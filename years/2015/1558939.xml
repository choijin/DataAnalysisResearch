<AbstractNarration>Global sea levels have risen steadily over the last century and there is concern that sea level rise will accelerate over the next century. Early detection of sea level acceleration, necessary for adaptation efforts, depends on an improved understanding of multidecadal sea level changes. This study consists of a detailed investigation of multidecadal sea level changes using sea level data, ocean and climate models, atmospheric reanalyses, vertical land motion, and a hierarchical Bayesian data-assimilation approach.  An outcome of this study will be an enhanced, value-added sea level dataset based on the hierarchical Bayesian model approach, which will complement the available sea level estimates from altimetry, tide gauges, and ocean circulation models. These sea level fields from the Bayesian model solution will be made freely and publicly accessible and available. With their estimates of uncertainty, these fields would be suited for use in state estimation efforts on century time scales. This project is a partnership between academia and industry and would also support an early career scientist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of this project include: reconstructing regional maps and global time series of sea level going back two centuries; elucidating roles of internal versus external forcing of global mean multidecadal sea level change; diagnosing the impacts of static and dynamic processes on multidecadal regional sea level changes; and evaluating the veracity of climate models. The outcomes will fill basic knowledge gaps, improving understanding of ocean circulation and climate change.  To increase basic knowledge of ocean circulation and climate change, and to cope with difficulties related to the sparseness of sea level data in space and time, a hierarchical Bayesian model will be brought to bear on extant datasets (altimetry, tide gauge, vertical land motion), giving observation-based constraints on sea level behavior over the last two centuries. Exploration of the underlying ocean dynamics based on hierarchical Bayesian model solutions will elucidate the physical drivers and space-time scales of multidecadal sea level changes and provide a basis to evaluate climate models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Changes in sea level have major consequences for flooding, and a better understanding of how sea level has varied in the past confers ability to better predict future changes.  Relative sea level, or the point where the ocean surface intersects the shoreline (suitably averaged over tidal cycles), can rise either because the shoreline subsides or absolute sea level rises.  Absolute sea level can rise as a consequence of a flux of water (often originally locked up as ice) from land to ocean, thermal expansion of seawater as a consequence of absorption of heat, or shifts in winds and currents that lead to water standing higher along the margins.   The specific goals of this project were (1.) to estimate global and regional sea level changes over the last two centuries within the context of a statistical framework known as a hierarchical Bayesian model framework.  (2.) To elucidate the roles of internal versus external drivers of multidecadal mean sea level changes.  (3.) To diagnose the relative influences of isostatic and dynamic ocean processes on multidecadal regional sea level changes.  And (4.) to assess the realism of historical coupled climate model solutions.  The project outcomes in furtherance of the above stated goals can be summarized in relation to three publications that resulted from this proposal.  The first paper (Piecuch et al., 2017) lays out a technical statistical approach for combining multiple streams of data to estimate changes in sea level across time and space.  Specifically, we probabilistically reconstructed mean sea level changes along the North American northeast coast over 1893-2015 using a Bayesian hierarchical algorithm.  Furthermore, we compared full and empirical Bayesian methods for inferring sea level from tide gauges, finding that the Bayesian hierarchical algorithm gives more accurate estimates of uncertainty.  In a second paper (Piecuch et al., 2018) we report upon a joint inversion of tide gauge records, Global Positioning System data, and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models using a fully probabilistic, hierarchical Bayesian framework in order to identify the contributions of vertical land motion, due to GIA and non-GIA processes, to relative sea level trends along the United States East Coast during 1900-2016.   We show that at spatial scales of greater than 500 km, vertical land motion processes exert a dominant control on the relative sea level patterns.  In particular, glacial isostatic adjustment explains 67% of the spatial variance in coastal relative sea level trends. These results demonstrate that long-period, large-scale vertical velocities can be successfully extracted from short GPS records, inform inferences on the Earth's interior structure, and clarify to what extent changes in long-term coastal exposure over the last century have been driven by geological processes that will continue at similar rates for centuries into the future.  Finally, in Gebbie and Huybers (2019) we assessed ocean heat uptake since 1750.  We were specifically interested in whether the often-made assumption of an ocean that is near energetic equilibrium during the preindustrial period was appropriate given longer-term climate variations associated with the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age.  The long memory of the ocean suggests that these historical surface temperature anomalies could be associated with ongoing deep-ocean temperature adjustments. Through combining an ocean model with a combination of proxy records and historical surface temperatures we found that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to the cooling going into the Little Ice Age, whereas temperature trends in the surface ocean and deep Atlantic reflect modern warming. This prediction is corroborated by a comparison of temperature soundings obtained by the HMS Challenger expedition of the 1870s and modern hydrography that generally shows cooling in the deep Pacific and warming in the Atlantic, in keeping with our model predictions. Moreover, our results indicate that the heat loss in the deep ocean since 1750 CE offsets one-fourth of the global heat gain in the upper ocean, suggesting that overall warming of the ocean since preindustrial times has been more varied and of lower overall magnitude than has been commonly assumed.  These results allow for better prediction of the relative changes in sea level across the U.S. East Coast, and for better interpreting modern changes in ocean heat uptake (with attendant implication for changes in sea level) in the context of historical variations in climate.
