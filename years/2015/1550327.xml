<AbstractNarration>With the drastic increase of human population, there is an ever-growing demand for energy and clean water for the continuous economic growth and suitable inhabitation on earth. Over the years, the federal government has applied distinct strategies to address these two needs separately: the municipal wastewater is collected by local wastewater plants for purification and subsequent reuse as reclaimed water, while the energy source is mainly based on natural gas, and crude oil. Apparently, these two strategies are decoupled. Million tons of wastewater are produced from industrial and agricultural operations each year, and about 25 billion US dollars are spent annually for wastewater treatment in the United States alone. Meanwhile, the use of natural gas/petroleum generates a lot of greenhouse gas and toxic chemicals, which pose a serious threat to the environment, and also leads to additional cost to treat the pollution. There is an urgent need to employ energy-efficient processes for wastewater treatment, and simultaneously recover the "wasted energy" contained as organic matters in wastewater. Microbial fuel cell technology represents a novel approach to produce bioelectricity and treat wastewater simultaneously has drawn significant attention worldwide.  The key innovation of the proposed microbial photoelectrochemical device/technology is the successful demonstration of hydrogen generation (instead of bioelectricity) in a sustainable manner using sunlight and municipal wastewater as the only energy sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The microbial photoelectrochemical cell device is a system that can remove soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) in wastewater and simultaneously recover the "wasted energy" stored in the organic wastes for photochemical generation of hydrogen gas, a chemical fuel with high energy density.  This team has demonstrated the feasibility of hydrogen gas production in a lab-scale microbial photoelectrochemical device using municipal wastewater and sunlight as the sole energy sources.  It represents not only a brand new approach to address the renewable energy needs for U.S., but also an emerging business opportunity for U.S..  The U.S. is among the world's largest producers of activated sludge (from wastewater).  There are more than 16000 wastewater treatment facilities nationwide, and spend billions of dollars per year to treat water.  A successful microbial photoelectrochemical system can efficiently convert wastewater into commercially valuable chemical fuels.  The device can be readily transferred to the market place by forming partnerships or establishing collaborations with these existing microbial technology companies such as in-state municipal wastewater treatment facility, food and beverage industry, farms and water industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Li lab at UC Santa Cruz has recently demonstrated a new microbial photoelectrochemical cell hybrid device, which can generate hydrogen in a sustainable manner using solar energy and the recovered energy from wastewater.  The device is different from conventional microbial fuel cell devices that used to produce bioelectricity.  This system represents not only a brand new approach to address the renewable energy needs, but also an emerging business opportunity for U.S..   Through I-Corps program, the PI (Yat Li) together with an entrepreneurial lead (Tianyu Liu, a graduate student in the PI?s lab) and a business mentor (M. Essam Badawi) form a team to carried out a commercialization feasibility study of the self-sustained microbial photoelectrochemical system.  The PI and EL both have strong expertise in the microbial photoelectrochemical device research, while the mentor has rich business development experience and strong track record in the business mentoring.   The team gets out of the building and successfully interviewed more than 100 potential customers. Based on these interviews, the team identified the potential customers and competitors, and the value propositions of the microbial photoelectrochemical system. More importantly, the team understands the market size after identifying the potential customers, and realizes the need to modify the current technology to better address customers? requirements: i) make a compact and modularized system, ii) make it easier to operate, iii) reduce fabrication and operation cost, and iv) reduce retention time of waste water. Based on these new information, the team has been modifying the design of the microbial photoelectrochemical system, and recently filed a provision patent on a new design of the system.  In addition to technology disposition, business training is also an important part of the proposal.  Both the PI and EL benefited from this wonderful opportunity to work outside of his own research field, to meet different people, to learn how to perform market research and develop a business strategy and plan from the team business mentor as well as other I-Corps teams in the project.
