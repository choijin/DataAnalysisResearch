<AbstractNarration>The 29th Annual Automorphic Forms Workshop (AFW) will be held March 2-5, 2015 at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Over the past three decades, the AFW has built a reputation as an internationally-recognized, well-respected conference attended by leading experts and junior researchers alike. The workshop is known for its inclusive, supportive atmosphere. Historically, about half of the presentations are given by mathematicians at early stages of their careers. Additionally, the workshop has a long history of involving women and members of other underrepresented groups in the automorphic forms community and facilitating the establishment of research connections.  The workshop has led to many collaborations and research papers. Moreover, the workshop traditionally includes panel discussions on topics designed to further the mathematical careers of junior participants. This award supports participation in the workshop of twenty early-career U.S.-based mathematicians, including students.  Additional information can be found at the workshop's website: automorphicformsworkshop.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automorphic forms, in all of their various guises, are of central importance in modern number theory and illuminate deep connections between number theory and other mathematical disciplines including coding theory, mathematical physics, representation theory and topology. Some of the most remarkable mathematical breakthroughs of the 20th century, for instance Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, made extensive use of automorphic forms. Moreover, several celebrated conjectures, such as those of Langlands and Bloch-Kato, are automorphic in nature. Many important classes of automorphic forms have only recently been discovered, for instance the harmonic Maass forms and mock modular forms that underlie Ramanujan's mock theta functions. The 29th AFW will feature talks on all aspects of automorphic forms with a special emphasis on mock modular forms and their applications.  The workshop will highlight recent developments in the field and catalyze future research progress.</AbstractNarration>
