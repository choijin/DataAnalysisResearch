<AbstractNarration>Western New Mexico University (WNMU) is constructing a robust, faster and more contemporary fiber network that supports research and educational initiatives. The enhanced network allows for 10Gbps speeds between research-intensive network segments for internal transfers, and provides critical redundant fiber paths for the WNMU network. The network enhances the regional research capacity and contributes to improving data sharing capabilities needed by emerging research initiatives at WNMU. These projects include examining variables that affect retention of at risk STEM students and helping STEM students participate in biology and chemistry research projects that require technologically modern online tools.  The network improvements also increase capacity and enable the network to scale up to meet WNMU's evolving bandwidth needs. By removing old multimode fiber, WNMU is taking the foundational steps of establishing the essential infrastructure to competitively contribute to more complex and scalable projects, such as the Science DMZ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WNMU has long-standing collaborations with other educational institutions and these collaborations are leveraged fully in this project; WNMU's partner, CHECS-Net (New Mexico's multi-institutional collaboration for sharing technology, expertise, and pricing information), provides guidance and experience. Moreover, as a rural, open-enrollment, Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) with a mission to serve students who are considered "at risk," the network is providing these students access and practice with contemporary science skills enhanced by practicing with modern cybertools and cyberinfrastructure.  The changes are providing these students the opportunity for them to effectively contribute to the scientific capital and workforce needs of the region.</AbstractNarration>
