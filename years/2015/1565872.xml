<AbstractNarration>Millard Alexander of the University of Maryland, College Park, is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational program in the Chemistry division to conduct rigorous theoretical studies, based on quantum mechanics, of chemical collisions, including chemical reactions. The award is cofunded by the Chemical Structures Dynamics and Mechanisms-A (CSDM-A) program, also in the Chemistry Division, and the Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (TAMOP) program in the Physics division. The essence of chemistry is the rearrangement of atoms from one arrangement to another.  A chemical reaction is akin to driving from one valley over a mountain pass into another valley. The pass is called a "transition state".   The rate at which "reaction" occurs is controlled by the height of the pass which separates the valleys, the ease of access to the pass, and the speed at which the pass is surmounted.  Experiments are limited to a before and after view, monitoring how many automobiles disappear from the initial valley, how many arrive in the new valley, and the velocity of the atoms after reaction.  From this, the chemist tries to infer how chemical bonding affects the shape of the mountain pass and, thus, the rate at which chemical change occurs.  Theoretical models, of the kind that Alexander develops, provide insight which complements experiment.  Alexander's work is particularly focused on how the uncertainty of quantum mechanics influences chemical reactivity.  The research has relevance for many fields including astrochemistry, atmospheric chemistry and ultra-cold chemistry.   The Alexander group develops and disseminates computer software for use by the research community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many aspects of the dynamics of small-molecule collisions can be well understood on the basis of classical simulations. Notwithstanding, a quantum treatment provides the only fully correct description of many elementary reactions, especially those involving H atoms; at the fully-resolved state-to-state level; at low temperature; or when the two (or more) electronic potential energy surfaces are accessed simultaneously.  In the latter case, exactly as in the paradigm two-slit situation, only quantum mechanics can describe the interference between trajectories which access the distinct potential energy surfaces.  To piece out where quantum effects -- resonances, or the breakdown in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation -- show themselves within the vast classical domain of molecular dynamics is the goal of research in the Alexander group.  Sophisticated quantum-chemical techniques are used to develop accurate potential energy surfaces for paradigm reactions.  These are then used in quantum scattering calculations of cross sections and, ultimately, rate constants.   Alexander's work, based substantially on computer codes developed in house, continues to provide insight and understanding for a number of top experimental groups worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Chemistry is fundamentally the study of molecular change.  The field of chemical kinetics is the study of how the speed of chemical change is a measure of the ease of rearrangement of atoms in and between molecules, and the ease of the redistribution of energy between the motion of a molecule as a whole and the relative motion of the individual atoms.  Classical mechanics, which models the motion of atoms as billiard balls, linked by attractive and repulsive forces, is sufficient to explain most of chemical kinetics.  Yet many times classical mechanics is insufficient.  Quantum mechanics must be invoked.  This occurs often at low temperature, when a reaction involves the exchange of H atoms (the most common atom in the universe), or when a collision leads to a change in disposition of the electrons of an atom or molecule.  Alexander, the Principal Investigator, and his long-time close colleague, Dagdigian, have developed a unique expertise to describe these quantum collisions.  The work is a marriage between the theory of molecular spectroscopy, where a quantum description is key, and the basic quantum description of atomic collisions, which was one of the first triumphs of quantum mechanics applied to chemistry.  Perhaps the best example is the F+H2&#10142;HF+H reaction &ndash; long a paradigm in physical chemistry.  Greater and greater sophistication has been applied to both the experimental and theoretical study of this reaction in what has been a most fruitful competitive synergy.  One of the most challenging (and then poorly understood) aspects of this reaction has been the effect on the reactivity of the open-shell character of the F atom.  Unravelling the degree to which the quantum mechanical degrees of freedom of the unpaired electron on the F influences its reactivity still remains an intellectual and even aesthetic challenge to chemists.  Alexander has successfuly developed the complete framework to describe, in particular quantitatively, these quantum effects in the F+H2 reaction.  He and Lique (a co-investigator in this project), have explored how these effects show themselves at low temperature (low translational energy) and can be seen experimentally.  Interestingly enough, this reaction is a marker for the observation of the hydrogen molecule in interstellar clouds.   This molecule can not be seen by spectroscopy, which is the primary tool for the identification of molecules in what is called the interstellar medium.   The quantitative relation between the abundance of HF, which can be seen spectroscopically, and the "dark" H2 molecule, has been convincingly established by Dagdigian and two astronomers, partially supported by the present grant.  Broader Impact  Our theoretical research has contributed significantly to the understanding of experiments carried out in the leading laboratories in molecular collision dynamics [Dalian (CN), Rennes and Bordeaux (FR), and Nijmegen (NL)].  Research supported by this project has been described in over over 40 publications in refereed journals.  Five publications have been in journals of "high impact", such as Science, Nature Chemistry, and Physical Review Letters.   In addition, the principal investigator and his scientific co-workers have reported on this work in invited talks at numerous scientific conferences and workshops, both in the U. S. and in Europe.  Through the participation of Francois Lique (a french scientist at Le Havre, FR), we have worked with astrophysicists in the U. S., France, and Spain, on the determination of rate constants for reactions and collisions important in the modelling of the chemical evolution and the heating and cooling of cold and cool interstellar gas clouds.  Much of our recent published work has appeared in major journals in the fields of Astrophysics and Astrochemistry.  Our research program involves close collaboration with many leading scientists, experimentalists, theoreticians, and astrophysicists, at a number of universities and government research laboratories.  During the period supported by this grant, Alexander and his co-PI's Dagdigian and Kios have trained two Ph. D.'s [Michael Warehime, now at Google, and Qianli Ma, now a software engineer in Germany] and co-mentored a third (Matthew Murray, now at the Naval Research Laboratory).  Alexander and Lique (a co-investigator in the present project) have organized several Telluride Workshops (2018, 2020).  These workshops have a primary goal of encouraging and fostering scientifc collaboration in the area of molecular dynamics and its overlap with other areas.  Alexander, Dagdigian, and Klos continue in the development of the Hibridon code, a program package to solve the close-coupled equations which occur in the quantum treatment of inelastic atomic and molecular collisions.  This code is integral to the software resources in a number of theoretical groups.       Last Modified: 12/21/2020       Submitted by: Millard H Alexander]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
