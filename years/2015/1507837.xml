<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL ABASTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;The growth of crystalline materials is the first step in the manufacture of numerous electronic devices including microprocessors for computers, chemical sensors for human health, and biological detectors to counter terrorism threats. Today, individual atoms are being manipulated in attempts to create such processors and sensors at the atomic scale. Improvement in our understanding of atomic scale surface processes, such as atom transport and its role in the growth of crystalline materials, is required so that the manipulation of individual atoms can be routinely employed to enhance the performance of existing devices, as well as develop new devices. This project uniquely combines the ability to view the motion of individual atoms using a microscope with the capability of identifying the atomic species in motion using a mass spectrometer. It thereby allows for a detailed atomic level study of the growth of an elemental crystalline material. This research is serving as the Ph.D. thesis project for one graduate student and employing an undergraduate science major to assist with the experiments. The inherent interdisciplinary nature of the project is training the students in a wide variety of technical areas and thereby helping to thoroughly prepare them to begin a career in the physical sciences. Underrepresented groups have a good opportunity to fill the student positions on this research effort because the University of New Mexico is exceptional in combining a highly rated research program and designated as both a Minority-serving institution and a Hispanic-serving institution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;The dynamics of steps on crystal surfaces is one of the most important processes governing atom transport and the resulting crystal growth. In this project, step dynamics at the atomic scale in the prototypic case, elemental crystals, is being investigated for the first time. To enable the study of such homogeneous systems we are employing a novel approach - the use of an adatom that is a stable isotope of the elemental substrate. This preserves the chemical nature of the homogeneous system, yet the isotope adatom is distinguishable due to its known mass and isotopic abundance. The field ion microscope is being used for atomic resolution surface imaging. Possible isotope adatom-substrate atom exchange processes that occur during atom transport are detected by the removal of individual atoms as ions with field evaporation and subsequent time-of-fight-based atom-probe microanalysis to determine their mass. The project is investigating step dynamics on various transition metal surfaces by studies of: Year 1 - The descent of isotope adatoms over steps and the diffusion of isotope adatoms along step edges, Year 2 - Nanosecond-time-scale diffusion initiated by laser pulses to capture any 'non-equilibrium' isotope adatom-substrate configurations, and Year 3 - The impact of the proximity of steps to one another on isotope adatom-step dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The field of Surface Science began nearly 60 years ago. Its inception was motivated largely by a lack of understanding of crystal growth processes in both the semiconductors being developed for transistors and the metals required to make electrical contact to them. Interestingly one of the key initial objectives of early studies -- the elucidation of the sequence of events that occur at the atomic level during the growth of a crystal from the vapor phase, especially the surface atom dynamics associated with diffusion, incorporation at steps, and step motion -- remains poorly understood. This is particularly true in the prototypical case of <em>elemental</em> crystal growth, and one can argue that if these aspects of crystal growth in <em>elemental</em> systems are not well understood then crystal growth from the vapor phase is not well understood. Now more than ever an understanding of such atom dynamics is needed because scientists and engineers strive toward, and struggle with, miniaturizing solid state devices to near the atomic scale. This ultra-miniaturization of devices such as microprocessors and chemical, radiation and biological sensors will likely be critical to addressing many of the National Academies Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p> <p>The goal of this NSF project was to significantly further our understanding of atomic-level surface atom dynamics during the growth of elemental crystals. Some examples of key dynamics governing crystal growth are illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1a shows the initial position of an adatom (blue). Figure 1b illustrates the position of the adatom after surface diffusion by the commonly assumed hopping mechanism. Figure 1c is the position of the adatom if it were to diffuse by atomic exchange with a substrate atom. Figure 1d is the case where the adatom diffused by hopping to the step edge and then descended over the step by rolling-over edge. Lastly, Figure 1e is the adatom location after diffusion by hopping to the step edge and descent by its exchange with an edge atom.</p> <p>In order to enable atomic-level studies of surface atom dynamics on elemental crystals, we have developed an approach based on using an isotope of the elemental substrate as the adatom. The approach thereby preserves the elemental nature of the system while making the isotope adatom distinguishable due to its particular mass and the known isotopic abundance of the elemental substrate. For example, if the adatom is initially a known isotope of the substrate and following its surface diffusion across a plane, or descent over a step edge, the adatom is found to be a different isotope of the substrate, then exchange diffusion occurred, as in Fig. 1c and 1e. Figure 2 shows a specific example of how exchange diffusion would be apparent using the isotope adatom approach with side-views of possible diffusion mechanisms on the <em>Ir(100)</em> surface for an <em><sup>191</sup>Ir</em> adatom. The left illustration shows traditional diffusion by hopping. In this case the adatom remains the <em><sup>191</sup>Ir</em> adatom. The right illustration shows diffusion by exchange. In this case, given that the surface is elemental iridium having its natural isotopic abundance (37% <em><sup>191</sup>Ir</em> + 63% <em><sup>193</sup>Ir</em>), the original <em><sup>191</sup>Ir</em> adatom has the possibility of becoming either another <em><sup>191</sup>Ir</em> or a <em><sup>193</sup>Ir</em> adatom following surface diffusion.

Figure 3b is a closeup image of the central <em>(100)</em> plane following the deposition of a <em><sup>191</sup>Ir</em> adatom onto the plane. Figure 3c shows the same plane following displacement of the adatom by surface diffusion. Subsequent mass analysis of the adatom showed it was now <em><sup>193</sup>Ir</em>, thus proving that exchange diffusion had occurred.
