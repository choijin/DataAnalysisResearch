<AbstractNarration>Coral reef health has declined worldwide in recent decades, in large part due to changing environmental conditions.  However, these trends lack long historical context.  Coral-based reconstructions of past ocean conditions can help researchers anticipate how reefs will respond to ongoing stressors, such as warming and acidifying oceans.  Three approaches--geochemical, growth banding, and luminescence--are often used to generate these climate records, but are rarely used together.  Combining these methods reconstructs both past environmental change and coral growth.  This project will generate luminescence and growth banding records on three coral cores in collaboration with Dr. Janice Lough at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), which will supplement existing geochemical measurements.  This work will produce a novel record of both environmental conditions and their effects on coral health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three coral cores have already undergone geochemical analyses, both of stable isotopes (delta-18-O and delta-13-C) and elemental ratios (Sr/Ca).  These measurements correspond to changes in seawater temperature and salinity.  At AIMS, luminescent bands will be used to track changes in terrestrial runoff, and coral growth will be measured by three parameters (extension, density, and calcification rate).  In conjunction, these methods record changes in ocean temperature, salinity, and runoff, and their effects on coral growth rate.  This project establishes a methodological basis for future, multi-century records. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             The amount of coral on the Great Barrier Reef has declined in recent decades.  This trend results, in part, from the growing impacts of climate change.  Researchers must place these coral growth trends into historical context in order to anticipate the impacts of future climate change on the health of reefs worldwide.              Corals of the genus Porites form growth bands, like tree rings, that are natural recorders of past climate.  Previous studies have used either geochemical methods or growth banding analysis to record environmental conditions through time, but have rarely used both methods in conjunction.  This project combines both analyses to better understand the role of past climate variability in coral growth.  Data from five Great Barrier Reef corals track monthly changes in sea surface temperature, salinity, runoff, and coral growth between ~1971 and 2008.  These corals show changes in temperature and precipitation that accompany El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a, as well as short-lived, powerful weather events, such as cyclones.  Results reveal a changing relationship between temperature and coral growth rate, and additionally show that some sites on the Great Barrier Reef reflect regional climate more accurately than others.  This work develops a method for upcoming studies on much longer coral cores (200 years or more), and demonstrates the value of combining multiple approaches when reconstructing climate from corals.
