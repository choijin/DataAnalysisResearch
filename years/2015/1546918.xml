<AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support for conference attendance costs by the PI and his students to attend a conference to be held August 23-28, 2015 in Hong Kong. The conference addresses the "terahertz (THz)gap" where bright sources of light and sensitive means of detection do not exist. The THz gap covres frequencies invisible to the naked eye in the electromagnetic spectrum, lying between microwave and infrared in the range from 0.3 to 3THz. The ?International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz) 2015 will address scientific and technological activities from millimeter-waves to the THz regime and the far-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics ranging from micro- and nano-scale devices and structures to large-scale accelerators and tokamaks and their applications will be covered. Other topics to be addressed include among other applications in Biology, Medicine, Security and Defense, Spectroscopy and Material Properties, Sources, Detectors, and Receivers.  The conference will foster advances in the leading research of Technology by gathering a diverse group of experts.&lt;br/&gt;The conference will include plenary keynote speakers, oral paper presentations, posters sessions as well as demo and exhibition sessions that will encourage the exchange of ideas in the THz area. It will encourage young researchers in the US to present their research work to the international community working in this field and will provide a great opportunity for learning both fundamentals as well as advanced principles.</AbstractNarration>

The conference was a great success and with 630 registrants from 37 countries, it is the largest IRMMW-THz conference held in Asia so far. Additionally the conference had a record number of abstract submissions - over 750.  The conference accepted 600 contributed papers and combined with the plenary speakers it had a very high quality technical program.     The 40th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz) was held at The Chinese University of Hong Kong from 23rd-28th August 2015. IRMMW-THz is the oldest and largest continuous forum devoted to the science and technology of long-wavelength radiation.

Presentations at this conference address issues ranging from basic physics, chemistry, electrical engineering and materials science to problems in high frequency circuits and systems, communications, antennas and optics, imaging and spectroscopy, as well as potential applications for the technological advancements.  The conference takes turns to be held in Asia, Europe and the US.  This is the first time that IRMMW-THz has been held in Hong Kong:     Following a record number of 750 abstract submissions, over 600 people from academia and industry around the world participated in this year?s conference &ndash; the largest IRMMW-THz conference in Asia yet!  The technical sessions were held over five days, with two plenary lectures each day.  The plenary speakers were selected through the technical program committee, chaired by Prof Xi-Cheng Zhang of Rochester University.  Of particular note were speakers Prof Ron Shen, from Berkeley University of California, well known for his contributions to non-linear optics, and Professor Philippe Goy, this year?s Button Prize winner for his outstanding contributions to terahertz instrumentation and its uses in the understanding of fundamental concepts in physics. Additionally, there were three sessions each day during which five different topic areas were presented in parallel. Indeed, there were slots for a total of 335 talks to be presented as well as a further 300 posters.  Coordinating all these contributions is rather challenging and inevitably there were a few last minute rearrangements to be made!     630 Registrants from 37 countries, it is the largest IRMMW-THz conference held in Asia so far!  Additionally we had a record number of abstract submissions &ndash; 753.      Frabrizio Buccheri gave the keynote talk, and PhD student Kang Liu gave a poster.     During this trip, my PhD student Fabrizio Buccheri was invited to give a one-hour plenary lecture titled "THz wave emission from laser-induced microplasma" during the 5th Shenzhen International Conference on Advanced Science and Technology on August 22nd. He was the only student speaker invited among all the other distinguished scientists.          The other PhD student Kang Liu has won the first place of Best Student Paper/Presentation Award in IRMMW-THz 2015 with her talk on" Study of THz Emission from Ring-Airy Beam Induced Plasma". Her  presentation stood out in the competition with 148 applicants, 48 nominees, and 6 finalists. The awarded paper was done under an international collaboration with FORTH, Greece.
