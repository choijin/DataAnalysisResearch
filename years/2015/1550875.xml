<AbstractNarration>Long-term data provide some of the most trust-worthy answers to important ecological questions. The immediate responses that organisms, including humans, make to an environmental change are often short-lived and do not provide accurate pictures of more permanent shifts. This project will conduct a series of workshops to examine how well long-term data collected through different projects, and at different locations, can be integrated to determine how organisms respond, over longer periods, to environmental change. Many of these responses are of societal importance; examples include responses to long-term nutrient additions, disruptions caused by invasive species, and the appearance of new diseases or disease vectors. The workshops will engage early-career researchers, providing them training in the analysis and interpretation of long-term data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A working group composed of leading researchers in ecology and ecosystem science will explore synergies between the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a new NSF-investment, and the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network, a program that has been in place for over 30 years. NEON is a continental-scale observation facility for documenting ecological change over time while the LTER program consists of long-term question-driven research projects aimed at understanding ecological processes in a wide range of ecosystems. An outstanding question is the extent to which data from these two investments will be complementary. Four topics will be addressed in a sequence of two workshops: 1) how can LTER data and insights provide landscape and regional scale ecological context for NEON sites; 2) can data collected by NEON inform the five core research areas implemented by all LTER projects; 3) can the conceptual models that underlie LTER research inform data collection at NEON sites and 4) does combined analysis of LTER and NEON data improve predictions of future ecological trajectories over those obtained from either data source alone? Two workshops held at the Cary Institute will each engage two groups; some overlap and interchange will occur between these groups. This structure allows efficient exploration of all four themes. Products from these workshops will include a series of papers as well as protocols, conceptual models and prediction platforms that will facilitate productive interactions between these two, major long-term research platforms over the coming decades.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) are complementary networks funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) that support ecological research in different ways and have great potential for productive synergies. NEON is a continental-scale observation facility for examining ecological change over time. The data produced are available for use by researchers, educators, policy-makers and the general public. LTER is a network of long-term research projects aimed at understanding ecological processes in a wide range of ecosystems. While the NEON observatory sites were selected to cover U.S. ecological variability according to defined criteria, LTER sites were selected on a site-by-site basis based on the intellectual importance and insight of the questions proposed for that site. Eight of the core and five of the relocatable NEON sites are co-located with LTER sites, and many LTER scientists have been actively involved in the planning and implementation of NEON.  There is a great need to define how LTER and NEON will interact to further the mission of each network and to facilitate transformative advances in ecological research.  As signature programs in the NSF Directorate for Environmental Biology (DEB), LTER and NEON occupy distinct intellectual and practical domains with tremendous potential for synergy.  In a general sense, NEON will produce and disseminate coordinated, high-quality ecosystem- to continental-scale data on key ecological variables that will characterize the nature and extent of environmental change over the next three decades. At the same time, the LTER network?s mix of long-term monitoring, experiments, comparative studies, theory and modeling are and will continue to produce detailed information on the mechanisms underlying that change. A concerted effort to develop synergies between LTER and NEON will produce fundamental and transformative insights into a wide range of continental-scale issues including fluxes of carbon, nitrogen and water, state changes and ecological thresholds and the importance of evolution as a regulator of ecosystem response to global environmental change. The project catalyzed these synergies by identifying topics, techniques and individuals that are poised for progress in this area.  The project produced a series of papers describing the practical data collection synergies between LTER and NEON, created a global context for observation and research networks, and conceptual and quantitative, predictive modeling synergies.  In these papers, we describe practical and conceptual synergies between LTER and NEON and more generally how synergies between a wide range of research networks can facilitate advances in Environmental Science.  We provide an overview of "continental scale science" and how different research networks are organized to collect data at this scale.  We then review synergies in specific data collection and analysis at site, regional and continental scales with a focus on how LTER (and other networks) can provide spatial and temporal context for the data that NEON is going to collect and conversely, how NEON data are going to help collection and analysis of core data at LTER (and other networks) sites. The modeling papers lay out a basis for conceptual and quantitative analysis of a wide range of continental-scale issues including fluxes of carbon, nitrogen and water and the prospects for state changes and ecological threshold responses to global environmental change.
