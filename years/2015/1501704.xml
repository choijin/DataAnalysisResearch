<AbstractNarration>Social animals, including humans, interact frequently and can affect each other in numerous ways. For example, long-term studies have found that measures of human health such as obesity, smoking cessation, and depression can in part be predicted by social relationships. In order to understand how these peer effects spread through a social network, the researchers will use a highly social fish that is strongly affected by social environment and the behavior of social partners as model system. This research project will closely monitor social groups and manipulate one individual within each group to determine how changes in the behavior of one individual affect the behavior, hormones, and neuromolecular responses of the other group members. The results will provide a better understanding of the mechanistic basis of these social network effects that can be harnessed to improve the health of social groups. This work will also provide outstanding opportunities for middle school students through class room visits, high school seniors who are interns in the laboratory, and undergraduate students who desire to become involved in the molecular and behavioral research. These students will be primarily recruited from programs that encourage the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences. Finally, results of this project will be communicated through media interviews and public presentations and in an on-going children's summer science program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, offers a uniquely tractable system for investigating the effects that individuals have on each other's physiology, neurogenomic state and behavior within naturalistic social communities. The researchers have developed a descriptive statistical framework for studying community dynamics in this system. The aggression of one male in each group will be experimentally increased using an estrogen receptor agonist which has been previously shown to cause an approximately two-fold increase in aggression. These manipulated communities will be observed and compared to control treatments to determine how the change in behavior of one male cascades throughout the social network to affect the behavior of the other group members. Blood and brain samples will be collected to determine how these social network perturbations affect sex steroid hormone levels and sensitivity to those hormones in key areas of the brain of members of the social group. These experiments will give causal insights into the physiological, neuroendocrine and behavioral mechanisms underlying social network effects.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Studies of social interactions have traditionally focused on dyadic interactions alone, which capture only a small piece of the larger social environment. For a more complete analysis of social behavior it is important to consider direct dyadic interactions between individuals as well as indirect interactions (who is connected to whom via intermediates.) Social network analysis allows for investigations at the level of the individual as well as the community level. The African cichlid fish, <em>Astatotilapia burtoni</em>, a model system in social neuroscience offers a uniquely tractable system for investigating the effects that individuals have on each other&rsquo;s physiology, neurogenomic state and behavior within naturalistic social communities. We conducted experiments to show how social context influences an individual&rsquo;s behavior and hormone levels.</p> <p>We found that dominant (DOM) <em>A. burtoni</em> males form the hubs of the network and that social interactions are strongly correlated across time. Furthermore, we found that individuals can have direct and indirect effects on their social partners. For example, among DOM males, receiving aggression from other DOMs is correlated to increased courtship and decreased aggression towards SUB males. This is an example of a direct effect since the amount of aggression received by an individual correlates to the behavior they display toward others. I also found evidence of indirect effects, these are correlations that aren&rsquo;t explained by direct interactions between individuals. For example, among SUB males, total aggression is correlated to the amount of aggression directed from DOM males towards females in the community. This effect is not explained by direct interactions between DOMs and SUBs. There were also indirect effects on hormones, for example increased connections between DOMs correlated to lower testosterone in SUB males. Finally, there were strong community effects on hormones. This is perhaps the most important aspect of the study since the full extent of this community effect has not been studied before. Both testosterone and cortisol have been measured many times in this species and there is a well- known effect of social status on these hormones. However, with complete sampling of communities it becomes clear that the community effect is equally important. In terms of the variance in hormone levels that each explains, in both the testosterone and cortisol data the status and community effects are nearly equal and in both cases the community effect is actually slightly more important than the much more widely studied effect of status. We found that the community effect in the testosterone data could be explained by the stability of the social network, with stable communities having a strong difference between DOM and SUB males. The community effect on cortisol was not explained by stability or any other community level property that we measured.</p> <p>To test the role of androgen and estrogen signaling in social interactions, I treated males with either flutamide, which is an androgen receptor antagonist, or fadrozole, which is an aromatase inhibitor and thus blocks the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Fadrozole treatment drastically affected hormone levels, as expected based on previous studies in this species. I found that the effect of FAD treatment depends on social status. In ascending males FAD treatment results in increased aggression while previous studies have shown that it decreases aggression in stable DOM males. This finding establishes A. burtoni as a unique and powerful model for understanding the impact of estrogen on male aggression. Across vertebrates, male aggression is usually positively associated with estrogen signaling as it is in DOM male <em>A. burtoni</em>. However, in some species the opposite association if found. The neural mechanism behind this difference is not understood and studies have been hampered by the difficulties of comparing across species and the developmental side-effects of using transgenic knockout. <em>A. burtoni</em> is the only species yet reported that shows either a positive or negative correlation between aggression and estrogen signaling depending on social status.
