<AbstractNarration>Fourier analysis implies that functions that are periodic -- for example, quantities depending on time that repeat their previous value a fixed amount of time later -- can be realized as sums of trigonometric functions.  Functions with more complicated, non-commutative, periodicities are at the heart of modern number theory.  A fundamental vision of Langlands predicts connections between such functions and symmetries related to arithmetic, that is, coming from roots of polynomial equations.  This proposal is concerned with periodic functions in a new guise, when the functions are defined not on a group but on a finite cover of a group. This blends arithmetic and analysis in a new way.  Moreover, the techniques to be studied may have connections to constructions in mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objects of study in this project are automorphic forms on covering groups.  The principal investigator will focus first on Eisenstein series, which are obtained by an averaging process.  Many of the standard tools from automorphic forms do not carry over (e.g. Whittaker functionals are typically not unique), but a surprising picture blending representation theory (canonical bases,  Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen cycles) and number theory is emerging.  The principal investigator will investigate these and and their number-theoretic applications. He also will study the residues of metaplectic Eisenstein series, "higher theta series."  There is much to be done to understand the unipotent orbits attached to these objects, to develop relations between such series on different groups, and to use them both globally and in local constructions. A third project concerns unique functionals and Iwahori Hecke algebras.  It offers the potential for new constructions of unique functionals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involved number theory and representation theory, topics that are linked in the study of automorphic forms.  Automorphic forms are a class of functons that are invariant under a discrete subgroup.  Their study involves both arithmetic (solutions to equations) and analysis (properties of functions). The Langlands program proposes that automorphic forms on different underlying spaces should be systematically related.  Such connections are difficult to prove but have substantial number theoretic consequences. Automorphic forms also appear in other parts of mathematics, and have recently been connected to string theory from physics. Through this project, the PI gave new relations and constructions about automorphic forms. He also showed how related constructions in algebra could be used to understand local representations attached to automorphic forms.  One part of this project involved finding out new information about the Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms that arise from coverings.  The research on covering groups has led to a better understanding of certain special automorphic forms, theta functions, and a program to show connections between theta functons on different groups.  The theta functions are residues of certain Eisenstein series.  The PI and Ginzburg showed how the methods of descent and unipotent orbits could be used to obtain new information. A second part of this project was to develop new algebraic methods based on Hecke algebras for the study of representations of p-adic groups.
