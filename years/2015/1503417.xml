<AbstractNarration>This award facilitates the participation of US scientists working in gravitational physics in the 14th Marcel Grossmann meeting on recent developments in theoretical and experimental general relativity, astrophysics and relativistic field theories, to be held in Rome from July 12-18, 2015. The Marcel Grossmann meeting is one of the two main international conferences in gravitation. It is organized every three years and is attended by approximately 500-1000 participants from all over the world. This award provides travel support to the most deserving participants from the US. The award will be shared, giving priority to participants with accepted abstracts for oral presentations and junior participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A panel comprised of theoreticians and experimentalists in gravitational physics will be convened to evaluate applications for travel support from qualified candidates from the US. Priority will be given to participants with accepted talk abstracts and to researchers with either no or reduced NSF funding. The panel will decide on the number of awards depending on the quality and quantity of applications received.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goal of this grant was to support the participation of US scientists working in gravitational physics in the international conference "14th Marcel Grossmann Meeting", that took place in the University of Rome "La Sapiens" between July 12 and 18, 2015. This meeting focused on recent developments in theoretical and experimental general relativity, gravitation, and relativistic field theory. This is a key conference in the area of gravitation and theoretical physics, and the funds provided ensured a strong representation of US scientist whose work is aligned with NSF  gravitational physics program.  A call for applications was issued and broadly distributed. Applications were reviewed by a panel of the following five US researchers, experts on different aspects of gravitation and theoretical physics:   1) Prof. Peter Saulson (syracuse University)  2) Prof. Richard Price (University of Texas at Brownsville)  3) Prof Jorge Pullin (Louisiana State University)  4) The Pi and Co-Pi of this grant.  9 high quality application were received and all of them were awarded. The panel decided to provided $1187 to eight applicants, and a smaller award of $500 to another applicant who had also partial support from the organizers of the conference.   The broader impacts of this grant were the dissemination of new results in scientific research carried out in US to the international community. The funded scientists got a unique opportunity to discuss their novel results with various experts, students and the general audience in the conference.    Summary of the outcomes: The contribution of the nine  awardees to the conference was outstanding.
