<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the Midwestern Workshop on Asymptotic Analysis, to be held at Indiana University-Bloomington October 10-11, 2015, in Bloomington, Indiana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on a variety of subfields that are active pursued in the study of analysis, such as several complex variables, approximation theory, mathematical physics (e.g. Schrodinger operators), and the like. This award gives early career mathematicians and/or non-funded mathematicians an opportunity to participate at the conference. The organizer plans outreach to make this funding opportunity known to target groups. More information is available through http://math.iupui.edu/~maxyatts/workshop/</AbstractNarration>
