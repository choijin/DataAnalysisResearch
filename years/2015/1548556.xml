<AbstractNarration>Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program, (I-Corps L), this project will develop ways to achieve more widespread use of a teaching laboratory that helps undergraduate engineering students learn to design and program state-of-the-art sensors and smart devices.  This project, developed at the University of Houston, is called the mySmart kit. The basic mySmart kit includes sensor nodes to measure temperature, light, noise, orientation, and acceleration. the kit combines integrated wireless capability with basic mobile apps that monitor the sensors.  The kit can be used for applications such as monitoring the environment and home security.   A variety of systems can be designed and built that utilize input from the wireless sensors to control devices such as lightning or heating and cooling systems wirelessly.  The mySmart kit provides engineering students with hands-on experiences on smart sensor networks to develop and enhance their knowledge and understanding of the design principles and practices needed to create the next generation of smart devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic mySmart kit is developed around the theme of creating a smart home.  Basic competence is developed through twenty-two hands-on projects.  The projects make use of the types of capabilities available to students in commonly-owned devices such as smartphones.  These capabilities include embedded sensors such as microphones, accelerometers, cameras, and GPS.  The projects also utilize connectivity such as cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.  In addition to engineering design principles, the smart home project covers a variety of STEM topics including  mechanical design, materials, electrical circuits, networking, and computation.  The mySmart kit is based on industrial wireless sensor network standards.  The projects include the flexibility needed to ensure individualized learning and provide an intuitive, easy to use platform.  Three critical capabilities allow students to develop their own prototype designs: sensing/ actuation, connectivity/communications and computing. In the I-Corps L program, the project team will interact with potential users of this technology to better understand the needs of various users of the kit, and will develop ideas for increasing the number programs that adopt these projects. Given the important role of smart devices in current and future technology, the project has the potential to help US engineering graduates continue to be leaders in developing innovative technology to meet societal needs.</AbstractNarration>

It is an effort to scale the impact of our successful exploratory project. The exploratory project entitled &ldquo;Infusing advanced wireless sensor network research into cross-disciplinary undergraduate education&rdquo; was funded by NSF CCLI program from 2009~2012. Its goal is to introduce new technology advances in wireless sensor network to multidisciplinary undergraduate programs. In the ICL project we choose one medium-scale project-based experiment on &ldquo;Indoor ambient environment and activity monitoring system&rdquo; and adapted it as &ldquo;mySmartHome&rdquo; project with integrated hardware and software kit to introduce to freshmen of all programs (starting from all STEM+C programs) the basics of scientific thinking and engineering design. It is chosen from the six project-based active learning modules with twenty-two inquiry based hands-on experiments on wireless data acquisition systems developed in the CCLI project because of its relevance to the expanding smart home market and its potential impact to engage freshmen and sophomore in higher education STEM programs, even if it is they do not have previous experience building a system and fundamental knowledge regarding how the system and its component works. We hope to inspire them to explore in more detail about the topics they are interested in after gaining experience in engineering design process and working in a multi-disciplinary team in a guided and structured environment.</p> <p>The team is composed two academic Co-PI, Drs. Yuan and Song, who led the initial CCLI project, the entrepreneurial lead, Dr. Ho, who worked on mechanical system and civil structure monitoring and control based on networked data acquisition systems extensively, and our industry mentor, Mr. Alvarado from National Instrument. After going through the intensive 10 week ICL training, learning all the basic terminologies of technology start-ups, getting out of the building and traveling thousands of miles, interviewing hundreds of potential customers (for which more than 100 were officially recorded into the Launchpad program), and changing our value proposition numerous times, we reached our &lsquo;great pivot&rsquo; point. After interviewing faculty teaching Engineering, Technology, and Computing programs in various types of university (from large public research university, to private university, to public teaching university, to community colleges, including many minority serving institutions), administrators from program coordinators, to department chairs, to deans and associate deans, to vice/associate provost, and individuals from potential industry partners at various levels (from engineers to managers to VPs), we identified faculty members teaching various STEM+C programs as our ultimate customer, especially those teaching in engineering, technology, and computing programs, honoring the culture of the higher-education eco-system.</p> <p>We learned that although all of them are actively creating, identifying, adapting, and adopting various hands-on projects and more than willing to share what they have with greater community, their urgent need is an online repository that hosts evidence-based high quality hands-on project (including real-world based problems/challenges) that incorporate open-ended questions and engineering design process and have been vetted by faculty from different programs for different college settings. They believe such a platform should have mechanism that faculty can use and submit their project, even collaborate to develop better hands-on project/problem, as well as anonymous rating and critiquing function to keep the quality of the &lsquo;vetted&rsquo; project/problem.</p> <p>Figure 1 Indoor environment and activity monitoring in the ISGRIN lab</p> <p>Figure 2 Smart vibration system and smart home setup with wireless data acquisition (DAQ) system</p> <p>Figure 3 Smart home monitoring and control system in action</p> <p>Figure 4 Project4You site layout</p> <p>Figure 5 Our ICL journey &ndash; customer discovery</p> <p>Figure 6 Continue our customer discovery &ndash; reaching the &lsquo;great pivot&rsquo; point&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/24/2016<br>      Modified by: Xiaojing&nbsp;Yuan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282473964_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282473964_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ISGRIN-mySmart"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282473964_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ISGRIN-mySmart"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Smart home monitoring and control system in action</div> <div class="imageCredit">xiaojing yuan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaojing&nbsp;Yuan</div> <div class="imageTitle">ISGRIN-mySmart</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282325612_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282325612_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282325612_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Indoor environment and activity monitoring in the ISGRIN lab</div> <div class="imageCredit">xiaojing yuan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaojing&nbsp;Yuan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282412797_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282412797_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ISGRIN-WSN"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282412797_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ISGRIN-WSN"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Smart vibration system and smart home setup with wireless data acquisition (DAQ) system</div> <div class="imageCredit">xiaojing yuan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaojing&nbsp;Yuan</div> <div class="imageTitle">ISGRIN-WSN</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282557650_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282557650_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project4U"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282557650_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project4U"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Project4You site layout</div> <div class="imageCredit">xiaojing yuan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaojing&nbsp;Yuan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Project4U</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282644869_Figure5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282644869_Figure5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Our ICL Journey"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548556/1548556_10383760_1477282644869_Figure5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Our ICL Journey"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Our ICL journey ?
