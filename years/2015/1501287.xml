<AbstractNarration>In Ohio, manufacturing supports 17% of the state's economy.  For many years Northwest State Community College supported programs on separate skilled trades based on industry practice related to their separate job classifications. A recent trend has been the combining of these separate skilled trades into a multi-craft maintenance position. This project  will convert a traditional automation maintenance technology program to a competency-based, hybrid instructional model with flexible laboratory scheduling options. The Hands On Maintenance Education for Technicians (HOME4TECHS) project will support professional development for faculty on competency-based education, and the development and deployment of modular online courses. This project will advance the knowledge and understanding of competencies required by manufacturing companies for students entering the automation maintenance field. The project will also advance the knowledge and understanding of the steps a college needs to take in order to convert a traditional college curriculum and delivery system, to an employer-driven, competency-based curriculum, delivered through hybrid learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to: re-structure 3 courses in the automation maintenance curriculum to a competency-based curriculum, so that they will be aligned with the needs of the local industry. This will involve moving the lecture portion of the courses to a modular online format, and developing an open lab delivery model for the hands-on portion of the 3 courses. Restructuring the delivery system will make the courses more accessible to students and incumbent workers. The project will engage college faculty and manufacturing employers in a collaborative effort to develop a competency-based, hybrid learning model that can be widely disseminated and scaled to promote applied learning in the technical workforce. Project outcomes will be disseminated through a meeting of the Northwest Ohio College Presidents. Research data on the effectiveness of moving from the traditional learning model to the hybrid learning model will be made broadly available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The purpose of the NSF ATE Hands-On Maintenance Education for Technicians (HOME4TECHS) project was to better prepare the students for the industrial workplace, and to allow more access to coursework for traditional, displaced and incumbent worker students.  The focus of the project was to realign the curriculum (to current industrial standards) of 3 technical courses that were delivered in a traditional lecture/lab format, and convert them to a competency-based (mastery of skills &amp; flexible pacing), hybrid (lecture portion delivered online), and open-lab model (allowing for flexible lab scheduling).   This project was designed with input from over 50 local employers whose input was received through industry roundtable meetings.    Students are Better Prepared for the Workplace Students are better prepared for the workplace due to curriculum realignment and a new assessment model.  The project moved the curriculum to align with the needs of the industry, by building competencies and outcomes that align with employer needs.  The input for these came from industry validated competencies (through a DACUM process) obtained through the AMTEC NSF ATE Center, faculty who did custom training for industry, and by obtaining the job descriptions for maintenance personnel from local employers.  These outcomes had to be based on tasks that the industry maintenance personnel perform on the job.  These competencies and outcomes were vetted through a group of subject matter experts from industry. The new assessment model included Hands-on Assessments (HOAs) that was closely aligned to the competencies and outcomes of the course.  This assessment requires each student to be individually assessed by the instructor.  A typical HOA would require a student to wire and troubleshoot a circuit, explain the operation to an instructor, and interpret a wiring diagram.  The primary focus is to build skills, through a learning experience, that will transfer to a workplace skill requirement.  Students are required to obtain 100% mastery on every HOA in the course (there are 8 HOAs in each course), before moving to the next course module.    A New Instructional Model for Student Access This project allowed the college to develop a new instructional model that is competency-based, hybrid, and has an open lab component.  Each of the courses are delivered in 8 weeks, instead of 16 weeks.  Since the courses all consist of 8 modules, once a student completes (masters) a module, they move on to the next module.  This is termed as flexible pacing.  Some students learn faster than others, but either way, all the students end the course at the same place with the same demonstrated skills and knowledge.  Some students finish in less than 8 weeks, and can start on their next course.  The courses were converted to a hybrid model, which means the lecture portion of the course is delivered online with active learning objects (videos, podcast, powerpoints, PDFs and online simulations), which has shown to accelerate student learning.  The courses still have scheduled on campus lab times, which allows the designated instructor to assess the students, and the students to develop their skills.  The open-lab model is the extra time scheduled that allow students extra time to develop their skills, or flexible scheduling due to work shift changes.  Students can also rotate between day and night technical classes.  The process to convert traditional technical courses to this new model was documented and can be downloaded from ATE Central, or by contacting the PI for this project.    Results and Impact Based on the survey of over 125 students in the last 2 years, over 95% are very satisfied with the new instructional model.  The primary reason was that they could get access to the material on a 24/7 basis, flexible lab scheduling due to life demands, and can work at their own pace to finish.  The faculty are 100% satisfied with this model.  The reason is that all of the curriculum and assessments are developed, the LMS grades the online assessments, and most important, all students have consistent instruction in each course.   The employers are 100% satisfied, saying that the students are better prepared when they hire them, and the model allows their existing employees have access to the program, due to flexible scheduling.  At least four other 2-year colleges (Ohio, Arkansas, Indiana &amp; Nevada) have reviewed this new model, and are planning on scaling portions or all of this new model into their courses/curriculum.   A huge impact to Northwest State was the change in culture of the faculty to adopt this new model.  The 3 faculty in this project mentor other full-time and part-time faculty to move their curriculum into this new model.  Faculty now build and modify their courses to the Quality Matters standards, thus implementing good instructional design.   Through continuous professional development, and interactive work sessions, the faculty continue to improve the model and the curriculum within it.
