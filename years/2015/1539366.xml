<AbstractNarration>This award is to subsidize student-related expenses (e.g., travel, registration, and accommodation) incurred by US students attending the 47th annual North American Power Symposium (NAPS), NAPS 2015. The Symposium will be hosted by the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, from October 4 to October 6, 2015. NAPS is a nonprofit event with technical sponsorship from IEEE and is aimed primarily at providing a forum for students to present and obtain feedback on their research in power engineering. Traditionally, the overwhelming majority of papers in NAPS are presented by students. NAPS has been supported by the National Science Foundation in the past. Support from NSF has helped to enable student participation in the past. In addition to providing subsidized accommodation for students, the symposium will foster and encourage student participation through a comprehensive student program, tours of nearby facilities related to symposium topics, and a student paper competition. Topics to be addressed in the Symposium include power system operation, power system performance, power system protection, power system control, power electronics, Smart Grid, and microgrid operation and optimization. Measures will be taken to encourage participation of women and underrepresented minorities in NAPS 2015.</AbstractNarration>

The NSF funds were used to subsidize student-related expenses such as travel, registration, and accommodation for student attendees from US universities.  NAPS 2015 had 286 attendees (263 from academia, 23 from utilities, industry and national labs), of which 200 were students.  The Symposium had a keynote speech by Dhiaa Jamil of Duke Energy, two technical panels: 1. Impact of Renewables on the Power Grid, and 2. Workforce Development for the US Power Sector, 30 paper sessions with 186 technical papers presented, and a student poster session with 45 posters.  Intellectual Merit:    After starting in 1969 as the Midwest Power Symposium (MPS) and then becoming the North American Power Symposium (NAPS) in 1986, NAPS has been held yearly at a university in North America to provide an international open forum for participants from academia and industry.  A strong focus is on student participation and graduate student interaction with faculty and industry attendees to receive feedback on their research work.  For this reason, strong emphasis is put on the student program, which comprises a student paper competition with awards, and student travel and accommodation support.  Topics covered in the Symposium include: power system operation, power system performance, power system protection, power system control, power electronics, Smart Grid, and microgrid operation and optimization.  Broader Impact:    NAPS provides students with the exceptional opportunity to participate in a research conference and present their research progress and outcomes to a technical audience. Furthermore, NAPS encourages discussion of systematic integration of research and teaching. In addition to being a venue for disseminating research innovations by students, NAPS addresses community building in power engineering, which is a research discipline of national interest.
