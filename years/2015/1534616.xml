<AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to bring together research about English-language learners with the use of dynamic representational technology for middle school quantitative reasoning. Dynamic representation technology allows learners to work with multiple representations of a problem simultaneously. These representations include, for example, graphs of an equation, a table of values and a simulation of the real-world phenomenon to understand concepts such as linear functions and rates of change that support algebra. This project will focus on English-language learners who will benefit from multiple representations in order to increase their participation in mathematics practices. English-language learners are a quickly growing segment of the student population in the United States. The EHR Core Research program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design-based research study includes seventh grade students in two linguistically diverse regions. The project will investigate how 7th-grade students with different levels of English-language proficiency "reason abstractly and quantitatively," as they engage with dynamic representation technology-based and paper-based activities that address the content area of linear functions. In phase II, they will conduct a design-based research study to develop adaptations of materials using the dynamic representation technology. The project uses a comparison study of the technology-based activities and comparable paper-based activities to analyze participation of English-language learners in mathematics practices. The research plan includes three phases. In phase one, the project will analyze the participation and discussion of small groups as they work with the tasks to understand participation mathematical reasoning. In phase two, design-based research will be used to develop and refine the dynamic representation technology software and activities using data from activity sessions with students of varying English proficiency. In phase three, the project will compare the effect of the dynamic representation technology activities compared with paper-based activities on students with or without English-language proficiency.</AbstractNarration>

Reasoning abstractly and quantitatively entails relating real-world situations to mathematical representations to solve problems. DRT is software that allows students to manipulate multiple, linked representations. For example, in our DRT, students can manipulate a graph showing a runner's distance over time, which modifies a linked animation of the runner (See Image 1). Prior research involving small numbers of ELs suggests that using DRTs, together with carefully designed instructional activities, can have a positive impact on ELs' mathematics learning. Our study used larger numbers of students to compare ELs using DRTs with ELs engaged with similar tasks and using only paper and pencil representations.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Reasoning abstractly and quantitatively is one of the eight mathematical practices given as targets for instruction across grades K-12 in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. Most prior research that defines this practice has been based on case studies, and these cases often analyze the reasoning of students who are easy for researchers to find and to understand. As a result, there is little existing research that focuses specifically on how ELs reason abstractly and quantitatively. This is a major gap because mathematics educators have noted that students' abstract and quantitative reasoning is greatly influenced by their life experiences, so we would expect students with varying life experiences to have varying ways of reasoning abstractly and quantitatively. Understanding this variation can broaden our understanding of this mathematical practice. Additionally, ELs are an increasing number of students in many schools around the country, so understanding how ELs engage in the Common Core State Standards Mathematical Practices is essential for equipping teachers with the knowledge and tools they need to teach their EL students.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The outcomes of our research include middle school mathematics activities focused on reasoning abstractly and quantitatively and designed for use by ELs and non-ELs, along with guidelines for facilitators of these activities. One version of these activities was designed to be used in a DRT environment and a parallel version was designed to be used in a paper and pencil environment. Along with these activities, we developed design principles for the development and use of DRTs with ELs. For example, one specific design principle that came out of this work was the notion that designers of DRT should make important quantitative information visible and manipulable within the representations. In our DRT, we found it was useful to create a visible 'limit line" on the graph that corresponded to the finish line of the race depicted in the animation in the DRT (See Image 2). Either the limit line or the finish line could then be manipulated to change the length of the race. This small change allowed students to provide more accurate answers and facilitated communication.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After creating and pilot testing the DRT and paper-and-pencil activities, we recruited middle school EL and non-EL students to be video-recorded while completing these activities, and we analyzed the examples of reasoning abstractly and quantitatively that we saw during these activities. Based on this analysis, we developed a coding scheme that identifies forms of reasoning abstractly and quantitatively that students use as they engage with the activities. We also identified cycles of reasoning abstractly and quantitatively, in which students move from the real-world context to a mathematical representation and back to the context again to check their work. This coding scheme can be used by other educators interested in how EL and non-EL students engage in this important mathematical practice.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Finally, our coding scheme allowed us to answer the main questions of our project about how ELs who use DRT vs. paper and pencil reason abstractly and quantitatively.
