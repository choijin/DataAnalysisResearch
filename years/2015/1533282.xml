<AbstractNarration>Energy consumption is one of the most important practical and timely problem associated with data centers for cloud computing. The urgency of this problem has been exposed by both, the governmental agencies and the industry. While policies that consider the physical design of the data centers have been studied in the technical literature rather thoroughly, the operational characteristics of the data centers (e.g., the required performance of the executed applications, such as the type of services and the applications being supported, their QoS requirements, associated background server maintenance processes, etc.) have rarely been accounted for. In particular, there is a need to investigate the implications of exploiting the operational characteristics of the data centers in the context of power management policies, as those could lead to potentially significant energy savings and operational cost reduction of a computer cloud.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: In the proposed project, we will study the effect of the characteristics of the applications and their requirements on the design of the data centers? power management policies. A particular interest of our study will be the design of such policies in the context of distributed data centers, as provided by the cloud-computing paradigm. In particular, we will investigate the problem of Power Management Policies in heterogeneous data centers for the case of independent/individual data centers from the perspective of job profiling, such as failure and latency tolerance. We will study the possibility of decomposition of the peak loads to a data center into high latency tolerant requests that needs to be migrated to different, less busy data centers, or high failure tolerant requests that require less server resources being activated at peak times. Similarly, we will study the approach of grouping jobs, as to reduce the demand variability on servers. Such decomposition and grouping will be dynamically performed.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The results are expected to significantly improve over the other approaches of power management of data centers, as well as represent estimations which closer match practical systems. The educational impact includes training of graduate and undergraduate students and outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the major activities of our work under this proposal has been to address the question of optimally sizing ("right-sizing") data centers as an optimization problem with the goal of minimizing the energy power, while delivering certain level of user quality of service (and/or quality of user experience). The general objective is to come up with a strategy to, on one hand, minimize the number of turned on servers (as to minimize the power requirement), and, on the other hand, deliver the expected performance, such as delay of a task, accuracy of the results, ability to stream data at sufficient throughput, deliver processing complexity, etc.  To accomplish the objective of right-sizing of data centers, we divided the project into two tasks: design of an "off-line" algorithm and design of an "on-line" algorithm. The off-line algorithm assumes that the arrival times and the characteristics of the jobs are known, and given this information, optimally schedules the servers turning on and off times, as to minimize the overall energy usage. Once the off-line problem has been solved, we use the off-line algorithm to design an on-line algorithm. In the on-line algorithm, we stochastically model the various arrival jobs patterns and, employing the results of the off-line algorithm for each such a case, we come up with an optimal server scheduling policy for the servers.  We developed an online algorithm which is able to minimize the total cost per time-slot (time is slotted in time-slots and all decisions are made on such time-slotted basis). The cost is composed of the energy cost per slot and a weighted sum of deadline and service demand of the job. In our approach, we calculate every possible assignment of servers to jobs present in the system based on the above cost definition. Then, we find which assignment of servers to jobs minimizes the total cost per slot. We show that this problem is exactly the assignment problem which solvable in polynomial time using the well-known Hungarian algorithm. In case of a server is not assigned to a job, we keep this server ON during a portion of time.   We also addressed the on-line problem by characterizing the space of the on-line jobs and modeling their stochastic behavior. We worked on an on-line heuristic and we compared the performance of the optimal solution to that of our heuristic algorithm, demonstrating that the heuristic results closely approximate the optimal solutions.  For the right-sizing of servers, we first demonstrated that the heuristic results closely approximate the optimal solutions.  We then showed that significant energy savings can be accomplished by optimally scheduling the turning on/off times of the servers.    Another objective of our work has been the design of an optimization algorithm for Microgrids in the context of smart homes. More specifically, we assume that users can plan to use appliances ahead of time (e.g., a day before) and the system is able to optimally schedule the turning on and off of energy sources (e.g., diesel generators) in the microgrid to satisfy the energy demand of these appliances.  For the optimization algorithm for Microgrids, we consider the user-planned appliances operations to be tasks with power and timing demands, and our goal is for the microgrid distributed generator sources to meet the tasks requirements while minimizing the power generation costs. At this point in this project, we concentrated on appliances whose usage can be scheduled ahead of time and whose power demand are significant (i.e., we did not consider yet the power demands due to spontaneous loads such as TV set, computer, lightning and microwave oven, but rather assume that the microgrid has reserved generator capacity to produce enough continuous power to meet those needs. Additionally, At this point in the project, we only focused on scheduling the operation of dispatchable power sources such as Diesel engines, micro turbines and fuel cells and leave the integration of renewable energy sources for later work.  For the scheduling of distributed generators in microgrid, we formulated the problem as a non-linear optimization problem and we use a genetic algorithm based heuristic  to solve it. The goal is to schedule the household tasks planned on programmable appliances so as to minimize the microgrid operation costs. We studied the space of the solutions, showing which cases are most likely to result in significant energy savings.
