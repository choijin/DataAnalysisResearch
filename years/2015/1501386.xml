<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    PROJECT DESCRIPTION  UCSD received funding from the National Science Foundation to support travel for 15 students, post-doctoral fellows and early career scientists from the US to attend the Future of Research Communication and e-Scholarship conference (FORCE2015) held in Oxford, UK, January 11-13, 2015.  The meeting was organized by the FORCE11, the Future of Research Communications and e-Scholarship, a grass roots community dedicated to transforming scholarly communication through technology. FORCE11 was founded by Dr. Philip Bourne and other leaders in the research and publishing communities.  The conference brought together researchers, librarians, publishers, technologists, funders and administrators for a truly trans-disciplinary summit and lively discussion around opportunities, challenges and progress in advancing research scholarship through new technologies and practices.    Given the nature of the conference and the topic it addresses, it has the capacity to truly impact all of science and broader society.  When science is done more efficiently and effectively all of society benefits.  The conference exposes students and post-docs to new disciplines, tools, role models and ways of thinking around the issues of scholarly communication.  They develop valuable contacts and see new opportunities where they can work towards positive change while developing their own careers.  However, as FORCE2015 is not a traditional conference, we know that without travel support, most students cannot attend.  Although the conference is trans-disciplinary, the majority of students come from science and technology fields.  Because of the open nature and small size of the conference, they are able to interact directly with leaders in the field across all disciplines and domains.   Students have found this conference experience highly valuable and transformative.    Methods of Announcements/Invitation  The FORCE2015 conference marketing campaign included direct mail of conference flyer, broad distribution of printed flyers, email to the FORCE11 community and members wider scholarly community, social media (Facebook, Twitter), newsletters, and the FORCE11 website.  We also posted calendar listings with affiliate organizations.  The FORCE11 membership (&gt; 1500 individuals) was invited to submit suggestions for session topics and to volunteer for the conference program committee.  The program committee, in turn, selected the topics and session chairs.  Keynote speakers were nominated by the program committee.  Session chairs decided the structure of the sessions.     Invitations to participate in the FORCE2015 conference and to apply for student travel funding were specifically targeted to Science and Engineering Societies representing women and minorities.  Examples of some societies that were targeted are listed below.   American Indian Science &amp; Engineering Society (AISES) Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science Society of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Society of Mexican American Engineers &amp; Scientists Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering National Society of Black Engineers Society for Women's Health Research Association for Women in Computing Association for Women in Science United Negro College Fund   FUNDING SUPPORT REQUESTED FROM NSF  NSF provided $30,509 in funding which included $25,000 in travel support funding plus $3,554 for 2.5 weeks of administrative staff hours (to collect the appropriate paperwork and distribute the funds) and $1,955 IDC on the administrative support. This amount enabled 15 U.S. students and young scientists to attend the FORCE2015 through partial travel support and related expenses to attend the conference, including registration fees.  Each funded student/junior researcher had the opportunity to participate in sessions and connect with peers from around the world, interact with senior-level researchers, and meet high-level keynote speakers.
