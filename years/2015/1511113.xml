<AbstractNarration>CBET - 151113&lt;br/&gt;PI: Rinaldi, Carlos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ferrofluids are fluids that respond to magnetic fields.  This project examines the fluid dynamics of a ferrofluid composed of magnetic particles in a suspending liquid.  The project focuses on the motion of the fluid near a fluid-air interface where interesting connections have been observed experimentally between flow near the interface and flow in the bulk fluid. The velocity of the ferrofluid near various kinds of interfaces will be measured in well-defined flows.  The results will be used to test the validity of theory that describes the appropriate dynamical conditions at the interface.  The project will provide research training to graduate and undergraduate students and will develop Web-based educational videos that explore the fluid dynamics of ferrofluids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the project is to validate experimentally appropriate interfacial boundary conditions on linear and internal angular momentum at ferrofluid-air, ferrofluid-non-ferrofluid, and ferrofluid-ferrofluid interfaces.  Velocity profiles near the interfaces and in the bulk fluids will be measured for various prototype flows, and results will be used to develop models that can be extended to more complicated geometries, including ferrofluid droplets.  The results should help clarify the appropriate interfacial conditions to use for fluid systems that exhibit antisymmetric stresses, which, in turn, can be incorporated into engineering design of various applications involving ferrofluids with interfaces.</AbstractNarration>
