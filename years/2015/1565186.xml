<AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is to study the mathematical structures of various differential equations, concentrating on models that may develop moving interfaces. These problems are used to model a number of different phenomena in Physics, Mathematical Finance, Image processing, and Biology. The main mathematical challenge in such problems is to understand the smoothness or regularity of the interfaces. The models combine the difficulty of analyzing the differential equation with the difficulty in locating the moving interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nonlocal equations to be investigated in this research project arise naturally in probability, in the study of stochastic processes with jumps. More precisely, free boundary problems involving nonlocal equations appear when considering optimal stopping problems, which are used in the pricing of American options in finance. When the underlying stochastic process is Brownian motion (with continuous paths), the regularity theory for solutions and free boundaries is well understood. However, when considering jump-processes the equations become nonlocal, and the structure of the model is more complicated. One of the main goals of the project is to provide a full understanding of such models, establishing regularity results for solutions and free boundaries in this type of problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under this project, the PI and her collaborators has achieved  significant improvements in the theory of  partial differential equations. Thematic areas of focus are: 1) Nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations; 2) Segregation models.     1) Nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations. We have investigated the  asymptotic limits of  1-D Peierls-Nabarro models. These models arise in the theory of dislocations in crystals  and describe at microscopic scale the atom dislocation inside a crystal. In the asymptotic  limit we have characterized the discrete dynamics of dislocation points at mesoscopic scale.  Dislocation points may collide in finite time. Collisions create a problem in the analysis as the  system that describes their dynamics ceases to be well-defined at the collision time. However, we have been able to understand how the dynamical law of the dislocation points can be continued/extended after collisions.  In  a second set of problems, we have studied heteroclinic solutions for systems of equations driven by fractional operators.  The results  obtained by the PI and her collaborators, provided the first complete, rigorous account to this phenomena in a nonlocal nonlinear setting. From the mathematical viewpoint, its solution required an original mix of the variational techniques used in dynamical systems and new tools from nonlocal integro-differential equations. These results are stimulating for both the scientific communities in dynamical systems and in PDEs.  2)  Segregation models. The PI and her collaborators have studied different segregation models. Segregation phenomena occur in many areas of mathematics and science: from equipartition problems in geometry, to social and biological processes (cells, bacteria, ants, mammals), to finance (sellers and buyers).
