<AbstractNarration>Contemporary youth are confronted with a paradox in their aspirations for upward mobility: higher education is increasingly becoming an economically necessary investment, while it is becoming less subsidized and more difficult to capitalize on in the short term. The establishment and maintenance of a stable middle class has long been regarded as essential to the health of the economy, and the viable pursuit of upward mobility is a key measure of confidence for that system. This project, which trains a graduate student in conducting rigorous, empirically grounded scientific fieldwork, asks how educated youth are able to maintain aspirations for upward mobility in the face of significant structural challenges. The findings will be useful to policymakers, planners, and practitioners interested in sustainable economic development.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robert Miles Loomis, under the supervision of Dr. Jennifer Cole at the University of Chicago, examines how members of a growing underclass of educated but irregularly employed rural graduates living on the margins of major metropolises negotiate the tension between aspirations for upward mobility and present realities of poverty and precarious employment. The research specifically such one such group in China (yi zu; or "ant tribe"), an ideal site for exploring this question as it has seen a rapidly developing middle class since initiating its policies for "reform and opening" (gaige kaifang) in the late-1970s. Much of the population now sees education as only way out of poverty. Rural parents, especially, often spend all of their savings to ensure that their children attend college and land jobs in urban areas. The turn to education as a means of social mobility was itself encouraged by the government's decision in 1999 to radically expand the university system, making higher education more accessible through marketization. Yet despite the greater availability of tuition-based degrees, the Chinese economy has not generated enough white-collar jobs to absorb this massive influx of graduates. Yet members of this group, as educated youth, remain hopeful about their ability to enter into China's "high quality" workforce. By providing an in depth ethnographic look at this growing population, this project will explore how marginalized rural youth make sense of and act upon the terms of their social participation in contemporary urban China, and the ways they may be reproducing or challenging the nature of value and social hierarchy as they do so. Methods include participant observation and interviews at four different sites in and around Beijing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examines how rural graduates living on the margins of major metropolises in China negotiate the tension between aspirations for upward mobility and present realities of precarious employment.  Over the past decade, the rapid expansion of tertiary education in China has not been met by a corresponding rise in the number of white-collar jobs.  Rural graduates living in urban China face the additional challenge of having to confront the legacy of China's hukou system dividing the national space into two hierarchically ordered parts: the city and the country. Anthropologists working in China have argued that this explicit division between urban and rural regions is legitimated in the post-Mao era by the state's current "quality (suzhi)" development discourse, which establishes a form of holistic hierarchy between the urban middle-class and the rural poor.  Yet as educated youth, these graduates remain hopeful about their ability to enter into China's "high quality" workforce.  Through ethnographic fieldwork conducted among youth living on the outskirts of Beijing in the "urban village" (chengzhongcun) of Shigezhuang, as well as a number of other sites, I found that such youth manage to preserve hope for the future by engaging in the "new spirit" of capitalism in the high-tech zone where they work, on the one hand, and through the continuing support of family and kin, on the other. However, I also discovered that it is precisely these two spaces of hope that are also sources of deep anxiety &ndash; the dramas of uncertain and precarious employment, as well as the new monetary pressures placed on filial networks in the absence of state support.  In an environment where neoliberalism is neither dominant nor hegemonic, rural graduates living in urban China force us to re-theorize those social-cultural and political elements dialectically interacting with rapid economic growth which shape the reproduction of social hierarchies and the formation of youthful aspiration(s) &ndash; that is, the (re)production of the future.  By providing an in depth ethnographic look at this growing population &ndash; their practices, their aspirations, their precarious lives &ndash; this project foregrounds the ways in which China?s hybrid economy, or "market socialism," leads not only to new forms of youth marginalization, but also to new forms of subjectivity.  Of course, while the specificities of China?s state-led development give a unique quality to the marginalization of rural graduates, the broader impacts of this study lie in its ability to address and engage what may be one of the most important phenomena of our times: the foreclosure of opportunity for youth around the world.  Across the globe, the rapid expansion of higher education has combined with the withdrawal of the state from managing national economies, leaving millions of young people in social limbo.  How such youth manage to preserve a sense of hope has major implications.  For while the aspirations of un(der)employed youth may result in the conservative "cruel optimism" of sustaining bare-life, they also harbor the potential for more radical change.
