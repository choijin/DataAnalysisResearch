<AbstractNarration>This award supports theoretical research related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), with the aim of improving the sensitivity of LIGO detectors.  Research carried out during this project explores the fundamental quantum and gravitational physics that underlie gravitational-wave detectors, and the results will be widely relevant to the more general community of quantum optomechanics. This project will be carried out at professor Yanbei Chen's research group at the California Institute of Technology; it will serve as a training ground for young gravitational-wave scientists --- by exposing them to a variety of research topics, ranging from quantum measurement theory to classical statistical physics. Members of Chen's research group will interact closely with members of the LIGO Lab, and the rest of the LIGO Scientific collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically: (A) New techniques of reducing LIGO's quantum noise will be explored, including the use of active quantum optomechanical devices, the employment of optical rigidity generated by multiple optical modes, and the possible application of active medium. The domain of applicability of the so-called Energetic Quantum Limit for quantum measurements will be critically studied. (B) Research on advanced interferometer configurations will be carried out; in particular, the feasibility and merit of switching interferometer configurations during signal arrival will be investigated; the effect of optical-mode imperfection on calibration will be evaluated; a framework for evaluating upgrade strategies for Advanced LIGO interferometers will be established. (C) Theoretical investigations on thermal fluctuations of anistoropic coating materials and non-equilibrium cryogenic suspension systems will be carried out. (D) Strategies of testing fundamental quantum and gravitational physics using macroscopic test masses and quantum-limited measurements will be formulated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project explored the fundamental limit on the sensitivities of gravitational-wave detectors, imposed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle of quantum mechanics, showing that maximal sensitivity is directly proportional to the level of light-pressure fluctuations in the detectors.  This insight has guided us toward designing new optical configurations of interferometers, some of these concepts have been put into experimental tests by our collaborators.  These new configurations may lead to substantial improvements in the sensitivities of the Laser Interferometer Gravitaitonal-wave Observatory (LIGO), its international partners, and its future upgrades and successors.  We invented a way to improve detector sensitivity by using quantum entanglement, which allows a simpler optical configuration.  This is a competitive candidiate for the next upgrade to the current, second-generation laser interferometer gravitational-wave detectors. We studied how precision measurement experiments involving macroscopic test masses can be used to test modifications to quantum mechanics, and have shown that results from the LISA Pathfinder experiment --- on board a spacecraft launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) --- can be used to put new bounds on the so-called Collapse Models, which attempts to explain the appearance of the classical world from quantum mechanics by postulating that quantum wavefunctions of macrosocpic objects get continuously destroyed.  Within statistical error, no effects of wavefunction destruction was found for the LISA Pathfinder's 2 kilogram test masses, in the time scale of ~100 seconds.  We carried out theoretical study of atom interferometry in gravitaitonal field --- using atoms that have internal states --- showing that the slight mass differences of atoms, when residing at different internal states, will cause the corresponding matter waves to spread differently, leading to reduction of frindge visibility.    By applying principles of quantum physics to experiments in gravitational physics, and by using gravitational-physics experiments to test quantum mechanics, our research has served as a bridge between the gravitaitonal physics and quantum physics communities.  This project has provided the opportunity for 2 graduate students and 1 postdoctoral scholars to receiving training in research.
