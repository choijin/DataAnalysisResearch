<AbstractNarration>One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the mass of the Higgs boson has the value it has. To answer these questions it is necessary to go beyond the present picture of the Universe described by the Standard Model to the next phase of development, Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Investigations in BSM physics probe such questions as why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe, the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents of matter, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. This award will contribute to this search through measurements made of the decay of charged K mesons, a rare process.  The award will also continue the impressive effort in broadening the participation in fundamental research, through its participation in QuarkNet and through a separate NSF IRES (International Research Experience for Students) grant that brings up to five undergraduates to CERN each summer, with applicants selected from a consortium of universities and colleges in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Searches for evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model can be addressed through direct searches at the Energy Frontier at High Energy Colliding Beam Facilities such as the LHC and through a complementary technique of indirect searches at the Intensity Frontier, in experimental measurements of very-rare decay modes of known particles. This award focuses on continued research with the NA62 experiment at CERN, which is a measurement of the rare decay of the charged K meson through the process, K+ -&gt; pion+, neutrino, anti-neutrino. This decay is well-predicted in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and a precision experimental measurement of the actual rate could provide evidence for new physics, if the observed rate differs significantly from the theoretical prediction.  This award will provide help in all aspects of NA62, with responsibilities in event trigger logic, trigger hardware and front-end electronics communication, slow controls, and a counter for the detection of  kaons in the beam line.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the George Mason University (GMU) group's involvement in the commissioning and running of the NA62 experiment at CERN.  The NA62 experiment studies ultra-rare transition processes--some of which are forbidden by the Standard Model--primarily of charged kaons, but also of hypothetical exotic particles.  The award also supported the preliminary design and testing efforts for a future experiment using a neutral beam.  Major activities undertaken during the award period included commissioning the detector (2015); collecting and analyzing data (2015-2019); publishing a) the proceedings of an international conference hosted by the PI, b) a complete description of the NA62 detector, and c) 8 refereed journal papers on NA62 data collected between 2015-2017; developing and testing high-level triggers; undertaking a number of service tasks for the experiment including run coordination, logbook and database development and maintenance, and editorial board membership; and engaging in research and development for a future experiment.  The major achievement of NA62 to this point has been to prove that its unique approach to detecting one part in 10 million processes works.  When the CERN accelerator infrastructure turns on again in 2021, after a two-year overhaul, NA62 should be ready to collect dozens of examples of such processes.  Over the course of the award period, one graduate student earned a Ph.D. and began a post-doctoral fellowship with the Naval Research Laboratory, and 5 undergraduate students completed two Summers of scientific internships at CERN.  One of the undergraduates received recognition for presentations of his work on simulations for the neutral experiment: 1st Place in the Physical Sciences category of the GMU College of Science Undergraduate Research Colloquium, and an OSA Poster Award for General Physics at the SPS Quadrennial Physics Congress.  This research award also made it possible for the PI to receive a series of International Research Experience for Students awards (NSF) to support as many as 6 additional undergraduate student experiences at CERN each Summer.  Thus, under the supervision of the PI, as many as 8 undergraduate students spent 8 weeks (2015-2018) at CERN working on research internships.  Before departing for Geneva, Switzerland, all students received a week of training at GMU, which included overviews of life and expectations at CERN and in Geneva; synopses of the projects each student would be engaged in, particularly their contexts; and individualized instruction on the skills needed for their projects .  At CERN, besides working on these projects, the students attended academic training lectures, participated in skill-building workshops, and took guided tours of laboratory spaces and experimental areas.  The students supported by these grants analyzed large  data sets, simulated detectors, developed trigger (real-time) and analysis software, and worked with detector hardware--all experiences they were unlikely to get in the  classroom, but likely enhanced their career prospects.  The PI's particle physics work and affiliation with CERN, supported by  this grant, have generated many outreach opportunities. He has made both  formal and informal presentations  at two-  and four-year colleges, Osher Lifelong Learning institutes,  high schools, and other places. He is a mentor for Virgina's chapter of  QuarkNet, a professional development and support program for high school  science teachers, made possible by the sponsorship of funding agencies and  involvement of large LHC experiments and LIGO. The Virginia chapter, one  of whose founding members is among the nearly 200 former Summer  internship students funded by the NSF and supervised by the PI, is  co-hosted by GMU and the College of William &amp; Mary. It meets annually in Northern Virginia, where the PI serves as the local resource  person.  In addition, the PI hosts at GMU an annual Masterclass for high  school students and teachers.  The primary focus of the Masterclass is  analysis of LHC data, but students are presented with an overview of  particle physics and an opportunity to tour physics labs on campus, as  well.
