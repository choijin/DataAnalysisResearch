<AbstractNarration>Cost-effective repair methods for composite blades are critically needed for the wind energy industry. Wind turbine blades are subject to considerable wear and degradation, and their repairs are often necessary. Currently, most blade repairs are performed using wet epoxy resins. Such repairs have low joining strength and require long processing time. The research supported under this award will establish the foundation for a novel laser-based process to repair composite blades. During the process, a repair patch of glass fibers is joined employing a laser-deposition joining method utilizing fine glass powders as filler material. Laser-deposition joining repair of fiber-reinforced composites will also have applications where repair of composite structures is needed; for example, those in defense, aerospace, automotive, and compressed gas storage industries. Consequently, the results of this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research objectives are: (1) establishing the relationship between glass powder stream temperature and operational parameters (such as laser power density and powder flow rate), (2) quantifying the effect of the glass powder stream temperature on the glass viscous flow behavior through the repair patch of glass fibers, and (3) establishing the relationship between glass powder stream temperature and deposition joint quality (in terms of infiltration depth, porosity, flexural properties, and delamination resistance). To achieve these objectives, three research tasks will be completed. First, numerical modeling of coaxial powder flow and laser-particle interaction will be performed to predict glass powder stream temperature. The modeling results under various operational conditions will be verified using experimental measurements of powder stream temperature. Second, multi-physics modeling will be performed to evaluate the effect of powder stream temperature on the glass melt viscous flow through the random arrays of fibers media. The infiltration depth of the glass fill and porosity of the cooled deposition joint will be predicted and validated against optical and scanning electron microscopy measurements. Finally, the effect of glass powder stream temperature on the joint integrity will be experimentally determined based on microscopy measurements of infiltration depth and porosity and mechanical testing of flexural properties and delamination resistance. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Current composite blade repairs using wet epoxy resins have low joining strength and require long processing time. The research supported under this award established the foundation for novel Laser Deposition Joining and Cutting processes to repair composite blades. This effort entailed experimentation, mechanical testing and analysis, and physics-based computational modeling to achieve two specific research goals: (1) Establish process mechanisms for new glass fiber-reinforced glass matrix composites using the laser deposition joining process, and (2) Establish the relationship between the material removal mechanism for fiber-reinforced composites and laser cutting operational parameters. Based on the results of the research effort as achieved over this project period, two key outcomes can be ascertained. First, relevant to the laser-deposition composite joining as a viable manufacturing process (Goal 1), a good quality bond is produced between reinforcing glass fibers and the glass matrix in a composite join without any damage to the fibers during the process, which can be seen in Fig. 1. The good bonding between the fiber and matrix also indicates that temperature during the process was well controlled between the melting temperature of glass powder and the fiber glass transition temperature. Mechanically enhanced glass fiber-reinforced matrix composites can be successfully manufactured. Second, relevant to Goal 2, this study has demonstrated for the first time that keyhole mode cutting can be achieved for Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) materials using a high-energy nanosecond pulse laser operating in long-duration Long Pulse mode, as shown in Fig. 2. The formation of keyhole-shaped trench was attributed to laser ablation of carbon fibers and polymer matrix via a deep penetration of laser energy. It was also shown that short-duration Q-Switch mode operation results in ineffective CFRP cutting performance, even for a much higher laser power intensity than the Long Pulse mode. Dissemination of research results during the project period was achieved exclusively by means of publication of research results in relevant professional journals and international conferences. Six journal papers were published, one journal paper is still in press, and two conference papers were published.&nbsp;</p> <p>Educational and outreach activities conducted during this project promoted the professional development and/or training of students, at diverse levels of education, respective of both industrial practice and academic research methods. One PhD student, supported under a supplemental NSF INTERN program, completed a 6-month research internship with General Motors (GM). Through his research project on ultrasonic welding at GM, a research collaboration program on material joining was established between the PI?s group at the University of Iowa and the advanced material joining group at GM R&amp;D. This experience provided the student with first-hand exposure of research outcomes to real-world applications as well as the obverse, applying industrial needs in the establishment of a meaningful academic research activity. As well, the two PhD students supported under the NSF research project at Iowa gained enhanced research experience with respect to laser joining, manufacturing process modeling, and material characterization, applying this knowledge to successfully conduct experimental and numerical analyses supporting the approaches and objectives of this project. The four undergraduate students assisted in nanosecond pulse laser machining research in the PI lab, participated in experimental setup (e.g., laser scan head system and laser beam delivery system) and conducted preliminary experiments. Similarly, the six high school summer interns performing surface texturing research, as demonstrated in Fig. 3, under the Workplace Learning Connection program in Johnson County, Iowa during the summers of 2016-2018, gained valuable experience with respect to how learning and education is effected in a higher academic setting, which will hopefully guide them in their post-secondary education academic or professional pursuits.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Hongtao&nbsp;Ding</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537512/1537512_10378391_1561847116343_2017report-1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537512/1537512_10378391_1561847116343_2017report-1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537512/1537512_10378391_1561847116343_2017report-1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A good quality bonding of the unidirectional fiber bundles was achieved using the Laser Deposition Joining process.
