<AbstractNarration>Many contemporary buildings tend to form a soft story mechanism during an earthquake. This behavior is characterized by large demands concentrated in a single story of the building. These demands can ultimately limit the capacity of the entire system and increase both structural and nonstructural damage, leading to structural collapse. This award supports research to develop the merits of a relatively new 'spine' system. The new system utilizes a spine that ties all the stories in a building together, forcing them to behave as one unit so that damage is not permitted to concentrate in a single story. If effective, this system could become essential for suitable structural performance during seismic events. This project will be conducted at National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan under the mentorship of Professor K.C. Tsai, a noted expert on innovative steel building systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will attempt to quantify the relationship between the use of a spine and its ability to mitigate a soft story. There has been little research internationally addressing the specific details of the spine concept and how to implement a spine into design practice. The purpose of this study would be to address the following questions about a spine system: (1) What is the effect of allowing yielding in the mast rather than designing it to be completely elastic? (2) What is the effect on the system if the inelastic portion outside of the mast is significantly damaged and exhibits substantial deterioration during a seismic event? (3) What is the resiliency of the system in terms of the amount of residual drift associated with a mast system after an event? Special emphasis will be placed on the first of these questions. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many contemporary buildings are susceptible to soft or weak story mechanisms during an earthquake. This behavior is characterized by large demands concentrated in a single story. Such behavior can be detrimental to a buildingÃ†s seismic performance, ultimately limiting the capacity of the entire system and increasing both structural and nonstructural damage. This study focused on developing the merits of a relatively new system that may be essential to limiting soft or weak story behavior. The new system utilizes a steel spine, or "strongback", that ties every story in a building together, forcing them to behave as one unit. As such, damage is not permitted to concentrate in a single story. A numerical model of this system was analyzed at the National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan under the mentorship of Professor K.C. Tsai, a noted expert on innovative steel building systems.               Research activities for this project were broken into two parts: (i) calibration of the numerical models to experimental tests conducted by the University of California, Berkeley and (ii) analysis of a prototype strongback under a suite of ground motions conducted at National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan. Both of these activities were successfully completed during the program time frame. Results from the two-story numerical model designed at the National Taiwan University show that the strongback system can be effective in limiting a soft or weak story mechanism.  These results, however, were tempered by the large number of failures due to large rotations seen in the numerical model. These failures show that the geometry of the strongback system is critical to maintaining adequate performance. Future studies will further develop the the relationship between the frame's rotation and geometry.  Intellectual Merit: The overall performance of the system shows that the strongback may be critical in improving the seismic safety of buildings located in regions near major earthquake faults.   Broader Impacts: There has been little research internationally addressing the specific details of the "strongback" concept and how to implement a "spine" into design practice. As such, this study formed a foundation for future collaboration, as well as a professional development opportunity at National Taiwan University.
