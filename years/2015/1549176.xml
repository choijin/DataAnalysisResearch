<AbstractNarration>The goal of the Workshop on Logic, Rewriting, and Concurrency is to provide an interdisciplinary research forum, focused on advancing the foundations of formal methods and reasoning about properties of cyber-physical systems and their safe, secure, and reliable operation in the real world. Such systems are rapidly becoming key component of critical infrastructure, medical systems, and artifacts that affect our daily lives such as smart buildings, wearables, and entertainment systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop grant will enable students and speakers from many disciplines, from industry and academia, to participate in research discussions at this workshop with leading researchers about new approaches and applications of rewrite-rule systems for composability, symbolic analysis, temporal modeling, and verification of hybrid systems. The workshop will provide an opportunity for students and young researchers to interact with leaders in these important fields. The diverse experience and expertise of the participants coupled with a shared interest in rewriting and formal systems provides an ideal setting to foster new synergies and collaborations to address challenging problems in theory and applications to real world problems.</AbstractNarration>
