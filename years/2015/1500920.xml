<AbstractNarration>This project supports participation by US-based researchers, particularly  speakers, organizers, graduate students, and recent PhD recipients, at the conference "Model Theory, Difference/Differential Equations, and Applications" held at CIRM in Luminy, France, April 7th - 10th, 2015.  This conference brings together researchers in model theory, in difference and differential algebra, and in allied fields (such as algebraic dynamics) in which theorems from model theoretic algebra have been applied.  This workshop will foster research interactions and will provide an informal setting for graduate students and younger researchers to learn of the newest trends in this research area and interact with some of the most prominent researchers around the world.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, this project will provide financial support to a substantial number of graduate students and young researchers from the United States.  Differential algebraic geometry, differential Galois theory and, more recently, algebraic dynamics have benefited from the close interaction with model theory, especially the model theory of fields with operators.  The conference aims to catalyze further developments in this area.  Details about the conference may be found at http://scientific-events.weebly.com/1194.html .</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported US-based participation in the conference "Model theory, dierence/dierential equations, and applications" held at the Centre International de Rencontres Math&eacute;matiques in Luminy, France during the period 7 April 2015 to 10 April 2015.  A central goal of the conference was to bring together researchers in model theory, in dierence and differential algebra, and from allied fields (such as algebraic dynamics) in which theorems from model theoretic algebra have been applied.  Various model-theoretic tools, in particular sharpenings of the Trichotomy Principle, have been used with great success in algebraic dynamics, e.g. in connection with descent issues and the study of invariant subvarieties. Similar connections exist in the study of classical differential and difference equations, such as Painlev&eacute; equations (and its q-variants) and the differential equations satised by relevant analytic functions: the exponential function; the j-invariant, among others. This development relates to questions in diophantine geometry and transcendence theory.  The aim of the meeting had been to present some of the major recent developments in these areas. Furthermore, we sought to bring together model-theorists and researchers in other fields of mathematics, from differential algebraic geometry to algebraic dynamics, as well as difference/differential Galois theory and arithmetic geometry.  More generally, especially through the funding afforded by this project, we aimed to broaden the participation by graduate students and young researchers in this subject.  These goals were met in that many people with a wide range of specialities attended, spoke at, and generally participated in the meeting.  The presentations covered a broad range of material, were accessible to the researchers present, and were at a high level of quality and depth.
