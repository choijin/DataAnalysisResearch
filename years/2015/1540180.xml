<AbstractNarration>Gyroscope is currently used in a wide range of applications including defense, aerospace, consumer electronics, and industrial. It is a multi-billion dollar market with a very high growth rate. Current Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) gyroscopes at the needed size, price point, and accuracy are not available to be used in many of the new applications the market seeks, such as in the navigation unit for guiding Unmanned Air Vehicles, automobiles, and humans in the regions where GPS signals are not receivable, for instance, inside buildings and tunnels. These applications require accuracy that is ~100 times higher than that of current available MEMS gyroscopes. This project aims to commercialize ultra-high-precision Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) gyroscopes, called the birdbath resonator gyroscope (BRG).  The proposed work will enhance the understanding of dominant energy loss mechanisms and ways to further improve the performance of these resonators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team has demonstrated the proof of concept BRG, and was tested at the lab under non-ideal temperature conditions. The device demonstrated accuracy and has been found to be sufficient for some industrial and military applications (e.g. stabilization of platforms for antenna, robots, or helicopters). By participating in the I-Corps program, the team will contact market participants that use gyroscopes to understand their needs, both met and unmet, regarding unit size, power, cost, and technical performance requirements. The team will work to learn the potential market size for its technology, and conduct an analysis of competitors already in the space to see how they are supplying the marketplace in a way that meet current customer needs. If successfully developed, the BRG technology could be adopted in a wide range of new applications. This will benefit the society by creating new jobs for developing both hardware and software for utilizing ultra high performance MEMS gyroscopes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             We participated an NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corp) cohort at Georgia Tech in Spring 2015.  The members of our team were Prof. Khalil Najafi (PI), Dr. Jae Yoong Cho (Commercialization Lead), and Dr. Jay Mitchell (industry Mentor).  Our goal was to assess the market and customer needs and for a high-precision micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope developed by Dr. Cho during his PhD and postdoc training.  Dr. Cho's MEMS gyroscope has higher performance, smaller size, and potentially lower cost than similar high-performance MEMS gyroscopes currently on the market.              The I-Corps program was extremely valuable and taught us the importance of identifying the value propositions for the device, and the importance of interacting with the end customers to test our value propositions.  The final gyroscope product will be a highly complex system consisting of a mechanical sensing device, and several other components and software.  This required us to study the details of not only the technology and performance needs of the customer, but also potential future revenue streams and mechanisms that would allow the commercialization of the end product.               By the end of the I-Corps program, we interviewed approximately 90 potential end users and 20 channel partners.  We found a good product-market fit for the gyroscope in the unmanned air vehicles (UAV) infrastructure and geographical mapping application.  By law, civil construction surveyors are required to prepare a topography map with &lt; 1 cm resolution for construction planning.  Currently, a topology map is created using a LiDAR on a helicopter or by a human-based survey.  The costs of these methods are about 20 times more than using a UAV.  However, a LiDAR for a UAV has to be light and small.  Therefore, only small gyroscopes can be used.  Existing small gyroscopes have limited accuracy, so the resolution of a current UAV LiDAR is &gt;&gt; 1 cm.  This resolution is not acceptable for a topology map for civil construction planning.  We found that our gyroscope can deliver a significant value to civil construction surveyors at much lower cost than their current methods.  We also identified a potential channel partner, who will integrate our gyroscopes to a LiDAR.             We will continue interviewing potential customers in order to more clearly identify our entry market and understand other aspects of our business model.  Following the I-Corps program, we received a grant from the University of Michigan to continue our commercialization effort.  We plan on raising additional funds from other government agencies and potential investors before making the final decision on whether a practical and viable product can be produced.              If successful, this accurate angular rate sensor could also fin application in a number of other markets with very broad impact.
