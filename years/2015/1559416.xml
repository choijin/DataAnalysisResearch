<AbstractNarration>This grant will support the refurbishment of an internally heated high-pressure vessel (IHPV) acquired by the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) from NASA.    Experiments under deep earth conditions are the primary means of investigating chemical evolution of magmas under controlled conditions. The installation of this apparatus will provide much greater access for students participating in AMNH-sponsored high school, undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and teacher training programs.  The additional IHPV access will also support AMNH and other, non-museum colleagues to enhance U.S. competitiveness in research in magmatic processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IHPV will be used to investigate melt-mineral-fluid phase equilibria and component partitioning behaviors in geologic systems under controlled conditions. The primary research objective is to obtain critical, missing knowledge to better address the compositional range of magmas that threaten society with eruptions or are part of hydrothermal mineralizing processes that produce metallic resources.</AbstractNarration>

IHPVs are critical to exploring volatile/magma interactions in the feeding zones of explosive, silicic volcanoes, at temperatures up to 1100 C and pressures up to 6.8 kilobars (6800 atmospheres, or about 16 miles.

Equipment failure is not uncommon at these high T and P conditions. Dr. Webster overcame several frustrating leaks in the seals, which took months to fix. In our tight space in New York, it was a challenge to install new pressure gauges, a rebuilt compressed air system, an enhanced water cooling system, temperature controls and other ancillary equipment to make the new IHPV operational (see images). Dr. Webster tested the IHPV extensively by running pilot experiments. This second IHPV in the AMNH lab doubles our capacity to see how much water and CO2 can dissolve in silicic magmas, depending on their sulfur and chlorine contents. The magmas we are working on are like that of Mt. Saint Helens, Vesuvius, and other explosive volcanoes. These experiments are ongoing in the two IHPVs. They will be used to calibrate models for bubble formation deep under volcanoes like those from Oregon to Alaska, and to calibrate models for magma crystallization, all to understand their eruption processes and potential. Fluids from such magmas also form metallic ore deposits, and our experiments will increase understanding of ore formation.
