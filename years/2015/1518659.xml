<AbstractNarration>This US-Singapore project will catalyze a new international collaboration between the PI's experimental group at SUNY-Buffalo and a theoretical group at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. During the PI's team visit to Singapore, the PI's recent experimental results on mechanical stability of atomic-sized conductors as small as a single-atom bridge will be analyzed theoretically, focusing on the size dependence of the modulus enhancement and deformation modes at the Fermi length scale. This will lay the foundation for the longer term objective of understanding the role of crystal structure and atomic coordination, temperature, and surface energy, on the stability of atomic-sized samples. &lt;br/&gt;Involvement of students in this activity will help to develop their capacities to be comfortable with both experimental and theoretical approaches. The project will help establish a theoretical and quantitative&lt;br/&gt;framework to explain the mechanics of quantum and semi-classical conductors.</AbstractNarration>
