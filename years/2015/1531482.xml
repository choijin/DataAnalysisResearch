<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI) award will support the acquisition of a bench-top powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) system at Denison University. This instrument will be used in the research of at least five faculty members at Denison. The breadth of the research includes development of new types of liquid crystals for use in organic electronics and solar cells, novel bio-sensors for disease detection, new catalysts for the generation of solar fuels, and understanding water transport in waxy layers related to hydration control in plants. Denison University is a primarily undergraduate institution, meaning that the research supported by the the new instrument is carried out exclusively with undergraduate researchers mentored directly by faculty. Undergraduate students will be trained as independent users of powder XRD, gaining significant hands-on experience and enhanced research training. In addition, the instrument will be incorporated into several classes in the science curriculum, including classes in general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, and geoscience. The use of cutting edge equipment across Denison's curriculum promotes an increased student awareness of the critical role fundamental science plays in technological innovation and in finding solutions for many of the critical issues facing the Nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a compact bench top design and advanced capabilities such as incorporation of the ALTK-450 variable temperature (VT) stage, the ADX-8000 powder XRD system will have significant and immediate impact on multiple ongoing research areas in the department in diverse areas of functional materials research.  These include (1) research in novel columnar liquid crystalline materials with potential to serve as components in a range of organic electronic applications, including low-cost photovoltaics;  (2) research on low-cost solar energy conversion, with the development of mixed metal-oxide nanomaterials; (3) research in well-ordered organo-silicate materials  with the potential to serve as biochemically active materials and sensors; (4) research on the complex phase behavior of wax layers mimicking natural boundary layers.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual merit.  In the area of inorganic nanostructure synthesis access to the ADX system has allowed for significant outcomes in developing nanostructured photoelectrochemical electrodes from a specific phase of iron oxide known as hematite. The X-ray diffractometer was used to interrogate the mineral composition of electrodes at multiple stages of the synthetic process, ensuring in ?real time? that the structured electrodes were indeed in the correct material phase. This proved to be critical to ensuring the integrity of the electrodes and to accessing several subtle affects of the synthetic process on electrode performance. This work will impact procedures in the synthesis of low-cost hematite electrodes and has uncovered important factors to consider in the general synthesis of many nanostructured inorganic films and devices.     In the area of organic materials design, the benefits of relatively simple synthetic tuning for many of these materials is often offset by the difficulty in accurately predicting how the synthetic changes will affect functional properties. Access to the ADX X-ray diffractometer system with a variable temperature stage at Denison has allowed for an in-depth investigation of structure-property relationships in a novel series of organic materials, bi-component donor-acceptor columnar liquid crystals (DACLCs). Subtle effects on material properties such as light absorption, stability, and conductivity were probed as a function of molecular structure and phase structure, yielding significant insight into future designs of DACLCs for tailored applications in devices and technologies.     Broader impact.  To date, 4 faculty members and 9 undergraduate students have been trained as expert users of the XRD. Of the undergraduates, 7 are women and 3 from a demographic traditionally underrepresented in the chemical sciences. Impressively, 6 of these students are currently enrolled in or applying to graduate programs in chemistry or materials science.
