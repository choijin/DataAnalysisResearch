<AbstractNarration>Islands often contain unique ecosystems and organisms. Numerous species across the animal tree-of-life have evolved a dwarfed body size on islands, and some, including Boa constrictor, the focal species for this work, have evolved dwarfism multiple times on multiple independent islands. The drastic variation between normal, large-sized mainland boas and their closely-related dwarfed island relatives suggests that a relatively small number of genetic variants in the B. constrictor genome may underlie island dwarfism, and that this system may therefore provide new insight into the genetics of body size in vertebrates. This project also leverages the replicated evolution of dwarf populations of Boa constrictor to investigate if repeated evolution of dwarfism is driven by shared or unique genes or functional pathways across multiple independently evolved dwarf island populations. This work will therefore address fundamental topics in evolutionary biology, including the genetic basis of local adaptation in natural populations and test for connections between the genetic and morphological basis for evolutionary convergence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability of evolution to drive the convergent evolution of phenotypic traits provides some of the strongest and clearest evidence for selection and adaptation. More recent work has become particularly interested in whether canalized paths of genetic evolution underlie convergent phenotypic evolution, or whether instead idiosyncratic and/or diverse genetic paths and processes lead to convergent phenotypic solutions. This work will use genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms to first delineate the population structure and phylogenetic relationships among island and mainland populations of Boa constrictor. These same markers will also be used to find regions of the genome that are putatively under selection and that are most variable between island and mainland populations, which represent the most promising regions in which to identify genes underlying body size dwarfism. Data collected from independent island lineages will be used to test whether phenotypic convergence in body size is the product of genotypic or functional convergence at the molecular level. This work will therefore answer questions about the genetics of adaptation and about the molecular basis of convergent evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supported research aiming to understand the genomic basis of insular dwarfism and to leverage independent island systems to test for underlying convergent patterns of selection and molecular evolution. Island dwarfism is a common pattern observed in island ecosystems where organisms have reduced size compared with mainland relatives. Despite decades of interest by biologists, the genetic basis of island dwarfism has never been thoroughly investigated. Moreover, this phenomenon is largely ubiquitous across distinct island systems and fauna, providing a powerful opportunity to understand how genetics shapes convergent island dwarfism phenotypes across taxonomic comparisons spanning the spectrum of evolutionary relatedness. The goal for this project was to use independent populations of a single snake species to attempt to unravel the genetic underpinnings of island dwarfism and to investigate whether phenotypic convergence in body size in these island populations is a product of shared or distinct suites of genes and genetic processes.</p> <p>The project focused on island and mainland populations of the snake <em>Boa imperator</em> in Central America, and used genome-wide sampling to search for genomic regions under selection in dwarf island populations that may cause repeat patterns of island dwarfs. Across Central America, numerous island populations of this snake species are dwarfed, and these island populations are thought to have been recently connected to mainland populations, and only separated since sea levels rose after the last glacial period. Studies of snakes on islands in Belize indicate that dwarfism is heritable even in common garden experiments, indicating a genetic basis for the trait. Using sampling from Belize island populations and from dwarf snakes on an independent island system in Honduras, alongside mainland population sampling, we evaluated signatures of selection at over 100,000 genomic regions, finding regions under selection that are characteristic of loci with known functional links to genes that could plausibly cause dwarfism. We combined this information with a newly-created <em>B. constrictor</em> genome annotation and evaluated the potential for causal relationships between genes and the island dwarf phenotype.</p> <p>We&rsquo;ve published the first foundational paper supported by this award, which uses mitochondrial and nuclear genome data to evaluate population structure and relationships among snakes in the genus <em>Boa</em> throughout their entire range. The primary results of this investigation is that there is substantially greater diversity than was previously recognized within the genus <em>Boa</em>, including at least three species. Moreover, we found that the two island systems for which we had dwarf island population sampling appear to be evolutionary independent, indicating that dwarfism has arisen at least twice on islands in Central America, an important foundational finding for our investigation of genetic convergence.</p> <p>Many of the most significant outcomes of this project (i.e., genetic basis of island dwarfism and convergence), are approaching completion, and will be completed and published as the co-PI Card finishes his Ph.D. in May 2018. Major outcomes are outlined below. Our preliminary analyses highlighted in the DDIG proposal identified a promising candidate gene, <em>NEK4</em>, underlying island dwarfism in Belize island populations. We further investigated this candidate gene using PCR and Sanger sequencing to scan for variants, especially non-synonymous variants in coding regions. Unfortunately, no variation was found in the <em>NEK4</em> exons, indicating that regulatory changes may instead be the driver of <em>NEK4</em>&rsquo;s impact on body size, should this gene play a role in this phenotype. Aside from this finding, and in conjunction with additional funding from the American Philosophical Society, we traveled to Honduras and gathered population sampling from &gt; 40 boas the dwarf island populations of <em>Boa</em> on Cayos Cochinos, where we only previously had two samples. This sampling was important for our work on genetic convergence. With all necessary samples in hand, we have sequenced all target genomic (ddRADseq) libraries and have thus generated all the data. Furthermore, and based on additional internal funding received from the Phi Sigma Graduate Honor Society at the University of Texas, Arlington, we have completed additional low coverage whole genome resequencing of 10 snakes: two each from the Belize and Honduras island systems and six from the mainland. This additional sampling will allow us to identify potential causal variants in genomic regions associated with island dwarfism in a much more cost-effective manner than PCR and Sanger sequencing. Analyses of these data are mostly complete and the accompanying manuscript has been drafted. To date, our results indicate a remarkably small number of genetic loci appear to underlie dwarfism in island populations, which is important and exciting because it argues this may be true of other vertebrates and explain why island dwarf phenotypes appear so commonly in nature. Final phases of work and associated publications based on this award are nearing completion, and this work is expected to yield a number of impactful conclusions with broad biological relevance.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/09/2017<br>      Modified by: Daren&nbsp;Card</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501747/1501747_10354421_1499630725584_IMG_2533--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501747/1501747_10354421_1499630725584_IMG_2533--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Co-PI Card with Boa"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501747/1501747_10354421_1499630725584_IMG_2533--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Co-PI Card with Boa"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Co-PI Card holding a island dwarf boa from Cayos Cochinos, Honduras.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Daren Card/Blair Perry</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daren&nbsp;Card</div> <div class="imageTitle">Co-PI Card with Boa</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501747/1501747_10354421_1499630815146_IMG_2398--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501747/1501747_10354421_1499630815146_IMG_2398--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Arboreal island dwarf Boa"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501747/1501747_10354421_1499630815146_IMG_2398--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Arboreal island dwarf Boa"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Arboreal island dwarf Boa from Cayos Cochinos, Honduras.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Daren Card/Blair Perry</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daren&nbsp;Card</div> <div class="imageTitle">Arboreal island dwarf Boa</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501747/1501747_10354421_1499630910169_IMG_2443--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501747/1501747_10354421_1499630910169_IMG_2443--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cayos Cochinos island dwarf Boa"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501747/1501747_10354421_1499630910169_IMG_2443--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cayos Cochinos island dwarf Boa"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Island dwarf Boa from Cayos Cochinos, Honduras, the subject of this NSF Award.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Daren Card/Blair Perry</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daren&nbsp;Card</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cayos Cochinos island dwarf Boa</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
