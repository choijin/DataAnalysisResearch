<AbstractNarration>Macromolecular crystallographers visualize in extraordinary detail the large molecules needed for life, using X-ray diffraction analysis of crystals of these molecules to determine the locations of each atom in three dimensions, thereby describing the entire structure of the macromolecule. However, sometimes the crystals do not form in a way that permits accurate X-ray diffraction and analysis. The analytical tools to deal with this problem, when it happens, have not yet been developed, and the goal of this research project is to provide the methods and computer software needed to study the atomic structure of protein crystals of this nature. This method will computationally add another (4th) dimension to the structural analysis permitting "superstructures" of the molecule to be defined. This highly innovative project will open the field, permitting others to complete difficult but important multidimensional crystallography projects. This research will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students including members of groups underrepresented in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes activities that will be beneficial to many areas of the biological sciences including macromolecular crystallography, cell biology and DNA repair. The project is focused on the structure determination of incommensurately modulated protein crystals. The unique diffraction patterns from modulated crystals contain "off-lattice" satellite reflections next to the main reflections. The intellectual merits of the proposed activity are multifold. The first incommensurately modulated protein crystal structures will be solved and advances will be made to the methodology of macromolecular crystallography. The main objective of this research is to develop new macromolecular X-ray crystallographic software for the refinement of incommensurately modulated crystals in superspace and to apply them to solve several crystal structures that currently cannot be solved. The methods employed include protein crystal growth,  X-ray diffraction data collection and structure determination. Innovative approaches to protein crystallography and software development will be used. Activities will include extensive modification of crystallography software for the determination of macromolecular structures in superspace using modulation functions. Simulated data will be used as a test case. Then the algorithms will be applied to well characterized incommensurately modulated crystals of profilin:actin, UvsY recombination mediator crystals and then to many other unsolved modulated crystals. The resulting continuum of structures within each crystal will be analyzed within the framework of the current biological/biochemical literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported jointly by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Division of Biological Infrastructure in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Crystals are composed of three-dimensional repeating unit cells (Fig.1).  The unit cell is composed of a single atom up to thousands of atoms.  When an x-ray beam passes through a crystal, the beam is diffracted, creating reflections that can be measured (Fig. 2).  The spacing of the reflections from this diffraction pattern is related to the unit cell dimensions and the crystal's orientation to the beam.  It is possible to stress the structure of a crystal, which causes a secondary periodic modulation to overlay the crystal lattice.  When this occurs, weaker observed satellite reflections appear between the original main reflections (Fig. 3).  When the modulation wavelength is equal to an integral number of unit cells, the modulation is commensurate (Fig. 1) and solved using a supercell expansion where the new unit cell is a multiple of one or more directions of the original unit cell.  When the modulation is irrational, the modulation is incommensurate (Fig. 1), and no supercell expansion exists.  The spacing between the main and satellite reflections determines whether the modulation is commensurate or incommensurate (Fig. 3).  The purpose of this grant was to develop approaches to solve incommensurately modulated protein crystals.  In the late 70s, Janner &amp; Janssen developed a theory that described modulations in crystals using higher-dimensional superspace (more than three dimensions) (Fig.4).  This theory has been successfully applied to incommensurately modulated small-molecule crystals using Jana Software.  Profilin:Actin (PA) complex crystals are an incommensurately modulated protein example.  We planned to adapt Jana approaches to protein refinement packages to solve the PA complex.  Over the grant's length, we worked with Vaclav Petricik (Czech Acadamey of Sciences, JANA) and Garib Murshudov (Cambridge University, UK, REFMAC) to work on the refinement of the PA data.  We developed a simulated dataset to test refinement ideas.  The simulated dataset allowed for the comparison of the refined answer to the known correct answer.  An interesting outcome of that work was that refinements would often converge to a result that was 180 degrees out of phase with the right answer.  Our sample's 3D space group did not allow such a case; however, the 4D space group did allow a 180 degree out of phase option.  In some refinements, there was evidence in the convergence where part of the supercell was refined correctly. In contrast, the other part refined out of phase with discontinuities resulting when the two solutions intersected in the supercell.  The solution to the problem was to add a little noise to the starting model, causing the refinement to converge on only one answer.  The approach for the PA data was to use a commensurate approximate.  The irrational periodic modulation was rationalized so that a supercell could be used to refine the data.  The simulated data indicated that this would provide reasonable refinements as long as the rationalization was near (&lt;5%) the irrational value.  The PA data is challenging because it had systematic absences (many satellites with a value of zero for the supercell approximation) between the main reflections and a small number of satellite reflections with observed values. Refining the data as a supercell resulted in models that had reasonable statistics and density (Fig. 5). Still, evaluating those solutions in superspace showed displacements that were not as smooth as expected from the experimentally observed first-order satellites.  The next approach was to apply real space restraints to the refinement.  MATLAB scripts forced the atoms to follow sine waves every several cycles of refinement.  The modulation functions were smoother but had worse density and statistics.  The restraints were possibly too restrictive and caused the solution to converge in a local minimum.  Reciprocal space constraints were implemented by forcing the systematic absences to zero.  SFTOOLS was modified to mask systematically absent reflections.  The result was good density and smooth modulations, but the statistics were worse.  The inclusion of the zero reflections in the statistics was partially responsible for the worse values.  While we were struggling with the PA data, two commensurate supercell structures (PDB 4N3E and PDB 6SJJ) of the same protein were published, allowing us to apply the tools we had developed to analyze the PA data.  The analysis showed that both structures (7x and 9x supercells) were nearly identical in superspace (Fig. 6) with the 7x to 9x transition related to a small 1-degree shift of the modulation in 4D space.  The results were published in several publications and presented to colleagues at international conferences.  Our lab website (http://sbl.unmc.edu) contains more details about our work on modulated crystallography.       Last Modified: 10/21/2020       Submitted by: Gloria E Borgstahl]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
