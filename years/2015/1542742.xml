<AbstractNarration>This project supports the 2015 Rustbelt RNA Meeting , which will be held in Huron/Sandusky, OH on October 23-24, 2015. A combination of posters and oral presentations will promote sharing of new research and techniques that will aid the study of RNA, one of the main forms of genetic material that encodes information about all living organisms. The meeting will provide an interdisciplinary experience by bringing together researchers investigating biological and chemical aspects of RNA structure and function.  A highlight of the meeting will be the opportunity for early-career scientists to network with current leaders in the RNA field; such interactions often serve as the foundation for future collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rustbelt RNA Meeting will feature a keynote address by a leader in the field, posters, and oral presentations. Presentations will cover topics including long non-coding RNAs, tRNA modification, and RNA structure-function studies and will include discussion of various computational, biophysical, and cellular methods being used to study RNA. This conference is notable for its focus on inclusion of students and post-doctoral scholars, as approximately 90% of the research presented will come from these groups of early-career scientists.</AbstractNarration>
