<AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project engages in on-site field work in India to examine the shift in the labor force for information and communication technology (ICT) from urban centers to rural villages, poor communities, and prisons.  The PI will conduct 100 interviews with workers at a rural unit, RuralShores, in four states, and she will engage in ethnographic observations at a prison, Cherlapalli Jail in Andhra Pradesh, which is the home to India's first global outsourcing center of this kind. The goal of this project is to shed light on the societal implications of this shift, which are far from clear. On the one hand, Indian firms are able to offer job opportunities to groups that have been traditionally excluded from technologically-based employment. On the other, these jobs pay wages far less than ICT outsourcing jobs in urban areas, and are less likely to be protected by state labor regulations or represented by unions. Three factors will be the focus for determining the viability of this shift: transferring technical skills to marginal workers, providing supports for social mobility, and upholding data security in the process. Results will have broader impacts on policy discussions of poverty alleviation, representations of rural and female workers in STEM occupations, and international regulation of data crimes and cyber security.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the theoretical level, this project will serve to adjudicate between competing notions within Science and Technology Studies of what ICT means for marginalized workers in the global south. Affirmation of propositions from modernization theory would indicate that sub-sourcing of ICT labor to places like villages in India has indeed provided mobility avenues out of poverty for the rural poor through technical training.  Alternatively, positive results for a post-colonial computing framework would suggest that sub-sourcing of ICT labor does not in fact represent a viable platform for long-term employment, but instead a re-segregation of the poor in villages; hence, solidifying the digital divide along geographic lines.  In addition, findings on data security will indicate what kinds of threats these rural and prison business outsource processors pose to information systems, and whether the stereotypes surrounding these workers as unsafe are upheld by the evidence.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focuses on labor for the information economy that is happening in unlikely places &ndash; the villages, wheat and sugar cane fields, and prisons of India.  Here we find newly installed ICT outsourcing centers for data processing and customer service.  They are part of a trend of "social enterprises," offered as a solution to unemployment.  These centers receive data from Europe and the US (on package tracking, sales invoices, human resources, etc.), and then transform, input, and transmit it back.  Until recently, the ICT industry has been concentrated in the techno-hubs of India (Gurgaon, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, etc.).  Now it is moving into village areas and marginalized sectors.  In these locations, the work is broken down into simpler tasks, but still directly connected to global information systems, and done in real time. This project explores why, how, and with what implications there has been a downward pressure of labor recruitment within the info-society in the last decade.   There are many questions about what these new jobs mean for the lowest skilled and marginalized workers in the global south.  Some positions are more optimistic, suggesting that sub-sourcing of ICT labor to remote places in India will create mobility out of poverty through technical training.  Critical perspectives maintain that these trends represent a continuation or adaptation of historic transnational labor hierarchies, and the creation of a technical underclass.  Theoretically, this project reflects on competing notions within Science and Technology Studies, as the employment base of digital capitalism branches into countries like India.  It investigates whether or not the sophisticated technology of the outsourcing industry has yielded its promises, as suggested by many scholars and policy experts.   Data collection for the project involves ethnographic fieldwork of India?s rural and prison sourcing of labor.  Interviews and observations were conducted at outsourced data centers in villages across three states (Rajasthan, Maharastra, and Karnataka), and at a prison in Andhra Pradesh (the first of its kind in India).   The analysis highlights the complexity of these trends.  The new outsourcing centers represent meeting points of many things that are thought be separate:  of rural and urban spheres, of information, consumption and agricultural industries, of old and new technologies, of technical and non-technical labor.  They also reveal contradictions embedded in this new labor sector:  How it recruits the most remote and confined workers, but into tasks that are at the center of informational infrastructures for logistics and service.  How it raises expectations and technical skills for marginalized workers, but denies them viable options for long-term careers in ICT industries.  How it draws on workers who are often suspect (villagers, prisoners), but at the same time reveals little evidence of data crimes, relative to the organized rings occurring in the techno-hubs.    These nuanced contexts and connections problematize the binary divisions that underpin many discussions of informational labor, automation, and technology in the global south.  Results have broader impacts on policy discussions of the digital divide, poverty alleviation, rural and female workers in STEM occupations, the future of work, and data security.
