<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the 24th International Meshing Roundtable (IMR) on October 11-14, 2015 in Austin, TX.  Meshing is the decomposition of complex objects into simple parts for design, display, and analysis.  As technologies change in computing and computer-aided design and manufacturing the demand for meshing seems only to increase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IMR conference includes four short courses, four invited speakers, and presentations of reviewed papers, research notes, and posters, and a professional development session particularly targetting students and postdocs. This award will support registration and some travel expenses for a dozen students (undergraduate to postdoctoral, coming from U.S. universities, national labs, or non-profit research organizations) to exchange ideas with experts from around the world, fostering collaboration and recognition that can help them launch their careers.
