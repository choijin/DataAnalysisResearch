<AbstractNarration>The ability of cells to monitor the environment and adjust their structure and function in order to best maintain all of the physiological properties that support their existence (homeostasis) is a fundamental property of all biological systems. Cells in animal nervous systems are no exception; they need to constantly change their signaling connections with other cells (synapses) in brain circuits in response to both normal environmental changes and to physiological challenges such as toxins, so that brain function can be homeostatically maintained within a physiologically appropriate range. However, we currently have a very poor understanding of the basic biological mechanisms underlying the homeostatic regulation of cell-to-cell communication that affects brain circuitry. This project uses genetic tools uniquely available in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster together with electrical recordings, biochemical techniques, synapse imaging by microscopy, and drug manipulations to understand how a newly-identified molecular factor in fruitfly muscles (called Heartless/Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor tyrosine kinase [Htl/FGFR]) homeostatically controls the level of activity in the motor nerve cells that cause these same muscles to contract. This research will precisely elucidate what causes this muscle-specific molecule to become biologically active, and how it signals its activity backwards in this circuit to affect the activity of the nerve cells that control muscles. This research plan also integrates a variety of educational activities at multiple levels, including: 1) an ongoing research and educational collaboration with a faculty member at a nearby primarily undergraduate institution (PUI); 2) a yearly three-day summer workshop designed by the principal investigator (PI) to expand neuroscience research resources for PUIs; 3) K-12 STEM public outreach in Iowa through tours of the PI's lab and school visits by the PI and his graduate students; and 4) long- and short-term research opportunities for undergraduates, including underrepresented minority students enrolled in programs such as the SROP/McNair Scholars Program at the University of Iowa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity direct synapses and circuits to maintain normal ranges of output, despite the perturbations they may experience throughout life. A significant unknown is the molecular underpinning of the homeostatic regulation of synapse function. The PI's lab addresses this problem utilizing the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model. At the NMJ, impaired muscle excitability is corrected by offsetting, homeostatic increases in presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Precisely how the muscle communicates a need for increased neurotransmitter release is not understood. Similar forms of regulation have been found in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems, and they are not understood either. Using Drosophila genetics and electrophysiology, the PI's lab has identified new molecules that illuminate signaling events controlling synaptic homeostasis. One molecule forms the basis for this project, a Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase. Data from the lab support muscle-specific roles for FGFR. The central hypothesis is that muscle-derived FGFR activity tunes synaptic strength by mediating both anterograde (nerve-to-muscle) and retrograde (muscle-to-nerve) cell-cell signals. There are two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the molecular signals in the muscle triggered by FGFR during the execution of homeostatic compensation. This aim includes experiments that will identify direct targets, as well as the retrograde signal(s) activated by those targets. Aim 2 will determine how homeostatic FGFR signaling is activated and regulated. Both aims will employ a combination of electrophysiology, biochemistry, synapse imaging, and pharmacology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Background and Scientific Problem  Homeostasis is a fundamental property of all biological systems. It refers to how cells maintain physiologically appropriate levels of activity, in spite of environmental perturbations. Cells in nervous systems are no exception; neurons constantly need to change properties of their signaling connections with other cells at synapses in response to both normal environmental changes and to physiological challenges such as toxins. In this way, neuronal activity can be maintained within physiologically appropriate ranges. This phenomenon is referred to synaptic homeostasis.  Scientific Problem:At present, there is not a good understanding of the basic biological mechanisms underlying the homeostatic regulation of cell-to-cell communication that affects neurons, synapses, and brain circuitry.  Intellectual Merit  The goal of this project was to use genetic tools uniquely available for research in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to understand how synapses maintain stable properties. At the start of the project, the PI and the lab discovered that a molecule in Drosophila called Heartless (Htl) is needed in muscles to maintain homeostasis of the neuromuscular junction synapse. Htl is a type of molecule called a Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR). The finding that Htl has a function in synaptic homeostasis was surprising because FGFR molecules are classically known to govern early events in organismal development.  There were two aims of the grant. Aim 1 was to determine the molecular signals in the muscle triggered by FGFR during the execution of homeostatic compensation, including muscle-to-nerve signals. Aim 2 was to determine how homeostatic FGFR signaling is activated and regulated. Both employed a combination of electrophysiology, biochemistry, synapse imaging, and pharmacology. A project like this is potentially impactful for several reasons.  1) Although FGFR activity has been described in other contexts, there is almost no molecular understanding about how it might impact homeostatic plasticity.  2) Given existing parallels between vertebrate and invertebrate models of homeostatic synaptic plasticity, new Drosophila findings could have a major impact.  3) Drosophila genes previously implicated in homeostatic include many that have human homologs with roles in neurological stability, such as CaV2.1/cacophony. Neurological instability may be exacerbated by defects in homeostatic plasticity.  Intellectual Merit Outcomes  The work for this project resulted in several major findings. Several manuscripts have resulted from this work:  1) Htl/FGFR is activated by classical fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligands to execute a long-term expression of homeostatic plasticity in the muscle.  2) Htl/FGFR signals through a linear pathway that includes Src family kinase members like Drosophila Src64B, as well as molecules classically linked to growth and nutrition like Target of Rapamycin (TOR).  3) The chronic, days-long maintenance of homeostatic plasticity is a reversible process. An active area of follow-up research in the lab is to test if Htl/FGFR activity is reversible (and on what timescale).  4) The long-term maintenance of homeostatic plasticity is completely separable from its short-term induction process, both by genetics and pharmacology,  5) A method to challenge neuromuscular synapse function on a timescale of hours was developed in the lab. This allows the lab (and other labs in the field) to delineate the activity time frame of ~ 40 homeostatic signaling molecules, including Htl/FGFR.  Broader Impacts  At the outset of the project, the PI outlined detailed plans to integrate the research with several long-term broader impact goals in research and education:  1) To expand neuroscience research resources for primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs).  2) To conduct K-12 STEM public outreach in Iowa through tours of the lab and school visits by the PI and his graduate students.  3) To facilitate long- and short-term research opportunities for undergraduates.  Broader Impacts Outcomes  The PI and the lab were successful at implementing a multi-faceted STEM education plan that integrated with the research plan and comported nicely with each Broader Impacts goal.  1) On a yearly basis, The PI hosted approximately 10 lab tours in collaboration with the University of Iowa (UI) Carver College of Medicine's STEM Education office. This effort was highly successful because the fruit fly-based research in the lab is accessible during STEM outreach.  2) Approximately 10 undergraduates have conducted research or support in the lab during the project period. Several have gone on to pursue graduate research or medical training.  3) The PI chairs the Neuroscience Admissions Committee at the University of Iowa. In this capacity, the PI has conducted STEM outreach efforts, including attending conferences for underrepresented minority students interested in graduate school.  4) The PI has provided opportunities for lab members to mentor others, both in the context of the lab at Iowa and in the context of a summer lab class taught by the PI.  5) The PI has coordinated with area faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions to share Drosophila research resources and to focus on research and education.
