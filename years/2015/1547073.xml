<AbstractNarration>Orthoses are assistive devices for people with disabilities.  It has been shown that custom orthoses with personalized fits are more effective than their off-the-shelf counterparts.  However, the manufacture of custom orthoses currently relies on the traditional plaster molding method, a technique with limited accuracy and long delivery times. These concerns can be overcome by integrating additive manufacturing into a cybermanufacturing system, enabling same-day or next-day delivery and improving the fit and quality of custom orthoses.  This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will broadly engage computer science students in Software Engineering, an undergraduate capstone course. Students from this class will be recruited to further develop the cybermanufacturing service system they work on during the course.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to investigate the fundamental requirements for a cybermanufacturing system for custom orthoses. A cyber data and design center outfitted with a software suite will automate the design, manufacturing, and interactive verification with clinicians for personalized orthoses.  An industrial collaborator will advise on software development to address the need of scalability in future full-scale implementation.  An innovative wavy porous structure will be implemented to optimize the production time, strength, weight, and delivery time for additive manufacturing.  The shape mismatch between orthosis and the human subject will be determined to calculate to improve the fit and patient comfort.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project integrates an Internet-based design software for the design and manufacturing of custom assistive devices.  This software system is evaluated at the University of Michigan (U-M) Orthotics and Prosthetic Center (OPC) for the ankle foot orthosis (AFO) to demonstrate the concept.  Assistive devices provide the critical support required to overcome physical limitations.  Custom assistive devices with personalized fit and comfort are more effective in treatment.  However, the current manufacturing practice for custom assistive device is mostly based on the traditional plaster molding method and has a long delivery time.  Together with 3D-printing, the Internet-based design software in this project is an essential tool to upgrade the manufacturing practice for custom assistive devices.      AFO was selected as the target assistive device because it has the largest revenue among all types of assistive devices at U-M OPC and most other clinical operations in the US.  AFO is common for patients who have the drop foot symptoms due to stroke, diabetic neuropathy, cerebral palsy, and others diseases.  A new type of AFO suitable for the Internet-based design and 3D-printing was discovered in this project.       The Internet-based design and 3D-printing manufacturing system benefits patients, clinics, and society.  For patients, the new type of AFO has quick delivery time and is durable, cost-effective, and reconfigurable for a patient?s personal and changing needs, including the adjustment of shape and dynamic response.  For clinics, this manufacturing system can enable One-Day Visit, wherein diagnosis, design, manufacturing, and evaluation of the AFO can be completed within the same day of visit to the clinic.  This can save the operation costs for clinics.  For the society, One-Day Visit can greatly improve the quality of care for patients and caregivers, particularly in rural areas or with difficulties travelling (e.g. homebound).      This project has close partnership between Computer Science and Manufacturing.  Student teams in Computer Science senior capstone design course worked on manufacturing projects and mentored by clinicians at U-M OPC to develop the software for Internet-based design and 3D-printing of AFOs and other assistive devices.
