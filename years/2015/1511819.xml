<AbstractNarration>Flaherty, 1511819&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global energy consumption will increase dramatically in the next several decades, thus stimulating demand for fuels and chemicals produced from renewable sources such as biomass.  While the processes for converting biomass to chemicals such as ethanol are well-known, the further processing of those fermentation products to the larger molecules that make up fuels and chemicals is presently inefficient and not well understood.  This project will investigate new combinations of catalytic materials specifically designed to promote the coupling of fermentation products into diesel fuel, lubricants and chemical feedstocks.  By understanding the detailed catalytic chemistry and its relationship to the structure and composition of the catalytic materials, the research will lay the groundwork for a new class of catalyst materials that can convert fermentation products into higher-value products both more efficiently and with significant energy savings compared to existing processes.  The work will also provide opportunities for the training of both graduate students and undergraduates in science, technology, and engineering, with special emphasis on providing opportunities to female students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most biomass upgrading processes rely on acidic catalysts.  Basic catalysts have generally been avoided because of poisoning by water and carbon dioxide associated with fermentation processes.  These researchers have recognized an opportunity to combine both acidic and basic catalytic functions into a single catalyst in a way that promotes aldol type condensation (i.e. chain growth) reactions without the usual poisoning effects.  They will do this by investigating more than 25 technologically relevant catalysts containing a range of acid sites, base sites, and acid-base site pairs.  Using a combination of experimental tools, they will characterize the number and strength of acid, base, and acid-base pair sites and then relate alcohol and aldehyde adsorption on those sites to detailed aldol condensation kinetics and identification of critical transition states.  The broader scientific impact of this work will be to produce guiding principles for the design of more active and stable catalysts for the production of carbon-neutral biofuels and chemicals.  In addition, the principal investigator is building an undergraduate research program that focuses on developing graduate-student female mentors to work with undergraduate mentees in the STEM areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Increasing population and pressing environmental concerns makes the conversion of biorenewable resources to fuels and consumer goods an important challenge.  One method for doing so involves the fermentation of sugars (e.g., glucose, fructose or sucrose) obtained from biomass sources can be used to provide ethanol or other small alcohols, albeit with much lower efficiencies.  This process is successful, and the supply of ethanol surpasses its current demand as a fuel or fuel additive.  Therefore, our lab and others explore strategies to upgrade ethanol and other small alcohols via known reactions (e.g., Guerbet, and aldol condensation chemistries) into larger molecules that are useful chemical intermediates and fuels.   We have worked to map complex sets of reactions that occur simultaneously on relevant catalysts and to design and synthesize more productive inexpensive catalytic materials for the most critical steps in these networks. Specifically, we focused on titania (a common and environmentally benign material) and related mesoporous and microporous metal oxides such as titanium, niobium, and tantalum containing zeolites.  The manner by which these catalysts formed new bonds between the reactant molecules (i.e., condensation reactions) was not clear upon the onset of this project, and consequently, more productive catalysts could not be designed intentionally.  On the materials studied, we determined that these reactions occur by sequential dehydrogenation, condensation, and hydrogenation steps.  The condensation reaction, and more specifically the deprotonation of an aldehyde intermediate (on zeolites) and the nucleophilic attach to an aldehyde (on mesoporous titania) determine the rates for C-C bond formation.  We showed that the reasons for these differences arise due to the low densities of reactive species on mesoporous titania surfaces &ndash; in short &ndash; the reactive intermediates have a low probability of being located within the short distances needed to form new C-C bonds.  Metal substituted zeolites (specifically, Ti-, Nb-, and Ta-BEA) circumvent this challenge because they expose cationic metal sites that can simultaneously bind both reactive species needed for nucleophilic attack. As a result, the rates for ethanol upgrading increase and are limited primarily the rates for aldehyde deprotonation.   The identify of the metal substituent plays an important role because it determines the effective strengths of the acid and conjugate base site that catalyze deprotonation. Consequently, rates between Ti-, Nb-, and Ta-BEA catalysts differ significantly/  We further determined that effectiveness of these zeolite catalysts could be affected by carefully controlling the density of defects in their crystalline structure during synthesis.  Point defects and vacancies lead to the presence of polar surface functions (i.e., silanol groups) that hydrogen bond to reactants and change the local concentrations and activities of important intermediates near active sites. These changes have a dramatic effect on product selectivities. Materials with many defects lead to the formation of larger amounts of esters - an unstable and undesirable class of molecules that can corrode engines and equipment.  By synthesizing catalysts with very low defect densities, we significantly increased the selectivities towards the desired longer chain alcohols, such as butanol, that can be used as fuels.  We anticipate that these materials will be useful also for liquid-phase catalytic reactions where their ability to stabilize or destabilize selected molecules through their hydrogen bonding properties will provide a basis for more complex and useful reactions that may provide pathways to renewable chemicals to replace petroleum derivatives.
