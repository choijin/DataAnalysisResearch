<AbstractNarration>It's About Time publishers in collaboration with the University of Colorado at Boulder develop and test a cyberlearning professional-development model that builds on the successful Curriculum Customization Service model implemented in Denver with EarthComm.  The cyberlearning system is tested with the Project Based Inquiry Science (PBIS) curriculum - a proven comprehensive middle school science curriculum.  In the first two years, six unit-specific materials, curriculum implementation webinars, electronic teacher editions, and teacher planning guide software are developed with teacher input and tested.  In the third year, forty middle school teachers nationwide use the cyberlearning system.  The learning of their students is compared to students of teachers who had other professional development.  The cyberlearning system is evaluated for scalability, affordability, flexibility, and effectiveness for changing teacher practice and student learning.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first two years ethnographic studies done by WestEd inform the project about how teachers use the cyberlearning system and which parts are most efficacious.  At the same time WestEd collects data of student learning and classroom practice from teachers who have had traditional professional development offered by the publishers.  At the same time, data are gathered about student learning in classes whose teachers receive traditional professional development.  These teachers form a matched control group for the teachers engaged in cyberlearning professional development in the third year.  Their student learning data are compared to the learning of students whose teachers are engaged in the cyberlearning professional development.  The research is evaluated by three members of the Advisory Board who have credentials in research methodology, content and broadening participation.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective implementation of reform-based STEM curricula depends upon curriculum-based, consistent and well developed professional development.  Scaling-up to a broad-based national market is logistically constrained by traditional face-to-face professional development.  The project will lead to a tested, useful, affordable, and effective system on-line system to support teacher implementation of reform science curricula that will be used by It's About Time publishers and will be available to others.  The results disseminated in the research and practitioner literature can transform the professional development provided by publishers of reform science materials.</AbstractNarration>

There is usually a very short supply of experienced workshop leaders with the expertise in a specific program and the pedagogy being adopted. Therefore staffing and delivery of effective workshops, at scale, becomes difficult.  Affordability. The workshop-based, face-to-face professional-development needed in order to successfully begin and then sustain an implementation is very expensive. Many school budgets cannot afford to support that level of professional development over the several years necessary for a successful implementation.  Flexibility. Workshop-based PD is usually offered during the first year of adoption and not throughout the five- to seven-year implementation cycle. Teachers hired or transferred after the initial implementation phases are neglected in professional-development support.

Additionally, teachers need different types of professional development depending on their knowledge and experience, including their experience teaching, their content knowledge and classroom management skills, and their understanding of an instructional model with new pedagogical methodologies.  Through the CyberPD environment, the delivery of teacher-guide materials and other teacher resources, such as professional development videos, has changed from print to digital format making it much more convenient for teachers to transport and access a large amount information in a just-in-time fashion. Included also is a journaling feature that is intricately connected to any given student page and provides teachers an opportunity to store their own thoughts and reflections, and other relevant data, digitally.   The PBIS CyberPD System was developed for Project Based Inquiry Science (PSIS) and is a curriculum-centric professional-development platform, but the platform and system can be used for any innovative research-based curriculum that requires extensive and ongoing professional development support to implement with fidelity.  The developed platform is now also being successfully utilized as the cyber professional development support for two additional innovative research-based programs: Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP), a problem-based high school Math curriculum; and, for NextGenPET and PSET, two college-based Physics and Physical Science courses for elementary teachers.  Project-based learning incorporates 21st century skills such as critical thinking, collaboration, and problem solving into student learning that ensures greater student engagement. PBIS students become better prepared for the workforce and college, as well as better prepared in general to become well-informed citizens. The projects in PBIS were selected to help students engage productively in public discourse. However, the transition to project-based learning is often difficult and requires significant professional development and support for teachers. The CyberPD System has had a significant impact in helping teachers make the transition to this new way of teaching and therefore consequently helps to support national efforts to create a STEM-literate citizenry.
