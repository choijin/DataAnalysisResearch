<AbstractNarration>With this award supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) and EPSCoR programs, Northern Kentucky University (NKU) will acquire a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy capability (SEM/EDX). A scanning electron microscope probes the surfaces of materials with a beam of electrons impinging on a sample. The resultant micrograph (picture) produced from the electrons scattering from the surface provides information on the structure and morphology of the material. The EDX accessory provides information on the elemental composition of the material. This provides insight on the microscopic and macroscopic properties and characteristics of a substance. This acquisition will provide training to students in the use of this important analytical tool. It will be used by students in the chemistry and biological sciences undergraduate research programs at NKU and by women and underrepresented high school students at Nanoscience Summer Camps. It will be employed in several laboratory courses providing training to large numbers of undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will be employed in research in areas including: a) development of a biocompatible drug delivery device; b) investigation of in-vivo local detection platforms to understand the metabolic pathway of thyroid hormones in relation to ancillary endocrine disorders; (c) investigation of fullerene-TM polymeric systems and their optical and physical properties; and (d) investigation of digestive physiology of embryonic anurans with the aim of carrying out microelectrode fabrication.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award focused on the acquisition of a "tabletop" SEM with EDX capabilities. While the institution has a "large" SEM, the high learning curve and limited access made it difficult to use in undergraduate research and in outreach activities. The new SEM is easy to use and accessible for these applications. The instrument was used in our department instrumental analysis course (CHE 350L) where students imaged carbon nanotubes, electrical solder, a computer memory chip, an automobile brake pad, and a subway coin.

The new SEM figured prominently in some of these projects. The instrument was also involved in undergraduate research projects, including those associated with modified clay structures and "smart" polymer scaffold structures that are involved in heavy metal and wastewater/pollutant remediation. While these research activities are in their initial phases with results to come after the award period (partly due to the turnover of research faculty during the award period), the instrument does open up new experimental opportunities at our institution.
