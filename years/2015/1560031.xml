<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site for Solar Energy and Photovoltaics Research is hosted by Arizona State University (ASU) using the facilities of the NSF/DOE jointly funded Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technologies (QESST) Engineering Research Center (ERC).  The challenge of sustainability meeting the world's energy demand-the "terawatt challenge"-has been described as the defining challenge of this generation.  Many of the most pressing world issues today are fundamentally intertwined with energy, ranging from climate change to poverty.  Photovoltaic (PV) devices are the most promising sustainable energy source, and have made the transition from lab to fab in the past decade.  Provided that the PV industry maintains its present growth rates, it can provide all of the new electricity required by the world within a decade, and it can meet the world's total energy demand by 2050.  However, motivated and innovative engineers in both academia and industry are needed to achieve this goal.  The aim of the REU Site is for undergraduate students to be introduced to research generally and solar research specifically, to experience how the course work they are studying can be put into practice to tackle the terawatt challenge, and to practice how the principles of scientific research can be applied to any engineering challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in solar research during a 9-week summer program, on topics that range from fundamental (e.g., new growth methods for the active layers in III-V multi-junction solar cells) to applied (e.g., degradation mechanisms in silicon modules in the field). Participants in the REU program will be immersed in this intellectual melting pot of ongoing solar research, both strengthening existing projects (e.g., high-mobility transparent conductive oxides) and being involved in the initiation of others (e.g., silicon-based tandem solar cells). The REU projects will be designed to cross traditional disciplinary boundaries-as photovoltaic research is apt to do-synergistically combining device physics, materials science, chemistry, electrical engineering, and sustainability. The REU students' laboratory experience will be enhanced by seminars and workshops that provide them with access to experts in a wide range of fields including PV research and development, the social science of energy usage, sustainability, and the solar energy industry.  The program will also include a number of social activities designed to encourage formal and informal communication skills, collaborative problem solving and teamwork with colleagues from diverse cultural, geographic, and demographic backgrounds. Each student will travel to one conference or workshop to present his or her work. The REU will recruit heavily from the network of QESST partner institutions, most of which have substantial populations of students that are under-represented in engineering. Through research that crosses disciplinary boundaries and a diverse base of mentors, this REU Site will retain students of all backgrounds in engineering as they pursue advanced degrees and careers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The aim of this REU program was for undergraduate students to be introduced to research generally and solar research specifically, to experience how their coursework can be put to use to tackle the energy challenge, and to practice how the principles of scientific research can be applied to any engineering challenge. The program attracted students who were both passionate about photovoltaics and were from underrepresented groups in STEM, thereby broadening participation both in academic research and solar engineering. The successful applicants were immersed in an intensive 9-week authentic research experience where they learned how to process standard solar cells as a cohort (as shown in Fig. 1) and then worked in pairs with a graduate student mentor to make advances at the forefront of photovoltaics research.</p> <p>Over 4 summers from 2016 to 2019, a total of 19 female and 15 male participants completed the program. They had diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, disciplines, education levels, and home institutions. Each cohort had 9 or 10 participants, except in 2019, which had only&nbsp;5 as the program was brought to a close. In addition to their immediate cohort, the REU participants worked alongside 6-8 RETs (middle and high school teachers), 2-3 young scholars (high school students), 2-5 participants from the Nanostructures Collaborative Infrastructure ? Southwest (NCIS) REU program and 1-3 PhD candidates. Learning to work with others and communicate their own work to a broad range of people was a key component of this REU program.</p> <p>While the general structure of the program was developed during the grant proposal stage, a valuable addition occurred in 2017 when the Education Director for the Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technology (QESST) Engineering Research Center, Michelle Jordan, and four of her PhD students developed a model of engineering research?which is shown in Fig. 2?and implemented a program of research to leverage the program to determine how communities of practice foster modes of belonging in engineering research. A conference paper on this topic was published in the 2019&nbsp;ASEE Conference proceedings. A second paper, detailing several case studies from the 2017 cohort, is currently being prepared. In addition to forming the basis for these publications,&nbsp;the engineering model itself was used extensively for the remainder of the program to guide PhD student mentorship and to scaffold mentees' knowledge, practice, and reflection, particularly with respect to learning to communicate about their own work.</p> <p>Qualitative analysis and social network analysis of data involving REU participants indicated that including diverse cohort members, such as high school students and K-12 teachers, in an REU can provide opportunities to garner social support for managing uncertainty, and that interactions with older REU colleagues can foster agentive engineering action for middle and high school participants. In addition to participating in engineering research projects and communicating their work to other engineers and industry members, REU participants communicated with the public about solar energy topics, thereby expanding their engineering communication capacity.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the end of each summer, all REU participants presented their work at&nbsp;the QESST REU Annual Poster Show (Fig. 3), which brought together REU participants from the eight QESST partner universities and was well attended by faculty, graduate students, and representatives from companies, including QESST industry partners. REU participants were also offered the opportunity to attend a conference or workshop of their choice later in the year or early the following year. A total of 23 of the 34 participants presented their work at an additional conference: 5 at the Arizona Student Energy Conference (AZSEC) in Flagstaff in October 2016, 2 at AZSEC in Phoenix in October 2017, 6 at the Materials Research Society (MRS) meeting in Phoenix in April 2018, 2 at the NREL Silicon Workshop in Colorado in August 2018, 2 at AZSEC in Tucson in November 2018, 1 at MRS in Phoenix in April 2019, and 5 at AZSEC in Tucson in November 2019.</p> <p>The REU students' research also contributed to several conference proceedings and journal publications, and four participants from two project teams were coauthors of conference publications. Examples of notable results include excellent mobilities&nbsp;in transparent conductive oxide films, an improved understanding of band-bending in CdTe solar cells, application of a new and superior method to measure the contact resistivity in silicon heterojunction solar cells, and correlation of the photoluminescence and band bending in perovskite solar cells with various contacting schemes.</p> <p>After participating in the program, 70% of the 10 participants that were enrolled in community college transitioned to four-year institutions. 20% of the 24 REU participants that were undergraduates have gone on to graduate school (so far), 25% have yet to graduate, 17% have just graduated, and 13% are employed in STEM occupations. These statistics are in keeping with the goals of the program to broaden participation in advanced solar research and science and engineering graduate work generally.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/19/2020<br>      Modified by: Zachary&nbsp;C&nbsp;Holman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560031/1560031_10415403_1592543027920_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560031/1560031_10415403_1592543027920_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560031/1560031_10415403_1592543027920_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU students in the lab during Solar Cells 101 in 2016.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kate Fisher</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zachary&nbsp;C&nbsp;Holman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560031/1560031_10415403_1592543075696_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560031/1560031_10415403_1592543075696_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560031/1560031_10415403_1592543075696_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Engineering research model.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michelle Jordan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zachary&nbsp;C&nbsp;Holman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560031/1560031_10415403_1592543137033_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560031/1560031_10415403_1592543137033_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560031/1560031_10415403_1592543137033_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU participants presenting at the QESST REU Annual Poster show in 2017.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zachary Holman</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zachary&nbsp;C&nbsp;Holman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
