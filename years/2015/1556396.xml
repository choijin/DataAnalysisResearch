<AbstractNarration>Part 1:     How animals survive and prosper under changing environmental conditions depends on both their physiological responses and adaptive changes in their genes.  Physiological responses include changes in the metabolic rates and the proteins that affect metabolism during the animal's lifetime.  These reversible, non-genetic changes buffer an individual's health in a changing environment.  Yet, there are limits to these physiological responses, and animals may evolve genetic changes that affect their metabolism and enhance their survival.  This research investigates the interaction between physiological and adaptive changes to better understand the mechanisms affecting health and fitness.  This research takes advantage of new DNA sequencing technologies to define 10,000s of genetic differences among environments and relate these to measures of gene expression.  The data from this research will inform society about the genes and gene expression that enhances health in a variety of environments.  Included in this research is the training of undergraduate and high-school students from a diversity of economic and social backgrounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2:To enhance our ability to predict responses to climate change, we need to understand the relative importance of acclimatory responses and the potential for adaptive divergence.  Although there are several good vertebrate models for thermal adaptive divergence among taxa and many acclimation response examples, few studies examine the interaction between acclimatory responses and adaptive divergence.  To examine this interaction, this research first measures derived changes in metabolism and the effect of thermal acclimation and then uses the variation in these measures to interrogate the importance of mRNA and DNA variation.  Two major goals of this proposed research are to utilize genotyping by sequencing to provide tens of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms and apply RNA-Seq to measure most expressed genes to determine if 1) nucleotide divergence among the three thermal effluent populations share similar adaptive divergence and 2) acclimatory and adaptive changes in mRNA expression affect the same loci.  Our predictions are that acclimatory and adaptive changes in mRNA expression involve different genes, that many loci can effect a change in metabolism and thus different populations will have different mRNA expression patterns that statistically explain the variation in metabolism, and similarly, that the SNPs associated with changes in mRNA expression or metabolism will differ in different populations.  These predictions suggest that because the loci involved in physiological responses are different from those affected by adaptive divergence, there is greater potential for adaptive change than if the same loci were involved.  Additionally, we predict that there are many different ways to achieve a change in metabolism, which means that there are many different polymorphic loci that selection can act on.  Providing the data to support or reject these hypotheses would enhance our understanding of evolutionary physiology and thus significantly influence our ability to predict climate change effects on species' abundance and survival.</AbstractNarration>
