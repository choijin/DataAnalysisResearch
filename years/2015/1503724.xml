<AbstractNarration>Predictions of future sea level rise depend on accurate estimates of the rate at which ice sheets deliver fresh water and ice to the oceans.  These estimates are provided by models, which, in turn, depend on our understanding of iceberg calving, among other processes.  Due to a lack of observations, our ability to project rates of iceberg calving needs improvement.  This project will provide an inexpensive means of detecting and, potentially, characterizing such events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to workforce development through provision of support for the training of a graduate student and a post-doctoral associate.  It will enhance community resources by releasing the open source calving detection software, written in the R statistical language, on a variety of web sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators of this project will develop a method for detecting and characterizing glacier calving events by measuring the surface waves generated during the process.  Development of the method will make use of data already collected in Sarqardleq fjord in West Greenland.  Following the project both the data and the method will be made publicly available.  In addition, they will characterize the noise generated by calving events using underwater acoustic data that was collected simultaneously with the wave data.  The comparison of the acoustic and surface pressure data, in conjunction with high temporal resolution time-lapse imagery, will be used to improve understanding of the details of acoustic signatures of glacier calving.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quantifying the rate, type and size of calving events in the arctic is an important part of achieving the broader scientific goal of understanding and quantifying changes in the natural environment.  This can often be difficult in regions of harsh climate which are difficult to access and methods for autonomously monitoring these environments are therefore attractive. One such method that is being explored within the scientific community is the acoustic analysis of measurements of underwater noise collected with autonomous recorders to detect and quantify the characteristics of calving events.    In this work, measurements were made of the underwater background noise environment in a glacial fjord and the data were examined to determine both the background underwater noise level as well as to explore options of correlating this noise with nearby glacial calving events.  To study the data, standard and newly emerging methods in the exploration of acoustic data were utilized. Standard methods of data inspection such as the spectrogram (Figure 1 a)  may be used jointly with newer methods of data visualization (Figure 1 b) such as spectral probability density as summary views of trends in the frequency domain of the data. Combining the use of exceedance percentiles with the spectral probability density also allows for an assessment of the likelihood of observing events of given spectral levels.
