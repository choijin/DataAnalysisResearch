<AbstractNarration>Human-wildlife conflict is a global phenomenon, with species that more readily adapt to human-modified environments directly competing with people for food and space.  Scientists recognize the need to assess conflict between humans and wildlife as dynamic coupled-systems in order to unravel how such interactions reciprocally impact both natural ecology and human socioeconomic sustainability.  This interdisciplinary research project will use network-based quantitative tools to assess interactions and conflict between humans and nonhuman primates (macaques) as well as their feedback effects on human sociopolitical conflict and primate social relationships.  The project will provide new perspectives regarding the generalizability of coupled-systems frameworks to a range of human-wildlife conflict interfaces.  It will provide new insights regarding the causal mechanisms and processes driving human-primate conflict by systematically detecting direct and indirect patterns that represent the inherent complexity of these coupled systems.  It will be one of the first studies to simultaneously assess multiple human-wildlife systems using a strong comparative, coupled natural and human system-based framework employing data-driven, highly quantitative approaches.  Although focusing on conflicts between people and macaques in a set of foreign locales, it will provide new perspectives to analyze the sometimes-conflict-based interactions between the humans and other forms of wildlife in a broad range of locales, such as human-bear conflicts in both recreational and developed parts of the U.S. as well as human-coyote and human-raccoon conflicts in American metropolitan settings.  The project will provide new perspectives on ways to adapt to and manage human-wildlife interaction.  The project will provide international, interdisciplinary education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as post-doctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will assess conflicts between humans and macaques in southern and southeastern Asia as dynamically functioning, self-sustaining coupled systems.  They will examine how certain combinations of attributes and features (such as human socioeconomic status, human population densities, macaque home range use, and the boldness of macaque personalities) influences the nature, frequency, and diversity of interactions and conflict between humans and macaques.  The investigators will assess how these interactions affect dominance behavior through the imposition of time-constraints on macaques. They will evaluate how these interactions influence human social conflict management as reflected in damage-related transaction costs, and they will examine which aspects of these coupled-systems co-vary within and across human and wildlife systems.  The investigators will conduct a three-year study of six human-macaque systems at three locations in the Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka regions of India and the Selangor region of Malaysia.  They will conduct intensive field-based data collection, including behavioral event sampling of human-macaque interface interactions, behavioral focal animal sampling to record macaque dominance behavior, and GPS coordinates and questionnaire-administered sampling of human attitudes, beliefs, and experiences to gauge human social conflict. The investigators will use both standard regression models and self-developed network approaches to examine the directional flow of dominance information in macaque social networks.  They will employ data cloud geometry to identify higher-order clustering in human geospatial proximity, and they examine patterns in the links between human and macaque systems by using multi-dimensional regression to test specific predictions related to the project's aims.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The growing expansion of human populations has increased contact rates and resultant conflict between humans and wild animals. Yet research on human-wildlife interactions has largely lacked a theoretical framework, that enables quantitively evaluating and comparing the causal factors and (especially) the outcomes of interactions in both wildlife and humans, and across different locations. In particular, understanding the dynamic nature of the behavior of human-wildlife systems is fundamentally important to move such systems from negative outcomes that define conflict, towards positive effects that may promote stability and co-existence of wildlife and humans alike.&nbsp;</p> <p>The intellectual merits of this project therefore stem from its efforts to address this critical gap in the scientific understanding of human-natural systems. Through implementing the framework of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNHS), the project has made significant strides in understanding the causal factors of interactions between humans and wild nonhuman primates, and their feedback effects on aspects of both primate and human demographics, activity and behavior that underlie the stability and homeostasis of these human-wildlife systems. Between 2016-2018, we collected behavioral and demographic data at human-macaque (genus: <em>Macaca</em>) interfaces across three different locations in Northern India, Southern India, and Malaysia. Thus far (2019-2020), our analysis of this data has revealed that certain aspects of both macaque systems (e.g. monkeys? sex, spatial position within their group, social status, cross-species differences) and human systems (e.g. gender, socioeconomic status, location-based differences), may combine to influence the frequency and nature (i.e. antagonistic/negative interactions like aggression), versus seemingly affiliative/positive interactions like food provisioning) of interactions between monkeys and humans. Further evaluations are revealing how these human-macaque interactions function as ?feedback mechanisms? that impact outcomes in both macaque systems and human systems. Specifically, we found that human-macaque interactions reduce the time available for monkeys to engage in activities and social interactions with other monkeys that are critical to their health and survival. Furthermore, our on-going analyses of the human system is also revealing that interactions with monkeys have a strong impact on the attitudes, beliefs, and experiences of individual people, negatively through imposing monetary and opportunity costs in some contexts, but also positively through generating upliftment and a source of tourism-based revenue in other contexts. The significance of these findings cannot be overstated. First, changes to wildlife behavior and activity budgets on account of human activity can underlie more critical effects pertaining to the health and survival of individual animals. Likewise, changes to human attitudes and experiences can affect changes to policy and intervention strategies aimed to reducing conflict with primates and increasing co-existence through positive outcomes such as socioeconomic upliftment and well-being. Finally, given the growing significance of human-wildlife interfaces as hotspots for emerging infectious disease, we anticipate that our findings from this project would lead naturally to future epidemiological assessments at these human-macaque interfaces aimed at identifying monkeys which, through their behavior, may be most prone to acquiring and transmitting zoonotic pathogens to humans, other monkeys, and other wildlife.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>As broader impacts, the project has enhanced the careers of four Postdoctoral Scholars through providing opportunities to mentor field research groups studying primate behavioral ecology and human-wildlife interactions, manuscript publication in the capacity of first/co-authors, and presentations of project results at conferences and invited talks. The PI established long-term collaborations with institutions from India (the Himachal Pradesh Forest Department, and the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram) and Malaysia (Universiti Putra Malaysia and Universiti Sains Malaysia). Aside from assistance in logistics and training related to fieldwork, collaborators continue to be actively involved in manuscript preparation and publication. The work provided opportunities for up to 18 research assistants from diverse, multicultural backgrounds, including women and other minorities, in field, analytical and scientific writing skills. in particular, the project involved student participants from India, Malaysia, and Thailand, two of whom are currently pursuing a Ph.D. program at UC Davis under the mentorship of the PI. Other research assistants are currently pursuing graduate careers at reputed institutions in the US, Europe and/or India.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2019-20, the afore described findings from this project have led to the publication of seven peer-reviewed manuscripts (and an anticipated five more by the end of 2021), and to the acceptance and presentation of 24 abstracts at various academic meetings within the US, Europe, Africa, and Asia.
