<AbstractNarration>Western New Mexico University (WMNU) has received a Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program Capacity Building grant to 1) develop and strengthen the teacher preparation network and pipeline from high school to college; 2) strengthen collaboration between the School of Education (SOE) and the STEM Departments at WNMU to more efficiently and effectively produce STEM teachers; and, 3) recruit high school and undergraduate students to consider STEM and STEM teaching careers through a focused effort to engage prospective STEM students in active teaching experiences early in their career.  Through these activities, the PI team will build the critical capacity to effectively recruit high school and university students into the STEM teacher preparation program.  Such a robust recruitment pathway will allow WMNU to have an impact on the national need to increase the number of STEM teachers and, in particular, to increase the number of Hispanic students who go into STEM teaching.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WMNU PI team will develop an innovative workshop, the Mustang Science &amp; Education Academy (MSEA), which will focus on developing collaborative relationships among the SOE, STEM departments and regional school districts.  MSEA will also provide the needed active learning experiences for our students who express an interest in becoming STEM teachers. The project also is building connections to industry partners and regional educational agencies.  These connections will help facilitate the recruitment, support, and induction of future STEM teachers.  The evaluation of the project will provide an understanding of the effectiveness of the recruitment strategies that will inform the recruitment practices of teacher preparation programs across the country.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>NSF awarded capacity building grant #1540554 was developed into the Math and Science Education Academy (MSEA), a week-long intensive workshop designed to bring Western New Mexico University (WNMU) faculty, high school faculty (and a few of their students) from high-needs school districts, and WNMU undergraduate students interested in teaching together to explore contemporary instructional approaches and training opportunities. The workshop was held on the campus of WNMU from July 10-16, 2016 and again July 16-22, 2017. The primary goal of MSEA was to strengthen the network and pathways from high school to college for students interested in Science and Mathematics education at WNMU, a rural Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI). This goal was pursued through collaborations among WNMU faculty and staff and high school teachers to develop contemporary, project-based Science and Mathematics teaching units. Additionally, high school and WNMU undergraduate students were offered a guided Science and Math teaching experience to inspire them to consider a career in teaching.</p> <p>High school teachers spent the week creating a project-based teaching unit used the subsequent semesters at their home institution. The supplies for these units were purchased with funds from the grant so as to not impact the teachers&rsquo; high needs high school. In addition to creating these contemporary units, the teachers participated in professional development sessions in the areas of leadership, experimental design, as well as specific experimental process related to fungal collection, DNA extraction protocols, energy and clean water protocols, statistics test selection, FAFSA process, and best practices for proper presentation and framework of instructional units. All participants received a stipend, room and board during the workshop thereby providing an experience that would have otherwise not been possible for many of the attendees.</p> <p>Providing a teaching experience for the WNMU undergraduate and high school students was a primary focus of the MSEA workshop. In order to create an interest in a Science teaching career, high school and WNMU students worked side-by-side with WNMU and high school faculty in choosing and creating a teaching unit based on Science-related hypotheses developed by the WNMU faculty. Working alongside faculty during a week-long intensive experience allowed the students the opportunity to ask questions and get to know the faculty and benefit from their mentoring, thereby developing the needed confidence to pursue a teaching career in Science or Math.&nbsp; Additionally, all students developed 20-minute teaching units presented to other students participating in the Health Careers Academy (HCA; an NIH-funded program that brought high school freshman onto the WNMU campus to develop basic skills and interest in health careers).&nbsp; The HCA students were receptive partners in helping our student participants develop some of the teaching techniques, but more importantly, a passion for teaching.&nbsp; The MSEA students worked with the HCA students in developing short units on STEM topics related to mathematics, genetics, meiosis, and mitosis.</p> <p>The specific objective for the WNMU faculty was to create a stronger network between these groups as well as a stronger network with the regional school districts, their faculty, and their administrators.&nbsp; The stronger collaborative ties will develop trust and a functional team that will work closely together to facilitate student advisement, and clarify pathways available to students interested in Science and Math careers. WNMU faculty will continue to collaborate with the high school faculty and school districts and provide them with follow-up professional development opportunities while identifying potential Science and Math teachers in the region.&nbsp; Although we hope that interested students consider or continue at WNMU within our Science and Math teacher preparation program, we fully understand and expect that some of the students impacted by the activities in the grant will go on and attend other programs in the region.&nbsp; Our connections with the high school teachers beyond the grant will help us identify some of these students and assist our efforts to assess the impacts of this capacity-building grant.</p> <p>During the two-year grant period, we received a total of 121 applications from high school teachers for 12 available slots. Additionally, nine high school students and five WNMU undergraduate students participated in the workshops. This impressive number of teacher applicants suggests that there is a significant need for high school STEM teachers in the region and that many of these teachers are hungry for additional professional development opportunities that will allow them to impart contemporary skills to their high school students.</p> <p>Given the success of the previous two MSEA workshops, we will continue to offer the workshop in 2018 using an NSF research grant to Herrera (PI of DEB1457248) as part of broader impacts strategy. We will continue to monitor the first two cohorts of high school teachers, and students with an interest in teaching over the next three years by sending out periodic requests to them via e-mail and LinkedIn.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/21/2017<br>      Modified by: Jose&nbsp;Herrera</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540554/1540554_10397013_1513614021879_2016-particpants-picture--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540554/1540554_10397013_1513614021879_2016-particpants-picture--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2016 MSEA participants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540554/1540554_10397013_1513614021879_2016-particpants-picture--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2016 MSEA participants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2016 Math, Science and Education Academy (MSEA) participants.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jose Herrera</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jose&nbsp;Herrera</div> <div class="imageTitle">2016 MSEA participants</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540554/1540554_10397013_1513613622944_2017-particpants-pciture--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540554/1540554_10397013_1513613622944_2017-particpants-pciture--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2017 participants involved in the Math Science Education Academy (MSEA)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540554/1540554_10397013_1513613622944_2017-particpants-pciture--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2017 participants involved in the Math Science Education Academy (MSEA)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2017 participants involved in the Math, Science, Education Academy in Silver City, NM on the campus of Western New Mexico University (WNMU)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jose Herrera</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jose&nbsp;Herrera</div> <div class="imageTitle">2017 participants involved in the Math Science Education Academy (MSEA)</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540554/1540554_10397013_1513614275724_2017-particpants-on-a-collection-hike--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540554/1540554_10397013_1513614275724_2017-particpants-on-a-collection-hike--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MSEA collection trip to Dragonfly trail"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540554/1540554_10397013_1513614275724_2017-particpants-on-a-collection-hike--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="MSEA collection trip to Dragonfly trail"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">MSEA participants collecting root-associated fungal communities from grasses near Forest land near dragonfly trailhead, Grant County, New Mexico.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Joe Doyle</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jose&nbsp;Herrera</div> <div class="imageTitle">MSEA collection trip to Dragonfly trail</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
