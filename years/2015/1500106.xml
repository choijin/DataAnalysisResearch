<AbstractNarration>This project deals with certain types of equations modeling wave propagation in various physical contexts.  Among these are (1) the structure of a collection of ultra-cold atoms (2) light waves moving through a medium whose index of refraction depends upon the strength of the wave allowing for the self-focusing of the wave (3) water waves in a shallow channel, and (4) waves that move through the electrons and ions in a plasma.  Among the important mathematical issues are the rigorous derivation of such models from fundamental physical laws, and the precise study of special types of coherent wave solutions (variously referred to as solitary waves, kinks, vortices, and monopoles, and blow-up profiles).   In the last decade, new techniques from several branches of mathematics, specifically harmonic analysis, spectral theory, and Hamiltonian mechanics,  have led to striking developments and the resolution of many problems once deemed intractable.   The PI has outlined several conjectures that he and his students and collaborators will address by adapting and extending these new methods.  At the same time, the resolution of these conjectures is expected to extend the applicability of these methods and interface  other branches of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, several conjectures on the derivation of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) as a limit of the fundamental quantum mechanical model for a many-body system of bosons are outlined.  The PI will continue to investigate problems pertaining to dimensional reduction by the imposition of strong anisotropic confining, and allowing attractive interactions leading to the focusing NLS, which supports bright solitary wave solutions, as observed in recent experiments.   Second, problems pertaining to the geometrical structure of singularity formation for NLS are proposed.  In particular, the PI will consider the stability of new contracting sphere blow-up solutions, the possibility for blow-up on an ellipse, and a precise description of blow-up in the Zakharov system, a model for collapse of Langmuir waves in a plasma.   Third, the PI proposes to consider the dynamics of dark solitons, vortices, and monopoles, which are solutions for which the wave function has nontrivial topological structure on the spatial boundary, in equations such as the sine Gordon equation, subjected to semiclassical perturbations.   Fourth, the dynamics of non-perturbative interacting multi-solitons in completely integrable models, specifically the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) and NLS equations, subjected to semiclassical perturbation, will also be pursued.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of the project were to study three main areas:  (1) The derivation of the equations of motion governing the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC).  A BEC is an ultra-cold collection of certain types of atoms that exhibit a peculiar type of collective, fluid-like behavior.  Starting from a many-body model in quantum mechanics, a limiting process capturing an averaging effect over the particles is shown to result in a scalar wave equation called the nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLS).  Specifically, the PI and X. Chen derived NLS in the case of two dimensions, with attractive inter-particle interaction, using new available tools such that the quantum de Finetti theorem, a way of representing densities as an integral over a space of specific types of functions.  (2) The study of coherent solutions of certain nonlinear wave equations. Coherent solutions go by many names, such as solitary waves, vortices, or monopoles.  They consist of a localized disturbance that retains its structure through focusing nonlinear effects, despite the linear dispersive effects inherent in the equations.  They arise as solutions in model equations in optics, condensed matter physics, and in Yang-Mills theories (fundamental theories of particle physics).  The objective was to give a precise description of these coherent solutions in different contexts, building upon and extending the vast existing literature. Specifically, the PI, L. G. Farah and S. Roudenko examined stability of solitary wave solutions for the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation, a higher dimensional generalization of the Korteweg de Vries equation, which describes weakly magnetized ion-acoustic waves in a strongly magnetized plasma.  Three papers were completed describing aspects of this problem.  (3) The collapse of solutions of certain nonlinear wave equations.  In some cases, the focusing effects of a nonlinear term in the equations can overwhelm the linear dispersive smoothing effects, leading to the collapse or explosion of a solution in finite time.   The PI and C. Liu described such collapsing solutions of a nonlinear Schrodinger equation with point-interaction in one-dimension.   This equation can be viewed as a simplified version of the standard nonlinear Schrodinger equation, and the simplicity allows for explicit solutions, more precise analysis, and more generally applicable theorems.  Three papers were completed describing aspects of this problem.  The grant supported the PI's summer research, provided travel support to attend conferences and deliver lectures, and research assistantships for graduate students involved in the research projects.
