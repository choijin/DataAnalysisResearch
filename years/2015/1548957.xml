<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the availability of single-wall carbon nanotubes in their most highly purified form in laboratory scale quantities. This would be enabled by the use of a spiral countercurrent chromatograph, invented and made in the USA. Single-wall carbon nanotube is one of the most promising semi-conductor materials and is being actively considered for making state-of-the-art high performance electronic circuits.  The associated know-how will be of great value to the high volume semi-conductor manufacturing industry. The availability of discrete chiral types of the single-wall carbon nanotubes separated by the proposed system will have additional impact on the research market. Research labs in the semi-conductor industry and academic labs may be able to develop the carbon nanotube based nanomaterials, components and final products for point of care diagnostics, genomics devices and sensors for environmental and security identification. The societal benefits of these potential applications are significant.   The benefits extend more broadly to the life science research industry also where the technology works for protein and particle separations in the development of novel vaccines and drug delivery.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on developing a novel laboratory scale system for carbon nanotube purification. Carbon nanotubes are challenging to manufacture and isolate in their pure form for use as robust logic and sensor elements in advanced electronics.  They are hard crystal carbon polymers that are heterogeneous tubes of various lengths and diameters and occur as single-walled or multi-walled with other structures.  The existing processes to solubilize and purify the various single-walled semi-conductor species are quite difficult and have low mass yields.  The methods mostly used to date are column chromatography and density gradient ultracentrifugation.  To meet the need of higher mass loading and increased selectivity, this proposal focuses on developing spiral countercurrent chromatography.  A new spiral design rotor used with a polymer solvent mix has shown improved nanotube fractionation over static extraction in preliminary experiments.  Recent innovative research on dextran polymer liquid stationary phase makes it possible to improve the fractionation of carbon nanotubes even further. It also opens up many exciting options for large molecule separation. This development has a very significant intellectual merit for both chromatography and semi-conductor research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the name implies, carbon nanotubes, which were discovered in 1991, are made of carbon found in all living organisms and in common forms such as pencil lead and diamonds.  Carbon nanotubes, however, are a more complicated arrangement of carbon than these forms.  A carbon nanotube is a hollow cylinder made of carbon atoms.  They are not found in nature and must be synthesized artificially.  Carbon nanotubes offer several properties that could make them ideal materials for use in computer chips, batteries and a wide range of electrical components.  The carbon nanotubes are excellent semiconductors making them very useful in electronic design.  Although silicon technology has been the main driving force for miniaturizing device dimensions to improve cost and performance, the current application of Si to soft electronics (flexible and stretchable electronics) or miniaturizing is limited.  Strong high performing semiconductor carbon nanotubes can fill this future need.  The main drawback for mass producing carbon nanotube devices is that as-produced nanotubes are a mixture of tubes with different diameters.  The different diameters have different electronic and optical properties.  Compounding the issue is that there are few methods available that can isolate the different diameters reliably and economically.  In this project we studied spiral countercurrent chromatography that used programmed solvent mixtures to separate the different types of carbon nanotube molecules out of a commercially produced sample.  From an ink black sample we separated out the two major semiconductor types in light blue and purple fractions, respectively.  Metallic carbon nanotubes which are not wanted in this case were removed, as well.  This purification was possible using a rotor with 3D printed disks with mixing and settling segments in the flow channels.  The purified carbon nanotubes had high activity in field effect transistors.  We show that carbon nanotubes can be purified in quantity for application in advanced electronic devices.  Continued development of this technology will enhance the US electronic industry and give it a competitive edge.       Last Modified: 08/08/2016       Submitted by: Martha Knight]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
