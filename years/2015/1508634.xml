<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) are a special type of crystalline metals that can recover their deformed shape upon heating, as a result of the reversible solid to solid structural phase transformations, i.e. martensitic transformations. Few recently discovered SMAs are also magnetic, and demonstrate simultaneous martensitic and magnetic transitions. The principal investigators have recently shown that careful manipulation of defects in these alloys can bring about novel glass-like behavior in which the 'amorphous' structure is defined in terms of magnetic spin and/or strain. Such multi-functional coupling, the appearance of various types of solid states, and the resulting properties may provide completely new functionalities such as magnetic actuation, efficient magnetic refrigeration, thermal management, harvesting of waste mechanical energy, and cell growth stimulation via remotely actuated active tissue scaffolds. This award supports fundamental experimental and theoretical research and education to understand how different types of solid to solid phase transformations, glassiness, and crystal defects interact in magnetic SMAs and influence their functional properties. The new understanding is expected to positively impact future design and development of multifunctional smart materials. The award supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art experimental and computational materials techniques. An integral aspect of this project is the open dissemination of research results through a Materials Data Repository based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Materials Data Curation System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;NiMnIn-based Magnetic Shape Memory Alloys (MSMAs) exhibit a wide range of complex phenomena resulting from the interplay between configurational disorder and different types of phase transitions (ordering, magnetic, structural) including spin glass and strain glass transitions. These phase transitions result in multiple coupling modes involving thermal, magnetic and mechanical thermodynamic conjugate pairs. In turn, the alloys demonstrate rich responses that result in unique behavior such as magnetic exchange bias, tailorable thermal expansion, giant magneto-caloric and elasto-caloric effects. The principal investigators have shown that the degree of order and the presence of point defects and anti-phase boundaries play a fundamental role in controlling the stability of multiple competing phases but much remains unknown regarding the specific effect of configurational disorder on the magneto-thermo-mechanical properties of MSMAs. The goal of the combined computational-experimental approach in this project is to elucidate the mechanisms and microstructural features that determine the stability of the different competing phases, the onset of the phase transitions and their couplings. The focus is to use state-of-the-art multi-physics characterization and modeling to investigate the nature of magneto-thermo-mechanical couplings in NiMnIn MSMAs as a function of configurational order and various external stimuli (temperature, stress, and magnetic field or their combinations). In-situ investigation of micro and magneto structure coupled with neutron diffraction measurements in combination with first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations are used to examine the effect of configurational disorder on the magneto-structural phase transitions and the onset of glassy behavior. The major scientific impact of this project is expected to be the development of sound, multi-physics-based alloying and heat treatment guidelines for tuning magnetic and structural responses in magnetic SMAs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Magnetic shape memory alloys (MSMAs) belongs to a unique class of "smart" materials that undergo a solid-state phase transition known as martensitic transformation. The martensitic transformations in MSMAs can be induced by external stimuli such as variations in temperature, stress or magnetic field. As a consequence, these materials can enable new technologies in sensing and actuation for electronic devices, or can be used in energy harvesting devices or efficient magnetic refrigeration systems. In order to enhance the performance of these materials and increase their efficiency, it is important to explore various ways to modify their martensitic transformation characteristics via structural and microstructural changes, and to understand the physical mechanisms governing the different complex phenomena occurring in these alloys.  The key outcomes of the present work on MSMAs summarized below.  Intellectual Merits:  We have systematically investigated the dependence of the martensitic transformation properties on composition and thermal processing conditions, including temperature and duration of thermal treatments. The work has demonstrated that many key properties of these alloys can be easily engineered by selecting the appropriated thermal processing conditions. For instance, in NiCoMnIn MSMAs, by increasing thermal processing temperature, one can reduce martensitic transformation hysteresis and increase latent heat, improving the performance of magnetic refrigerators; or by reducing thermal processing temperature, one can reduce martensitic transformation temperature, allowing low-temperature actuators for space applications.      The present systematic work on NiCoMnIn MSMAs has shown, for the first time, a non-monotonic dependence of the martensitic transformation on the duration of the thermal process. This dependence is not caused by the formation of precipitates as observed in other shape memory alloys, such as NiTi and NiTiHf. To understand this behavior, we have investigated the physical origins behind the complex dependence of the martensitic transformation characteristics on both temperature and duration of thermal processing. Atomistic simulations and in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments suggest that such complex dependence is associated with two different physical processes. The first process is experimentally demonstrated to be the (quick) increase of overall order which is mainly determined by thermal processing temperature, while the second is hypothesized to be the coarsening of order domains which requires longer thermal processing time. In this case, the non-monotonic behavior is a length scale-effect resulting from the interaction between the microstructural features of the ordered domains, such as size and morphology, and the critical nuclei size for martensite. Significantly, this length scale-effect, discovered in this work, introduces an additional degree of freedom for engineering the properties of MSMAs.      We have demonstrated that NiCoMnIn MSMAs exhibit interesting kinetic effects including glassy features, known as strain-glass behavior, when they are engineered, with compositional adjustments or control of heat treatment procedures, to feature martensitic transformation with low driving force (the tendency of the material to undergo the martensitic transformation).  In this way, our research has also shown for first time that the full thermodynamic suppression of the martensitic transformation in these MSMAs occurs when the driving force is nullified by selecting the appropriate thermal processing conditions.      We have designed and built a custom magneto-thermo-mechanical testing device that permits to test the material behavior between -150&deg;C and 400&deg;C under simultaneous magnetic, up to 9 Tesla, and compressive stress fields. As such, this device allows for the advanced characterization of the martensitic transformation on the magnetic shape memory alloys and, in general, of the magneto-elastic couplings in solid materials.   Broader Impacts:  This project has offered a great opportunity to educate and train young researches on the state of the art problems in the field of shape memory alloys. Three PhD (2 male, 1 female, two US citizens) students were employed, one of them graduated and just became a tenure track faculty at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.      The results of the projects have been communicated to the communities of interest in twelve journal publications and over a dozen conference presentations at national and international conferences.      The students involved in the project have participated in the different outreach events organized by Texas A&amp;M University, such as annual Aggieland Saturday and STEMFest, for freshmen, and high school students and families.
