<AbstractNarration>This project supports a conference on Experimental Interdisciplinary, and Computational Windows on the Core Concepts of the Origin of Life to be held November 9-13, 2015 at Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington DC. The relatively small size of the meeting (approximately 100 participants) combined with the proposed 30 scientific talks and poster sessions should ensure that the core aim of the meeting to bring together representatives from diverse scientific disciplines to exchange ideas and approaches to the origins of life should be met. An effort has been made to broaden participation to young scientists including females and minorities.  A public lecture by one speaker will be offered as part of the Carnegie public lecture series. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference delegates will discuss narratives focused around five integrative themes that explore the concrete and abstract dimensions of origins, the connections to planetary context and biological evolution and ecology, the roles of modeling and computation, and the relation of biological theory to fundamental principles governing order in physics, chemistry, mathematics, and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Final Report:  NSF &ndash; 1564399 in support of the Project title: Conference: Experimental, Interdisciplinary, and Computational Windows on the Core Concepts of the Origin of Life.  Grant PI: George D. Cody     Background: This grant supported an extremely successful interdisciplinary one week conference titled "Re-Conceptualizing the Origin of Life" held in Washington DC from Monday November 9th to Friday November 13th, 2015.  The meeting was an outgrowth of a series of meetings that were held at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, NJ.  The focus of those meetings leading to the 2015 meeting was to seriously address the question of Life?s Origin on Earth from a fresh perspective and in particular bring in a theoretical physical and bio-physical perspective.     Process:  We started by selecting a Science Organizing Committee that was Chaired by Dr. Sara Walker a theoretical physicist at ASU and included 11 other scientists with interest and experience in studies into the Origins of life and spanning nine different institutions both national and international (see below).     We planned a meeting wherein a maximum amount of scientific interaction was ensured.  With aid from grants from the NSF, NASA and Carnegie Science we were able to cover travel for all speakers and students, provide breakfast and lunch for all attendees (key as this kept  the attendees on site and interacting with each other).     Result: This was an incredibly successful meeting that was 95 % attended continuously for five continuous days.  Having had prior experience in putting together meetings first as Program Chair for the Geochemistry Division at the Americal Chemical Society Annual meeting and later as the Chair of the Gordon Research Conference I had the benefit of considerable resources of the both organizations.  For this meeting we knew what it would take to make a fantastic scientific meeting that would be transformative, what we lacked were resources.  Because of the support of the NSF we were able to get everything done right and with Carnegie covering the costs of an incredible venue &ndash; we did succeed in putting together a meeting that all attendees agreed was "transformative".      In my experience of putting together scientific meetings (I keep telling my self "never again") I attach below the full program.  I would argue that this meeting was the perfect example of a perfect meeting- I honestly think that the model in terms of size and meeting plan might be something that program managers might use as a model.      Representing the SOC and the LOC we gratefully acknowledge the critical support that the NSF provided to enable us to achieve our goals.
