<AbstractNarration>Sea-level rise is a defining issue for the future of densely populated low-lying coastal regions. Within this context, the fate of the remaining large ice sheets is arguably the primary concern. Therefore, numerous studies over the past few decades have focused on the retreat of ice sheets during the end of the last ice age, 20,000 to 7,000 years ago. The North American and Antarctic continents collectively account for up to 80% of total ice melt, but the amount and timing of their contributions is not well known. Resolving this is important because the location of meltwater input is likely to have major implications for ocean-atmosphere circulation across the globe. The period between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago that witnessed about half (the last ~60 m) of the total sea-level rise is particularly poorly studied, despite the fact that the Earth's climate was roughly comparable to that of the present-day. Thus, this time interval could serve as a useful analog for the future. The present project will reconstruct the rate of sea-level rise in the Mississippi Delta during this period with unprecedented resolution. Combining this new record with state-of-the art computer models of ice sheets and the solid earth, it will be possible to calculate the relative contribution of North American v. Antarctic ice sheets to global sea-level rise during this time interval. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar as well as undergraduate students, and also contain numerous outreach activities. This includes instruction and field demonstrations at a New Orleans urban farm that educates local youth leaders on sustainable food production. Educational materials will be provided for high school teachers throughout Florida and for an exhibit on sea-level rise in the Tampa Bay-St. Petersburg area. Finally, all new sea-level data will be publicly released through the NOAA-WDC Paleoclimatology database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncertainty about the meltwater contribution from different ice sheets during the last deglaciation is particularly well reflected by the sea-level history during the early Holocene, where recent end-member estimates of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) contribution to global sea-level rise between 11 and 7 ka vary from ~20 to 30 m sea-level equivalent. This difference corresponds to about 1.5 times the volume of the present-day Greenland Ice Sheet. Possibly even larger uncertainties exist about the retreat history of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS). Ice-sheet volumes during this time window are equally poorly constrained. The Mississippi Delta is uniquely suited to produce a highly detailed early Holocene relative sea-level (RSL) record, extending to ~9.5 ka and possibly older. Wherever conventional approaches (AMS 14C dating of plant macrofossils extracted from basal peat) are not feasible, ramped pyrolysis 14C dating of brackish wetland paleosols, a novel geochronological technique, will be used to obtain sea-level index points of sufficiently high resolution. The new early Holocene RSL record will be combined with a synthesis of lower resolution records from across the globe, with the primary goal to determine the rate of RSL rise and its spatial variability from 7 to 10 ka. Glacial isostatic adjustment modeling that considers a large suite of ice-sheet histories will be used to correct RSL records for viscoelastic and rotational effects. The residual signal should provide new information on the contribution from the LIS and AIS to early Holocene sea-level rise, due to their distinctly different sea-level fingerprints. Specific questions that the work will answer include: (1) Was the early Holocene sea-level rise predominantly smooth or was it punctuated by distinct sea-level jumps akin to (and possibly larger than) those around the 8.5 to 8.2 ka time window? and (2) What was the relative contribution of the LIS v. AIS to early Holocene sea-level rise, in particular during the time interval from ~9.5 to 8 ka?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was funded to improve estimates of sea level rise from the period of Earth's history just after the last ice age (~10,000 years ago).  This period is called the Holocene Epoch, and our aim was to date indicators of sea level more accurately from the earliest part of that time.  We targeted peat deposits formed in wetlands as well as soils that formed where peats did not form in sediment cores from southern Louisiana.  Our work aimed to:  Apply cutting-edge radiocarbon dating techniques to buried peat and soil layers to improve accuracy, and to Test whether all peat deposits were likely deposited at sea level.   The first part of work centered on dating.  We were able to demonstrate the utility of dating buried soil layers that formed where peats did not form.  This is important because it allows more sediment cores to potentially expand our sea level data set.  Our initial thought was that these soils would be important tools as sea level was rising quickly at this time. Therefore, peat, which forms in standing water much like the wetlands currently located in southern Louisiana, may not have been as widespread in the early Holocene (10,000 yrs. ago to 6,000 yrs. ago).  However, we also were able to core deeper and we found more basal peats as well.  These were also dated.   Peat deposits can be formed in freshwater or saltwater.  When there is evidence that peat was formed in saltwater marshes, it can be used as a sea level indicator.  If evidence shows otherwise, it can only be used to estimate the maximum sea level (in other words, sea level would have been somewhere below that measured height).  The problem is that there had not been much investigation into the evidence of freshwater or saltwater.  We measured the abundance of certain chemicals that are only formed by plants on land to develop more evidence.  We found that at least two of the basal peat layers we were interpreting as saltwater were more likely freshwater peats, limiting their use as sea level indicators because a definite indicator is better than a maximum indicator.  Although this realization did not help us stretch our record further into the past (unlike the dates described above), it will have a large impact in the way basal peats are used in the future.  Finally, our project resulted in several videos addressing Florida state education standards from grades 7-12.  These are available on the C-PALMS website, cpalm.org, by searching this NSF grant number.  Seven videos feature professors from the College of Marine Science discussing how we measure sea level over different time scales.  These videos had already been viewed over 450 times as of February, 2019.  The USF PI have been contacting local educators to introduce them to this set of videos which, when used in unison, introduce students to the simplicities (length versus time) of measuring sea level over so many different time scales.
