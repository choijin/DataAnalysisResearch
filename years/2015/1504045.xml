<AbstractNarration>This project will evaluate how anthropogenic changes in estuarine morphology affect sediment fluxes in urban estuaries, and how consequent shifts in the physical regime affect estuarine sustainability, based on a combination of environmental and socio-economic factors. Geophysical models of hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and morphodynamics will be combined with economic models that value ecosystem services to examine two study sites, the Delaware and Hudson-Raritan estuary systems. The work will incorporate field observations, historical analysis, high-resolution physical modeling, morphodynamic modeling, and coupled modeling of the human-natural system. Studies of estuarine physical processes will lead to the application of dynamical models that represent the hydrodynamics and recent morphodynamics in these estuaries, with particular emphasis on coupled estuary-wetland responses to channel deepening and shoreline modifications. Socio-economic analyses will provide a quantification of the ecosystem services under past, present, and future states of the natural-human system. The culmination of the research will be a coupled model of the natural-human state trajectory, which quantifies the feedback between human actions to alter the estuarine regime, the response of the physical system, and the changes in values of the altered ecosystem services. The proposed work will define the relevant and appropriate natural and human scales for sustainable management of an urban estuary and identify a decision framework that permits the assessment of socio-economic values across generations such that alternative predictive outcomes can be compared and ordered in terms of their sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique contribution of this research is the quantitative integration of advanced analysis and modeling of physical processes in estuaries with socio-economic analyses, in order to predict the trajectory of the coupled human-natural system. Assessment of sustainability in estuaries requires this type of coupled analysis because of the sensitivity of the physical regime to human impacts and because of the critical human dimension of ecosystem services in estuaries. Important intellectual advances will also occur within the sub-disciplines. The morphological model of the estuary and surrounding wetlands will provide novel coupling of three-dimensional estuarine hydrodynamics and sediment transport with system-scale morphodynamics. The socio-economic analysis will analyze the linkage between policy, economics and ecosystem services within the context of the coupled human-natural regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a framework for decision-making leading to the sustainable management of estuaries. The models will provide prototypes for future decision-making tools for planning of urban estuarine economic development, environmental management, and risk management. Engagement with policy professionals at the municipal, regional, state and federal levels with responsibility for management of the Hudson-Raritan and Delaware estuarine resources will advance the use of system-scale integrated analysis of the human-natural system. Communication of methodologies to the broader community is intended to shape future analysis and decision-making concerning estuarine sustainability throughout the U.S. and worldwide. The research program provides professional development for six graduate students, one post-doctoral investigator, and undergraduates through the institutional research experience for undergraduates (REU) programs. The diverse-yet-integrated project team will foster strong interdisciplinary collaborations and educational experiences that will prepare the students for future careers in sustainability science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under NSF's Coastal SEES (Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability) program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Coastal marshes are valuable habitats for fish and wildlife, clean water, recreation, and protection of communities from storms, yet they are vulnerable to loss due to sea-level rise and human changes to the landscape. Much of the research has focused on the ability for wetlands along the coast to keep up with the increasing rate of sea-level rise by accumulating plant material, especially through root production, and sediment deposition. However, many coastal marshes are being lost through edge erosion from waves, regardless of their ability to vertically keep up with sea-level rise. We examined this process and the potential for waves to deliver eroded sediment back onto the marsh surface in the Delaware Estuary, USA. Using a combination of remote sensing, field studies, and modeling we found that over the short-term, rates of edge erosion ranged from 0.1 to over 11 m/yr depending on orientation relative to wave direction and wave energy. There was very little sediment deposited within 10 m of the marsh edge, yet at an average of 17 m inland, there was a distinct sediment ridge, made up of fine sands, deposited by waves, which migrated inland at the same rate that the marsh edge was being eroded. The ridge harbored vegetation similar to that of high marsh elevations, which migrated in-step with the ridge. Our results show that the eroded marsh material was not being redeposited near the marsh edge and that wave energy delivered subtidal sands from the estuary bottom that formed the ridge. The results of this study show that lateral erosion by waves is a major mechanism of marsh loss in the Delaware Estuary and in order to ensure that marsh habitats remain, the loss occurring at the edge should be counterbalanced by facilitating marsh migration landward into appropriate upland habitats.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/02/2019<br>      Modified by: Tracy&nbsp;Quirk</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
