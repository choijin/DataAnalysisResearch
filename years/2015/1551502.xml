<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. The project will integrate Native Hawaiian cross-cultural practices to explore ways to help teachers know about and know how to connect resources of students' familiar worlds to their science teaching. This research is needed since Native Hawaiians are often stereotyped as poor learners; the available STEM workforce falls short of meeting the demands of STEM employers in the state; and as the largest group of public school enrollees, data show a greater decline in percent of students meeting or exceeding proficiency in science at higher grade levels. This project will address these issues by transforming the ways teachers orient their teaching at the upper elementary and middle grades through professional development courses offered at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The professional development model for teachers will be situated in the larger national and global contexts of an increasingly technology oriented, urbanized society with associated marginalization of indigenous people whose traditional ecological knowledge and indigenous languages are often overlooked. Guided by the cultural mental model theory and a mixed methods approach, data will be collected through document analysis, surveys, individual and focus group interviews, and pre-post assessments.  This approach will capture initials findings about the influence of the professional development model on teaching and learning in science. The end products from this project will be an improved professional development model that is more sensitive to contexts that promote learning by Native Hawaiian students. It will also produce a survey instrument to assess student interest and engagement in science learning whose teachers will have participated in the professional development model being explored. Both outcomes will potentially be instrumental in changing the way approximately 2000 Native Hawaiian students learn about and become more interested in STEM fields through their natural world.</AbstractNarration>

The project team hypothesized that PD in diverse communities of practice (COP) including Hawaiian language translators, scientists, and community members would transform teachers? practices in ways that would support their NH students? interest and engagement in STEM learning. The PD model was extended to American Samoa in the final year of the project.  The project explored two related questions:  1)  Would place and culture-based PD enable teachers to integrate Hawaiian and 21st Century STEM into their instruction? and  2) Would surveys developed by project team and teachers be able to assess students' interest and engagement in STEM learning?  Significant Results:  We found that PD strategies and a year-long graduate class designed for the project, EDCS 640P(S) Seminar in Place-based Education, Sustainability enabled teachers to transform their teaching practices through incorporation of place-based, culturally sustaining STEM resources into their curricula.  Two Likert scale student surveys developed for the project assessed 1) interest in in STEM, sustainability, and Hawaiian culture and language coursework and careers and 2) six outcomes related to Hawai?i, belonging, well-being, responsibility, aloha, and excellence.  Both surveys across grade levels and community demographics showed that the geat majority of students, but particularly those self-identifying as Native Hawaiian responded positively to STEM curricula restructured to be place-based, culturally sustaining, and oriented to sustainability.  We found that over four classes spanning Fall 2015 to Summer 2018 (three in Hawai?i, one in American Samoa) teachers:  Utilized      standards as a framework for curriculum development: in Hawai?i NGSS      and Na Hopena A'o, in  American Samoa the territory?s science standards      and STEM Logic Model. Applied strategies of community mapping and curricular      mapping to situate curriculum development in place, culture, and      authentic STEM phenomena. Interviews with elders and research into      traditional stories and past land use enabled teachers to learn new      content, meet new people and identify new places to connect to their STEM      instruction.  Wrote, implemented, and evaluated innovative, place-based STEM curricula that      intersected place, culture and STEM.   Place-based PD enabled teachers to integrate formerly separated and sometimes conflicting bodies of knowledge associated with place, culture, and science. This enabled teachers to transform decontextualized textbook-based instruction to active learning pedagogies addressing phenomena situated in their students' worlds. After two years of curricular restructuring including adopting part of a state park for native plant restoration, a rural, predominantly NH intermediate school showed percentages of students scoring proficient on Hawai?i science tests increased from 13% in 2015-16, to 21% and 25% in 2016-17 and 2017-18.   Project findings highlight the role of teacher agency in transforming curriculum to be situated in particular places with unique histories, cultures and STEM resources. Science educators who collaborate with community members to integrate STEM with place-based, traditional and local ecological knowledge and indigenous language reduce barriers to entry of underrepresented Native Hawaiians and Indigenous peoples into STEM fields and reduce historical antagonisms between adherents of western science and adherents of Hawaiian/Indigenous science, cultures and languages.           The project has impacted thinking about the relationship of science research and education and Indigenous language and knowledge in Hawai&#699;i, American Samoa, and other communities. Hawaiian language specialists gained new appreciation of the value of Hawaiian language newspaper articles to science and science education.  In Hawai&#699;i and American Samoa the project has expanded the purposeful integration of  Hawaiian and Samoan language resources into English and bilingual curricula.   Strategies of community mapping, curricular mapping, and place-based PD have been successfully applied to formal and informal science education in Hawai&#699;i and American S&#257;moa.  The project provides evidence that place and culture-based PD delivered in diverse COPs 1) supports development of teacher expertise, agency, and leadership, 2) supports teachers? ability to transform teaching to support NH and American Samoan students? learning and engagement and 3) increases K-20 educators? interest in and use of indigenous texts and language as resources for STEM education and research.  This suggests the model of place-based PD integrating culture, language, historical resources and disciplinary content may transfer to other cultural and disciplinary settings and provide a model of community-based, collaborative problem finding and problem-solving.  In today's rapidly changing and multicultural society, science educators and students who able to respectfully navigate multiple cultural and social domains are an asset to a democratic society. Strategies of participatory curriculum development, and community-based research and education provide a pathway towards realizing that "All science learning can be understood as a cultural accomplishment" (p. 282, NRC, 2012).
