<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site hosted by New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) focuses on engaging undergraduate students from underrepresented populations and from institutions with limited research opportunities, such as community colleges, in research in the key emerging topics of optics and photonics technologies, systems and devices and inspiring them to consider continuing graduate education in electrical and computer engineering and related areas. Optical and photonic technologies, devices and systems are enablers for modern communication systems, sensors and computing. By focusing on next generation optical and photonics technologies and systems, this program seeks to increase the number of students entering the workforce with skills in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in optics and photonics research, with faculty mentors and their research teams, during an intensive and unique 10-week summer program in three focus areas: 1) optical communication and networking; 2) optical and photonic devices; and 3) optical systems.  The REU students' laboratory experience will be enhanced by technical seminars and workshops on non-technical topics, such as presentation skills and ethics. Each student will prepare a final report and give a presentation on his or her project at the end of the program at NJIT's International Undergraduate Summer Research Symposium.</AbstractNarration>
