<AbstractNarration>The onset of "big data" has led to an increased appreciation of the value of large data sets in both industrial and academic settings. Typically, the analysis of such data sets begins by modeling the data as a high dimensional system, and so an understanding of the behavior of such systems (and techniques for dealing with them) has become equally important. This award supports a mathematical investigation of the behavior of such systems using techniques introduced by the researcher in previous work with collaborators. These techniques have led to the resolution of a number of open problems across various mathematical fields, including the Kadison-Singer problem and the existence of Ramanujan graphs of all sizes and degrees. This project aims to further develop substantial connections with research across numerous fields of science, including convex optimization, real algebraic geometry, functional analysis, combinatorics, and probability. The award also supports plans to focus interdisciplinary activities of particular benefit to students associated with the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a technical level, the project focuses on two areas of research: (A) to develop a theory of ''finite free probability,'' a collection of ideas lying in the intersection of random matrix theory, convex optimization, real algebraic geometry, and polynomial geometry, and (B) to generalize the previously mentioned techniques so as to widen their potential application. This includes extending the ideas to bivariate polynomials as well as a non-Hermitian setting. In the direction of (B), the project aims to address some of the obstacles that hinder the application of the current techniques (for example, the need for real rootedness of associated polynomials) by investigating analogous behaviors in more general settings. This would be a necessary part of extending (A) to non-Hermitian settings, for example, as such objects no longer satisfy the conditions necessary to apply the current techniques. Extensions in this direction would also open the possibility of application to new areas such as quantitative geometry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is with great pleasure that I am able to characterize the outcome     of this project as successful, both in terms of achieving the goals     listed in the original proposal, but also in ways beyond what had been     anticipated.  The original goal was to  provide the   foundational   framework for a collection of ideas known as  "finite free     probabilty." For much of this  project, the researchers depended on    ideas from more established fields of  mathematics to suggest the most    fruitful directions and most promising  approaches.  This project,    however, has seen the tools of finite free   probability mature to an    extent that they are starting to "give back"  to  these other areas of    mathematics.  A number of phenomena have now been  discovered in the context of     finite free probability which point to  undiscovered results in other     areas of mathematics.  The most natural setting for such phenomena  occurs in    the realm of random matrix  theory.  A new   inequality in  finite free  probability, for example, suggests a  possible    generalization of an important structural theorem concerning the spectra  of random matrices (the so-called    "single ring theorem") in  unexpected ways.  Similarly, work in finite   free processes has  suggested a new type of matrix  Brownian motion that   would represent  a  vast leap in terms of the  complexity of systems  that  are currently   accessible by random matrix  theory methods.   Applications of this have   already appeared in the  field of finance and  it  would not be  surprising to see applications in statistical  physics  soon  follow.   An equally  interesting (but more theoretical) outgrowth of this  project has been a new approach to an important  convolution   in   (infinite) free probability that has eluded researchers  for   decades.    Much of the theory of (infinite) free probability has    developed in  two  parallel tracks (combinatorial and analytic) and this    dual  nature has been the source of numerous discoveries in the field.    One  particular tool, the  "box  product" convolution, has been studied   for  decades on the  combinatorial  side of the field, but an analytic    representation has  eluded  researchers.  In an exciting breakthrough,    an analytical  representation  of the box product was discovered in    finite free  probability, and we  believe this will open the path to the    development  of some long-sought  tools in (infinite) free   probability.  In a more unexpected  development, some of the tools that were    discovered under  this project have found  valuable applications in    engineering.  One way  to measure the stability  of a chemical structure    or fabricated material  is to analyze the  so-called "spectral gaps"  in   an associated operator.   Maximizing these spectral  gaps leads to    chemicals and materials with  optimal physical properties.  The   theory   developed in this project provides  new ways to understand  spectral  gaps  and new methods for constructing  operators with maximal  spectral  gaps,  which  could lead to the  development of chemicals and  materials  with  new and  improved properties.  This project has, in many ways, provided exciting new    directions   for mathematicians and engineers to explore.  While the    original   focus was on directions that would help to build the    foundational   framework of the new field of finite free probability,    there have   already been a number of unexpected applications to  established   areas   of mathematics.  This will undoubtedly be the legacy  of this project   and an achievement that was likely still decades away  without   its   support.
