<AbstractNarration>Additive Manufacturing holds the promise of revolutionizing manufacturing. One important trend is the emergence of cyber additive manufacturing communities for innovative design and fabrication. However, due to variations in materials and processes, design and computational algorithms currently have limited adaptability and scalability across different additive manufacturing systems. This award will establish the scientific foundation and engineering principles needed to achieve adaptability, extensibility, and system scalability in cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems, resulting in high efficiency and accuracy fabrication. The research will facilitate the evolution of existing isolated and loosely-connected additive manufacturing facilities into fully functioning cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems with increased capabilities. The application-based, smart interfacing infrastructure will complement existing cyber additive communities and enhance partnerships between academia, industry, and the general public. The research will contribute to the technology and engineering of Cyber-physical Systems and the economic competitiveness of US manufacturing. This interdisciplinary research will generate new curricular materials and help educate a new generation of cybermanufacturing workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will establish smart and dynamic system calibration methods and algorithms through deep learning that will enable high-confidence and interoperable cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems. The dynamic calibration and re-calibration algorithms will provide a smart interfacing layer of infrastructure between design models and physical additive manufacturing systems. Specific research tasks include: (1) Establishing smart and fast calibration algorithms to make physical additive manufacturing machines adaptable to design models; (2) Deriving prescriptive compensation algorithms to achieve extensible design models; (3) Dynamic recalibration through deep learning for improved predictive modeling and compensation; and (4) Developing a smart calibration server and APP prototype test bed for scalable additive cyberinfractures.</AbstractNarration>
