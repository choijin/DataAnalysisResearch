<AbstractNarration>The way that we move has long been recognized as a window into human health; our gait is affected by numerous pathologies, including arthritis, diabetes, and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Having access to quantitative gait analysis could be an important tool for pathology prevention, diagnosis, and management. However to date, quantitative gait analysis has been largely confined to the laboratory, due to the cumbersome and expensive nature of multi-camera motion tracking lab equipment.  This project uses novel sensors that employ materials that emit a voltage when subjected to mechanical stress and has the objective of bringing mobile gait analysis to the general public, in their real-world environment.  These wearable sensors are inexpensive, consume little power, and can wirelessly communicate with a nearby smartphone.  In addition, the sensor technology itself promises to be transformational across a broad cross-section of applications including clothing-integrated wearable sensors, self-sensing furniture, smart mounts for vibrating equipment, advanced airbag deployment systems, integrated helmet concussion sensors and self-sensing shoes.  Students from both mechanical engineering and exercise sciences are intimately involved in all aspects of the research to provide a unique cross-disciplinary educational environment.  Furthermore, high school students can apply to receive gait analysis systems to solve interesting science and technology problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The piezoresponsive nano-composite sensors used in this project are comprised of a dielectric polymer matrix impregnated with a network of conductive nano-particles. The mechanical and electrical responses of the sensors are independently tailored to provide an optimized system for multifunctional implementation in numerous systems requiring large-deflection sensing capabilities. When connected to a voltage-sensing device (for example, a blue-tooth transmitting Arduino microcomputer) the sensors can track deformation and impact energy and relay it to a nearby smartphone. In order to effectively leverage these sensors for mobile gait analysis, several scientific barriers need to be overcome.  The piezoresponse of the sensors will be modeled using a machine-learning algorithm to enable accurate, continuous self-calibration of the sensors.  An optimized mesh network of sensors will be designed to allow mobile gait analysis and will be validated against traditional gait lab instruments.  Finally, the optimized sensors will be utilized to measure gait in a cross-section of subjects to establish a public baseline database of gait behavior in a variety of real-life environments (i.e., outside of the laboratory).</AbstractNarration>

Bipedal locomotion is uniquely challenging from a control standpoint, and is sensitive to numerous factors, including mood, pain, current or previous musculoskeletal injury, neural deficits, vision distortion, vestibular dysfunction, and various other pathologies, even including some types of cancer.  Interestingly, each of these factors manifests itself uniquely in our gait; making gait analysis a valuable diagnostic tool with a specificity that rivals or exceeds our current capabilities in terms of pathological diagnostics (e.g., blood tests or medical imaging) for many conditions.  Unfortunately, our current ability to leverage the available information from human gait is limited by our sensing capabilities.  Gait analysis requires accurate measurement of both limb motion and ground reaction forces during locomotion, currently requiring a multi-camera motion tracking lab with an integrated force plate or instrumented treadmill.
