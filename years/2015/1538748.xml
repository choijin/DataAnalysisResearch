<AbstractNarration>The need for STEM workers is expected to grow at or above the national growth rate over the next decade (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2012). In recent decades the U.S. government has focused a good deal of attention on increasing the presence of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. The science and technology labor force has already diversified in important ways over the past few decades.  Women's representation in science and technology education and employment has increased significantly, though their representation remains considerably smaller in fields such as engineering and computer science. This research explores whether the particular components of the STEM labor force - such as the representation of women in particular fields, or the share of coworkers of a particularly nativity or race - are associated with retention in the STEM work force or the gender wage gap.  In fields where women account for a larger representation of STEM workers, for example, is the gender wage gap narrower?  How is that relationship influenced by the group size of foreign-born workers, and does it matter whether these workers received their education and training in the United States or abroad?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several social scientific views that can be evoked in seeking to account for the dynamics involved in occupational sex composition and occupational wage rates.  These perspectives are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but each focuses on distinct ways in which employers may exhibit preferences by gender or ethnicity.  Our project will utilize Queuing theory and Devaluation theory to explore how the changing composition of the STEM labor force promotes (or retards) the retention and earnings of women in STEM.  Such an approach will enable us to move beyond a simple gender dichotomy (men/women) to assess variation within gender (native-born/foreign-born).  Data come from pooling six waves of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), covering years from 1995 through 2008. SESTAT is comprised of three ongoing surveys designed to create a nationally representative sample of science and engineering college degree holders (Kannankutty &amp; Wilkinson, 1999).  The restricted SESTAT data include detailed information regarding labor force participation, occupation categories, educational attainment, and demographic characteristics.  The proposed project will include three sets of analyses, including descriptive analyses establishing trends in STEM employment by gender and nativity, as well a time since degree; multivariate logistic regression models incorporating predictors of employment in a STEM profession, by sex, and how group representation of the foreign-born moderates these associations; and OLS regression of women's and men's logged wages on observable characteristics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Employment Projections Program indicates that many STEM occupations are expected to grow at or above the national growth rate over the next decade (BLS, 2012). Yet groups that will account for substantial and growing shares of the population of college graduates in the United States - women and racial/ethnic minorities - remain underrepresented in STEM occupations, even as the foreign-born have increased their representation in the STEM labor force in recent decades. This project, entitled "Diversifying the STEM Labor Force: Are Women and the Foreign-Born Complementary or Additive?" utilized data from nine waves of the National Science Foundation?s restricted Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) to establish time trends in STEM employment for the largest gender-race groups in the U.S. (White men; White women; Black men; Black women; Hispanic men; Hispanic women; Asian men; and Asian women) and the native and foreign-born.  The peer reviewed papers published from this research, presentations, and work under review highlight the challenges of retaining women in computer science, reductions over time in the proportions of Black women working in computer science, and large disparities in earnings between women and men, and particularly among certain groups of immigrants, in computer science jobs.  The major goals of this project were:  (1) To measure gender and nativity differences in STEM employment; (2) To assess employment differentials between native-born and foreign-born STEM workers by gender; and (3) To assess the factors contributing to the gender wage gap in specific fields.  Our earlier research revealed that gender disparities were largest in the two STEM fields where not only was the representation of women was the smallest, but where wages were the greatest: Engineering and computer science.  These two fields account for over eighty percent of all STEM jobs, and are therefore the focus of our analyses.  In year two we expanded the data to include newly collected information from 2010 and 2013; this ensured that our sample provided observations of those employed after the Great Recession of 2008.   Our published papers and presentations have explored whether men and women with STEM degrees are as likely to be employed in occupations outside of their field of study, what are the occupational choices made by those employed outside of their field of study, as well as the factors that contribute to the persistent gender wage gap in computer science.  We found that while women and men with degrees in engineering generally work at similar rates in engineering jobs, women with computer science degrees are significantly less likely to be working in computer science jobs than their male counterparts with equivalent degrees.  Women with degrees in engineering are approximately 8 percentage points less likely to work in STEM than men; but about half of this gap is explained by observed differences between men and women ? for example, years of experience, graduate degrees, or family factors. Among those who obtained a degree in computer science, on the other hand, women are 14 percentage points less likely to work in STEM than their male counterparts, and controlling for demographic and family characteristics did little to change this gender gap.   So if they are not working in their field of study, or in other STEM jobs, what are they doing?  Relatively few women with CS degrees who are not working in CS jobs obtain employment in other STEM fields. Consistent with the findings of earlier research, we find that instead of leaving the labor market, the majority of women with CS degrees who are not working in CS occupations (and a smaller share of men) go into non-STEM occupations. As a result, there is a larger gender gap in employment in computer science than in engineering.  These occupational choices also shape earnings, contributing to the gender wage gap.      Furthermore, in computer science the gender wage gap is wider among recent computer science graduates than for older graduates, suggesting that the computer science workforce is an increasingly challenging one for women.  Whereas popular press and media accounts have documented such challenges, our work utilizes nationally representative results of those with degrees in and working in STEM occupations to highlight how attrition from essential STEM fields plays out.  Yet the existing findings are unable to explain the mechanisms resulting in these gender disparities, highlighting the need for linked longitudinal data on individuals and organizations, as well as qualitative in-depth interviews on workplace experiences, to clarify the processes that continue to push women out of their fields of degree receipt.  To conclude, our research demonstrates the considerable challenges to increasing the representation of women in the two STEM fields where employment opportunities are the greatest, but the representation of women the smallest - Engineering and Computer Science.
