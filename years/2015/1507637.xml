<AbstractNarration>Non Technical Abstract &lt;br/&gt;Liquid crystals (LCs) represent a peculiar state of matter combining properties of solid crystals and isotropic fluids.  The subtle combination of orientational order, fluidity, and eager responsiveness to the electric field featured by the LCs brought a revolution in the way we present information nowadays, enabling an entire industry of portable LC displays.  The project focuses on LCs as a functional medium that enables new forms of electrokinetics, i.e., motion of particles and fluids under an externally applied electric field.  As compared to standard isotropic fluids such as water, the LCs offer new mechanisms of electrokinetics, rooted in orientational order of molecules.  The project explores a new approach to induce and control the electrokinetic flows through surface-imprinted molecular orientation of the LC.  The objective is to establish a fundamental understanding of electrokinetics in LCs, determine which new technologies and applications might emerge from the study, and to train the new generation of researcher (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) in this cutting edge research of technological significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract &lt;br/&gt;Electrokinetics represents a broad spectrum of phenomena associated with a relative motion at fluid/solid interfaces caused by external electric fields that act on suitably separated space charges, such as electric double layers or induced charges.  The project goals are to explore a new mechanism of electrokinetics, in which the spatial charges are generated through the coupling of anisotropic electric conductivity to the liquid crystal (LC) director gradients and also to develop a new method to trigger the electrokinetic flows, through the imprinted surface patterns of director gradients. The control of surface alignment is performed locally in each point of the substrate by photo-irradiation. The project advances knowledge of electrohydrodynamics of isotropic fluids and electrohydrodynamics of LCs, two extremely rich scientific branches usually considered separately.  It brings a new perspective in a general area of charge transport in organic matter which embraces photosynthesis, transport within proteins and across biomembranes.  The project uses well-tested experimental methods such as three-dimensional optical microscopy, microparticle velocimetry, photoalignment and electro-optics, thus ensuring that the new knowledge is based on a solid experimental background. The research advances discovery and understanding of electrokinetics and LCs as materials for applications other than LC displays.  The study offers new perspectives for practical applications where highly flexible, precise and simple control of fluid or cargo placement, delivery, mixing or sorting is needed. The research will be conducted at the Liquid Crystal Institute, which will immediately make the results and techniques available to numerous partners already linked together by the Institute's Industrial Partnership Program.  The project helps to achieve the educational goals of the 5-Year Federal Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education Strategic Plan and the Materials Genome Initiative, by preparing the next generation of highly trained science professionals.</AbstractNarration>

Together, electrophoresis and electroosmosis form a subject of electrokinetics.&nbsp; In standard electrokinetics, velocities of particles and fluids are proportional to the amplitude of electric field.&nbsp; Important applications range from medical diagnostics (pregnancy tests, DNA and protein separation) to informational displays such as e-paper readers. For many decades, the research focused on the case when the electrolyte is an isotropic fluid, such as water with added salts. The research conducted within the NSF-supported project on Electrokinetics in Liquid Crystals focused on a new type of electrolyte, namely, on anisotropic fluids known also as liquid crystals. The defining feature of a liquid crystal is that its molecules are orientationally ordered, being parallel to each other; this direction of preferred orientation is called a director. The most interesting aspect is that the director can be patterned, i.e., predesigned to change in space. This project uses a novel approach to pattern liquid crystals by using photonic metamasks that convert unpolarized light into a light with linear polarization that changes from point to point in space according to the preprogrammed geometry of the metamask. This preprogrammed light beam aligns photosensitive molecules at the surface of a liquid crystal cell that in their turn, align the liquid crystal director.</p> <p>The project demonstrated that by using a patterned liquid crystal, one achieves a new mechanism of electrokinetics with many advantageous properties.&nbsp; The main feature is that the patterned director in presence of the electric field separates electric charges in space.&nbsp; Charge separation is necessary to trigger the motion, as the separated charges feel the applied electric field; charges that are too close neutralize each other and thus do not move in the field.&nbsp; In regular electrophoresis, separation of charges occurs either at the surface of dielectric particles, or through polarization charges generated near conducting substrates.&nbsp; In contrast, separation of charges in a patterned liquid crystal occurs in the bulk of the medium because of the variations of the director.&nbsp; In presence of the prepatterned director, thanks to the anisotropy of physical properties of the liquid crystal such as electric conductivity and dielectric permittivity, the charges of positive and negative charge move into different directions. The moving charges drag the liquid crystal with them, forming flow streams, the geometry of which is determined by the predesigned pattern.&nbsp; This new mechanism brings the following benefits. First, the velocities of flows and particle transport grow with the square of the applied electric field (rather than linearly), which allows one to use an alternating current instead of the direct current driving, eliminating parasitic effects such as screening of the electric field and electrochemical processes.&nbsp; Second, flows of the liquid crystal can carry particles of any type, metallic and dielectric, charged or not, polarizable or not, solid or fluid and even gas bubbles. This versatile character of patterned liquid crystal electrolytes is important for sorting and separation at microscale. The project established that the direction of particle transport can be reversed by tuning the material parameters of the liquid crystal. The distinct feature of patterned liquid crystal, namely, spatially-varying orientational ordering of the molecules, enables a new mechanism of electrokinetics that overcome many limitations known in the classic version of electrokinetics, such as zero mobility of uncharged particles.&nbsp; This fundamentally new mechanism has been termed &ldquo;Liquid crystal-enabled electrokinetics&rdquo;, or LCEK.&nbsp;</p> <p>The project advanced our understanding of electrokinetics and of liquid crystals as materials for applications other than informational displays in flat panel TVs and computer screens.
