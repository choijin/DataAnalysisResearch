<AbstractNarration>1510435 (Dooley), 1510541(Janik)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sulfur-containing compounds are ubiquitous impurities in petroleum resources that poison catalysts used for the refining and upgrading of both crude oil and natural gas to fuels and chemicals.  The proposed research seeks to develop and understand novel sulfur-tolerant catalysts for the conversion of natural gas to gases used to synthesize liquid fuels and chemicals.  To this end, the work has potential to develop a simplified, efficient process for natural gas conversion without the need for expensive "upstream" desulfurization.  The researchers will also advance education and scientific awareness by involving undergraduate students in their research with an emphasis on minority, women, and first-generation students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large quantities of natural gas are being produced from shale resources, providing opportunities to convert the gas to liquid fuels via reforming reactions.  This study reforms methane by reacting it with carbon dioxide, thus generating feedstocks for liquid fuels while reducing the atmospheric loading of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas).  A combination of experimental and theoretical tools will be used to design mixed metal oxide catalysts (combining transition metals and rare earth oxides) that are both sulfur tolerant and less prone to poisoning by coking than current catalysts.  Specifically, the work addresses the hypothesis that the mixed transition metal and rare earth oxide catalysts form stable and active oxysulfides under reaction conditions, with the benefit that the oxysulfides destabilize coke precursors.  Computational methods will be used to predict candidate oxysulfided catalyst materials that will then be synthesized, tested, and characterized, with results used to refine the theoretical predictions.  Beyond the direct research, the two PIs on this project have a strong track record of educational outreach at their respective institutions including involvement of undergraduates in their research programs and Dooley's work with the "You be the Chemist Challenge" of the Louisiana Chemical Education Foundation (focused on middle- and high-school students).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Carbon dioxide or "dry" reforming of methane (DRM) is potentially a better way to utilize greenhouse gases compared to steam reforming, since two greenhouse gases are consumed and made into a useful industrial gas stream of theoretically 1:1 H2/CO, CH4 + CO2&rarr;2H2 + 2CO.   Several Ce-La and Ce-Zr oxides, with different transition metal additives, were studied for the dry reforming of methane.  A rapid screening technique was developed to measure reforming and coking rates at low partial pressures.  It is a good indicator of catalyst behavior at higher conversions and partial pressures.  Following rapid screening, select catalysts were examined at longer times on stream.  Those containing Ni and Co together were the most stable.  Catalysts containing Ce-La oxides lacked practicality, partly due to more reverse water-gas shift.   Catalysts containing Ce-Zr oxides fared better, with Ce/Zr = 3 (molar) showing the best stability for Ni-based catalysts.  Reaction and deactivation results for Ni- and Ni/Co-containing catalysts could be explained partly in terms of DFT calculations for model surfaces, and partly in terms of spent catalyst characterizations.  The Ni interacts strongly with the mixed oxides, even when it is in a mostly reduced state, as in Ce-Zr, although more of the Ni segregates to the surface under reaction conditions, some forming larger aggregates.   The sulfur and coking tolerance of Ni-based dry reforming catalysts was also examined.  Catalysts prepared on both Ce-Zr and Ce-La oxide supports were tested under low and high conversion conditions.  Long-term reaction runs were conducted both with and without sulfur added to the feed.  The catalysts were also characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Ni K-edge X-ray absorption, and chemisorption of carbon monoxide.  Only catalysts where Co is also present, and supported on the Ce-Zr oxides, are capable of extended sulfur tolerance at &gt;20 ppm sulfur.  This tolerance, and also a greatly reduced coking rate, is linked to Co alloyed with the Ni and existing in small nanoparticles anchored and influenced electronically by the oxide support, where the activation of methane takes place.  Larger metal aggregates formed during reaction appear to be spectators.  Measured activation energies for the dry reforming reaction support the hypothesis that CO2 activation takes place at the oxide interface and is a kinetically significant step.     Broader Impacts:  The Ph.D. student (Changyi Jiang) on this project participated in writing two papers as first author.  He also participated in the Capitol Region "You Be the Chemist Competition"  for 3 years, preparing and coordinating demos related to emission and visible spectroscopy.  He coordinated the efforts of three other graduate students here.  The competition, organized through the Chemical Education Foundation, is designed to spark the interest of middle school students in the chemical sciences.  The regional and state (Louisiana) competitions are sponsored by LSU and the PI is the faculty coordinator for both.  Over 20 middle schoolers participate in the regional competition, and another 20 in the state competition, every year.  Reserves of natural gas continue to increase.  The catalytic reaction technology of CO2 reforming:   CO2 + CH4 &rarr; 2 H2 + 2 CO  which was investigated here provides a potential future pathway to both utilize the greenhouse gas CO2 and to further valorize methane.  The products can then be employed in well-known processes such as methanol synthesis and Fisher-Tropsch to upgrade CO and H2 to fuels.  There are reported pilot-scale plants testing this process with an eye toward commercialization.  In summary, the project advanced knowledge in the areas of: (a) high temperature hydrocarbon and CO2 reforming catalysis; (b) sulfur tolerance of reforming catalysts at high temperature reforming conditions; (c) understanding the surface and bulk structures of transition metal-doped rare earth oxide catalysts.  Results from this project have opened up avenues to design of superior catalysts of this type, including catalysts with better sulfur tolerance in CO2 reforming.
