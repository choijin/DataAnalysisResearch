<AbstractNarration>This summer program brings talented undergraduate students together, from all over the country, to engage in mathematics research for eight weeks.  Their work frequently leads to scientific progress in the form of published scholarly papers.  It also leads to students jump-starting successful careers in the mathematical sciences.  Additionally, by including a diverse group of students, this program increases the participation of historically underrepresented groups in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site conducts a nationwide recruitment effort to target primarily talented undergraduates with limited opportunity for research at their home institutions. They are brought for 8 summer weeks to SDSU's campus, where they are immersed in an mathematically intensive environment with graduate students and faculty.  In this setting, they are trained in the entire experience of being a research mathematician. They read background papers, write code to formulate conjectures, prove theorems, write papers in LATEX, collaborate with peers, and present their results in seminars and at conferences. Research projects will come from various areas of the mathematical sciences, including monoid theory, mathematical biology, and modeling of water waves.  Students will also learn about graduate school and mathematical careers as a whole.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For each of three summers (2016, 2017, 2018), groups of talented undergraduates were brought together to San Diego State University to conduct research in mathematics and related sciences.  These research projects, led by six faculty members, have led to 8 technical reports and 7 published papers in peer-reviewed journals.  The 31 undergraduate participants received technical training, as well as education about careers in mathematics and academia.     Participants met daily, for 8 weeks in the summer, to conduct a research project from start to finish.  They worked under the direction of their faculty mentor, together with (at times) graduate students and postdocs.  They read published papers, wrote code, made and tested conjectures, proved theorems, generated data, wrote papers, gave multiple technical talks on their work, and all contributed their results to at least one technical report (often in addition to a published paper).  These technical reports (as well as those from past years of this long-running REU site) may all be found on the SDSU MATH REU website, at: http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/math-reu/index.html     Subsequently, this work was disseminated by both the participants and the faculty project directors.  The grant extension from 5/1/19 to 4/30/20, funded travel for various personnel to discuss their REU-related results and encourage further REU participation.
