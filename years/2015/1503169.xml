<AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is to support the travel of US-based doctoral student researchers to the&lt;br/&gt;premier international conference on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems and their participation&lt;br/&gt;in the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium held in conjunction with it. The Fourteenth International&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2015) will be held in Istanbul,&lt;br/&gt;Turkey, May 4-8, 2015. AAMAS is the premier conference devoted to all aspects of research and application of agent technology, a key area of research with applications to the success of the WWW, electronic&lt;br/&gt;commerce, digital libraries, robotics, personal agents, and virtual humans. All students&lt;br/&gt;awarded travel funding will participate in a Doctoral Mentoring Consortium in which they will&lt;br/&gt;present their research to other student researchers and receive in-depth feedback from a group&lt;br/&gt;of senior researchers. Students will also attend the conference, which has a rich technical&lt;br/&gt;program complemented with an array of workshops, tutorials and other events. The wide variety&lt;br/&gt;and significance of the topics typically presented at AAMAS, in both the technical program&lt;br/&gt;and the workshop program, provides opportunities for students to share, exchange and learn&lt;br/&gt;from the best in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The sole goal of this project was to fund the travel of 21 students from US institutions to attend the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems conference in Istanbul, Turkey (May 2015).   Students were required to attend the doctoral mentoring symposium, organized by M. Birna van Riemsdijk (TU Delft) Ya'akov (Kobi) Gal (Ben-Gurio`n University of the Negev) Adrian Pearce (University of Melbourne)).  The selected students had a high level of participation in the AAMAS program (e.g., were an author on a paper accepted for oral presentation).  Attending the conference gives the participants a better grasp of their  field. AAMAS is the premier international conference in the area of multiagent systems.  Technologies, methods, and theories of agents and multiagent systems contribute to many diverse domains such as information retrieval, user interfaces, electronic commerce, robotics, computer games, education and training, ubiquitous computing, and social simulation.  The doctoral mentoring program prepares students for making the transition from student to independent researcher.  Participation in these programs motivates students to continue on their research journey, by connecting them with multi-agent researchers from all over the world.    At the doctoral mentoring symposium, the students participated in the following activities:  1) a career interview session with researchers Gal Kaminka (Bar Ilan University) and Kate Larson (University of Waterloo) who spoke about the process of transitioning from student to senior researcher and answered candid questions from the students. 2) student presentations (11).   Ph.D. students who had an extended abstract accepted by the doctoral mentoring review committee spoke for 10 minutes about their dissertation work and presented a poster.   3) panel discussion about multi-agent research with invited speakers Ece Kamar (Microsoft Research), Reshef Meir (Harvard University), Bo An (Nanyang Technological University), and Tim Miller (The University of Melbourne).     4) mentoring session.   Students with accepted abstracts were matched to a mentor (a senior member of the AAMAS community) with closely related research interests.   These mentors were invited to the student presentations and to the lunch.                           Last Modified: 12/02/2015       Submitted by: Gita Sukthankar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
