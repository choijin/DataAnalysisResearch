<AbstractNarration>In association with the "big data" phenomena with greater volumes of data being generated, there has been an increase in the need to analyze and process that data in real-time. Example sources of this data include social media, robots, scientific instruments and simulations. Real-time analysis of "big data" holds great promise for industry, finance, communication, first responders, and public safety, to name just a few promising areas.  Common to these applications is the requirement to process, analyze and respond to data immediately to make "live" decisions and steer applications. This project will organize and hold a workshop that will lay the foundations for a common understanding of the requirements and help the scientific community prepare for data of ever greater volumes and acquisition velocity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support a community workshop to understand the class of applications that entail streaming data and related (near) real-time steering and control. Such applications are increasing in their sophistication, pervasiveness and scale. The goal of the workshop is to identify application, infrastructure and technology communities in this area and to clarify challenges that they face. Workshop participants will focus on application features and requirements as well as hardware and software needed to support them and will identify recommendations for NSF's production distributed cyberinfrastructure (hardware and software) for both the short and long term.</AbstractNarration>

Although we identified 8 categories of applications, we believe there is a need for more detailed categorization, an analysis of software and hardware infrastructure requirements and development of associated "mini-applications" for use in research and testing.  The importance of the area, the significant number of interesting challenges and enthusiasm of participants motivated discussion of forming a formal "streaming data" community.
