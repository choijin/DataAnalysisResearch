<AbstractNarration>The University of Kansas (KU) Biodiversity Institute includes world-class systematic research collections and is one of the leading university museums in the world. KU has an extensive history of paleontological research and collection stewardship back to the late 1800s. Paleontological collections represent an invaluable resource for studying past biodiversity and tracing the evolution and relationships of groups of organisms through time. Such collections represent an irreplaceable record of past life and their proper maintenance is especially crucial in cases where collection sites are no longer accessible, where they contain evolutionarily important organisms, or represent a unique record of Earth history. This project will provide funding for a compactor storage system for fossil plant specimens that are currently in unsuitable storage and inaccessible. The KU Paleobotany Division has a long, successful history of outreach programs that use specimens from the collection. Activities that this project will engage in include: recruitment/retention of underrepresented minority and female graduate/undergraduate students and postdoctoral scholars; workshops for middle school girls using female role models and hands-on science activities; subject-based (paleobotany, environmental change, Antarctica) workshops for various groups (TRIO program for inner-city students from Kansas City; home-schooled students; gifted students from Topeka PS); participation in Natural History Museum Public Education programs (fossil identification day, Darwin Day); collection tours; public lectures; permanent and temporary displays in the Museum; and teaching paleobotanical techniques to school children and the public. This project will include a Museum Studies student who will develop a virtual exhibit based on the newly accessible fossils.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The paleobotany collections have greatly exceeded current space in Haworth Hall (biology labs, offices) and specimens are scattered in storage areas and the paleobotany research laboratory. Specimens will be moved into newly renovated space on West Campus, where many other Natural History collections are housed. The Paleobotany Division contains more than 100,000 specimens. KU houses the largest collection of Antarctic fossil plants in the world. These fossils provide calibration points for molecular clocks, molecular phylogenies, and extinction and dispersal events. The current project includes Permian, Triassic, and Jurassic fossil plants from Antarctica, and orphaned collections from Ohio University (OU), which were moved to KU in 2012. The latter includes Paleozoic plants from Appalachia and the Midcontinent, as well as Oxroad Bay, Scotland. Together with collections already at KU, this acquisition forms an unparalleled resource of the history of seed plants, from the earliest accepted fossils to the evolution of modern groups. The OU collection also includes plants from rare, seasonally dry ("upland") floras from North American communities during glacial times in Gondwana; some of these sites are no longer accessible for collection. The Antarctic fossils that need proper storage represent a unique, anatomically detailed record of Paleozoic - Mesozoic plants and fungi at a time before and after end-Permian extinctions - the largest extinctions in Earth history. The Jurassic plants represent the only substantial deposit of Jurassic plants on continental Antarctica and are an important record of plant diversity and paleoclimate at the time of the breakup of Gondwana. Results of project will be shared with iDigBio (idigbio.org) and made available online (biodiversity.ku.edu/paleobotany).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project requested funds to purchase and install a compactor system to store part of the paleobotany (fossil plant) collection at the Biodiversity Institute, University of Kansas (KU), a major, research-oriented systematic research collection. Many fossils were haphazardly stored in various storage areas and in hallways in academic buildings on main campus and needed to be moved from these areas and properly stored in metal cabinets in newly renovated space in a collections building on West Campus at KU. The Paleobotany Division houses the largest collection of Antarctic fossil plants in the world. The current project included Permian (~250-260 million years old), Triassic (~240 mya), and Jurassic (~200 mya) fossil plants from Antarctica, and fossil plant collections from Ohio University (OU), which were moved to KU in 2012. The latter collections include Paleozoic plants (Devonian-Carboniferous) from North America and Europe. Together with fossils already at KU, this acquisition forms an unparalleled record of the evolution of seed plants, from the earliest accepted fossils with seeds to the evolution of modern groups. In addition, the OU collection includes plants from rare, seasonally dry (&ldquo;upland&rdquo;) floras that correspond to North American communities during glacial times in the southern hemisphere (Gondwana); some of these sites are no longer available for collection. The Antarctic fossils that needed proper storage represent a detailed record of Paleozoic and Mesozoic plants and fungi, at a time before and after Late Permian extinction events&mdash;the largest extinctions in Earth history. The Jurassic plants represent the only substantial deposit of Jurassic plants on continental Antarctica and are an important record of plant diversity and<br />paleoclimate at the time of the breakup of Gondwana, when there was much volcanic activity on the continent, so that plant fossil deposits are very rare. <br /><br />The compactor was purchased, installed, and fossils moved from main campus storage into the new units. Fossils from OU were unpacked, catalogued and added to the online collections database. All were stored in acid-free trays in the compactor drawers. The fossils from OU had been in storage since 2012, so this is the first time that they have been available to researchers and their data searchable online. A number of undergraduate students helped with the move and we hired a Museum Studies graduate student to oversee the collections move and supervise the undergraduates. She also worked on upgrading the electronic data on the collection and making it available online to worldwide collections portals. Her experience on this project helped her to get a job at a Natural History Museum working on their electronic data systems.<br /><br />The Paleobotany Division is committed to public outreach and has a long and successful history of programs that involves all members of the Division from students to post-doctoral scholars and faculty, and makes use of the collections in presentations and workshops for the public, K-12 students, university students, and teachers. Some of our continuing activities include: recruitment and retention of under represented minority and female graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral scholars; workshops for middle school girls that utilize female role models and hands-on science activities; subject-based (i.e., paleobotany, climate change, Antarctica) workshops for various groups (Expanding Your Horizons for middle-school girls, TRIO program for inner-city students from Kansas City; home-schooled students; gifted students from Topeka PS); active participation in the KU Natural History Museum Public Education Programs (i.e., fossil identification day, Darwin Day); collection tours; permanent and temporary displays at the Museum; and paleobotanical techniques (i.e., acetate peels).
