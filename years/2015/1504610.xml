<AbstractNarration>Central to the survival of many organisms is their ability to manipulate inorganic molecules into elaborate crystalline structures such as skeletons, teeth, and protective shells.  This ubiquitous process of "biomineralization" depends on the precise action of specialized proteins within cells to form minerals where they are needed and prevent their accumulation in sensitive tissues.  Although progress has been made, much is not understood about how biomineralization is realized inside of individual cells and which genes control the process.  This collaborative project will address this challenge by applying recent advances in magnetic imaging technology to detailed studies of biomineralization in a simple and well-controlled biological system: the production of nanoscale magnetic particles within magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), and the use by MTB of chains of these particles (known as magnetosomes) for orientation and travel along the Earth's magnetic field lines (known as magnetotaxis).  During this project, students and postdoctoral researchers will receive training in scientific practices at the interface of the physical and life sciences.  In addition, the project may inform the development of improved materials with broad practical relevance, as products of biomineralization have superior properties compared to those currently engineered by humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goals of this project are to study the molecular mechanisms governing biomineralization and the development of magnetic nanoparticles in MTB.  The studies will employ a "diamond magnetic imager" that exploits a nanoscale layer of quantum sensors at the surface of a diamond chip, enabling imaging of magnetic field patterns from individual MTB in a population under ambient laboratory conditions, with better than 50 nanometer spatial resolution and greater than 1 millimeter field-of-view.  The investigators will apply the diamond magnetic imager to studies of magnetic nanoparticle growth in various MTB species and biomineralization mutants.  The project will open a new window onto the physical processes enabling magnetotaxis, including the transition of magnetic nanoparticles from a superparamagnetic to a stable single-domain magnetic state during magnetic nanoparticle growth, and the role of interactions between magnetic nanoparticles within individual MTB.  Magnetic measurements on genetic mutants will provide biological insights into the genes controlling the biomineralization process.  Observations will also be made of the dynamics of the magnetic nanoparticle chain during the cell division cycle, both through time series magnetic measurements on different MTB as well as magnetic imaging of individual living MTB.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this collaborative project between the Walsworth lab (Harvard, physical sciences) and the Komeili lab (Berkeley, life sciences) was to optimize an emerging new technology known as the "quantum diamond microscope" (QDM) and apply this and other methods to study the the physics of living systems, particularly biomineralization and development of magnetic nanoparticles in magnetotactic bacteria (MTB).  The Walsworth lab realized a series of advances to aid QDM optimization and its application to such biophysics studies.  These include: (i) demonstration of a variety of techniques to enhance the magnetic field sensitivity of the QDM; (ii) development of improved methods to make the diamonds containing the quantum defects that serve as magnetic field sensors in the QDM; (iii) demonstration of improved spatial resolution techniques for quantum diamond sensing; (iv) application of the QDM to map magnetic fields in mammalian cells and correlate with the origins of image contrast found in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and (v) application of the QDM to MTB studies, with life science results described in the Project Outcomes Report by the Komeili lab.    As a broader impact of this research, QDM optimization enabled a broad array of applications in other fields: e.g., studying primitive rocks and meteorites to probe the early history of the Earth and Solar System; quantum materials in condensed matter physics; and fingerprinting integrated circuits through patterns of magnetic fields assessed via machine learning.  Students and postdoctoral researchers were active participants in all phases of this research: design, construction, and execution of experiments&#894; detailed calculations&#894; analysis of data&#894; presentation of results at scientific meetings&#894; and writing scientific papers.  There was also a focus on the scientific training and career advancement of a diverse range of postdoctoral associates and students.  For example, a female graduate student working on this project in the Walsworth lab moved into a permanent staff scientist position at a Federally funded research and development center; and a female postdoc working on this project in the Walsworth lab moved into a tenure-track university faculty position.  In addition, the investigators on this NSF-supported project described the scientific process and results in a wide variety of presentations ranging from scientific conferences and seminars to public lectures.
