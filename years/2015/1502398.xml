<AbstractNarration>The primary goal for the Convective Precipitation Experiment- Microphysics and Entrainment Dependencies (COPE-MED) study is to investigate how changes in the strength of the warm rain process acting directly, as well as through the Hallet-Mossop process, impacts the amount, intensity and characteristics of convective rainfall.  Of equal interest is cumulus entrainment, factors influencing its progression, and how it alters the effectiveness of both the warm rain and Hallet-Mossop processes.  The COPE-MED study includes: (i) a field campaign to collect a unique data set; (ii) the novel application of data analysis techniques designed to maximize the utility of the data; and (iii) numerical simulations of the clouds, to complement the data analysis and hypothesis-testing, and to develop improved representation of these processes in numerical models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The COPE-MED field campaign is built around the combination of remote sensing capabilities and in situ cloud physics instrumentation on the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft.  These capabilities will be used to observe, in detail, the microphysical and dynamic structure of convective storms in their initial stages of development. COPE-MED will take place within the broader context of COPE - a U.K. lead field campaign scheduled from June through August, 2013 in Southwestern England. In this geographical location, the cooler cloud bases, lower drop concentrations and relatively predictable convective initiation along convergence lines provide an ideal opportunity to sample developing cumuli as they progress from the warm rain process into ice processes, and the influences of entrainment upon that progression.  The remotely-sensed and in-situ aircraft data will be analyzed together with data collected from a COPE UK research aircraft as well as from ground-based radars, radiosondes, aerosol instrumentation, and surface rain gauges.  The data will be analyzed in conjunction with high-resolution 3D numerical simulations of the clouds, which can represent the different microphysical pathways and the effects of entrainment, and provide information on cloud features that are otherwise incapable of being sampled by the aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novel contributions from COPE-MED will include technical development of the use of attenuation of the in-situ Wyoming Cloud Radar signal by raindrops as a measure of the strength of the warm rain process; the analysis of data collected from a suite of microphysical probes on the aircraft, with post-processing algorithms designed to maximize information and minimize ambiguity regarding quantification of the different water phases in the cloud; and the first direct comparison of flow fields near cloud top derived using dual-Doppler analysis with those from high-resolution cloud simulations, with the purpose of studying entrainment features and improving its representation in large-eddy simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits:&lt;br/&gt;This research will collect a unique, multi-component data set for the initial stages of convective precipitation development, increase understanding of entrainment and microphysical interactions affecting convective rainfall, and develop data analysis methods and improve cloud simulation models that can be applied to many future studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The study will improve quantitative precipitation forecasting (both by increasing basic knowledge as well as inspiring new microphysical and/or entrainment parameterizations), advance in cloud seeding, and improved prediction of the effects of aerosol and climate change upon clouds and precipitation.  Other broader impacts of the work include the education and training of three graduate students and two postdocs in observational data collection and analysis and/or numerical modeling of clouds, and their introduction to numerous members of the international cloud physics community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[FINAL OUTCOMES  The primary motivation for the Convective Precipitation Experiment- Microphysics and Entrainment Dependencies (COPE-MED) study was to better understand heavy convective rainfall that can sometimes lead to flash flooding.  The COPE-MED field campaign was built around the unique combination of onboard radar, lidar, and cloud physics instrumentation on the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft. These capabilities were used to observe, in detail, the microphysical and dynamic structure of convective storms in their initial stages of development. COPE-MED took place within the broader context of COPE ? a UK led field campaign scheduled from June through August, 2013 in Southwestern England.  This region of the world has had historic flash flood events in the past, often resulting from nearly stationary lines of storms that heavily rain over the same area for many hours.  Somewhat similar analogs have occurred in the U.S.  By superimposing COPE-MED upon the UK field program COPE, we were able to leverage resources from both programs to enhance data collection, broaden analysis of the data, and use a wider variety of numerical models to interpret the observations and test hypotheses. Of particular interest to the primary investigator of this grant was to study (i) how storms interacting along the line might enhance the overall surface rainfall by shielding each other from the erosive effects of the surrounding dry air; (ii) how much rain is created earlier in the storm lifetime before much ice occurs in the cloud; (iii) how much rain occurs later in the storm development due to the onset of ice-related processes; and (iv) how the storm environment can modulate any of these contributions to surface rainfall.  Some of the main scientific findings from the work funded by this award include the following:  A novel analysis of samples of air brought into each developing storm illustrated how a sequence of thermals rising into the storm can allow the later ones to be more protected from the ambient dry air, allowing the storm to deepen and precipitate more heavily.  This scenario is especially likely when the storms are moving along a line of continuous forcing.  Clouds and developing storms spaced along a line appeared to start interacting with each other when separated by distances less than three times their average widths.  Once they produced rainfall, new developing storms were forced in between the older storms, helping to fill in the convective line and enhanced the rainfall in the second generation of storms. The cleaner maritime air fed into the storms enabled rain to be created early in the storm lifetimes, which actually enhanced ice formation as the storms deepened, and created the bulk of the rainfall.  Although another mechanism (?rime-splintering?) was sometimes active to increase the number of ice particles in the storms, this mechanism did not appear to enhance the surface rainfall overall, as had been hypothesized. As found in some past studies, the effect of vertical wind shear in the storms was to overall greatly decrease the amount of rainfall produced by the line of storms.   These results have been communicated through presentations and publications to the scientific community, including weather forecasters and persons improving weather forecast models that can alert the public to potential flash flooding events.  This award also provided for the education and training of a Ph.D. graduate student in international data collection efforts, numerical modeling including high-performance computing, and in oral and written communication of scientific results.  Another M.S. graduate student received some support from this award to be trained in numerical modeling including high-performance computing.   Finally, this award also supported the training of a postdoc to numerically simulate clouds and storms.
