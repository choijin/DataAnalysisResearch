<AbstractNarration>1511825&lt;br/&gt;Brown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the relatively new molecular biological tools, the identification of fecal contamination in the environment increasingly makes use of rapid molecular assays to identify DNA sequences specific to fecal indicator bacteria or DNA from host-specific cells such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) shed in stools. Unknowns persist, however, primarily regarding the kinetic relationships between culture-dependent and culture-independent assays, since time-since-contamination information is critical in surveillance as a proxy for fecal pathogen survival and therefore public health risk. The proposed work will elucidate the strengths and limitations of current and novel molecular assays intended to identify fecal contamination in environmental waters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To provide new insights into these issues, the research team will undertake fundamental work on degradation of human mtDNA and human-specific microbial DNA-based targets in parallel with a suite of commonly used culture and qPCR methods for fecal source-tracking applications using laboratory-based mesocosms that simulate well natural surface water and sediments. Mesocosms will be spiked with sources of fecal contamination (healthy and diarrheal stools, primary effluent, isolates) and the fate of the gut microbial community, autochthonous microbial community, and pathogens (when present) will be followed over time (6 months) with advanced metagenomics techniques. Metagenomic approaches can track changes to microbial communities and pathogens with unprecedented accuracy and sensitivity. Hence, the temporal metagenomic datasets will provide an ideal reference to benchmark and compare the efficacy of currently used (fecal indicator bacteria test) and proposed (e.g., human mtDNA) biomarkers for fecal pollution monitoring, revealing comparative kinetic models and potentially new, robust targets for fecal source tracking. Further, the project has the potential to identify promising additional biomarkers for fecal contamination, resulting in improvements in risk assessment tools used by water quality managers. Hence, these studies will likely lead to the development of novel advanced techniques for water quality monitoring as well. Results of this research will be broadly disseminated to the public via a joint workshop with a local partner, Chattahoochee River Keeper, and an interactive exhibit called the Microbe Petting Zoo at the Georgia State Fair.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual merit. Our work represents a range of novel contributions on fecal source-tracking using new tools we have developed. At the highest level, most source-tracking methods now use bacterial genes associated with gut microbiomes of various animals (e.g., to distinguish between cow, pig, chicken, and human). The problem with this is that we now know that most if not all domestic/livestock animals and humans have overlapping gut microbiomes. So that when you identify a specific gene associated with a given bacterium, it is not unambiguous in relation to the source of that contamination. The problem is magnified outside of the United States; other environments represent different modalities of contact with animals and microbiome relationships may be very different. So, we have taken two approaches here: first, to build on the current state of the science for mtDNA markers, which are not variable between species. They are 100% specific to the species. The problems that have limited their use have been several but include poor performance of assays, the fact that these signals are in low concentration compared to microbial source tracking (MST) assays, and unknown persistence in comparison to MST assays. We have made substantial advances on all these fronts by developing and validating a new and more highly sensitive method and through evaluating its persistence in environmental media.
