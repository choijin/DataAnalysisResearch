<AbstractNarration>GameSec is a leading research conference focused on analytical models based on information, communication, optimization, decision, and control theories that are applied to diverse security topics. At the same time, the connection between theoretical models and real world security problems are emphasized to establish the important feedback loop between theory and practice. The conference helps to promote a "science of security" with a theoretical foundation that helps us understand security risk in a principled way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to allow more students to attend the 2015 and 2016 conferences. Preferences for travel support are based on the credentials of the students, with a focus on attracting women and underrepresented minority students to support their participation in this event.</AbstractNarration>
