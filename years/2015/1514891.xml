<AbstractNarration>Gaseous carbon in the atmosphere plays a large role in regulating global temperatures. However, plants use carbon dioxide (gas) and convert it to solid building blocks for growth, ultimately removing gaseous carbon from the atmosphere and providing short and long-term storage, reducing its effect on global temperatures. This research uses a simulation model to track carbon through the carbon cycle and provide estimates of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere from land use change activities such as de-forestation, forest degradation, and forest regrowth. This project builds on recent work by the Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Prabir Patra (host scientist at Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology), and Dr. Ben Poulter (PI?s academic advisor) that provides estimates of carbon emissions due to land use change for a regional greenhouse-gases budget of Asia. These estimates of carbon emissions are simulations, so their accuracy is uncertain.  This project?s main objective is to benchmark the simulated carbon emissions against observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide from a satellite that is operated and owned by Japan, the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), which is the current gold standard for observations of global atmospheric carbon dioxide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (?DGVM?) simulate exchanges of carbon between the land (live plants, litter, and soil) and the atmosphere, and includes factors that affect plant?s efficiency to exchange carbon, such as weather (short-term) and climate (long-term patterns in precipitation and temperature), and competition from other plants. The CO2 fluxes from seven independent DGVMs will be combined with fossil fuel emissions (for control of ancillary terrestrial CO2 fluxes) obtained from a separate dataset, and together they will be used as boundary conditions for forward runs in an atmospheric chemistry-transport model, developed by the host scientist. The simulated CO2 fluxes from the atmospheric chemistry-transport model will then be benchmarked to GOSAT observations and evaluated for accuracy. A regional gridded, and GOSAT-derived, dataset of CO2 fluxes from land use change, for the years between 2009 to the present, will be created for Southeast Asia. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Global carbon emissions from land use and land cover change (~1 Petagram C per year; 1 Petagram = 1 X 10<sup>15</sup>) are about 10-15% of the total carbon emissions on earth. The contribution of carbon emissions from land use change to global carbon emissions has been in decline in recent decades, partly due to increasing fossil fuel emissions and reduced deforestation in Amazonia. However, recent research suggests that deforestation in Asia has not seen the same downturn as in other parts of the world. Stemming from the student researcher&rsquo;s scientific visit to Japan in 2016, a team of scientists from seven countries contributed multiple independent data sources on areal changes of forest (due to deforestation, forest regrowth, or fires) and estimates of carbon stocks in forests biomass and soils.

Further, deforestation and peat fires in Southeast Asia have comprised ~15-25% of global carbon emissions from land use change. This research was published in July 2016 in the open-access high-impact scientific journal, Environmental Research Letters. We also teamed up with a graduate student at the School of Film and Photography at Montana State University to develop a video abstract of the research findings, with an aim to communicate the major findings of our research to non-scientists.

Japan&rsquo;s Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) provides near-global observations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but atmospheric carbon dioxide is a fully mixed gas, meaning that carbon emissions from fires, fossil fuels, and the decay of plant matter and soils are all contributing to changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We used data from seven carbon-cycles models to simulate and quantify the exchange of carbon from land to atmosphere, including feedbacks from climate and land use change. During the scientific visit to Japan, we transported carbon emissions in space and time using computer simulations of the atmospheric circulation of large air masses. These &lsquo;transported&rsquo; fluxes were used to create animations of carbon emissions from land use change over time for the entire globe; these animations will also be made freely available.
