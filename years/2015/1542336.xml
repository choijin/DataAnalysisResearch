<AbstractNarration>Within a coherent theme of Smart Vehicles, this collaborative Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site at Central Michigan University (CMU) and Western Michigan University (WMU) will expose in-service and pre-service teachers, and community college faculty to leading research spanning mobile robotics, kinematics and kinetics, vehicle manufacturing robots, vehicular sensor networks, ergonomics, material science, and circuit design. The multidisciplinary nature of Smart Vehicles in engineering will provide a holistic ground for developing creative course modules in physics, chemistry, engineering, and technology that aligns well with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), Common Core State Standards (CCSS), and Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) Criteria for STEM curriculum. Engaging regionally automobile focused industrial advisors and university faculty with rural secondary school and community college teachers will serve as a model-platform, and provide rare best-practices-based professional development opportunities and experience. CMU, a regional comprehensive university, is located in the heart of central rural Michigan where it maintains a reputation as "the" university to which schools turn for access to newly educated teachers, and for professional development for their current teachers. This RET renewal site will focus on teachers in these rural areas, and support them as they lift the STEM knowledge base of their students, increasing their opportunities for employment and for becoming entrepreneurs. Engaging pre-service teachers in cutting-edge research ensures that they begin their careers well-equipped with research experience and confidence to take into their classrooms. Similarly, with nurtured NGSS-based curriculum design and implementation expertise these teachers will take on leadership roles in their employing schools, thereby multiplying the effect of this project. Overall, through partnership with K-12 schools, community colleges, and a public university, this RET site will provide a profound influence on the learning and career paths of young students in the rural Michigan area, with knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes which are in high demand, but who have traditionally been underrepresented in the STEM education and employment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Site will offer an intensive six-week summer research program for a total of 45 rural STEM teachers over three years with a focus on those serving groups that are underrepresented in science and engineering. RET participants will engage in cutting-edge research on Smart Vehicles, under the guidance of engineering faculty mentors who lead active research programs, and who serve the community through outreach activities. The engineering faculty mentors, curriculum development specialist, Instructional Coach from Science/Mathematics, Technology Center, and staff from CMU's Faculty Center for Innovative Teaching will coach participants as they design standards-compliant curriculum modules and conduct professional development activities for each participant group. Extensive follow-up activities through the academic year include on-site Instructional Coaching, Quarterly Team Meetings, engineering faculty involvement in secondary school and community college classrooms, and Cross Classroom Collaborations to ensure translation of research experience into practice. The annual CMU High-Impact STEM Teaching Symposium will share findings with regional educators, and the annual CMU STEM Day will engage more than 200 secondary school students in exploration of engineering disciplines on CMU campus. The Science and Mathematics Program Improvement (SAMPI) staff at WMU will serve as external program evaluators, track and evaluate the site progress and provide feedback for improvement. They will also conduct longitudinal studies to assess the long-term impact of the proposed RET site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RET Site is co-funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) and the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Central Michigan University (CMU) engineering faculty members partnered with Science and Mathematics Program Improvement (SAMPI) from Western Michigan University (WMU) for three years (2016-18) to offer a summer engineering research experience to 28 teachers: 14 community college instructors, 15 in-services teachers, and 14 pre-service teachers.  Fifteen different research team projects were carried out (five each summer) with one pre-service teacher, one in-service teacher, and one community college instructor on each team (except for one team in Year 3 that did not have a pre-service teacher and one team in Year 3 that did not have a community college instructor).  Each team project was led by an engineering faculty member at CMU.  An undergraduate engineering student also served on each team to assist the teachers.  Each project involved research activities that exposed participants to the engineering disciplines.  Each team developed a poster based on their project and presented it at a public event on the last day of the summer program.  The professional development portion of the project also exposed participants to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), especially emphasizing Engineering Practices for grades 6 through 12.  This helped prepare participants to be competent leaders in their own schools and districts. Each participant benefited from approximately 15 hours per week for six weeks in learning about and developing standards-based and research-based lessons for the classroom.  Science education itself has been dramatically changed with the development and adoption of NGSS.  As is to be expected with the enormity of the change involved here, actual faithful adoption of the standards into individual classrooms is beginning slowly.  This project was really on the ground floor of this adoption and participants were prepared to provide leadership roles in their schools and districts.  As teachers develop and implement more and more standards-related lessons and provide support to their colleagues, the local impact of the project will be substantial.  In addition, impacts of this project will spread as specific participants report orally and in writing on their experiences.  Two annual High-Impact Teaching (HIT) Symposiums were held in 2017 and 2018 at which participants presented their experiences and lesson learned to regional school teachers.  The 2017 HIT Symposium was planned and executed by the 2016-17 participants.  The 2018 HIT Symposium was planned and executed by 2017-18 participants.  At these gathering, participant also presented information on their engineering research projects and on classroom lessons they developed.  An annual STEM day event was hosted for students of RET participant teachers.  More than 494 middle and high school students attended the event (including at least 180 in 2016, at least 171 in 2017, and at least 143 in 2019).  The event engaged students in an engineering-based hands-on activity. This opportunity allowed our RET teachers to select the challenges presented to students who attended the event and to see their own students applying the engineering design process.   Some participants received financial support to participate in professional conferences.  This included three participants who shared their experience at the Regional Conference of the National Science Teachers Association in Portland, Oregon.  Two additional participants presented at the Grand Valley State University?s annual Fall Update Conference which provides professional development to regional K-12 science teachers.  One participant presented at the Consortium of School Networking in Chicago. One presented at the Michigan Science Teachers Association meeting.  Two delivered talks at the Michigan Science Teachers Association Conference.  Most of the in-service teacher participants were from small, rural schools and taught science with very limited physical resources including space, supplies, and equipment.  They had very limited budgets and very limited ways to learn about new equipment which might allow them to teach skills and information relevant to jobs and careers coming available to their students. The CMU RET program not only allowed the participants to work with state-of-the-art equipment but also allowed them to attend conferences in which exhibitors explained, demonstrated, and provided information about resources that will help them with their science teaching.  In the future, these teachers will have some criteria to use as they make selections of equipment, supplies or laboratory spaces.  In addition, collaboration and networking between community college faculty, in-service teachers, and pre-service teachers was established.  Each participant took part in teaching in a classroom not like her/his own.  For example, a community college faculty member was in a middle school classroom, and vice versa.
