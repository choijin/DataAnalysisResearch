<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on the development of new theory, methods, and computational algorithms for analysis of longitudinal data, motivated by problems in AIDS clinical trials and HIV vaccine efficacy trials.  The methods will enhance our understanding of the benefits of treatment switching in an AIDS clinical trial, and how HIV vaccination modifies the disease progression in HIV infected individuals over time.  The broader impacts of the research include the development of statistical theory for longitudinal data, applications to medicine, public health and the social sciences, advancing statistical learning and training for undergraduate and graduate students, and promoting the participation of women in scientific research.  The statistical models and methods will provide a broad platform for investigating complex covariate effects including linear and nonlinear effects, time-varying effects, and nonlinear interactions among the covariates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project investigates a class of generalized semiparametric varying-coefficient models for longitudinal data.  These models can be used to analyze both categorical and continuous longitudinal responses through a link function, and flexibly model three types of covariate effects: constant effects, time-varying effects, and covariate-varying effects.  Part I studies the generalized semiparametric varying-coefficients model (GSVCM), where the covariate-varying effects are parametric functions of an exposure variable specified up to a finite number of unknown parameters, and Part II  investigates the GSVCM model, where both the covariate-varying effects  and  the time-varying effects are unspecified functions.  In Part III, the generalized semiparametric single-index varying-coefficients model (single-index GSVCM) is investigated.  The model is more powerful for assessing interactions among multiple covariates.  Estimation procedures for the model based on multivariate local linear smoothing and generalized weighted least squares are proposed.  Large sample theory will be developed for the proposed estimation and hypothesis testing procedures.  Other important problems that will be investigated include variance estimation, hypothesis testing of covariate effects, weight function and bandwidth selection, goodness-of-fit diagnostics, and estimation and hypothesis testing of link functions.  Computational algorithms will be developed to facilitate the applications of the proposed methods to real data from AIDS clinical trials and vaccine efficacy trials.  By pursuing the directions outlined in the project, significant progress may be made in building biologically interpretable models, and in developing statistically efficient methods to handle the complexity of longitudinal data.</AbstractNarration>

In AIDS clinical trials, the viral load and CD4 cell counts are measured repeatedly for trial participants and are considered as surrogate endpoints for HIV disease progression and HIV transmission to others. The PI proposed some flexible semiparametric mixed varying-coefficient effects models for longitudinal data models where the time-varying effects are unspecified functions of time and the covariate-varying effects are parametric or nonparametric functions of a possibly time-dependent exposure variables. Novel estimation procedures as well as hypothesis testing procedures are developed. The proposed procedures have been fully justified in theory and examined through extensive simulations with satisfactory performances. &nbsp;The AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) 244 clinical trial is an example for illustrating the developed methods although the methods can be applied generally to clinical settings where patients switched therapies based on the monitoring of a biomarker.</p> <p>The ACTG 244 is a historical case study of antiretroviral treatment regimens. Zidovudine (ZDV) was the first drug approved for treatment of HIV infection. Initial approval was based on evidence of a short-term survival advantage over placebo when zidovudine was given to patients with advanced HIV disease. Shortly after that, zidovudine resistance was associated with disease progression measured by a rise in plasma virus and decline in CD4 cell counts in both children and adults receiving zidovudine monotherapy. Subsequent studies suggested benefits of switching patients to treatments that combined ZDV with didanosine (ddI) or with ddI plus nevirapine (NVP). ACTG 244 enrolled subjects receiving ZDV monotherapy and monitored their HIV in plasma bi-monthly for the T215Y/F mutation. When a subject?s viral population developed the 215 mutation, the subject was randomized to continue ZDV, add ddI or add ddI plus NVP. After interim review by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, all subjects were offered randomization to ZDV + ddI or ZDV + ddI + NVP with 6 months of additional follow-up. An important question is whether the treatment switching has any beneficial effects in treating the HIV infected patients after drug-resistant virus was detected. A distinctive question is whether the treatment switching has any beneficial effects in treating the HIV infected patients who had not yet acquired the 215 mutation at the time of this randomization.</p> <p>The developed statistical methods are applied to assess how an adaptive treatment randomization affected longitudinal measurements of CD4 cell counts before and after the T215Y/F mutation was detected. Our analysis (Figure 1) shows that CD4 cell counts decreases significantly after drug-resistant virus was detected for those continuing on ZDV monotherapy. CD4 cell counts increases significantly even after drug-resistant virus was detected for those switching to the combination therapy ZDV+ddI+NVP. While the combination therapy ZDV+ddI did not increase CD4 cell counts, it had some positive effects for not letting CD4 cell counts continue to decrease. In conclusion, switching to the combination therapies based on the T215Y mutation had positive benefits as compared to continuing with ZDV monotherapy ZDV even after drug-resistant virus was detected. Our analysis (Figure 2) also suggests that switching to the combination therapies ZDV+ddI and ZDV+ddI+NVP both improve CD4 counts for patients without having yet developed the T215Y drug resistance mutation.</p> <p class="Default">Statistical analyses of failure time data often involve modelling treatment effects on clinically relevant biomarker based on incomplete observations.
