<AbstractNarration>The international Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) launched a series of World Congresses on Risk in partnership with other scientific, governmental and professional organizations and foundations interested in risk. SRA will hold the Fourth World Congress on Risk on 19-23 July 2015 in Singapore. The theme for the 2015 World Congress on Risk is: "Risk Analysis for Sustainable Innovation." By selecting this theme, SRA hopes to focus attention on risks of importance to developing and developed countries in a rapidly changing world of organizational and technological options. Technological evolution, growing interconnectedness between technology, science, economics, and society, and the need for a global balance between resource conservation, economic prosperity, and social equity have elevated the importance of sustainable innovation. Evidence-based risk assessment and risk management are central to the process of sustainable innovation as rapid development-driven social and environmental changes often exacerbate the physical and social burdens placed on the world?s most vulnerable nations and peoples.  SRA expects that approximately 350 participants will attend the events of the Fourth World Congress on Risk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific objectives of the World Congress are to (1) stimulate dialogue and learning on risk issues of worldwide interest, (2) share insights about analytic methods and decision processes used in different regions of the world, (3) demonstrate and disseminate advances in risk assessment and management, (4) improve regulatory practices and risk governance based on interdisciplinary risk research and evaluation of practical experiences, and (5) build bridges between professional organizations and individuals worldwide to facilitate education and to transfer science-based risk management practices across key user networks. Funding from the National Science Foundation will support the broad participation by faculty or researchers and risk scholars and practitioners from American institutions. Many of these participants face significant difficulties in attending the Congress without financial assistance.</AbstractNarration>
