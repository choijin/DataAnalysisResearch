<AbstractNarration>Dartmouth faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students will provide support for U.S. participation in the Joint Science Education Project (JSEP) and associated educational outreach efforts. JSEP is an internationally funded program that brings American, Danish and Greenlandic students and teachers to Greenland for a three-week field school experience. The program includes research related experiences in the Kangerlussuaq area and at the U.S. supported Summit Station on the Greenland ice sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components of the US participation included in this award are: sending a small team of graduate student and postdoctoral researchers with polar field experience, along with a Dartmouth faculty member, to Greenland to support field science education in the JSEP programs; continued training of an international group of students, teachers, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in cross-cultural science communication to advance the understanding of polar science in Greenland; sharing this training more broadly with the polar community; hosting planning meetings and workshops to design the curriculum for Science and Education Week and to help coordinate efforts by all parties engaged in JSEP; working with partners in Greenland and Denmark to increase the visibility of JSEP; and sharing and assessing the results of JSEP through public presentations, education-focused symposia at national meetings and publications in scholarly journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benefits to U.S. students, teachers, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty will include: improved science communication skills; greater facility in framing and communicating scholarship to meet the needs of Arctic communities; increased capacity for recognizing, assimilating, and communicating traditional knowledge; and skills for implementing programs that will broaden impacts of their future scholarship. The postdoc and graduate students will receive training in managing interdisciplinary research and outreach teams, thereby preparing them as future leaders in Arctic science and policy. Program goals include developing and disseminating curricula strategies that will increase general awareness of polar issues, attract the next generation of polar scientists and strengthen the international network of polar researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Earth's polar regions are undergoing rapid changes, the consequences of which are relevant to the entire world. The pace of polar environmental change demands continuous investment in training and educating the next generation of polar professionals who are prepared to be leaders in academia, government, industry, and policy.</p> <p>Starting in 2015, through the grant- <em>A Dartmouth-JSEP Partnership for International Science Education in Greenland</em>- we provided training and field-based experiences in the polar regions to a group of competitively chosen U.S. high school students and cohorts of graduate students from Dartmouth College. These students worked alongside students from Denmark and Greenland during the 3-week Joint Science Education Project (JSEP) in Greenland or with students from Chile as part of the 2-week Joint Antarctic School Expedition (JASE) in Chile and Antarctica. JSEP and JASE expeditions took place annually for a total of eight expeditions over the course of the funding period. Through collaborations with our international partners, we designed each expedition to engage students in inquiry- and field-based research in multiple polar science disciplines. Graduate students participated in a professional development series focused on science communication, teaching in diverse classrooms, field-based learning, and international collaborations, which prepared them for teaching and mentoring roles during the expeditions and prepared them for future careers in the research and education workforce.</p> <p>Several elements of this project were rated as particularly effective for training students in polar science. Example 1: Graduate students mentored the high school students as they completed an inquiry-based research project. All students learned new polar science content, but they also experienced the process of science, from asking a good question, to implementing a field-based study, to communicating results with diverse audiences, including the public. Graduate students gained mentoring skills by working with students from diverse backgrounds. High school students got to design their own projects and found it helpful to work with early-career scientists who could help them understand the process of becoming a scientist. Example 2: Students were required to share the results of their polar science research with multiple audiences, which is especially important in the Arctic. Students designed exhibits for an outreach event at the Kangerlussuaq airport, created videos explaining their projects for a general audience, used social media (science twitter @JSEP_GL @EAE_JASE), and created lesson plans for U.S. K-12 classrooms. Example 3: Our classrooms and student teams were inclusive and diverse, with emphasis on Indigenous participation. For JSEP, nearly half of U.S. students were from groups underrepresented in the STEM fields and 65% were female. Each year, half of all of the JSEP students were from Greenland. This helped the entire group understand the importance of including diverse and Indigenous participants on Arctic research teams. For JASE, the language of the expedition was Spanish. This was a unique opportunity for bilingual U.S. students, many coming from homes where Spanish was the primary or only language spoken. Importantly, these students were immersed in the diverse international scientific community of King George Island, where people in leadership positions shared elements of their identity that are underrepresented in the U.S. polar science community. In general, our students cited increased confidence for pursuing STEM careers as a result of the JSEP and JASE experience.</p> <p>This project has grown a diverse and international network of nearly 200 students and scientists, and our evaluation data indicate that nearly all participants remain in contact with their expedition team members. Participants also developed knowledge and skills that will strengthen the future of collaborative, international, and interdisciplinary polar work, whether they end up in academia, industry, policy, or education. These include: knowledge of cutting-edge and field-based polar science; improved science communication skills; cross-cultural and international experience; greater facility in framing and communicating scholarship to meet the needs of Arctic communities; and skills for outreach to broaden impacts of their future scholarship. From a survey we conducted of former U.S. JSEP participants (n=16), all were enrolled at a university and 94% were enrolled in a STEM degree program. Two were involved in polar research on their campus and several commented that they were considering a career in polar science. Of the graduate students who were funded and have graduated- two hold tenure-track teaching positions, one is adjunct faculty, one is a postdoctoral fellow, and one is employed at a government research lab.</p> <p>We believe that JSEP and JASE have emerged as model experiential learning programs for polar STEM fields. They are impacting students at all levels (K-12, undergraduate, graduate) and helping to build a strong U.S. workforce in polar science, policy and education.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last
