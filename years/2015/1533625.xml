<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this project from researchers at Pennsylvania State University is to understand the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying reading comprehension of expository scientific texts by school-aged children, adult first language readers, and adult second language readers. The proposed research integrates knowledge from several largely separate research traditions that are related to reading comprehension: (1) cognitive psychological and educational research in adult first language reading comprehension, (2) cognitive psychological and educational research in child first language reading comprehension, (3) neuroimaging research in text comprehension, and (4) graph-theoretical modeling of knowledge representation. Findings from this project will have significant implications for STEM education. It was funded by the Integrated Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems program, which included support from the EHR Core Research (ECR) program and the Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences division of SBE.  The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will study the behavioral and neural patterns during the reading of science text, in an attempt to unravel the brain's text reading network underlying first and second languages, and the neurocognitive differences between good versus poor readers. It combines methods from functional magnetic resonance imaging, cognitive study of learner abilities, and advanced data-analytic techniques in cognitive modeling and brain networks. The study of brain networks through the connectivity that exists in the functional and structural pathways of the learning brain holds the promise of providing new insights into the neural bases of individual differences, neuroplasticity, and language learning and representation. Data analytics will be applied to probe into the dynamic changes in connectivity patterns. This approach will allow the study not only of learning-induced or experience-dependent neural changes, but also what brain networks characterize individual differences in learning and representation (including intrinsic neural patterns captured by resting-state functional connectivity). Observed neural changes and patterns will allow the researchers to predict who might be more successful learners.</AbstractNarration>

Previous neurocognitive literature has focused on narrative texts but there has been little attention to the brain processes and mechanisms when reading expository science texts. Also, in past fMRI investigations students read one word at a time because of the technological challenge of eye-tracking in a scanner. In this NSF-FO project, the children and adult participants read one sentence at a time in the scanner, this allowed us to study the brain network that characterizes dynamically changing patterns during students reading of scientific texts. Our approach combines and integrates cognitive psychological and educational research in reading comprehension. In addition, because of this advanced neuroimaging techniques, it was necessary to pioneer analysis methods of this dual stream fMRI-fixation data that will help support future researchers.</p> <p>The project provides insights for understanding student learning and for STEM education for both native English speakers and for the rapidly increasing immigrant population for whom English is a second language. We collected data from three groups of participants: 52 Native adult (L1-Adult) speakers of English, 54 Native Child speakers of English (L1-Child), and 56 Second Language (L2-Adult) speakers. Among the L2-Adult group, participants were further divided into two subgroups (28 each) based on status of language immersion: Half of these participants were foreign students immersed in the English-speaking environment (Chinese students enrolled at Penn State University), and the other half were Chinese students learning English in Beijing, China. All participants participated in the reading experiment in the MRI scanner, and they underwent structural MRI, functional MRI, and resting-state MRI scanning while they were reading the scientific texts.

Comparison between adults and children, and between L1 and L2 populations has provided a good basis for us to understand science text comprehension for both native speakers and second language learners in both children and adults. The L1 and L2 data have shown how dynamic changes occur in brain and behavior as text reading unfolds rapidly.
