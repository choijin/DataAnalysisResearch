<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: ECCS-1535751&lt;br/&gt;PI: Victor Zhirnov, Semiconductor Research Corporation&lt;br/&gt;Title: Workshop on Enabling a Future Information Technology Revolution, March 30-31, 2015, IBM Conference Center, Washington, DC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) is planning a workshop to define Grand Challenges that will identify long-term research priorities for the semiconductor and nanoelectronics community in support of a future Information Technology (IT) revolution. This workshop will bring together strategic and knowledgeable experts from academia, government agencies, and industry, including the semiconductor and other information technology companies. The workshop will include overview presentations and roundtable discussions directed toward comprehending the barriers and approaches to enabling a future IT revolution. Participants will be asked to identify Grand Challenges and key scientific challenges related to nanoelectronic devices and future IT systems. By carefully assessing the scientific/technological challenges for future information technologies, the workshop will provide important documented inputs to the research community and to industry and government agencies that invest in long-term research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide an excellent opportunity for intellectual pursuit and discernment of important and limiting scientific challenges related to new approaches for information processing. Exploratory research indicates the potential for economically viable new devices, circuit and system architectures, and algorithms to take computing far beyond the limits of today's technology. Examples of IT topics to be explored include: (i) Ultimate Connectivity and Internet of Things; (ii) Intelligent ?nano-nodes?; and (iii) Semiconductor technologies for big data, such as exascale computing, and new data storage technologies. Some potential Grand Challenges include: (i) Guaranteed data security, from the smallest sensor nodes the largest data centers; (ii) Ubiquitous wireless communication for billions of connected Nanosystems; (iii) Intelligent sensor nodes, powered solely by energy harvested from the environment; and (iv) Continued exponential advances in energy efficient high-performance computing. A technical report will be generated based on the information gathered at the workshop and will be made publicly available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Access to information anywhere, anytime, is a hallmark of the world today, but the ability to collect, move, analyze, store, and - most importantly - use the explosding data stream to develop insights and options will require new approaches to computation. In the future, data-producing systems increasingly will involve small, low-power sensors and actuators embedded in the physical world - a network of cyber-physical systems, also referred to as the Internet of Things.  At the same time, ever more powerful, high performance computation will analyze and manage the deluge of data, and systems that anticipate needs will deliver useful information when and where it is needed. Beyond information, the combination of distributed, networked sensors with massive data centers and cloud-based computing capabilities will make it possible to obtain insight that can inform decision making at all levels.   The combined IT infrastructure -from small, low-cost sensors to massive computing systems- will enable innovation in society at large, in both government and the private sector. Greater availability and access to distributed IT and computing on a global scale, in developed and developing countries and regions, will help to reduce the "digital divide" and provide a platform for locally driven innovation.  A workshop on Rebotting the IT Revolution, held March 30-31, 2015, in Washington, DC, brought together experts from industry, government, and academia to explore leap-ahead IT technologies.  Attendees concluded that research is required in the following critical areas:  Energy-efficient sensing and computing. Energy efficiency is vital at all levels - from smallest sensor to high performance processors.  Sensor nodes also often need to operate without access to the electric grid for power -using batteries or heavesting energy from the environment. Advanced processors, on the other hand, are limtied in their performance by energy inefficiencies that result in overheating and thermal management issues. Novel materials, devices, and architectures must be developed to reduce the energy used to move data, either on a chip or over logner distance. Cyber-physical systems. Cyber-physical systems contain networks of collaborating computational elements that control physical entities. They require new engeineering models that embrace temporal dynamics and algorithmic computation; indeed, a CPS must have robust control in the face of very dynamic, physical systems that often act randomly. Moveover, safety and security must be designed in to protect lives, personal information, and property. Intelligent storage. New memory technologies and management systems are needed to store and archive the projected explosion of data. Research is needed on implementation of new memory architectures, including how a new architecture could disrupt the system and what changes are required for optimal memory management by system hardware and software. Real-time communication ecosystem. Communications bandwidth, especially for wireless communication, must grow along with the amount of data. The ability to provide very high speed communication will be critical for real-time applications. Broadband commuication will be greatly aided by advances in technologies for terahertz communication, including novel materials. Research is needed on advanced antenna arrays and the design of reliable and resilient communication networks. Multi-level and scalable security. Appropriate levels of security and privacy must be built into hardware and software. A secure system must be trustworthy, assured, and resilient to cyberattack, theft, and counterfeiting. Systems also must be able to adapt over time to meet the dynamic nature of threats. Next-generation manufacturing paradigm. New processes, such as rapid three-dimensional, additive manufacture with control at the molecular and atomic levels, may provide a cost-effective path to novel devices and architectures.
