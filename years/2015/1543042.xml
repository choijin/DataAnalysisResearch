<AbstractNarration>This Partnership for Innovation: Accelerating Innovation Research Technology Translation project focuses on translating a modular and field deployable electrochemical sensing technology to fill the unmet need for rapid, low cost, and on-site characterization of toxic metals such as arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, zinc, and mercury in water and sediments. This project will result in the development and field demonstration of a modular prototype "E-tongue" probe. This E-tongue probe will facilitate accurate, rapid, and cost-effective detection and quantification of heavy metals and have a direct impact on improving health and safety of humans. Standard spectro-analytical methods are expensive, bulky and require trained personnel for operation. The E-Tongue probe has the following unique features and advantages over existing laboratory and portable technologies, including: a) Portability and robustness, enabling rapid on-site testing; b) High sensitivity to detect multiple toxic metal ions below EPA specified maximum contamination limits; c) Integrated pH and temperature sensor for additional data and improved accuracy; d) User-friendly; and e) Low cost. By ascertaining levels of heavy metal contaminants at sites with sufficient accuracy in real-time, the E-Tongue probe can assist engineers to make onsite decisions, such as determining optimum locations for placement of monitoring wells, identifying hot-spots for sample collection for detailed laboratory testing, and adjusting field activity to control remediation options. It will also provide regulatory agencies with critical information so that they can take appropriate steps such as communicating drinking water advisories in a timely manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in the creation of a field deployable prototype E-tongue probe comprising an electrochemical sensor array, data acquisition/control and intelligent pattern recognition software. To develop the prototype, and move from research discovery to commercial application, the project will address the following technology gaps: 1) Simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, 2) Interfering compounds and electrode fouling, 3) Effects of temperature and pH, 4) Sampling challenges in the monitoring well and sediment testing systems. These technology gaps will be overcome by the use of multiple modified electrodes to enhance selectivity and sensitivity, elimination of interference and fouling through the use of appropriate sampling electrolytes and electrode protection strategies, integration of pH and temperature sensors to compensate for variations in pH and temperature, and incorporation of automated sampling systems. This project will provide the investigators, postdoctoral researcher and graduate student, the experience in transforming novel discoveries into prototype devices to solve real-world problems, as well as interdisciplinary, multicultural, global entrepreneurship experience through the Manning School of Business "Global Entrepreneurship and Innovation" program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geoprobe and K2 Engineering will partner in manufacturing the prototype E-Tongue probe and princed circuit board (PCB) fabrication and assembly of the miniature potentiostat. Demonstration of the prototype E-Tongue probe will be conducted in collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (Mass DEP) and CH2M Hill. Mass DEP will help locate appropriate sites for prototype demonstration. CH2M Hill will partner in the demonstration of the E-Tongue probe in heavy metal contaminated river sediments. The diverse skills and complementary expertise of the team, and collaborations with industry and regulatory agencies (CH2M, and Mass DEP) will ensure the successful translation of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The presence of toxic heavy metals, such as lead and arsenic, in drinking water is a serious health problem in many areas around the world. When water contaminated with heavy metals is consumed by humans, bioaccumulation occurs, which causes kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system damage. The problem is widespread with millions of people in the United States alone at risk from public water systems and private wells with unsafe heavy metals concentrations. While there are numerous methods for the detection of these contaminants, they require complex analytical devices which are expensive and require trained personnel for operation. To address this threat to human and environmental health, researchers in the PFI AIR TT project, titled A Versatile E-Tongue for In Situ Detection of Heavy Metals in Water and Sediments have developed a modular and field deployable electrochemical sensing technology to fill the unmet need for rapid, low cost, and on-site characterization of toxic metals such as arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, chromium(VI), and mercury in water and soil.</p> <p>During this project, the team developed methodologies for the detection of heavy metals using disposable sensors, including developing novel coating for the sensors and safe reagents, and easy to use procedures for accurate onsite detection. This included developing methodologies that could detect multiple metals with a single test. The team also developed a handheld sensor system for onsite detection use of this technology, known as the E-Tongue (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>). Furthermore, data analysis software was developed to enable users to interpret results with minimal training. Ten prototype E-Tongues were fabricated for testing in laboratory and field conditions.</p> <p>To test and validate the developed technology, the team has worked with several partners for demonstration of this technology in real world applications. In collaboration with the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Agency, the team collected samples of groundwater from several groundwater wells contaminated with various heavy metals (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>), including cadmium, mercury, and arsenic, and tested these samples using the E-Tongue. Furthermore, in collaboration with GeoProbe Systems, a company specializing in geotechnical and geoenvironmental site characterization, the team used a direct push 1.75 groundwater profiler (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>) to obtains groundwater samples from multiple depths and used their E-Tongue technology to test the groundwater for chromium(VI) contaminations. Extensive fieldwork was performed at a chromium(VI)-contaminated site to evaluate and validate this technologies for profiling of groundwater contamination plumes. Groundwater samples from selected depth intervals were collected and analyzed by an outside laboratory. The excellent comparison of the field results with the laboratory test results confirmed the potential of this technology in obtaining high resolution site characterization data to improve the management of heavy metal-contaminated hazardous sites. Following the success of this initial collaboration between the research team at UMass Lowell and engineers from Geoprobe Systems, the team is currently preparing a prototype handheld E-Tongue for the field screening of groundwater wells contaminated with arsenic. The field testing will be performed in Canton, Kansas.</p> <p>Furthermore, during this project, two graduate (doctoral) students interned at non-academic organizations focused on environmental engineering, gaining valuable experience and helping the host organizations to further their missions. These internships were made possible through the Non-Academic Research Internships for Graduate Students (INTERN) Supplemental Funding. One graduate student interned at Merrimack River Water Council in Lawrence, Massachusetts, a non-profit organization focused on environmental protection, where he helped develop a volunteer-based sampling programs to monitor the effects of combined sewer overflows on the Merrimack River.
