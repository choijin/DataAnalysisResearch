<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research is responsive to the established industry need to increase the precision of automatic assembly systems while automating much of the setup required to design and deploy these systems which must operate in the presence of short-term demands of the marketplace.   More specifically, the research addresses strategies, new hardware, and algorithms for micro-manufacturing utilizing teams of precision mobile and fixed robots. The specific problem addressed is automated discovery and calibration of assembly manufacturing system layouts prior to the commencement of automated assembly. The research augments the capabilities of a previously developed minifactory multi-robot micro-manufacturing system by introducing additional new robotic agents and calibration methods.  During the research period, a new type of 2-DOF precision manipulator system was developed for micron-level assembly in a multi-robot minifactory system.  These new manipulator agents incorporate a vacuum compensator and air bearing for gravity and friction compensation.  These inovations were successful in counteracting gravity and friction forces which greatly improved the achievable precision.          A batch of 10 of the these new manipulator agents was designed, built, debugged, and operated within the CMU minifactory system. Additionally, to realize precise motions for micron-level assembly and automatic discovery and calibration, a planar position sensor calibration method was developed to achieve closed-loop motion control of the planar 2-DOF courier robotic agents used to transport parts and subassemblies.  The achieved motion resolution was in the sub-micrometer range (0.2 um, 1 standard deviation).  Sensing and control methods were studied to enable the courier agents to detect and map out the their workspace boundaries and to precisely locate manipulator agents using an optical approach.  The multi-robot system was implemented and experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods including exercising inter-agent communication over the publish/subscribe network with up to 10 agents.   During the research we decided to improve the courier agents by intitiating a more robust design with respect to thermal distortions.  To that end we produced a set of 20 linear motor forcers of an advanced design to be used in the production of several new, enhanced courier robots.  Eight of these forcers have been wound with our semi-automatic coil winder in preparation for mounting in their housings.  We hope to have these new couriers operational soon.  In summary, our research served to advance the state of the CMU minifactory system which will serve as an exemplar for manufacturing companies' future needs.
