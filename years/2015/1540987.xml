<AbstractNarration>The International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip (NOCS) is the premier event dedicated to&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary research on on-chip, chip-scale, and multichip package scale communication technology,&lt;br/&gt;architecture, design methods, applications and systems. NOCS brings together scientists and engineers&lt;br/&gt;working on NoC innovations and applications from inter-related research communities, including&lt;br/&gt;computer architecture, networking, circuits and systems, packaging, embedded systems, and design&lt;br/&gt;automation. NOCS has established itself as the premier conference in this area. With these funds from this student &lt;br/&gt;travel grant, the conference organizers will be able to&lt;br/&gt;provide 10-15 travel grants to students, who may otherwise not be able to attend NOCS and take&lt;br/&gt;advantage of the available learning opportunities in this evolving research area. The grant recipients will&lt;br/&gt;be expected to report their learning experiences once the conference is over.&lt;br/&gt;Special efforts will be made by personal contacts to recruit student participants who are underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;minorities (i.e., African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders) and/or&lt;br/&gt;women, coming from diverse institutions.</AbstractNarration>
