<AbstractNarration>This award will support travel and conference costs for American students and students from American universities to participate in the Joint Doctoral Consortium, Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT) Conference, and Logic Programming and Non-Monotonic Reasoning Conference (LPNMR), September 2015, in Lexington, KY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADT is a multi-disciplinary forum focused on algorithmic issues in decision theory. The first three International Conferences on Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT 2009, 2011, 2013) brought together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas of computer science, economics, and operations research from around the globe. LPNMR is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference is to facilitate interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the design, implementation and application of logic-based programming languages and database systems, and those who work in the area of knowledge representation and non-monotonic reasoning.  The Joint Doctoral Consortium will include presentations to and by students, and personal and small-group interactions with mentors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported a joint Logic Programming and NonMonotonic Reasoning/Algorithmic Decision Theory 2015 doctoral consortium. Students gathered for a day before the two parallel conferences for a day of talks, active mentoring, and interaction.   Doctoral consortia have become standard vehicles for providing support to graduate students, both career mentoring and financial support for attending conferences, we offered something extra in bringing together students from two fields of Artificial Intelligence that have potential to influence each other. This allowed the students to broaden their knowledge base in AI and their networking opportunities.   This was  the first doctoral consortium to be held jointly between ADT and LPNMR.  There was significant time for students from both fields to present  their work, meet mentors from their own and closely related fields, and  heard interesting panels related to their research careers.    The joint  program gave students the opportunity to interact with their peers and  researchers within and outside their own focus. The closeness of ADT and  LPNMR meant that there were additional opportunities for students to  establish potential future collaborators and benefit from advice of  mentors from the other field. There was a special student spotlight  during the joint ADT/LPNMR poster session. This provided the students  with a key opportunity to hone their research pitch to and receive feed  back from a diverse audience.   The joint ADT/LPNMR Doctoral Consortium provided funding for student travel and conference registration for both conferences.  Nineteen students were supported, of whom thirteen were full participants who gave talks and were assigned mentors.  All attended the student talks and presentations by mentors.  The grant, therefore, directly supported the students' publications in the conference proceedings, and indirectly supported the conferences and their proceedings, by paying the students' registrations.  The intellectual merits of this supported research range across the disciplines of the two conferences;  the broader impacts are in the support of a diverse group of graduate students, including women, students of color, and at least one Hispanic student.
