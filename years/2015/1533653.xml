<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) seeks to develop a concentration in Computational and Engineering Mathematics. The project intends to provide a sound introduction to computational and engineering mathematics to undergraduate students to prepare them for positions in industry or for graduate school. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the objectives to: infuse computational engineering and mathematics techniques into relevant already existing mathematics and physics courses; develop new theme-based computational and engineering mathematics courses and laboratories; establish a 3-plus-2 program with North Carolina State University; develop a computational engineering and mathematics capstone design project; and recruit students for the new concentration. The areas of concentration are: robotics engineering, computational science, data science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and industrial engineering. Demonstrating and evaluating how to integrate computational and engineering applications concentrations into a mathematics major could serve as a model to other liberal arts institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We developed the Computational Engineering and Mathematics (CEMA) as a concentration in the Mathematics curriculum at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) to provide a solid, interdisciplinary foundation for students interested&nbsp;in academic and industrial careers in engineering and the sciences; provide a solid introduction to computational and engineering mathematics that would prepare majors for positions in industry, or to continue with graduate degrees; and provide high-quality education in mathematics including the most recent developments and discoveries in computational research.</p> <p>This program is designed to provide students with strong analytical skills, technical abilities and hands-on experiences and the option to select a concentration that reflects their interests and career goals. The program emphasizes a foundation of basic concepts and methodology of mathematical analysis and computation and prepares students for advanced work in computer science/engineering, applied mathematics, and scientific computation. It is designed in a manner such that the student must complete courses in mathematics, applied math, computing sciences, in addition to the science and general education requirements. This concentration allows the student to develop the use of quantitative methods in thinking about and solving problems -- &nbsp;knowledge that is valuable in all endeavors. The expectation is that students who complete the concentration can pursue graduate study, is prepared for the computer consulting and information industries, and scientific and statistical analysis careers in industry or government.</p> <p>A student in this concentration will:</p> <ul> <li>Develop an interdisciplinary foundation in math, applied mathematics and computer science</li> <li>Acquire advanced skills in critical and quantitative reasoning</li> <li>Design a focus area around a coherent theme</li> <li>Engage in a senior capstone project and produce a final paper or software project</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We designed and finalized courses and syllabi for 3 thematic areas comprising of Computational Science, Data Science and Software Engineering.

This semester-long, credit-bearing course focuses on solving&nbsp;industrial problems and through participation in PIC Math, the undergraduate students will: (a) learn knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in a mathematics career in BIG (Business, Industry &amp; Government), and (b) work on a BIG research problem.</p> <p>Students work as a group on a semester-long undergraduate research problem from business, industry, or government.
