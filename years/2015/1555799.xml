<AbstractNarration>This project will support a workshop that aims to address the role of distributed spectrum measurements and associated management techniques in support of making significantly more spectrum available to the U.S. population.  New spectrum management approaches and spectrum sharing regimes promise to provide greater broadband access, accelerate the pace of wireless innovation, and increase the competitiveness of the US telecommunication industry and U.S. commerce in general. This workshop will result in the promotion of research and educational efforts that enhance our ability to use spectrum sharing technologies in a manageable and enforceable manner. This work is supportive of the goals set out in the National Broadband Plan, the PCAST Report on Spectrum Policy and the two associated Presidential Memorandums on Spectrum issued in the past 8 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will assess the current state of spectrum measurement techniques, the datasets that have been collected and importantly the analysis and modeling tools available to make this data useful and actionable. This should in turn provide the basis for developing a roadmap for research leading to future spectrum management, monitoring, and enforcement techniques and policies that will enable greater and more efficient access to our increasingly scarce national spectrum resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The NSF Spectrum Measurement Infrastructure Workshop was sponsored by the NSF and was hosted at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago on 6-7 April 2016.  Spectrum measurement and the understanding that comes from these efforts has become an increasing important topic as we seek to more efficiently and effectively utilize our nation?s increasingly precious spectral resources.  Several government initiatives, including two Presidential Memorandums[1], and the PCAST (Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology) Spectrum Policy report[2], have advocated collaborative research, development, and testing in the area of enhanced measurement capabilities to advance temporal spectrum sharing technology, and related regulatory rule-making.  Currently there are spectrum measurement related efforts being pursued by advisory bodies for both the FCC (the Technological Advisory Council) and the NTIA (the Commerce Spectrum Management Advisory Committee) that further underscore the importance of this area.   Understanding the spectrum sharing environment is complex. While spectrum measurements are performed today by industry, academia, and government, these efforts tend to be narrowly focused to align with their respective mission, and/or current business interests.
