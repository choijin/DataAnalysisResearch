<AbstractNarration>1510790&lt;br/&gt;Clemson&lt;br/&gt;Husson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One future possible source of energy is the energy released when low-salinity waters mix with high-salinity waters, such as when rivers reach the ocean. This "gradient energy" can be harvested through a process called pressure retarded osmosis (PRO). The PRO process involves water transport from a low-salinity source through a semipermeable membrane to a high-salinity draw solution. The objective of this multidisciplinary research and education program is to develop and study advanced thin-film composite (TFC) membranes that are designed for PRO. The proposed research is transformational because it will deliver TFC PRO membranes with high water flux, low reverse salt flux, high apparent power density, and an overall structure that can withstand mechanical stresses generated during operation under high osmotic pressures. These performance and structural characteristics will be achieved by incorporating unique, previously untested nanomaterials into the membrane structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies will test the hypothesis that incorporation of specific nanomaterials directly into the thin film active layer and as a separate, ultrathin supporting layer will yield a new class of robust PRO membranes with unmatched performance characteristics. The research will provide deep understanding of how chemical functionalization of the membranes and nanomaterial additives impacts their mechanical properties and performance. Investigations will examine the roles of loading and degree of functionalization of nanomaterials on membrane compressive modulus and strength. Performance measurements will use standardized protocols and models to determine water and salt permeability coefficients, structural parameters, and apparent power densities. With this knowledge, the team will be able to design TFC PRO membranes with the desired performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will integrate education and research aimed at improving public science literacy among individuals living in Upstate South Carolina and Western North Carolina by using entertainment media education and creating social media forums that facilitate discussion of science news. Partnership with a local television program that serves over 800,000 households in the nation?s 36th largest market will ensure that on-air science demonstrations and web-based science videos reach a large and highly diverse audience. It is expected that television promotion of the demonstrations and videos to local school districts will benefit students in the viewing area by illustrating the relevance of science and supporting science learning.</AbstractNarration>
