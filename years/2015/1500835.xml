<AbstractNarration>Optimization is one of the areas most critical to modern technology, since designers always try to minimize cost or maximize performance, safety, output, etc. It can be thought of in two parts: convex optimization and nonconvex optimization. The concept of a convex function is illustrated by a cup; it has  unique  lowest point (minimum), while for nonconvex problems one would think of a mountain range with many valleys, hence  many lowest points (local minima). Computer algorithms are good at finding one (or even a few) of local minima, but a  major open problem is this: out of all the local minima, find the lowest (global) one. For convex problems all local minima are global, which means that computer runs do not report a false minimum. Of course, in technology the number of variables is huge, so all that is available to the designer are algebraic formulas (not pictures); thus the cup and mountain metaphors are  misleadingly simple. There are two major classes of convex optimization problems solvable on a computer: classical linear programing and (within the last twenty years) the more widely applicable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). This project concerns many aspects of LMIs, including the scope of LMI techniques: problems treatable with LMIs are convex, but conversely, which convex problems are treatable with LMIs? With collaborators the PI has sketched out a roadmap for this problem and pursues its confirmation. What one sees in linear systems engineering and control are problems with matrix unknowns. Simplifying physical problems and converting them to convex ones is currently done by ad hoc algebraic tricks. A major goal in this project is to develop a theory that will help systematize this. A particular concern is changes of variables to convert nonconvex problems to LMIs. Another is approximating a set with a convex set. In addition, the PI's group is the main provider to the public of software (called NCAlgebra) for performing general noncommuting algebra calculations in Mathematica. NCAlgebra is developed in the course of doing experiments for the proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classical real algebraic geometry develops a theory of (commutative) polynomials and much of it concerns inequalities based on evaluating them on tuples of real numbers. A good part of this project concerns  noncommutative polynomials and their properties when evaluated on tuples of matrices (of all sizes). This new (freely) noncommutative real algebraic geometry often behaves much more rigidly than classical real algebraic geometry. While seeing how classical structure transports to free real algebraic geometry is part of the pursuit, engineering motivation and the highly rigid structure opens up new classes of problems. For example, free convexity, change of variables to achieve free convexity, free convex hulls, and free dilation theory are mathematically rich areas involving mixtures of functional analysis, optimization theory, algebra, and several complex variables. Also studied in this project are interactions with other subjects such as free probability as well as commutative topics related mostly to so-called linear matrix inequalities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most problems in technology involve models with extremely large numbers of variables. Often the key to handling these problems  is special structure which they possess.Our  efforts focused on situations where the variables entered naturally into arrays called matrices. A natural operation is to add two matrices entry by entry; as every spreadsheet user knows. In addition to this matrices multiply naturally and this operation occurs in many physical situations, such as with signal flow diagrams, or in quantum mechanics.  In other words the set of matrices has an algebra structure. Furthermore, important objects are positive definite matrices and the associated rich theory of  matrix inequalities.  We are particularly interested in inqualities and formulas in matrix variables which do not depend on the size of the matrices, that is, they are "dimension free".  This NSF project saw serious advances on several aspects of this  structure.  In many variables it is not possible to visualize a situation, so one is dependent on algebra and inequalities to validate the success of a design method. Convexity ensures that an optimization algorithm finds a true global optimum, so it is an overwhelmingly desirable property in applications.Our research made advances on convex  situations where the unknowns are matrices.  Key to understanding a convex set and optimization of a linear functional on it are the extreme points of the set.  With collaborators McCullough, Klep, Evert the PI found  elegant and computationally effective characterizations of extreme points in these convex matrix "free " situations, as well as proved that the span of these free  extreme pointsfor such  a set actually equals that set.  One focus of our NC work aimed at determining changes of variables which make a set of matrices defined by a noncommutative polynomial inequality convex.A first step is to determine if for a particular free convex set there are many or fewnoncommutative (transpose free) maps onto any other convex set.We showed that such transforms were remarkably rare.  Of course understanding solutions of equations prescribed by sets of polynomials is a major undertaking in mathematics and bears on technology.  For polynomial equations in matrices there are three natural notions of solution. Under auspices of this grant there was major progress on one of the types,  determinantal solutions, done with Klep and Volcic. This led directly to both qualitative computer and algorithmic characterizations of non-commutative rational functions who’s positivity set is convex.   A topic which opened up under this grant was the discovery that some well developed techniques used in our area applied directly to random matrix theory.Not surprisingly in random matrix theory one considers a set of a few independent normally distributed random matrices. What we were able to do is take any noncommutative rational function of them thereby getting a random matrix and we give a formula for the probability distribution of  its eigenvalues. These results were obtained with Mai and  Speicher.  Helton’s group are the main providers of software(called NCAlgebra) for performing general noncommuting calculations in Mathematica.Over the last few years we have done many experiments, leading  to publicly available software pertaining to: optimization of a linear functional over a "free " convex set and also to quantum information.
