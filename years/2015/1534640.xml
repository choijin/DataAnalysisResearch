<AbstractNarration>Since the early 1970s, life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (LWOP) -- an extreme prison sentence under which a person convicted of a criminal offense is ineligible for administrative release during natural life -- has emerged as a routine legal sanction and penal practice in the United States. Yet while LWOP is a normal and expanding part of American punishment, just how it came to be so has not been carefully articulated or explained. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates LWOP's rise and continued expansion along several lines. First, the project examines historical uses of life sentencing in America as a means of identifying how LWOP is unique. Second, the project analyzes LWOP's current use, charting patterns in session laws and sentencing statistics across the fifty states and the federal system. Third, the project uses comparative state-level case studies to interrogate existing hypotheses that attribute LWOP's emergence to death penalty abolition efforts or mass incarceration policies: drawing from legislative history, judicial precedent, executive records, media coverage, and archival material, the project explores the state-level conditions and decisions responsible for differences in the sanction's timing, target, and intensity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is a subject that long went without close inspection in legal, sociological, and criminological scholarship. While life sentences have existed in some form throughout the history of the United States, what we understand today as "life without parole" or "LWOP"&mdash;a prison sentence under which a person convicted of a criminal offense has no reasonable expectation of being released during their natural life&mdash;is a recent phenomenon. A century, even several decades ago, the emergence of natural life imprisonment as a prominent and routine punishment would have been unexpected. Today, however, with 50,000-plus prisoners so sentenced and hundreds of laws authorizing it, LWOP is firmly entrenched in American policy making, in judicial and prosecutorial decisionmaking, and in public discourse. Just how this came to be, however, has not been carefully articulated or explained.  This doctoral dissertation relies on archival research to provide an empirically rooted, historical and sociological account of the transformations in laws, practices, and meanings that gave rise to LWOP during the last quarter of the twentieth century. The project is organized around three related questions. First, what is LWOP and how does it align with past practices that held prisoners for the remainder of their natural lives? Second, what conditions and processes produced LWOP in the United States at the end of the twentieth century? Third, what meanings and understandings in the penal and legal fields undergirded LWOP?s emergence? The research draws from multiple state archives, as well as the National Death Penalty Archive and the Library of Congress. Complementing the archival research with secondary materials, case law, state statutes, and news media, the study concentrates on the period from the early 1970s through the 1990s, formative years during which the current concept, practice, and sanction of LWOP gelled.  There are two prevailing narratives about LWOP?s rise. One of these narratives states that efforts to abolish capital punishment and the temporary invalidation of the death penalty by the United States Supreme Court in Furman v. Georgia (1972) sparked LWOP?s growth, in capital statutes as a replacement for the death penalty. Another narrative situates LWOP with tough-on-crime policy of the late 1980s and 1990s, in laws with harsh punishment as the primary aim. While death penalty abolition and tough-on-crime politics have a role in LWOP history, this study finds that LWOP?s emergence must be explained in significant part by other factors or, as in the case of Furman, by perceiving the conventional factors in a different light.  This study finds LWOP?s emergence between the 1970s and the early-to-mid 1990s to be the product of a unique historical intersection in which states had to deal with two large-scale transformations in the penal field: first, the reconfiguration of the death penalty into a narrower and more regulated mode and, second, the fall of the open-ended, discretion-based indeterminate sentencing approach that had held sway in most state criminal justice systems for most of the century. The manner in which states responded to those paradigm shifts -- a function of local institutional histories and political struggles -- laid a foundation that contributed to variation in the scope, timing, and prevalence of LWOP across states. Furman?s impact on LWOP, more than new death penalty statutes, was to influence the emergence of LWOP outside the capital arena. Governors, withdrawing the exercise of executive clemency, played a critical part in defining the context in which LWOP became recognized as meaningfully distinct from other life sentences. The United States Supreme Court, deciding on legal challenges provoked by these changes, solidified the image of LWOP as a distinct punishment that prevails today. The study also shows the autonomy of departments of corrections and prison administrators, and their stance on LWOP, as pivotal factors.  To be completed in 2018, the dissertation provides a core of new information, relevant for scholars, policy reformers, and legal professionals, about an extreme penal practice that has emerged and is expanding in the United States. Providing a detailed account of conditions and processes that produced LWOP as a distinct form of punishment in recent decades, the dissertation contributes to sociology of punishment research focused on how state-level variation complicates and differentiates the transmission of cultural, social, and political concerns into policy. The study has general implications for thinking on severe punishment, showing how severe punishments may be generated through divergent rationales and by reforms with aims that are not primarily punitive.
