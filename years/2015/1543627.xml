<AbstractNarration>Quantitative determination of the ambient temperatures at which rocks deform under different tectonic settings in the earth's crust is of critical importance for constraining thermo-mechanical modeling of the earth's tectonic plates, and their mechanical and thermal evolution.  Ambient deformation temperatures control the physical processes that govern deformation and the rates at which deformation occurs.  Pressure-Temperature-time (PTt) histories of rocks can be obtained from the compositions of minerals and mineral assemblages, through reaction equilibrium relations, but these determinations bear on the PT conditions of the mineral reactions, not necessarily those of deformation.  Development of thermometers that directly constrain conditions of deformation is important because temperatures indicated by deformation features and those indicated by equilibrium mineral assemblages may differ, recording different intervals of a rock's PTt history. In quartz-rich continental crust, two types of deformation thermometers (based on quartz recrystallization processes and crystallographic fabrics) have been used as analytical tools over the last two decades in a wide range of tectonic studies, assuming that temperature is the primary controlling factor in recrystallization regime and fabric development.  However, recrystallization regimes and fabric development may also be influenced by trace levels of water, and the effects of water on deformation mechanisms and fabric development may be of comparable importance to temperature. We propose to test, refine, and validate the deformation thermometers for quartz-bearing rocks and to examine those conditions under which water contents or variations in deformation rate need to be evaluated. We have chosen Himalayan and NW Scotland field areas as case studies because one of us has already collected extensive suites of appropriate oriented quartz-rich tectonites from these areas under prior NSF funding.  These samples have been deformed under a wide range of tectonic settings and deformation thermometry, together with more restricted compositionally based thermometry, have already been completed on many of these samples.  Deformation temperatures indicated by recrystallization regime and crystallographic fabrics in individual samples will be independently compared/tested by titanium-in-quartz thermometry, while the potential influence of water on recrystallization and crystallographic fabrics will be investigated by infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integration of theoretical concepts and analytical techniques developed in Geosciences and Materials Science over the last half century has led to major advances in our understanding of both the mechanisms by which rocks deform/flow and the influence of environmental factors such as temperature on flow in the earth's crust.  However the most commonly applied analytical techniques for determining the temperatures at which rocks now exposed at the earth's surface have been deformed are known to also be sensitive to fluctuations in chemically-induced weakening that may have occurred during deformation in the mineral grains making up the rock.  Thus, deformation temperatures calculated using these thermometers may be in error, and thermomechanical numerical models developed to simulate flow in the crust using such temperature data may give unrealistic results.  This project is designed to test the validity of these thermometers using a recently developed thermometer that takes such chemical processes in to account.  Rock samples collected under previous NSF funding from ancient mountain belts in the Himalaya and Scotland have been chosen as case studies, and the potential role of chemical weakening in these samples will also be evaluated using complementary analytical techniques.  These studies have important applications to plate tectonics and the results may change our understanding of the mechanical and thermal character of plates.  Plate thickness and strength were originally considered to be due solely to temperature and the geothermal gradient in the earth.  Our study addresses this concept and tests whether the internal strength of plates may also be influenced by water content, in addition to temperature. The project is a collaborative effort between researchers at Virginia Tech, Texas A&amp;M University and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In addition to the scientific goals of the project, this research is contributing to the training of Ph.D. students at Virginia Tech and Texas A&amp;M, and providing support for an early career post-doctoral researcher at RPI. Undergraduate students at all of the participating institutions will be involved in the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of the project was to develop methods that can be used to estimate the depths and temperature at which rocks are recrystallized.  There exists a complete spectrum of recrystallization conditions that range from static recrystallization (e.g. adjacent to an intrusion) to dynamic recrystallization in high-strain environments (e.g. in a fault or shear zone) in tectonically active areas, and recrystallization can occur over a wide range of temperatures.  The amount of titanium (Ti) contained in primary quartz can be used to estimate the depth (i.e. pressure, P) and temperature (T) at which quartz crystallizes.  The transport properties of Ti in single crystals of quartz and quartz polycrystals are well constrained, which makes it possible that observed concentration gradients of Ti in quartz-rich rocks can be used to estimate timescales events that caused changes in pressure and temperature in rocks.  Collectively, the Ti-in-quartz solubility and diffusion information can be used to develop detailed models of primary quartz crystallization, and any secondary changes in pressure or temperature that may occur during later geologic events.  Prior to this study the effects of recrystallization on trace element behavior in quartz had not been specifically studied.  Despite the lack of basic information on how static and/or dynamic recrystallization on Ti retention and uptake in quartz, numerous studies have used Ti-in-quartz as a thermobarometer to estimate the P&ndash;T conditions of deformation in quartzose rocks.   Jay Thomas? major objective was to experimentally investigate the effects of static and dynamic recrystallization on the retention and uptake of Ti in in quartz under ?wet? and ?dry? conditions.  Experiments were performed to investigate quartz recrystallization in static environments similar to those of contact aureoles adjacent to igneous rock contacts.  Additional high-stress and high-strain experiments were performed to study how dynamic recrystallization affects Ti content of quartz crystals in deformed rocks.     Quartz with prescribed Ti concentrations was synthesized over a range of P&ndash;T conditions to grow quartz crystals tailored for specific recrystallization experiments; quartz crystals contained ~250 to 400 ppm Ti. Titanium-in-quartz and Zr-in-rutile solubility models were used to cross check the accuracy of our experimental conditions.  Results from numerous synthesis experiments indicate that our equilibrium solubility models for Ti in quartz and Zr in rutile agree within ~5&deg;C and 500 bars of measured experimental conditions.       The synthesis and static recrystallization experiments were used to confirm that the Ti-in-quartz concentrations used to calibrate the P&ndash;T dependencies of Ti-in-quartz solubility in our original calibrations represent the equilibrium concentrations of Ti in quartz.  The recrystallization experiments demonstrate that Ti concentrations in quartz can be extensively and rapidly modified in wet and dry systems by dynamic grain boundary processes.  During the course of this study a new mechanism for forming rutilated quartz was discovered.    High-Ti quartz crystals recrystallized in ?dry? experiments were consumed by chemically induced grain-boundary migration, and the quartz adjusted its Ti concentration to the new P&ndash;T condition to rid itself of excess Ti to attain the equilibrium solubility Ti concentration for the imposed P&ndash;T condition.  In the dry experiments the Ti in excess of the solubility concentration was partitioned into the nominally anhydrous grain boundaries where rutile crystals formed at the new P&ndash;T condition.  New rutile crystals commonly grew along the length of grain boundaries in the dry experiments.  As grain boundary migration proceeded during microstructural development, rutile that crystallized along grain boundaries was commonly trapped to form rutilated quartz.  The interiors of recrystallized grains are thoroughly rutilated with acicular needles marking former grain boundaries.  Most rutile crystals are oriented parallel to existing grain boundaries, and commonly outline former grains that were consumed.   Experiments were performed to investigate the effects of dynamic recrystallization on the retention and uptake of Ti in in quartz.  The synthesized quartz crystals were mixed with Ti-free quartz matrix materials to mimic natural quartzites that contain quartz crystals derived from various geologic environments.  The quartzite analogs were then deformed in a Griggs device at constant P&ndash;T conditions to investigate the effect of deformation on Ti in quartz.  Optical microscopy, cathodoluminescence imaging and electron backscatter diffraction measurements were used to study Ti mobility and redistribution in a wide range of quartz microstructures that developed in the deformation experiments.  Cathodoluminescence imaging demonstrate that grain size reduction can significantly affect the Ti concentration of quartz.  Quartz crystals oriented with slip systems similar to the deformation direction form ribbons and retain Ti concentrations similar to the high-Ti starting material, but quartz that recrystallized by subgrain formation underwent extensive Ti loss to the system.  The results are the first of their kind, and our results will provide fundamental guidelines on how to apply trace element thermobarometers to deformed rocks.
