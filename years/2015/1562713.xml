<AbstractNarration>Rivers play an important role in the global carbon cycle that is not fully understood. This project will collect measurements of a form of carbon found in rivers to better understand how its storage varies across diverse biomes and geographic settings, river networks, and land-use histories. This information may improve predictions of the contribution of rivers to CO2 emissions and large scale carbon budgets. The project team will engage resource managers of the USDA Forest Service to inform their decision making, participate in the science learning network and seminar series of Olympic National Park, develop a website to disseminate research outcomes, train a graduate student, develop online, in-class, and public lectures on rivers, and develop educational materials in collaboration with a local 5th grade teacher that address the State of Colorado's common core standards for geomorphology and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to quantify hypothesized differences in riverine organic carbon (OC) storage as functions of position within the river drainage network, climate and biome, and land-use. It will develop a geomorphic context for understanding watershed-scale OC dynamics that could inform future estimates of OC budgets and CO2 emissions from land. The primary objectives are to quantitatively assess (1) downstream patterns of OC storage in floodplain sediment and downed wood within mountainous river networks draining up to about 400 km2, (2) compare the OC dynamics of disparate mountain river basins to assess the sensitivity of mountain river basins to potential changes in OC storage that could affect global climate, and (3) compare magnitudes of OC storage between otherwise similar mountainous river networks that differ with respect to land use. A fourth objective is to estimate age of OC in river corridors.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This project examined how the amount of carbon stored along rivers varies with climate, land use, and distance downstream. We measured stored carbon from the headwaters to the base of the mountains along river networks in northern Wyoming and western Washington. We found that wide, gentle valley bottoms store more carbon, primarily in the form of carbon in soil. Steeper, narrower valley bottoms are more likely to store carbon in the form of downed wood. The ability of the channel and floodplain to trap wood moving down the river and store the wood for hundreds of years depends strongly on the heterogeneity of the river. Rivers with islands, bars, and side channels, for example, are much more efficient at trapping and storing wood. River basins with wetter climates store more carbon in soil than do river basins with semiarid climates. River basins with a history of commercial logging store only about half as much carbon in the form of downed wood as river basins that have never been logged. The amount of carbon per unit area of valley bottom does not increase consistently downstream. Instead, the local details of the width and depth of soil on the floodplain and the trapping potential for large wood are far more important in controlling the amount of carbon stored within each portion of a river valley.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/03/2020<br>      Modified by: Ellen&nbsp;E&nbsp;Wohl</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1562713/1562713_10408308_1591190893418_image--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1562713/1562713_10408308_1591190893418_image--rgov-800width.jpg" title="carbon stock in study areas"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1562713/1562713_10408308_1591190893418_image--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="carbon stock in study areas"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This figure illustrates the spatial variations in amount of carbon stored in river valleys in the study areas.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Scott and Wohl, in press, Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, https://doi.org/10.1002/esp.4855</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ellen&nbsp;E&nbsp;Wohl</div> <div class="imageTitle">carbon stock in study areas</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
