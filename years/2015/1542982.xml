<AbstractNarration>Computing has become an integral part of everyday practice within modern fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. As a result, the STEM+Computing Partnerships (STEM+C) program seeks to advance new multidisciplinary approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning, and discipline-specific efforts in computing designed to build an evidence base for teaching and learning of computer science in K-12, including within diverse populations. This project addresses that mission by developing and testing computing-based science investigations for an Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles course, and for additional learning modules for use by teachers and students in middle school and high school not engaged in AP courses.  The project will be implemented through a state-wide network of schools in Rhode Island having diverse student populations, and will provide professional development experiences for teachers in participating schools.  The learning modules to be developed will integrate use of data and observations with computing to create conceptual models that simulate or predict natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, coastal resiliency, trends in the spread of infectious diseases, bioaccumulation of toxins in fish, the incidence of radon in homes, or other phenomena associated with emerging societal issues.       &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This design and development project will develop at least six proof-of-concept computing-based scientific investigations for use in science or computing classes.  The investigations will each be grounded in the core science fields (life sciences, physical sciences, or Earth and space sciences), but the content and implications of the learning modules will span a broad range of interdisciplinary topics that focus on societal issues or potential hazards that require behavioral or engineering solutions.  Each topic will require students to access data from science or engineering publications, or from national data archives maintained by agencies such as NASA, NIH, NOAA, or USGS, and incorporate these data into the development or testing of their conceptual or computer models of natural phenomena.  The investigations will be aligned with performance expectations advocated by the Next Generation Science Standards for disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and science and engineering practices.  Research questions for the project will focus on student and teacher skills in using computational thinking to understand, learn, or teach; the influence of computational thinking on attitudes toward science, engineering, and computing; and factors influencing the learning and teaching of computational thinking.  The learning modules to be developed will first be piloted within AP courses having diverse student populations at three Career and Technical Centers, with subsequent implementations in schools throughout the collaboration network.  Data for project research and evaluation activities will be gathered from higher education partners, assessments embedded within the investigation activities themselves, and classroom surveys and assessments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  As  K-12 students become more comfortable with computing, an emerging national trend in education is to include computing in the K-12 curriculum both as its own discipline and as a support for other STEM disciplines.  The specific goals of this STEM+C project were:   A diverse population of students improve their science learning using computing.   A diverse population of students improve their computer science learning.   A cadre of teachers has the capacity to teach computing.   A diverse population of are interested in STEM and/or Computer Science (CS) fields and careers.   Contribute to the evidence base of successful practices.   In its 6 years this project achieved the following:  It created computing-based science investigations (CBSIs) that integrate computing skills such as programming and data computation, with the learning of science to both make learning of computer science increasingly more relevant through contextually rich science activities, and to assist K-12 schools in their struggle to meet the computing aspects of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) standards. The CBSIs and computing education modules are designed as a proof of concept so that other educators can easily leverage the results of this project to design their own computing course and CBSIs for science classes.   It created an Intro To Computing high school course curriclumn to provide students the skills needed in the CBSIs. It also created English Language Learner support for the curriculum in response to better support for racial/ethnic minorities requested by our pilot teachers. It trained K-8 teachers to teach the CS/CT skills necessary to prepare high school students for the CS/CT curricula developed on this project. It trained school district administrators in implementing CS and Computational Thinking (CT) in their districts. It trained school counselors in how to advise studentst to participate in CS/CT education, with a particular emphasis on broadening participation in computing (BPC).  Intellectual Merit.  This project combined best practices in science education with current and emerging development of K-12 computing education. The CBSIs embody the NGSS goal of students having opportunities to investigate natural phenomena and construct knowledge using inquiry-based self-affected learning that accurately represents scientific processes. The CBSIs use a Knowledge Integration framework, a fruitful synthesis of extensive research in technology-enhanced STEM learning. The computing education developed on this project and integrated into the CBSIs is based on the foundation of computational thinking and current development in the computer science education community of framework and K-12 courses in computer science principles.  The teacher professional development (PD), which is uses a Resource Team model involving a K-12 Master Teacher and higher education faculty working together, and the Master Teacher supporting other teachers, is based on education research and development of an approach called technological pedagogical content knowledge.  The resulting CBSIs provide both relevance to students learning computing, and an exciting new way to investigate scientific discovery and analysis through computing. Broader Impact. The CBSI and the Intro To Computing curricula developed on this project have been released free on the RITES+C portal ritesc.org and on the University of Rhode Island (URI) website k12.cs.uri.edu. The project has trained over 200 teachers who have directly helped over 10,000 students increase their CS/CT knowledge and skills. The student demographics show that over 40% of the affected students are female, over 40% are from racial/ethnic minorities, and over 40% are classified as economically disadvantaged.  This STEM+C project's public dissemination of its developed curricula, cadre of trained teachers, and its establishment of the curricula in RI schools, all will help ensure the impacts of the project continue now that it is complete.
