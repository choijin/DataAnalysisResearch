<AbstractNarration>There is a need for highly precise, real time, fine grained spatiotemporal sampling of the ocean environment, which forms the vast majority of the surface area of our planet, but yet is 90% unexplored. Current methods such as remote telemetry and sequential local sensing cannot satisfy current requirements, let alone future ones. The notion of an underwater network is relatively new due to the lack of maturity of underwater acoustic communications. And yet, networks are critical in order to achieve the monitoring goals noted above. The Ninth ACM International Conference on Underwater Networks &amp; Systems (WUWNet?14), to be held in Rome, Italy, is a leading conference showcasing research in this area, and features a rich technical program, including technical sessions, keynote speeches as well as poster and demo sessions. This award will promote student participation in WUWNet'14 by supporting their travel and registration costs to the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference attendance is a crucial part of the life of a researcher. By creating new opportunities for students (especially those from under-represented groups) to attend a high-quality conference, this project will benefit the research community in several ways. The students themselves benefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with many other researchers in a favorable setting, and from attending research presentations that may be related to their research areas.  The research community also benefits by training the next generation of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award has allowed total of six graduate students who are conducting research in underwater communications and networking to attend The Ninth ACM International Conference on Underwater Networks &amp; Systems (WUWNetÆ14) to present their accepted papers. The conference took place in Rome Italy on November 12 - 14, 2014. The conference venue has consisted of technical paper presentations, invited paper presentations, research demonstrations, and poster sessions. The conference also featured keynote speeches from leading researchers and practitioners.  WUWNet 2014Æs travel award program recognizes that, while graduate students are an important segment of the research community, they often have limited sources of funds for travel to conferences.  Each student travel award helped cover the costs related to student travel (economy airfare), lodging for up to three nights, meals per-diem, and conference registration fees.  Participating in technical conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, as it provides students with the opportunity to interact with senior researchers and peer graduate students, to be exposed to leading edge work in the field, and to take part in discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field (e.g., in terms of technology, standards, open research problems, current and future application requirements).
