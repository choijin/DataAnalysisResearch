<AbstractNarration>PI: Davis, James F.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 1523237&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In October 2014, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) released the report of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) 2.0 Committee entitled, "Advancing U.S. Advance Manufacturing". The report motivates next generation advanced manufacturing focusing on enabling innovation, securing the talent pipeline and improving the business climate for U.S. growth and competitiveness. The report further identifies and recommends the alignment of efforts and resources to address next generation advanced manufacturing IT infrastructure technologies critical to U.S. competitiveness, encompassing growth, dynamic performance, energy and material usage, environmental sustainability and zero incidents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Sensing, Control and Platforms for Manufacturing (ASCPM) and Visualization, Informatics and Digital Manufacturing Technologies (VIDM) were established as comprehensive technology priorities. This workshop will emphasize the real-time sensing, control, platform and human systems models and cyber technologies, i.e. ASCPM, important to the actual manufacturing process and how these are mutually linked with digital design and manufacturing, i.e. VIDM. The workshop will bring together research and industrial experts from a cross section of continuous, batch, discrete and hybrid manufacturing structure interests who are also involved in the application of real-time enterprise smart and digital manufacturing technologies including real-time process management and control, simulation and modeling and data analysis and supply chain management, product and production design and optimization, An important objective is to understand how these interlinked cyber technologies are appropriately balanced and integrated for process and discrete product industry applications with a view toward next generation manufacturing technology trends. Invited speakers with expertise in advanced sensor, control, platform, automation and design systems across manufacturing structures will set the stage for a workshop that will develop priorities about the intersection of these technologies from research, development and delivery viewpoints. The workshop will focus on ASCPM and VIDM modeling, and summarize SM Platform integration and scaling of modeling and operational deployment to stimulate thinking within and across the areas of Smart and Manufacturing. The workshop will motivate next generation advanced manufacturing that focuses on enabling innovation, securing the talent pipeline and improving the business climate for U.S. growth and competitiveness through uncovering how these interlinked cyber technologies are appropriately balanced and integrated for process and discrete product industry applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Smart Manufacturing and Digital Manufacturing are the evolving descriptors for the business and operational application of advanced cyber technologies in manufacturing. The term æManufacturingÆ refers to anything that is æmadeÆ - energy, chemicals, materials, and objects. A workshop was held on February 23-24, 2015 in Atlanta GA, bringing together experts in smart manufacturing and digital manufacturing, industry, and academia, cutting across the sectors of continuous, batch, discrete and hybrid manufacturing. The workshop objectives were to build a common understanding and use of terminology and to then delineate research areas and opportunities with greater precision.  A  report entitled, "NSF Workshop on Research needs in Advanced Sensors, Controls, Platforms, and Modeling (ASCPM) for Smart Manufacturing" has been published and is available at https://smartmanufacturingcoalition.org/sites/default/files/smlc_nsf_workshop_report.pdf.  The workshop report is an independently developed assessment and summary of the results reflecting a consensus by each breakout group on relevant definitions and research areas and their scope. A key outcome of this workshop is the expression of the report structure itself &ndash; (1) the semantics of Smart Manufacturing and Digital Manufacturing, (2) the fundamental role of modeling and (3) the particular descriptions of the ASCPM research areas.  The workshop addressed the following key ten questions about advanced sensors, controls, platforms, and modeling (ASCPM) for Smart Manufacturing:  (1)      What are crisp definitions/meanings that capture the semantics of advanced manufacturing: Sensing, Control, Automation, Platform, Visualization, Informatics, Digital Thread, Design vs. Operations, Life Cycle, Model Integration  (2)      What are key attributes that define Smart Manufacturing vs. Digital Manufacturing?  (3)      What modeling, data and infrastructure elements overlap and/or intersect?  (4)      What are the key fundamental research challenges in sensors and monitoring, controls and processes, platforms and standards, and supply chains and scheduling; and how do they relate to different manufacturing and enterprise structures &ndash; continuous, batch and discrete (building off AMP 2.0 workgroup summaries - https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/amp20_report_final.pdf)?  (5)      What roles do models play in addressing research challenges?  (6)      What are the needs in visualization and data informatics in each area?  (7)      How do research needs impact platform infrastructure requirements?  (8)      What are the potential impacts of ASCPM R &amp; D on energy efficiency/carbon emissions, environment and safety?  (9)      What are compelling industrial vignettes for ASCPM successes?  (10)   What are the sensor, control, platform and software barriers to achieving success?  The Appendices included in this report contain particularly valuable detailed information and insights. Great care was taken to include the direct results in the Appendices from each of many breakout sessions designed to bring different viewpoints together in answering specific questions. The reader is encouraged to validate the summary with the detailed results in the Appendices.       Last Modified: 02/08/2016       Submitted by: James F Davis]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
