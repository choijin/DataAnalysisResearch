<AbstractNarration>This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project will expand a highly successful graduation and retention program for chemistry majors to all STEM majors at the University of West Florida and develop a smaller cohort of 28 academically talented, low income students. The project will focus on student engagement in the context of (a) academic and social integration, (b) knowledge and skill development, (c) support and motivation, and (d) monitoring and advising. A key feature of the project is the new STEM for Life seminar series designed to prepare students for academic success and future careers. A systematic examination of the factors influencing STEM student retention at this regional, comprehensive institution, with a high percentage of commuter students, will be conducted using data collected as part of the project evaluation. The location of the institution in a county of low average income where only 26% of the population holds a bachelor's degree or higher provides an opportunity to decrease the local college attainment gap while at the same time addressing the national need to increase the number of American scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the College Strengths Inventory, the project team will create individual support and intervention plans that will be implemented and revised as needed throughout each student's college career. The STEM for Life seminar, which will serve as a platform for skill building and career readiness, will also be used to manage individual plan advisory discussions and goal setting. Outcomes evaluation will address the extent to which the project retention and graduation goals are met. Process evaluation will determine the extent to which the project is delivering high quality academic and social supports. Research will focus on understanding which set of S-STEM activities are most influential for student retention with an emphasis on the effectiveness of the seminar series. The research results will inform the institution's efforts to coordinate student development programs that use early identifiers and proactive interventions. The data will be disseminated at PKAL and Gordon conferences to bridge gaps in best practices designed for moderately selective, regional comprehensive state institutions with a high percentage of commuter and working STEM students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Default"><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> S-STEM Scholars was a College-wide program, informed by the previous results from Chem Scholars. S-STEM Scholars supported 25 first-time-in-college (FTIC) academically competent students (beginning their freshman year through graduation). All of these students were financially disadvantaged and more than 60% were underrepresented, with 40% Pell-eligible, 36% from ethnically underrepresented backgrounds and 32% females in a Math, Engineering, Physics, or Computer Science degree. A novel STEM for Life Seminar series, an eight-semester sequence of courses, was implemented to create a cohort experience while simultaneously providing professional development and mentoring necessary to mitigate the aforementioned known risk factors. The PI team collaborated with campus offices to ensure academic resources were provided at critical times. A STEM Living Learning Community (STEM LLC) was also established in collaboration with the UWF Hal Marcus College of Science and Engineering (HMCSE) to further increase Scholar?s success and broadly impact more UWF STEM students. The STEM LLC launched in 2016 with 63 students and has now served approximately 500 total students. Table 1 shows the retention and 4 and 5-year graduation results for S-STEM Scholars. (Table 1 includes data for one student who transferred to a different institution after year 2 and graduated in 4 years with a STEM degree.) Figure 1 shows the retention of S-STEM Scholars in comparison to students who lived in the LLC, HMCSE students and UWF students. It is noteworthy that 75% (3 of the 4) of the students not retained in year 1 were due to severe mental health reasons. Additionally, more than 90% of S-STEM Scholars dealt with some form of mental health barriers as students at UWF. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>Figure 2 shows the magnitude of S-STEM Scholars? impact when comparing all FTIC 2016 students who completed their degree at UWF in 4 years. The data compares all FTIC students who started college at UWF in fall 2016 and graduated in 4-years, where 64% of S-STEM Scholars completed a degree at UWF and 56% of S-STEM Scholars completed a STEM degree at UWF as compared to 32% of HMCSE/STEM students completed a degree at UWF (not necessarily in STEM), and 37% of all majors completed a degree at UWF. These 4-year graduation rates demonstrate the impact of a comprehensive program like S-STEM Scholars on helping students succeed, especially given the high risk of attrition for S-STEM Scholars. The 4-year STEM graduation rates for FTIC 2016 students living in the STEM LLC, even for one semester, was 11% higher than their HMCSE peers, demonstrating that even a moderate level of program support impacts student success. Not surprisingly, of the 84% (21/25) retained into year 2, 86% and 95% completed STEM or an undergraduate degree, respectively, within 5 years at UWF, which shows the importance of retaining students in year 1. S-STEM Scholars were also well prepared for life beyond UWF. Upon graduation, 68% (17/25) have entered the STEM workforce or a MS/PhD program, which is 81% (17/21) of the 21 retained into year 2. This is also during a global pandemic! These data demonstrate the increased success in high-risk students when provided early and often, critical academic support and professional development resources paired with thorough monitoring, advising and mentoring.</p> <p class="Default">The lessons learned through this funding center around communication, securing buy-in, and preparation for mental health barriers. Our students needed us to balance their emotional needs while helping them build the skills necessary to succeed through and beyond undergrad, especially given their non-academic hurdles/pressures typical for disadvantaged students. Thankfully, our first semester external evaluation clearly showed the student perception and their frustration. Engaging with our external evaluator during the first semester was critical to our students (and thereby program) success. Student feedback was also critical to revising the proposed STEM for Life Seminar curriculum and ensure the topics covered were relevant to students? perspective while preparing them for the ?real-world?. Through these conversations we learned <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></em> of our S-STEM Scholars suffered from some form on mental health barriers through anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, etc. Though academic support was critical the success of our previous S-STEM, mental health created debilitating barriers that often determined whether students persisted and graduated or not. S-STEM Scholars? perspectives validate the program?s importance, where 100% reported that the financial aid was helpful but the program support, mentoring/advising, and professional development is what contributed most to their success. Over the 5-years, 100% of S-STEM Scholars battled some form of debilitating mental health. This clearly demonstrates the necessity to integrate mental health and wellness into support programs like S-STEM Scholars. The program and mental health components informed UWF and other institutions around the country as we all begin responding to the anticipated black hole of COVID-19 effects on our school and college age population for decades to come.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/28/2021<br>      Modified by: Karen&nbsp;S&nbsp;Molek</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564392/1564392_10416497_1627502594620_OutcomesFigure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564392/1564392_10416497_1627502594620_OutcomesFigure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564392/1564392_10416497_1627502594620_OutcomesFigure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2: Comparison of 4-year graduation rates for 2016 FTIC students at UWF.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Karen Sinclair Molek</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Karen&nbsp;S&nbsp;Molek</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564392/1564392_10416497_1627502453737_OutcomesTable1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564392/1564392_10416497_1627502453737_OutcomesTable1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Table 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564392/1564392_10416497_1627502453737_OutcomesTable1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Table 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">S-STEM Scholar Results</div> <div class="imageCredit">Karen Sinclair Molek</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Karen&nbsp;S&nbsp;Molek</div> <div class="imageTitle">Table 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564392/1564392_10416497_1627502532359_OutcomesFigure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564392/1564392_10416497_1627502532359_OutcomesFigure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1564392/1564392_10416497_1627502532359_OutcomesFigure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: Year 1 to Year 2 retention rates of 2016 FTIC students at UWF.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Karen Sinclair Molek</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Karen&nbsp;S&nbsp;Molek</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
