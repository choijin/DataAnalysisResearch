<AbstractNarration>PI: Qutub, Amina    &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1533708&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to develop a robust theory of how single neural cells form electrically active networks. The project integrates emerging methods in computer science, systems biology, neuroengineering and developmental biology to offer insight into the brain's organization. Results of experiments performed in this project have the potential to impact the design of new computing devices, a $300B industry. Methods introduced by the investigators can be used broadly by scientists to rapidly characterize brain cells, and can aid in the discovery of new therapies for neurological diseases, which affect 1 in 6 people worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neural differentiation, the process of neural progenitor cells transforming into neurons, holds the key to understanding the brain's ability to self-repair. Understanding this complex process can inform us how the structure of neural networks relates to their function, which is an important unsolved problem in neuroengineering. This project's ultimate goal is a mechanistically-detailed theory of how neural networks form as a result of decisions made by single neural progenitor cells.  Integrating methods from three disciplines (systems biology, nanotechnology and developmental biology), the investigators will identify single cell features critical to network formation, and predict how heterogeneity and noise in the cell population defines the network's function. The investigators will employ three emerging methods (proteomic barcoding, ImageOmics, and E-phFACS) to define neural cell phenotypes as a function of chemical signaling, morphology and electrical activity (Aim 1). Observed changes in these single cell phenotypes will be mapped to neural network formation by coupling a state machine model with a graph-based analysis (Aim 2). The effects of cell heterogeneity will be explored computationally using a new framework developed by the investigators and iteratively compared to in vitro live-imaging assays, and in vivo assays. The tight coupling of chemical, morphological and electrical measurements enabled by the technologies introduced here, can be broadly applicable paradigm for integrative scientific research. Understanding how cells interact to form neural networks has relevance to organism development and tissue engineering. State-machines can be adapted across tissues and species to develop theories of cell decision-making. The phenotyping tools that correlate electrophysiology and protein expression with multi-cellular network topology will provide a powerful resource for neurobiologists. Furthermore, the E-phFACS device provides a high-throughput way to record electrical activity and sort cells. To further engage the scientific community, the investigators will (1) provide an open source ImageOmics platform and (2) host an international crowd-sourced neuronal network Design Challenge.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A conversation over coffee connects you to a new neighbor. Twitter lets you quickly share news to strangers. A hug comforts your mom. We favor some forms of communication over others based on our relationships, and what information we want to convey. Cells in our body also have multiple forms of communication: biochemical, mechanical, and electrical. And like us, they vary their mode of communication depending on context and who they are communicating with.</p> <p>Cellular communication and an ability to switch modes of communication is particularly critical during processes of tissue growth and regeneration ? like during an infant?s development, following a traumatic brain injury or during recovery from a stroke. Understanding cell communication can help provide new treatments for the &gt;50M worldwide suffering from neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, yet much about the way human cells communicate and interact is still unknown. This is particularly true of brain cells, whose development and communication has eluded study because of challenges of access (deep within the human skull), limited techniques to characterize them, and lack of a paradigm to understand how they develop into functional neural networks.</p> <p>This three-year project ?Identifying Design Principles of Neural Cells? addressed this gap by developing a robust theory of how single neural stem cells form networks. To achieve this goal, we designed quantitative live-imaging technologies and introduced a mathematical framework (<em>Living Neural Networks</em>) that enabled us to identify how human neural cells communicate with neighboring cells electrically, chemically and mechanically as they differentiate into immature neurons and form neural networks (Figure 1).</p> <p>The project?s impact stems from (1) the development and validation of the <em>Living Neural Networks</em> approach, the coupled computational-experimental framework to characterize neural network formation (Figures 1-4); (2) the discovery that healthy human neurons follow a distinct pattern of development that can be described mathematically (Figures 3 and 4), and that cells derived from children with a neurodevelopmental disorder develop networks in a notably different manner, and (3) new open source tools, crossdisciplinary research collaborations among the investigators, and interdisciplinary training workshops for the biosciences, computational biology and neuroengineering communities (Figures 5 and 6).</p> <p>The overall result of the project ? <strong>a new paradigm for how human neurons form</strong> ? makes this work transformative for neuroengineering by providing a better understanding of the human nervous system, a toolset to study key parts of brain cell communication with quantitative precision, and a new method to screen therapies for neurological disorders in a manner that is specific to an individual. The study was made possible by multiple technological innovations, including three computational tools which are being disseminated to the public online for broad use in processing images and biomedical data in a user-friendly manner (Figure 5). Results of this project and the related new technologies are providing the foundation for new bio-inspired artificial intelligence algorithms and studies that link human neural network formation to daily cognitive behaviors.</p> <p>In summary, this work broke new ground in understanding how human neural stem cells switch between biochemical, mechanical and electrical forms of communication as they develop into neural networks (<em>Intellectual Merit</em>), while contributing a suite of new experimental and computational methods and interdisciplinary training workshops to characterize human cells (<em>Broader Impacts</em>). &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Amina&nbsp;Qutub</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1533708/1533708_10385984_1540847847085_Figure1_LivingNeuralNetworks--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1533708/1533708_10385984_1540847847085_Figure1_LivingNeuralNetworks--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Schematic of the Living Neural Networks methodology"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1533708/1533708_10385984_1540847847085_Figure1_LivingNeuralNetworks--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Schematic of the Living Neural Networks methodology"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Human stem cells are studied in this project through live time-lapse imaging as they form neurons.
