<AbstractNarration>This study examines the use of verbal -s (the non-standard application of -s on present tense verbs) in African-American English (AAE). AAE speakers are asked to judge when verbal -s is most appropriate, and also to provide information via rating tasks about their beliefs regarding the frequency of their own use of verbal -s, the frequency of its use in their surrounding communities, and their beliefs about who in the African-American AAE-speaking community is more likely to use verbal -s. In order to gather these data, a survey will be carried out in which participants read brief scenarios and choose, for each one, whether a given follow-up sentence presented to them is more appropriate with or without verbal -s. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factors to be investigated include those which past research has hinted at being influential.  Grammatical factors include speaker affect, the attitude or emotion that a speaker brings to an utterance, and habitual aspect, which distinguishes states and ongoing actions from repetitive actions.  Non-grammatical factors include age and gender of participants, as well as geographical region, which will be investigated by conducting the survey in four locations: California, Ohio, New York, and Texas. This study thus provides evidence as to whether verbal -s can have an affective and/or aspectual connotation in a way that past production-based studies have struggled to account for. It will also provide a regional perspective, which has been lacking in AAE studies for some time. The large number of participants and consideration of other social factors will also make this a valuable study with reliable results. The results of this study should help to address the misperceptions about non-standard varieties in general and African American English in particular.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 1. Intellectual Merit  This study demonstrates the potential for the grammaticalization of emotivity in language. More specifically, and equally important, it demonstrates the use of emotive grammatical inflection on present tense verbs in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE).   The grammatical expression of emotivity is still a debated issue in the linguistics community. In language, we see emotion expressed through tone of voice, physical gestures and/or by directly refering to the emotion with a word (e.g. "happy" or "sad"). This is because it is believed that grammar is a strictly cognitive phenomenon, and so while emotions can be referenced, they cannot be directly expressed via the grammar, so it was thought.  But this study not only shows evidence that emotions can indeed be expressed grammatically, but also the phenomenon is demonstrated in a manner that is substantially more objective than past research, which usually entails subjectively choosing when a grammatical feature is used to express emotion and attempting to justify that emotive label through reasoning. Here  a survey was performed and participants were to choose the most appropriate contexts to use verbal -s, which to a significant level, ended up being cases where strong emotion was being expressed.  Moreover, the grammatical forms that have been identified thus far are usually expressed via noun inflection or syntactically (word order). This study adds to our knowledge of grammatical emotivity by demonstrating that it can be used in verbal inflection as well.  2. Broader Impacts  In terms of broader importance, this study has added substantial evidence that the non-concord -s marker in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is in fact rule-governed and therefore grammatical. Scholars have struggled for quite some time to identify all of the grammatical contexts under which it is used and its potential to express emotion may be the final factor not accounted for. With that being said, we now have yet more evidence that AAVE is a rule-governed system of communication that should be respected by speakers of other dialects of English.  The tendancy is to treat people differently when we believe they are speaking "broken English" but evidence has been building for over 50 years that AAVE is not broken, but instead that it is both very grammatical and very ancient: two features that help to win it much respect among college (and potentially high school) students in the classroom when they learn about features of AAVE such as verbal -s.
