<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL AND TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $9,000 are requested to cover the registration costs of eight US based participants in the 2016 Polymer Physics Gordon Research Conference (GRC)and associated Gordon Research Symposium (GRS) to be held on July 23-24 (GRS) and July 24-19 (GRC) at Mt Holyoke College in South Hadley MA. The combined GRC/GRS conference/seminar are held every other year. The Polymer Physics GRC is an important venue for scientific exchange in this interdisciplinary field. New experimental, simulation, and theoretical developments in both existing and emerging areas in polymer physics will be emphasized with particular focus on the influence of structure and interactions on macroscopic behavior. The associated GRS provides a complementary venue for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to interact with senior mentors, and with one another, to cultivate scientific exchange  and collaborations. The themed GRC technical sessions will cover each of the following areas: Crystallization and Crystalline Polymers; Polymer-Polymer phase behavior; Structured Polymer Conductors; Block Copolymer Thin Films; Segmental, Chain and Ion Dynamics; Confined Polymers; Nanocomposites; and Ionomers. The GRS will be held the weekend before the GRC. It will comprise twelve talks delivered by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and two poster sessions, reporting on their research, and will include a panel discussion featuring senior scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Polymer Physics were held at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts from July 23-29, 2016.   The joint meetings covered a variety of scientific topics and the content presented was highly rated by participants; the 2016 GRC had a focus on "Emerging Topics in the Behavior of Neat and Hybrid Polymer Materials", while the 2016 GRS was entitled "Building and Leveraging a Nanoscopic Understanding of Polymer Physics".  Both meetings were well attended (197 at the GRC, 69 at the GRS; the site attendance caps were reached well before the start of the events), and were highly rated by participants.  Polymer physics? broad and interdisciplinary spectrum of research impacts every industrial and manufacturing sector, from electronics to transportation to energy production.     The 2016 GRC focused on the latest research in both neat polymers (crystallization and crystalline polymers; segmental, chain, and ion dynamics; confined polymers) and hybrid polymer-based materials (polymer-polymer phase behavior; structured polymer conductors; block copolymer thin films; nanocomposites; ionomers). New developments from experiment, theory, and simulation were featured, with nineteen full-length lectures, as well as a session on "Future Directions in Polymer Physics," featuring shorter talks from six younger independent investigators. In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. Poster sessions and informal activities provided ample opportunity to share and discuss the latest advances in polymer physics with the speakers, poster presenters, and other conference attendees.  The Gordon Research Seminar on Polymer Physics is a unique forum for graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education to present and exchange new data and cutting edge ideas.  The focus of this meeting highlighted the work of the next generation of polymer scientists and engineers in areas of current interest such as copolymers, polymer glasses, conducting polymers, and nanoscale assembly. The meeting culminated in a panel discussion on "Finding Your Niche" in the field of polymer physics. The financial support from the National Science Foundation was critical to the success of these joint meetings, which have advanced the frontiers of science worldwide.  In addition to its direct effect, the early and generous NSF support greatly facilitated the successful solicitation of contributions from 12 private sources, which collectively enabled a larger, more diverse, and more successful program than would ever have been possible in the absence of NSF support.
