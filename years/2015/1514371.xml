<AbstractNarration>Aggressive scaling of CMOS technology and concomitant inventions of nanoscale nascent technologies have fueled the growth of computer, information, communication and consumer electronics industries of the 21st Century by leveraging the ground-breaking discoveries in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The workhorse of multibillion-dollar semiconductor industry, the CMOS technology is approaching its scaling limit due to the strong quantum-mechanical effects present at the nanoscale. To sustain the accelerated pace of economic growth during the post-CMOS era, this multi-university collaborative research proposal envisages building the roadmap of VLSI technology in two significant ways. First, the research is mooted to extend quantum transport principles to simulate emerging nano-devices based on novel semiconductor and 2-D layered materials by exploiting non-charge based degrees of freedom, electron spin controlled magnetization, interaction between electromagnetic waves and semiconductors in metamaterial structures, and topological states in topological insulators. Second, the research will systematically scale these properties from their fundamental atomistic limits to circuit level integration by developing industry-graded SPICE-compatible compact models for heterogeneous circuits that will define the landscape of beyond Moore?s Law VLSI systems. Integrative education, training, and outreach activities envisioned in this collaborative proposal will encompass K-12, undergraduate, graduate, female, minority, and postdoctoral fellows by leveraging the existing outreach activities of participating universities in order to advance science and engineering education in broader segments of the society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using density-functional theory (DFT), time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), time-dependent density-matrix functional theory (TD-DMFT), to phenomenological Extended Huckel to effective mass, in conjunction with non-equilibrium Green?s function (NEGF) methods, quantum field theory, and finite-difference time domain (FDTD) methods, a wide variety of computational methods are going to be developed to tackle the modeling of multiscale circuits in future VLSI systems. The software packages and multiscale modeling tools resulting from the proposed research activity are going to provide computer chip designers and manufacturers the ability to model complex hybrid substrates comprising nanoscale electronic, spintronic, opto-electronic, and plasmonic devices. The resulting software is going to be written with a view to enabling researchers from universities and practicing engineers in industries to develop their own modules that will engender improved system functionality, integration density, and operational speed.</AbstractNarration>

Major Activities: During the last year the main effort was concentrated on investigating properties of interconnect based on spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPP):  Transport properties and information capacity The effect of process variation on performance The dual electro-optical operating regimes  Specific Objectives:  1.1  Investigate the dynamic properties of the SSPP-based interconnect  1.2  Uncover physical mechanisms determining the performance of the SSPP-based interconnect  1.3  Establish theoretical limits on the information transfer capability of SSPP interconnect  2.1 Investigate the performance degradation in SSPP with statistical geometrical variations  2.2 Develop a technique for restoring the signal integrity  3.1 Investigate the possibility to employ the inherently dual character of SSPP  3.2 Develop a foundation for hybrid electro-optical interconnect Significant Results:  It is shown that the SSPP waveguides present an implementation of a hybrid electro-optical channel capable of operating in two different regimes over the same physical channel. Since the backbone of the SSPP waveguide is a conducting surface, it can operate as a conventional, RC-limited, electrical communication channel. On the other hand, since its geometrical pattern supports bound states of the electromagnetic field, it can serve as an optic-like channel not bounded by the capacitance. When the SSPP interconnect operates in a native mode (by transferring a signal encoded in SSPP), its performance, measured by the spatial bandwidth density, is determined by the interplay of two factors. On the one hand, the bandwidth increases with the size of the spectral region, which can be used for encoding information.
