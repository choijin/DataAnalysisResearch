<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Auburn University, located in Auburn, AL, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2017-2019. Undergraduate students will participate in research projects in computational biology/bioinformatics. Students will work with faculty mentors on projects involving functional, evolutionary, environmental, and speciation genomics, among other topics using large-scale computational analyses. Several professional development activities are associated with the training program such as a summer-long writing workshop, computational skills training, graduate school preparation and planning as well as training and mentoring in the responsible conduct of research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. There is a particular focus on increasing the participation of underserved groups in computational biology research. Students will learn how research is conducted, and will present the results of their work at scientific conferences including a capstone research symposium with other summer undergraduate research program participants at Auburn. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine student career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting www.auburn.edu/bioinformatics/nsf_reu.htm or by contacting the PI Dr. Leslie Goertzen at bioinformatics@auburn.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Auburn University conducted a highly successfull program geared towards providing research experience in computational biology to a diverse group of undergraduate students from across the country.  From hundreds of applicants each year we selected on average 10 students each year for three summers (2017-2019) to join the labs of diverse research faculty in multiple units across the Auburn campus.  Students were provided with in-depth training in genomics, unix command line computation, bioinformatics, physical computing and microcontrollers.  Lectures and lab sessions were held to accomplish this training, including an intense week of primer courses when they first arrive.  The students were also supported by our funding to attend the Bioinformatics Bootcamp held each year at Auburn University, where they were the sole undergraduate participants working and learning alongside faculty, post-docs and graduate students representing universities from 14 countries and 4 continents.   Additional emphases were placed on professional development of the student participants throughout the three years of our funding.  We held weekly, informal, career-focussed luncheons where students could interact with faculty and post-doc guest speakers and learn about various paths they could take in science.  Students also participated in an intensive summer-long workshop called "Communicating in the Sciences" where they practised writing, oral communication, and poster and conference-style presentations.   The program was extremely well-received by students, faculty mentors and the Auburn University community in general that enjoyed the benefit of the yearly REU interaction.  We enjoyed particular success in educating students about their prospects in graduate school, including numerous students who initially had no interest in or ideas about how to get into graduate school.  This aspect of our program paid off for Auburn as well -- we recruited at least three of our REU students in the Department of Biological Sciences graduate program and have three additional strong prospects from summer 2019 alone.
