<AbstractNarration>Structural health monitoring (SHM) is an emerging technology that may provide real-time information about the "health" state of the structures anywhere and anytime in order to maximize their performance and prolong the lifespan during the operation. This technology increases significantly the "awareness" of the operators in real time on the integrity of the structures that may encounter various harsh environments in actual operation conditions, and hence, could lead to the development of advanced mitigation techniques to avoid structural catastrophes. The state awareness is the key element for safety, reliability and security of national aerospace, civil, mechanical and power infrastructure platforms. Structural health monitoring would not only allow users to access the condition of their assets remotely and instantly, particularly after unexpected events such as earthquakes, but also make the users to maintain their assets more efficiently and economically. The fundamental building blocks in the development of SHM capability are data collection and interpretation. Structural health monitoring techniques use built-in sensors to collect data and create diagnostic methods to interpret the relationship between the data and the change in the structure. Recent advances in networked sensor technology and "big data" science provides significant opportunities to further advance the science and technology in diagnostics and prognostics for detection and monitoring of the health of structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 10th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring 2015 will identify research needs and seek a consensus among experts from industry, government, and academia to develop an SHM roadmap spanning across various industry platforms. The general impact of SHM technologies is essential in sustaining the health functions and in maintaining the structural integrity of national transportation systems, defense, civil infrastructures, and other industrial sectors. The workshop will assess the state-of-the-art in the field of SHM; identify and discuss key and emerging issues that are critical; promote exchanges and cross-fertilization from researchers, students, engineers and practitioners among many disciplines; and establish a panel consisting of thought leaders from government, academe, and industry to develop a document for guiding the directions of R&amp;D in SHM for both the near and long term.</AbstractNarration>

IWSHM 2015 has seen considerable growth in the number of abstracts received compared to 2013.

Reliable and robust techniques as well as appropriate verification and validation procedures are urgently needed to fulfill the technology gap for SHM implementation.  Therefore, the theme of the 10th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring is "System Reliability for Verification and Implementation". The Workshop proceedings provide answers to those challenges and opportunities. The focus of IWSHM 2015 can be categorized into the following topics:  Sensing:       Smart sensors and actuators, bio-inspired sensors, and innovative sensor network technologies are presented in both general and special sessions.  Innovative design and integration approaches for multifunctional materials and smart structures with embedded self-sensing and self-diagnostic capabilities are emphasized in special sessions. Sensing strategies for sensor network optimization and detection of damage precursors are offered and presented.   Diagnostics:       Advanced signal processing methods for compensating environmental and operational effects are emphasized and demonstrated.  A significant amount of efforts by the SHM community is centered on quantification techniques and procedures for damage detection. Physics-based and probabilistic approaches for damage detection, localization, and quantification are integrated to offer novel methods for SHM. More in-depth fundamental studies in various diagnostic principles are presented through modeling, analyses, and experimental assessments.   System Integration:       Increased emphasis on system validation and verification for implementation from aerospace and civil infrastructure communities. Extensive evaluation results from laboratories to field studies are presented for maturation. Applications of SHM continue to expand into manufacturing, machining, high-speed railway transportation, wind turbines, and many other fields.    Automation and Control       Automation of data collection, processing and interpretation has been recognized from the community through numerous presentations. System integration with robots or machines for inspection or control through sensing can be spotted in several sessions.   A growing interest is apparent from the community to integrate sensing and diagnostics to close the loop through control for various applications.     The workshop provided researchers an opportunity to assess across the board the current state-of-the art technology in SHM and promoted intellectual exchange in enhancing the SHM technology development across multiple industries including civil, aerospace, mechanical systems, marine, energy and off-shore platforms sectors.  The workshop resulted in proceedings of the technical presentations as well as in the formation of a technical committee consisting o...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
