<AbstractNarration>This renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Pittsburgh entitled, "American Student Placements in Rehabilitation Engineering (ASPIRE) offers research experiences in rehabilitation engineering to students from institutions with limited research opportunities, women, underrepresented minorities, veterans and students with disabilities.  The research is focused on identifying and addressing problems critical to achieving and maintaining the highest possible level of function and participation in areas related to mobility, communications, sensory (e.g., hearing, tactile, vision), cognition and in areas associated with recreation, daily living, health, employment, independent living, and education. The broader impact of this REU Site is about empowering undergraduate students with the confidence, experience and skills necessary to excel in graduate studies and in their future careers as engineers or scientists. This Site provides opportunities for students to work on projects that have direct application to the betterment of society.  Having this experience early in their academic careers not only raises awareness to the social obligations of being an engineering, but also provides a "beyond the classroom experience" that brings purpose and meaning to an engineering curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the ASPIRE REU Site renewal are to: 1) Enroll highly-motivated undergraduate students majoring in diversified areas of engineering, computer science or related fields such as rehabilitation science who attend universities and colleges that have few opportunities for structured undergraduate research in RE. 2) Engage undergraduate students in RE to understand critical issues faced by persons with disabilities and apply engineering principles to improve their level of functionality, quality of life and society participation.  3) Employ targeted recruitment efforts in order to increase the numbers of qualified underrepresented students who apply; in particular veterans, students with disabilities and women. 4) Increase the number of undergraduate students who are well-prepared for graduate studies and professional careers in RE, and assist them in pursuing their career goals.  During the 10 week experience, students will gain understanding of the research process by 1) exposure to the real life problems that persons with disabilities face, 2) interacting directly with the assistive devices and systems used to ameliorate these problems and by conducting extensive scientific literature and product reviews, 3) assimilating these experiences and information to formulate research questions and/or design criteria to meet the current and evolving needs of persons with disabilities, and 4) working with highly qualified research mentors on a team project that will lead to new therapeutic or technological innovations in rehabilitation engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Rehabilitation Science &amp; Technology (RST) is the lead organization in this REU Site.  The other organizations involved with ASPIRE are the University of Pittsburgh Center for Assistive Technology (CAT), VA Pittsburgh HealthCare System-Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL), and the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&amp;R)</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The American Student Placements and Internships in Rehabilitation Engineering (ASPIRE) Research for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Pittsburgh?s Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL) is designed to promote greater knowledge and understanding of rehabilitation engineering (RE), as well as to foster an understanding of the problems faced by individuals with disabilities (IwD). The result is an increase in the ability of participants to apply engineering principles to improve the quality of life, level of participation in society, and functionality for people with disabilities (PwD). The comprehensive approach applied to the ASPIRE REU program has resulted in the successful engagement of undergraduate students from multiple disciplines - engineering, rehabilitation science, computer science, and biology - with the goal of making them better engineers and to encourage a portion of the participants to pursue graduate studies in RE or a related field.</p> <p>HERL offers a robust 10-week REU experience that has attracted over 1,00 applications over the past five years. Of that group, 54 have accepted the offer to study at HERL and participate in our broad scope of research aimed at increasing inclusiveness for IwD. In addition to project research, faculty and staff contribute workshops to help students gain a better understanding of the needs of those individuals for whom their projects are intended to serve. The cumulative result of these activities are students who have an expanded understanding of research, acquired new opportunities for professional development, and who effectively demonstrate the role RE plays in improving the quality of life for individuals and their communities.</p> <p>ASPIRE is founded in the principal of sparking an interest in a new generation of RE scientists to transform the lives of older adults and PwD. The intellectual focus of ASPIRE is based on the foundation of systems thinking, human factors, structured design, and mathematical/statistical modeling/simulation/analysis; these principles are manifested in a participatory action engineering and design paradigm. ASPIRE actively engages students in RE research design/analysis, device/system design/development and practices as well as teaches them how to effectively convey scientific findings to persons with technical and non-technical backgrounds.&nbsp; ASPIRE affords students practical experience in appropriate research conduct, social benefits of engineering, and research design/conduct and engineering/scientific ethics.</p> <p>All ASPIRE projects specifically address a research question or hypothesis that is part of a larger-scale or pilot research project (typically funded) that the primary mentor oversees. Our mentors have demonstrated their commitment to ASPIRE by supplying excellent projects for the ASPIRE students and have very successfully advised ASPIRE students in the execution of those projects over the past award cycles.&nbsp; Our experienced faculty and graduate student mentors adjust the level of mentoring needed to exercise the students? critical thinking ability and enable them to assume ?ownership? of the project.&nbsp; Each student exercises their communication skills by interacting with members of a multi-disciplinary team, which may include any or all the following:&nbsp; masters and doctoral level engineering and rehabilitation science students, medical students, clinical and research coordinators, machinists, technicians or PhD/MD faculty.&nbsp; A key component of the ASPIRE program is that students learn-by-doing participatory action engineering. This means they work intimately with the end-users (PwD or older adults) to seek solutions (e.g., design or test a device or system) or to describe underlying phenomena (e.g., mechanisms of injury or assessing changes in function) using good engineering and scientific practices. Mentors and ASPIRE students meet daily to discuss the project tasks and track progress; most work side-by-side. Students are encouraged to seek the advice or assistance of their primary mentors and other team members as often as needed.&nbsp; In most cases, this will involve learning how to use engineering, data acquisition and analysis/simulation software, research and testing instrumentation, high-end rapid prototyping equipment, and electronics equipment.&nbsp; Once the student has demonstrated his /her proficiency and safety with the equipment, he/she may use equipment with minimal supervision, enhancing the student?s ownership of the project.</p> <p>Effective communication - both on an individual level and in the effective dissemination of information - is an important part of the ASPIRE REU program at HERL.
