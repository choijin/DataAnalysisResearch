<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project will analyze and assess the ideas and assumptions that motivate the maintenance of the United States' widespread diplomatic apparatus, a far-reaching network of 285 embassies and consulates.  The practice of diplomacy has changed dramatically in recent decades as a result of technological advancements and shifting geopolitical concerns.  Individuals around the world now have the opportunity to communicate directly with ambassadors and foreign ministers on Twitter, disclosure of diplomatic correspondences on WikiLeaks have heightened calls for more transparency in diplomatic exchanges, and non-state terrorist actors continue to challenge the idea that diplomats and their facilities are inviolable.  While some countries have adjusted to 21st century realities by adapting to a more mobile, maneuverable diplomatic corps and fewer diplomatic facilities, the United States remains committed to a widespread diplomatic network.  This diplomatic footprint is the hallmark of universality, a sustained effort beginning in the second half of the 20th century to acquire nearly total diplomatic coverage by scattering around the world embassies and consulates designed to look, work, and behave in a similar manner regardless of their geographic location.  Attending to this understudied phenomenon means studying the historical and geographic conditions out of which the United States? relatively even and uniform diplomatic apparatus materialized.  By examining the relationship between diplomatic infrastructure and foreign policy aims, this project will apply geographic approaches focusing on everyday materialisms and institutional networks to examine diplomatic practice and the implications of those practices.  The project will expand current approaches to diplomatic theory and practice, bringing examinations of everyday practice back into a central role in diplomatic studies.  Project findings will facilitate self-evaluation by the U.S. Department of State of the implications of its diplomatic geography, and it will assist others engaged in diplomatic practice in assessing the geographic implications of practices on statecraft.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctoral student will focus the project on the following sets of questions:  (1) What factors influence decision making related to U.S. embassy and consulate placement?  (2) How does the U.S. approach to diplomatic infrastructure differ from that of other states?  (3) In what ways does the universal character of each facility prove alternately productive and counterproductive for U.S. foreign policy aims?  The student will employ methods that draw on institutional ethnographic techniques at multiple scales and a wide range of voices, including ground practitioners, high-level policymakers, retired ambassadors, voices from the past, and the student's own experience in Washington, D.C., and within the U.S. Department of State.  She will identify the origins of the universality argument and its continued relevance alongside 21st century diplomatic practices.  She also will engage in archival research and conduct interviews with current and former members of the diplomatic corps.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal goal of this project has been to uncover, analyze, and critique the discourse of universality as it relates to U.S. diplomatic infrastructure.  The universality principle is an unwritten rule of sorts that mandates that the United States ought to physically and permanently maintain diplomatic representation in as many states (and large cities) as possible around the world.   Through the funding of this award, the PI was able to accomplish all the stated objectives of this project, including data collection drawing on multiple qualitative methods, data analysis, and writing up results and findings for dissemination.   Three dominant findings emerged from this study.  The first concerns the universality principle.  Even as I found that universality has dictated the ?siting? of U.S. diplomatic infrastructure for some time, the concept itself is surprisingly absent from the academic literature, archival material, and present-day records and documentation.  Instead, the idea endures in the minds of policymakers and practitioners, several of whom I interviewed over the course of this research.  Phantom it may be, but universality, "is built into the very fabric of the U.S. diplomatic institution."  Over the course of the last 250 years, the Department of State routinely augmented its diplomatic footprint around the world and was loathe to consider closing embassy and consulate properties, only doing so when prompted by austerity measures or concerns about the safety of employees.   On a deeper level, the universality principle is intrinsically linked to U.S. foreign relations history.  The ideas of widespread diplomatic representation first emerged as lone consuls sought to secure U.S. access to (and later control) markets around the world.  As the isolationist era gave way to an increasingly active foreign policy, the United States moved to install legations, and later embassies, in foreign capitals.  In the Cold War era, ideological warfare led the United States to swiftly place new embassies in newly emerging states.  Today, the deeply entrenched notion of universality is evidenced by high-level practitioners? inability to imagine a world in which the United States did not have a presence in nearly every capital and large urban population center.  The second key finding to emerge throughout the course of this study is closely connected to the first.  As I have documented in the above articles, attention to diplomatic representation is critical to any study of diplomatic processes, behavior, and objectives.  In the case of the United States, it is impossible to understand U.S. ambitions in the global arena without noting the value policymakers place on maintaining well-staffed embassy and consulate compounds in 169 countries.  These facilities render the globe legible to decision makers and become active, force-full participants in negotiating diplomatic outcomes and mediating geopolitical disputes.   Thirdly, this dissertation calls attention to the multiplicity of diplomacies that exist at any one moment.  On a broader level, this research contributes theoretically to erasing the boundaries between what are alternately considered formal and informal diplomatic practices, actors, and spaces.  Over the course of this research, I found that while the path-dependent nature of rusty state diplomatic institutions make reform efforts difficult, new tools, technologies, and partnerships may potentially alter how diplomacy is practiced in the years to come.  Innovation comes in many shapes and sizes, and I hope to see the U.S. policymakers take advantage of opportunities to create a more mobile diplomatic corps that crafts policy solutions at different scales and in different places.   The findings of this project were presented in a doctoral dissertation which was comprised of three discrete manuscripts for publication.  Those publications are currently being prepared for submission to academic journals.        Last Modified: 04/28/2017       Submitted by: Anna W Moore]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
