<AbstractNarration>This Early-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will support a project that will use Business R&amp;D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS) microdata to test whether innovation results in job growth and whether particular types of innovation and industries generate more growth than others.  The project will provide information and insights regarding the linkages between innovation and economic development by identifying the impact of specific types of innovative activities on industry-level growth in output and employment.  Project results will provide information about the relative contribution of different types of technological, product, and process innovations to employment growth.  Because the investigators will evaluate the role that industry characteristics play in converting innovation into economic outcomes, the project will provide framework for relating research on innovation to the goal of economic development.  By distinguishing a variety of relationships among types of innovation, types of industries, and economic development, the project will help to adjust and expand innovation policies currently focused on high-technology sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will conduct statistical analyses of a range of distinctive valuables in the BRDIS database developed by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, including variables that deal with prototyping, product innovation, process innovation, and other innovation activities.  They will conduct systematically test the many of the policy-relevant conclusions of existing case-study research, and they will extract industry-level innovation and employment indicators that can be used by other researchers.  This EAGER-supported project responded to a Dear College Letter issued by the NSF Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) Program designed to facilitate the use of STAR METRICS, NCSES, and other databases in order to evaluate relationships among science funding, employment, and outcome metrics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We received an EAGER award to study the links between innovation and  economic development using administrative microdata from the BRDIS.  We used the EAGER funding and time afforded us to generate a proposal to the US Census Bureau and the IRS to work with the full microdata available in the BRDIS and its predecessor survey the SIRD.  In addition we applied to use additional Census and IRS products including the Longitudianl Business Database (LBD) and the Business Register.  Our goal is to link these various datasets in order to analyze the impact of firm-level innovation on the degree and geography of subsequent economic development (e.g. job growth).  Since the approval process by Census and IRS involved attaining special sworn status, and planning for a separate project that was aimed at improving the quality of the sampling frame of the BRDIS (a benefit to the Census), the application process took nearly two years. Since obtaining approval, we started working on the analysis in October of  this year and will be working on the linking of BRDIS data to other  census and IRS products in the course of the next year.  We do not  expect to have a working paper ready for at least a year.  While the support of NSF was invaluable in providing the time and guidance to apply to the Census, we will be continuing to work on this project and related ones for the next five years.
