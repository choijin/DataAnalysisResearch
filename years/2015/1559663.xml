<AbstractNarration>As understanding and awareness of the natural world grows, researchers are seeing increased complexity in the new ecological problems they encounter.  Because of this complexity, mathematical and statistical methods are becoming increasingly important in the study of biological and ecological systems. This award supports a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse (UWL) aimed at 1) training undergraduate students in various sub-disciplines of mathematical ecology, 2) motivating undergraduate students, especially underrepresented and/or first-generation college students with limited access to research at their home institution, to attend graduate school in a STEM area, and 3) preparing participants to be successful in an interdisciplinary, collaborative setting.  The UWL site will host eight students per year for 10 weeks during the summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018.  The award is supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research at this REU Site will contribute to the overall body of knowledge in mathematical and theoretical ecology by tackling research questions in mathematical areas such as ordinary and stochastic differential equations, decision theory, game theory, the theory of inverse problems, graph theory, probability theory and branching processes, as well as ecological questions that arise from the study of topics such as the parasite propagation in snail and waterfowl hosts in the Upper Mississippi River and the effects of wind energy on the population viability of bird and bat populations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From 2016 to 2018, twenty-four undergraduate students received valuable training in various sub-disciplines of mathematical ecology through the REU Site at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse. Students addressed interdisciplinary research questions using tools from mathematics, data science, computer science, and ecology.  Students conducted research using many mathematical methods, including simulation, dynamical systems, machine learning, and statistical modeling. Their research projects were connected to ecological systems in the La Crosse region like the Upper Mississippi River and area chestnut forests.  Since this REU was conducted in collaboration with federal scientists, results from students' projects could be readily applied to resource-management problems, which may help to inform future decisions made by state and federal agencies.  Through the REU experiences, the participating students are better prepared to be successful in an interdisciplinary, collaborative setting.  Students worked in teams through the REU projects.  These teams were mentored each summer by a collaboration of federal research scientists and UWL professors from Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Biology, or Computer Science programs.  Additionally, the students interfaced with a variety of professionals working in related fields through research presentations and field trips laced throughout the summer.   The research work generated through the REU in Mathematical Ecology at UWL has been disseminated through numerous presentations along with peer-reviewed publications in the journals, the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology and Natural Resource Modeling.
