<AbstractNarration>Division of Chemistry The Chemistry Division and the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division are sponsoring this workshop entitled "Food-Energy-Water Systems Challenging Chemists and Chemical Engineers in the 21st Century" to be held on October 22-24, 2015 in Arlington, Virginia. Population growth combined with a concomitant need for more food, energy, and clean fresh water necessitates technological innovations that address a myriad of complex global problems that center on fresh water. Professors Tim Long (Virginia Polytechnic Institute), Frank Bright (Buffalo), and Paul Edmiston (College of Wooster) bring leading scientists and engineers to identify the integrated challenges in water research at the water-energy-food nexus and to explore new opportunities in rapidly advancing area of water research, especially on the integration of water research with energy utilization and food production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop includes lectures and breakout sessions designed to identify the critical research activities in water recycle and reuse. The proposed workshop provides: (1) a sociotechnical systems model for the integration of experimental research at emerging intersections of chemistry with food science, biology and plant science, crop and soil sciences, economists, entrepreneurs, and diverse engineering disciplines, (2) fundamental knowledge underpinning the more efficient use of food, energy and water resources with attention to safety, economics, and security, and (3) strategies to train the next generation workforce to address the global challenges in rapidly emerging food, energy and water systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The key outcome of this project is the construction of a 40-page NSF workshop report based on a two-day workshop entitled "FEWS: Food-Energy-Water Systems Challenging Chemists in the 21st Century."      The workshop report describes a collective vision to address two pressing questions: (1) What are the avenues for chemists and chemical engineers in the 21st century to address critical fundamental scientific and technological challenges at the food, energy, and water nexus? (2) How will chemists team in unprecedented ways with other disciplines to address interdisciplinary scientific questions related to this nexus? With input from an interdisciplinary group of leading academic and industrial scientists and engineers, the report envisions the critical role chemists play at the rapidly emerging nexus of food, energy, and water. The report is based on diverse input, including chemists, life scientists, environmental engineers, chemical engineers, agricultural community leaders, and soil scientists, to create a comprehensive vision for the chemical community. Grand challenges range from sensors for ensuring efficient water utilization and purification to educating the next generation of interdisciplinary chemists for impact on this critical field. The report identifies the top grand challenges as identified and prioritized at the workshop. The workshop comprised ten oral presentations to nurture discussion, and in-parallel working groups allowed small teams of scientists and engineers to clarify the challenges and provide examples of specific fundamental questions of science. The report is not intended to be comprehensive in content but exemplifies challenges where fundamental advances in chemistry will be critical to ensure broader impact.  The report presents potential opportunities for chemists in the coming decade, consistent with crosscutting initiatives at the National Science Foundation. The chemist plays an important role in team-tackling these challenges, enabling next generation technologies, and training the next generation workforce. Although chemists have successfully pursued the energy-water nexus over the past decades, the addition of the food and agriculture lens imposes new challenges for the chemist and the opportunity to engage in active partnerships with new scientific fields from smart farming to soil science. Agriculture accounts for 80% of human water use, and our attention to water and nutrient availability will be critical in the future.       Broad dissemination of the report at the NSF and other professional venues including the American Chemical Society (ACS) and leading conferences has been initiated.  An additional outcome includes the financial support of a symposium entitled "Materials at the Food-Energy-Water Nexus: Polymers for Soils to Sensors" which was held at the ACS National Meeting in Washington, DC on August 20-24, 2017. Fourteen presentation abstracts were published from the symposium and can be accessed on the ACS website.         Last Modified: 03/13/2018       Submitted by: Timothy E Long]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
