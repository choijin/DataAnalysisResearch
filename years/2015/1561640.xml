<AbstractNarration>Army ants live in highly complex societies, accompanied by legions of tiny, intimate associates (primarily mites and insects).  The study of these host/symbiont systems is precluded by a lack of access to basic information and knowledge about their biology, including physical collections. Resulting from 50 years of fieldwork, the Rettenmeyer Army Ant Guest Collection (AAGC) at the University of Connecticut (UConn) is an unparalleled resource for studying complex systems of social insects. The AAGC comprises more than two million specimens of New World army ants and their associated guests:  Hundreds of species of mites, beetles, flies, wasps, springtails, and bristletails.  Extensive field notes and numerous photographs complement the biological specimens, detailing intricacies of species interactions. This project will stabilize this collection, addressing critical issues. This project aims to address basic physical storage issues and to make all data publicly available via an on-line database so as to maximize its potential as a source of information on social behavior in insects. A two-part exhibit will engage the campus community. One part will highlight the Rettenmeyers' collecting activities. Across campus, the second part will include a large ant model complete with an array of mites attached all to scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is motivated by the recent donation of the Rettenmeyer Army Ant Guest Collection (AAGC) to the UConn Department of Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology Biodiversity Research Collection Facility. The AAGC comprises more than 2 million specimens of New World army ants and their associated arthropods. It includes ca. 1,000 types representing 200 species, ca. 16,000 pinned specimens, ca. 5,000 microscope slides, more than 15,000 vials and jars, complemented by detailed field data and 5,000 Kodachrome transparencies. The collection is in dire need of stabilization - fluid levels are low, stoppers are deteriorating, specimens are overcrowded and disorganized. The project's two primary goals are specimen curation (e.g., replacing fluid, re-vialing, labeling, attaching barcodes, and reorganization) and establishing an on-line presence by modifying an existing MySQL database to accommodate the AAGC in four related Tables. Type specimens and colony exemplars will be image and linked to database records. Data will be shared with iDigBio (www.idigbio.org) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.  High school students will work with graduate students to hone their writing and observation skills as they interpret slide labels to populate the database. Project results can be accessed online (biodiversity.uconn.edu/ant-guests/).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project was motivated by a donation of the world's largest and most important collection of army ants and the hundreds of tiny species of mites, beetles, flies, wasps, etc. (<em>i.e.</em>, guests) that rely on them to survive to the Biodiversity Research Collections in the Department of Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut. This amazing collection is the result of over 50 years of fieldwork by Carl W. and Marian E. Rettenmeyer in the jungles of Central and South America. The two primary aims of the project were to assess and curate the specimens and to provide public access to the specimens and the rich array of associated data of this complex biological system (Fig. 1). The over 10,000 jars and vials of fluid-preserved specimens were stabilized (fluid replaced, transferred to archival containers, etc.) (Fig. 2). These and the over 17,400 specimens of army ants and/or guests mounted on pins, and 5,505 microscope slides (a large proportion with multiple guest specimens) were labeled, reorganized and barcoded. The jars, many of which contain bulk collections of specimens, are estimated to house approximately 2 million army ant specimens, many still with guests attached. The vials contain approximately 100,000 guest and ant specimens. Limited taxonomic work to date indicates the collection includes over 150 genera of more than 130 families of guests, with an emphasis on mites, from colonies representing over 20 genera of army ants. These numbers are expected to increase considerably now that the collection is fully accessible to taxonomists.</p> <p>An online database (aagc.uconn.edu) with four modules was developed. The records of 9,300 field cards in the <em>Field Card Module</em> provide details of daily fieldwork involving army ant behaviors and movements, and ant and guest collecting activities. Associated with the 3,309 colony records in the <em>Colony Module</em>. The 6,246 records in the <em>Kodachrome Module</em> provide access to images of army ants and guests in the field and laboratory. Data on individual specimens or lots of specimens are provided in the <em>Specimen Module</em>. Links connecting related data among the four modules expands the collection's value as an unparalleled and irreplaceable multidimensional resource not only for taxonomists interested in describing new taxa, but also for ecologists and evolutionary biologists interested in understanding fundamental questions in coevolution, the mechanisms shaping specialization in ecological interactions, the evolutionary dynamics of complex communities, among other key concepts.</p> <p>A total of 16 undergraduate students and 1 postdoctoral scholar received training in collections management, database design and population, and taxonomy over the course of the project. Two exhibits were created. The first, featuring a 12 ft soldier army ant and its 8 species of guest mites (Fig. 3), focuses on the biology of army ants and their guests and has become a showpiece in the lobby of the building in which the collection is housed. The second, which features interactive monitors with a variety of games and activities (Fig. 4), details the life's work of the Rettenmeyers. The intriguingly complex natural history of army ants and their guests helped promote voluntary collaborations with a variety of partners across the University, all aimed at sharing the wonders of this system, going well beyond our original plan. These novel partnerships included army ant guest-inspired poetry by students in Poetry and Creative Writing classes. This led to an exhibit of some of that work alongside a 50 ft. interactive magnetic poetry wall furnished with large-print vocabulary inspired by the biology of army ants and their guests (Fig. 5). A puppet pageant (Fig. 6), a toy theatre workshop (Fig. 7), and an exhibit of commissioned puppets all inspired by army ants and their guests (Fig. 8) were done in collaboration with the Ballard Institute and Museum of Puppetry. Collaborations with staff and students in Digital Media &amp; Design resulted in the creation of the interactive games and activities in the Rettenmeyer exhibit, and also resulted in an original art-science performance, "The Colony" with an associated original music video shot in a local grocery store (https//viimo.com/363071227). We also worked with two teams of Engineering Senior Design students to develop a prototype to mobilize a 3 ft ant (Fig. 9). Collaboration with a K-12 teacher and faculty and students from the Neag School of Education resulted in development of a middle school module on Big Science Ideas (using army ants and their guests to illustrate concepts in Group Behavior and Natural Selection), which was published in the National Science Teaching Association's journal <em>Science Scope</em>. Enthusiasm for details on the collection and the biology of army ants and their guests led us to develop a resource page (<a href="https://biodiversity.uconn.edu/Resources/">https://biodiversity.uconn.edu/Resources/</a>) to provide easy access to that content to all interested individuals. Big ants installed on buildings across campus help draw attention to project partners and exhibits (Fig. 10).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/19/2020<br>      Modified by: Janine&nbsp;N&nbsp;Caira</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1561640/1561640_10429800_1592599893175_OutcomesPlate1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1561640/1561640_10429800_1592599893175_OutcomesPlate1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="AAGC Project Plate 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1561640/1561640_10429800_1592599893175_OutcomesPlate1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="AAGC Project Plate 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">1.
