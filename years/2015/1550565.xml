<AbstractNarration>Societal problems, such as climate change, poverty, and illiteracy, can only be solved with social innovators - people who understand societal challenges in context, design new technologies, and can work with diverse stakeholders. To become social innovators, learners must gain experience tackling complex, illstructured design challenges that are not easily solved by a single individual within a fixed time frame. This makes innovation difficult to teach: individual mentoring is effective but expensive; extra-curricular environments provide flexibility but insufficient guidance; and classroom instruction is too rigid and timebound for solving complex public problems. Social innovators can better be developed via social innovation networks - learner communities collaborating to solve real-world problems. Social innovation networks: a) teach learners to design solutions to real problems, b) are led by learners and supported by faculty and professional experts, c) extend nationally through a network of local hubs and d) have pro-social missions. Unfortunately, such networks are difficult to orchestrate: facilitators must coordinate many project teams with varying levels of expertise and work on different problems to address unpredictable needs of community clients. This project will test the design argument that digital studios can help social innovation networks develop innovators through pedagogical affordances that create networked teaching hubs in support of learner-driven projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will develop an understanding of the customer needs inherent in social innovation networks and develop sustainable business model to commercialize the proposed Loft platform. Analysis of digital studios in innovation networks will include interviews, observation, and surveys and empirically grounded design principles. It will build novel systems based on new insights and evaluate developed tools and methods through software deployments. The team's researchers, designers, and programmers from Northwestern University's Segal Design Institute, School of Education &amp; Social Policy, and industry have expertise in cyberlearning, innovation education, peer production, web development, and scaling educational initiatives. As a new cyberlearning genre, the proposed Loft digital studio has the potential to radically change who innovates and how people innovate. Developing core principles for designing successful digital studios for innovating education will contribute to cyberlearning research areas, including badging, peer production, learning-by-cases, design-based learning, and online learning communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The worldwide market for e-learning and employee training is large and growing rapidly, estimated at $135 billion. The Loft (www.loft.io) has tremendous commercial potential in both education and corporate markets. Industry and universities must prepare learners to solve real-world problems. This requires learners to work on real-world projects while learning complex problem-solving processes such as product design or business model development.  However, graduate programs are failing to adequately prepare learners for industry and employers are increasingly asked to play a larger role in workforce development. Real-world project based learning is extremely resource intensive because instructors must orchestrate multiple novice project teams while ensuring that all learners master complex problem-solving process. As a result, instructors often: (a) spend an inordinate amount of time to support novices, (b) provide little teaching, letting novices flounder, (c) give novices oversimplified tasks, stunting development, (d) acquire additional co-instructor at great expense or (e) use less effective, lectured-based pedagogies. The Loft is a digital studio for training networks of novice innovators.  A combination of Coursera, Basecamp, and Facebook, the Loft allows learners at multiple schools, chapters or sites to launch and manage new projects as they learn a problem solving process through instruction, coaching, and digital real-time critiques with peers and experts. The Loft scaffolds project work through group-critique, just-in-time process instruction, collaborative project management tools, and crowd-sourced authoring of instruction.  This project has been designed, developed, and tested in earlier work at Northwestern University.  Through the NSF I-Corps program, we developed an initial business and customer model for commercializing the Loft online learning platform, networked with other colleagues interested in commercializing research, and prepared for business formation. Specifically, weÆve trained our founding team in lean startup methodology, developed and tested initial business and customer model, determined that the business model warranted commercialization of Loft platform,and prepared for future participation in the NSFÆs Small Business Innovation Research.
