<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will center on the development of a new chemically-bonded amorphous ceramic network (CBACN) for use as a thermal coating in next-generation engine exhaust thermal management systems.  The coating will permit a combination of performance, price and processing parameters superior to currently available technologies.  The potential outcome of the proposed work will be a low-cost, easy to apply, thermal barrier coating that bonds to exhaust components, reducing the net heat loss from the exhaust to the surrounding components.  Thermal exhaust coatings offer improved engine and catalytic efficiency, lower under-hood temperature, and reduce vehicle weight.  The net effect for the consumer is improved efficiency, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, reduced pollution, improved safety, and lower cost.  The net outcome for automobile manufacturers will be higher corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) scores, a simplified manufacturing process, and an estimated cost savings of $20 per vehicle.  Current ceramic exhaust coatings are too costly for use by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).  The potential outcome of the proposed research is a ceramic exhaust coating for use in a thermal management system appropriate for OEM use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project derives from the advancement of low-cost, easy to apply, chemically-bonded ceramics into a market currently occupied by difficult-to-apply plasma sprayed ceramic coatings.  Target features for these coatings include thermal conductivity less than 5 W/m-K, emissivity below 0.3, adhesion to exhaust-grade stainless steel, thermal stability, wear resistance, chemical resistance, and ease of coating and integration into the vehicle manufacture supply chain.  CBACNs may be formulated with a wide range of physical properties not obtainable in a sintered ceramic system.  Related CBACN coatings have been developed with enough adhesion and flexibility on 400 series exhaust stainless steel to survive a 35 degree bend around a 10 mm mandrel.  Independently, CBACN coatings have been developed with emissivity below 0.2 and with thermal conductivity below 1 W/m-K, although no single coating has been developed with all the desired properties simultaneously.  This project will focus on the material synthesis and evaluation tasks needed to realize such a material system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Automotive manufacturers are being pressured by CAFE standards to increase vehicle fuel efficiency.  Automobile manufacturers are considering several ways to improve mileage, while reducing emissions, including greenhouse gasses.      Automobile light weighting and running engine systems hotter tend to increase fuel efficiency and reduce harmful emissions.  High engine operating temperatures benefit from greater Carnot efficiency, however the excess heat damages other vehicle components.  Controlling the heat flow after combustion is important for several reasons: 1. in the engine compartment to avoid high under-hood temperatures which damage other than engine components, 2. increased heat and rate of heat up increases catalytic converter efficiency and reduces cold start inefficiency, 3. retaining heat in the exhaust system reduces back pressure on the engine, as well as removes the need for complex heat shielding elements.     Diesel engine exhaust is even more sensitive to loss of heat.  "Clean Air" diesel exhaust is benefited by keeping the heat in because the improves the SCR (selective catalytic reducer) efficiency, reduces particulates in the DPF (diesel particulate filter) as well as increase DPF regeneration, better decomposition of DEF (diesel exhaust fluid) for NOx reduction.     Thermal Barrier Coating (TBC) are known to reduce the heat flux of the exhaust system, and typically wraps and ceramic coatings are utilized.  However, thermal wraps are not suitable for many reasons, and the ceramic coatings suffer from lack of robustness and cost effective application.   This Phase I project was to develop a chemically bonded ceramic Thermal Barrier Coating (TBC) which keeps the engine heat in the exhaust system, can be easily applied, reduce the need for heat shielding, and allows for deployment across mainstream vehicle platforms.  High performance, durable, low cost easy to apply TBCs have been demonstrated in Phase I.   With the technical success, comes commercial interest.  A technology is only an innovation if it is translated into a commercial reality that truly benefits the end user.  Our potential customer Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) has purchased certified samples of coated exhaust pipes that meet or exceed their testing performance specifications to date.     Based on the Phase I performance, FCA has identified two vehicle production lines they would like to target for cold end exhaust TBC year 1 for a total of 360,000 vehicles, with a target start date in 30 months.  They would like to ramp up to nearly one million vehicles per year by year seven.  Expected cost is $22.69 per vehicle with a profit of $13.31 for Covaron and our development partner, savings to FCA of $9.00 per vehicle.   Covaron has developed a thermal management coating for exhaust stainless steel that offers incredible adhesion, superior hardness, excellent thermal insulation and low thermal emissivity at low wavelength, while being lower cost than any thermal management coating currently on the market.  As part of this SBIR Phase I, this coating was successfully tested to survive and keep performing over 100,000 simulated road miles: both Covaron?s ETMS coating and ETMS-a (developed for even stronger resistance to thermal shock and cycling) had no deterioration of mechanical, adhesion or thermal radiation properties after 100,000 simulated road miles.  As part of this Phase I, Covaron was able to considerably improve ETMS coating?s application process.
