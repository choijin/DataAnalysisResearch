<AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support for the International Symposium on Equatorial Aeronomy (ISEA) which will provide opportunities for the establishment of new international scientific collaborations and for facilitating coordinated long term data collection in the African sector. The travel support will provide opportunities for young scientists and graduate students from the US to interact with established and emerging scientists on the international stage.&lt;br/&gt; The ISEA conference is held approximately every three to four years and brings together international researchers to advance the understanding of the ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere (ITM) coupling which impacts space weather, navigation, and communication systems. The location at Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, will facilitate future efforts in data collection in the African sector by engaging local scientists. This will address the longitudinal and hemispheric dependence of equatorial ionospheric effects and space weather.&lt;br/&gt; This award will be jointly funded by the NSF Aeronomy Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

During the last few years, a significant number of small-to-medium scale instruments have been either deployed or in the process of deployment in Africa.
