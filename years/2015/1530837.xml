<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that support envisioning the future of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Development and Implementation (DIP) Projects build on proof-of-concept work that shows the possibilities of the proposed new type of learning technology, and PI teams build and refine a minimally-viable example of their proposed innovation that allows them to understand how such technology should be designed and used in the future and that allows them to answer questions about how people learn, how to foster or assess learning, and/or how to design for learning. Educating the next generation of design innovators is essential for ensuring U.S. economic and social prosperity. To prepare students for this critical work, design innovation instructors rely on project-based learning where learners construct and iterate on preliminary solutions to real-world problems and try to acquire feedback from stakeholders who depend on the outcomes. This project aims to create a scalable method for obtaining formative feedback in the classroom by leveraging online crowds through social media and crowdsourcing platforms via a new online learning platform called CRAFT (CRowd Aided Feedback Technology).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CRAFT project involves an integrated social science research and technology design plan. Studies will examine how to optimize the acquisition of feedback, how learners do sensemaking of provided feedback, and how and when they can reflect on the feedback in their own learning process. The technology design will utilize an iterative rapid prototyping strategy based on XML templates that will allow quick reconfiguration of interface elements and functionality. Pilot usability testing will be done with face-to-face volunteers, students in courses, and via Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Students in courses on product design, graphic design, and interface design will serve as participants in a series of studies. A 3x2 experiment will examine the relationship between types of incentives for feedback (intrinsic, financial, and social), design stage (early- or late-stage design), and impact of the feedback on learners. A second, 3x2 within-subjects experiment will examine the relationship between different types of rubrics, early- and late-stage design, and learner impact. A third experiment will compare individual use of scaffolded crowd feedback tools, paired dialogue with annotation tools, and crowd use of annotation tools, and a control condition to examine qualitatively the differences in learner outcomes. The fourth experiment will be a between-subjects analysis of the impact of the tool on design outcomes using both an analysis of the designs themselves and an analysis of a reflective essay submitted by the participants. The CRAFT tool will be iterated and refined on the basis of each of these experiments. A final, summative evaluation will test the final version of the CRAFT environment using a mixed factorial design with independent variables including scaffolding and early- vs. late-stage of design.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  In project-based learning, students often struggle to acquire formative feedback due to their limited social capital, financial resources, and time. To meet this educational challenge, we pioneered new scalable methods for obtaining formative feedback by leveraging online crowds on social media, online communities, and online work platforms and advanced the science of this new genre of learning technology to realize the potential of crowd feedback for design innovation pedagogy. Specifically, we accomplish four major intellectual goals: 1. Contributed empirical knowledge to help learners in design innovation courses understand how to effectively allocate their financial resources, social capital, and time for acquiring design feedback from online crowds. 2. Produced user interface designs and empirical knowledge to help learners interpret large quantities of noisy feedback received online. 3. Produced user interface designs and empirical knowledge to help learners more effectively reflect on and develop an action plan for the feedback received. 4. Developed and disseminated a crowd feedback platform that embodies the results from our design research and empirical studies to help learners more effectively acquire, interpret, and reflect on the feedback received.  These intellectual outcomes advanced cyberlearning research, specifically  research on crowdsourcing, online learning communities, and project-based learning. The broader impact goal of this project created a foundation for learning environments that educate our nation’s designers to tackle complex challenges.
