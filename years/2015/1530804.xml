<AbstractNarration>An interactive scientific and educational workshop will be held at the active Volcan Santiaguito (Guatemala) in January of 2016.  The meeting will bring together researchers, students, and observatory personnel to exchange state-of-the-art quantitative geophysical field techniques and to collect and distribute integrated volcano geophysical data products.  The workshop will entail an initial (pre-workshop) deployment, ongoing field study during the workshop, lectures and presentations, and data analysis and open exchange.  It is hoped that this workshop will be the first in a series of innovative workshops where a group of scientists target and study a select open-vent volcanic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volcan Santiaguito is the ideal locale for the inaugural workshop owing to its diverse and continuing low level of activity (lava effusion, explosions, regular rockfall, and small pyroclastic density currents).  The volcanic activity is amenable to a range of geophysical data collection, including seismic, infrasonic, geodetic, optical, thermal, and ground-based UV and microwave sensing.  The scientific program will focus on volcano geophysics acquisition, processing, and analysis techniques through hands-on demonstration and focused discussion.  Novel scientific insights are expected from integration of diverse data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Workshops on Volcanoes  Santiaguito, Guatemala, 4&ndash;12 January 2016     The Santiaguito volcanic dome complex in Guatemala is the ideal site for studying volcanic activity, with its regular explosions, active lava flows and sporadic larger eruptions and pyroclastic flows.  The nearby and taller Santa Maria volcano offers safe vantage points for deploying in-situ and line-of-sight instrumentation.  It is an important volcano laboratory because it represents a style of volcanic activity, explosive dome volcanism, that occurs commonly worldwide including occasionally in the United States.  Santiaguito is also an especially hazardous volcano, which threatens a large populace.  Efforts to better understand eruption dynamics at Santiaguito can help to mitigate hazards to the local populations.   In January 2016, volcano scientists, monitoring agency specialists, and students gathered in the nearby city of Quetzaltenango to share research expertise and conduct fieldwork in the first of a series of scientific and educational workshops on volcanoes. Sixty participants from more than ten countries attended the workshop. Fifteen principal scientists launched experiments before and during the conference.  Their specialties included seismic (earthquake studies), geodetic (deformation), and infrasound (volcano sounds) deployments.  Other work focused on multi-spectral gas and thermal sensing (to quantify mass and gas flux), as well as UAV reconnaissance (for birds-eye perspective video), photogrammetry (to produce maps), and petrologic and rheologic sampling (for studies of igneous rock properties). Participants learned about these volcano monitoring technologies during visits to installation sites and in breakout groups.  More than 50 scientists and workshop participants also climbed to, and spent the night (in shifts), on the summit of the neighboring Santa Maria Volcano, from which unimpeded views of the volcanic activity could be observed.  Data collected during the workshops were analyzed and shared with all conference-goers. This data resource is also being offered freely to individuals from the broader volcano community.  Other products from the workshop include an education and outreach website (http://bigstory.thebluereview.org/santiaguito-volcano-research/) produced by an embedded journalist as well as plans to host a dedicated special session (focused on Santiaguito volcanism) at the fall American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco in December 2016.  A brief meeting report has been published in Eos (https://eos.org/meeting-reports/visiting-the-volcano).
