<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Project &lt;br/&gt;1512659 Gomes, Carmen &lt;br/&gt;1511953  McLamore, Eric S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a novel sensor device designed to detect foodborne pathogens.  The researchers will stimuli-response material in combination with a specially developed biomolecule for detecting Listeria monocytogenes (pathogen present in foods).  The proposed work is particularly important because we do not have antibodies (a molecule that recognizes the pathogen) that have high affinity for this particular pathogen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop biosensors which combine stimuli-responsive polymer nanobrushes and aptamers. Such an approach is expected to significantly improve the field of pathogen detection. The biosensor device will be evaluated on a broad range of criteria such as sensitivity, selectivity, and response time with appropriate controls.  The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in combining the actuation of stimuli-responsive polymers with selective capture of bacteria by aptamers immobilized on the polymer surface for increasing selective capture and retention of target pathogens. The biomimetic approach proposed in this work is inspired by selective recruitment of symbiotic bacteria by ciliate actuation in the bobtail squid light organ, which is capable of capturing a specific target species from a solution with a complex microbial background and a wide range of particle sizes. When combined with nanomaterial-modified electrodes, it is anticipated to provide two distinct advantages; namely, enhanced capture of target bacteria due to lower non-specific binding, and enhanced limit of detection.  Broader Impacts : A convenient, rapid, and sensitive biosensor for foodborne pathogens can have significant impact in food safety and medical diagnostics.  This proposed research also serves as a unique opportunity for dissemination of engineering research to underrepresented population at the two collaborating institutions and will focus on food safety  and nano-biosensing technologies. These activities will include at Texas A&amp;M University:  (i) demonstrating practical applications on detecting foodborne pathogens in the Expanding Your Horizon one-day camp ( reaches 70 sixth-grade girls per year), (ii) mentoring  and hosting young women through the Women Explore Engineering summer camp; and (iii) hosting a high school teacher through Enrichment Experiences in Engineering program. At University of Florida activities will include (i) recruiting secondary science educator to participate in the research project through the Center for Precollegiate Education and Training (ii) developing online learning modules using animation software to teach biosensor concepts; and (iii) coordinating  and hosting  K-12 students through 4H Bioengineering summer camp</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The overall goal of this project was to develop biomimetic sensors for food safety analysis that used "shape changing" polymers decorated with DNA that "sticks" to bacteria. A summary of our experimental work is below:  [1] We first tested three different types of polymers that change shape after different types of stimulus (electrical stimulus, temperature stimulus, and acid stimulus).  [2] We then attached DNA to the polymers that were most effective, and tested the materials for bacteria capture. We focused on Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli as model bacteria that are known to contaminate food.  [3] We developed different types of sensor systems that can be used in flow-through analysis or single test analysis (with varying cost and performance).  [4] Sensors were tested in lettuce production systems and vegetable broth to validate the technique.  [5] A smartphone-based protocol was developed for each of the successful sensors.  [6] Proof of concept systems were developed for providing decision support to users regarding microbial contamination of lettuce production systems (hydroponic) or lettuce processing facilities (washing, rinsing, packaging).  Development of this technology is aimed to help food producers/distributors/retailers conform to regulatory guidelines put in place by the Food Safety Modernization Act.  The cyber-physical sensor system developed in this research switches the paradigm of food safety analysis from one of microfluidic sampling that targets a few cells to devices that are robust and work at large scale (we have validated use of the technique at volumes of 100mL and we have preliminary evidence that the system functions for volumes as large as 1L). This is an important shift in terms of real-world sensor systems that function in the field. The "shape changing" material has been combined with systems-level sample processing through cyber-physical control systems, overcoming many of the barriers experienced by analysis of water quality/food safety that plague microfluidic techniques.
