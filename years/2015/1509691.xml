<AbstractNarration>1509691&lt;br/&gt;Sangi Reddy, Pramod&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is to understand how energy flows between two surfaces placed very close together, with gaps as small as 10 nano-meters.  The resultant data are significant because knowledge gained will help establish methods of manipulating energy flow effectively in small devices.  There have been many models predicting these behaviors, but relatively few experimental results exist to verify or disprove them.  This proposed study will facilitate model validations.  The proposal also incorporates extensive outreach activities to engage undergraduate and graduate students as well as underrepresented minorities in research. Modules for K-12 students will incorporate novel atomic force microscope, which is impressive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to validate and invalidate the developed theories and numerical studies on the near field radiation between nano-gap parallel plates.  The PIs have successfully demonstrated preliminary measurements of the 200 nm gap radiation and plan to reduce the gap down to 10 nm.  The experimental setup will be used to validate many combinations of materials and radiation rectifier and enhance the performance of calorimeter (with pico-Watt resolutions).  The experimental facility is being developed on a current NSF award.  Several significant questions regarding near-field radiation heat transfer in nano-gaps will be addressed: (1) near field heat transfer polar dielectrics and hyperbolic materials, (2) thermal rectification, and (3) high resolution calorimetry.</AbstractNarration>
