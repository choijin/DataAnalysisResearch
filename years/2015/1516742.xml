<AbstractNarration>As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The project will develop an informal tribal community-based environmental health (EH) education framework based on Indigenous knowledge, practices, and learning styles using a First Foods paradigm. First Foods represent a unique, place-based knowledge and practice, intimately tied to traditional ecological knowledge. Most (if not all) tribal communities in the United States have knowledge and practices centered around their local natural resources and First Foods.  By building, testing and evaluating an innovative EH education model based on a culturally-meaningful local knowledge source, First Foods, this project seeks to increase informal STEM learning in tribal communities.  American Indians and Alaska Natives account for 2% of the population but only 0.1% of STEM-related degrees. By working specifically with this underserved and underrepresented group, this project seeks to engage tribal community members in informal STEM learning, increasing access to informal learning settings, particularly for young people who are not currently engaged in formal STEM learning environments. The EH framework will be disseminated locally, regionally and nationally through Indian Health Boards, conferences, and with other tribal communities interested in informal STEM education and environmental health programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will review established EH and First Foods program curricula to develop a tribal-specific community-based EH education framework. The project will use the contextual model of informal STEM learning developed by Falk and Dierking, which is designed to integrate personal, sociocultural and physical aspects of learning. The project will adapt this model in order to create a space for community experience to enrich learning, as well as expanding the view of the physical context beyond the biophysical environment to encompass a holistic definition of the living environment. This model and framework will be developed in an iterative manner, with continuing formative evaluations both internally and externally.  The overarching hypothesis is that the proposed model will increase informal STEM learning by providing a culturally meaningful education platform that resonates with tribal community members. The model will focus heavily on the sociocultural aspect of learning, striving to collaboratively design a CBEH education program that is appropriate and adaptable for tribal communities and includes pertinent EH themes and information.  Metrics and evaluation techniques will be developed, as relevant, for the iterative evaluation of specific program components. Year 1 development and evaluation will focus on the review of community-based EH activities, design of the project EH model and prototype program components.  Critical review will be provided by project advisors, the Swinomish Health and Human Services Committee, and tribal elders.  Year 2 will focus on the implementation of prototype program components.  The project external evaluator will use mixed methodologies, including observation, interviews, pre-and post-surveys, participant ranking of activities/events, and quantitative analysis of attendance at EH events. A tribal-university partnership has been established that includes expertise in informal STEM learning, environmental health program evaluation, cultural competency, and outreach and engagement.</AbstractNarration>

The 13 Moons curriculum represents the first Indigenous-created informal environmental sustainability curriculum founded on First Foods and resources. First Foods, also called traditional foods, subsistence foods or Indigenous foods, are more than local resources harvested for caloric intake. Most (if not all) Indigenous communities in the United States have knowledge and practices centered on local natural resources and First Foods. The project hypothesis was that a tribal community-based environmental sustainability education model centered on First Foods would increase informal STEM learning by providing a culturally-meaningful education platform that resonated with Indigenous communities.</p> <p>Project researchers conducted an extensive literature review of existing programs and curricula related to environmental health and environmental education, with an emphasis on tribal programming and Indigenous foods (Figure 1). Of the 51 identified materials, few addressed more than one subject area, and few (&gt;10%) addressed a comprehensive view of environmental sustainability from an Indigenous lens. The results of the literature review demonstrated the gaps in Indigenous-developed informal curricula, which provided a roadmap of where to focus project efforts. Project researchers developed &ldquo;13 Moons,&rdquo; a Swinomish-specific environmental sustainability curriculum and associated guidance document using the literature review roadmap. The 13 Moons curriculum follows the Indigenous Coast Salish lunar calendar, guiding activities throughout the year for when particular foods and resources are harvested, prepared, and preserved. The 13 Moons curriculum includes 1-3 activities per moon (n = 32), with a focus on one plant-based activity and one animal-based activity. Activities are designed to carefully balance Indigenous knowledge with western science in an informal STEAM learning environment. The curriculum highlights the importance of Indigenous foods and resources in a cultural, spiritual and heritage-based sense, while integrating information on sustainability and stewardship of natural resources, and an understanding of how resources can be impacted by contamination in the environment.</p> <p>The curriculum underwent multiple iterations of review: first, an internal project team review; next, an internal Swinomish community review; third, an external review with identified Indigenous environmental health and sustainability experts; and finally, an internal project team review to ensure that all comments were addressed. The external project evaluators monitored the entire project. The iterative evaluation resulted in the development of eight Guiding Principles (Figure 2). These guiding principles identify the overarching themes that formed the foundation of the 13 Moons curriculum, enabling Indigenous communities to adapt the curriculum as appropriate.</p> <p>Many of the 13 Moons curriculum activities were piloted as part of the review process, with approximately 1,600 community member participants. Overall, the community evaluations of the activities were strongly positive and supportive of the curriculum and continuation of the activities. The evaluation results showed that the strongest outcomes for community members were around connecting to community and traditional practices, as well as connecting to land and environment from a community lens. Events were well-received, suggesting that building upon existing community practices was an effective strategy.</p> <p>Four Indigenous students were involved directly in the project. Based on their experiences, each student chose to focus on a STEM field in their continuing education, with two students pursuing Native Environmental Science undergraduate degrees and two students pursuing Master&rsquo;s degrees. Furthermore, one graduate has since used her experience with 13 Moons and now teaches activities from the curriculum in the local school district and in an afterschool program called Swinomish Youth Spirit.</p> <p>In sum, the project hypothesis was strongly supported. The project demonstrated a prior lack of Indigenous specific environmental sustainability curricula. Through iterative development and pilot testing, an informal education curriculum and associated guidance document was developed. Over 1,600 community members, a project team of researchers (Indigenous and non-Indigenous), Indigenous students, Elders and evaluators influenced the development of 13 Moons to represent diverse backgrounds and interests.
