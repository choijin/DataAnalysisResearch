<AbstractNarration>Electroencephalographic (EEG) measures subtle voltage fluctuations along the scalp resulting from ionic current flows within the neurons of the brain. EEG is widely used as a low cost, portable, and noninvasive means to capture not only cognitive and memory performance, but also brain disorders like epilepsy and stroke. Conventional EEG recording is obtained by placing individual thick and stiff electrodes on the scalp with conductive gel after skin abrasion which enhances electrode-skin contact. For many decades, EEG technology has suffered from limitations such as low spatial resolution, poor signal-to-noise ratio without proper signal amplification, time consuming and obstructive electrode connections, and short measurement time as gel dries out. Such limitations are partially due to the incompatibility between the soft, curvilinear, and deformable human skin and the hard, planar, and rigid electrodes and electronics. The ultrathin, high electronic performance, and transparency of atomically thick two-dimensional materials offer clear mechanical, electronic, and optical advantages over silicon in the neuroelectronics. This research proposes to explore the idea of replacing conventional rigid EEG electrodes by tattoo-like ultrathin, ultrasoft, dry electrodes and signal amplifiers fabricated from two-dimensional materials. Preliminary results indicate this idea is feasible and further research will prove the feasibility and future prospects for tattoo-like, long lasting, and high performance neuroelectronics to benefit society. In addition, the graduate student and post-doctoral researchers working on this research effort will gain advanced scientific and engineering skills needed to be technical leaders in industry, academia or government post-graduate careers. Moreover, undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds will be recruited to participate in the research effort to promote advanced science and engineering careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to carry out a feasibility study that two-dimensional materials such as graphene and atomically thin molybdenum disulfide can be applied as the electrode and amplifier materials for noninvasive, long-term, high fidelity Electroencephalographic sensing. The major technical barrier towards two-dimensional materials based epidermal active EEG sensor lies in the device design, heterogeneous fabrication, and reliable bio-integration with the final goal of enhanced EEG sensing. An innovative active electrode architecture is proposed in which graphene is employed as both the sensing and gate electrodes, and molybdenum disulfide integrated with ultrathin polymer dielectrics and graphene source/drain as the on-site signal amplifier. Two research thrusts are proposed to accomplish the feasibility study: i) fabricating and validating graphene based passive epidermal EEG electrodes, and ii) integrating molybdenum disulfide vertically on top of the graphene electrode with ultrathin polymer dielectrics and graphene source/drain as a transistor amplifier for active EEG recording. The expected outcome is an affirmative decision on the feasibility of an integrated neuroelectronics that can be conformally laminated on human skin without conductive gel but still able to record long term, high fidelity EEG with orders of magnitude signal amplification. For the targeted gain of several hundreds the active electrode minimizes both the extrinsic noise and allows substantial reduction of the electrode arrays.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this award, we fabricated and validated ultrathin, ultrasoft, transparent and skin-conformable electronic tattoos based on two dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene. The graphene electronic tattoo (GET) has transparency above 85%, thickness less than 500 nm, stretchability up to 50%, and wearability beyond 2 days with liquid bandage protection. We invented a low-cost but high-yield &ldquo;wet transfer, dry patterning&rdquo; process for the fabrication of GET (Fig. 1) [1]. The submicron thickness ensures full conformability of GET to skin texture without using any skin adhesives. As a result, the skin-electrode interface impedance turned out to be as low as conventional Ag/AgCl gel electrodes, which are widely used in clinical measurements. The GETs we have created are the first truly mechanically and optically imperceptible e-tattoos and the open-mesh design gives the skin full breathability (Fig. 2). GET was successfully used for electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), skin hydration sensing and skin temperature sensing (Fig 3). Moreover, electrooculography (EOG) was performed using GET EOG sensors and used to control a drone by eye movement. This demonstrates the potential application of GET sensors as human-robot interface (Fig. 4) [2].&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>: One of the biggest challenges in electrophysiological measurement is high fidelity measurement during an extended period of time. Long-term measurements are challenging to perform using conventional wet gel electrodes because signal quality degrades as gel dries out. Dry electrodes are a possible solution but conventional dry electrodes suffer from high electrode-skin interface impedance, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as motion artifacts due to extensive relative motion between electrode and skin. To overcome those challenges, ultrathin tattoo-like dry electrodes based on gold nanomembranes were invented. However, thin film gold is expensive, fragile, optically visible and has limited thinness. In contrast, while graphene is only a single layer of carbon atoms with a thickness of only 0.34 nm, it is electrically conductive, mechanically robust, optically transparent, and chemically inert. Despite so many merits of graphene, its processing can very challenging due to its ultrathinness. The &ldquo;wet transfer, dry patterning&rdquo; process we invented for GET has two-fold advantages compared with conventional photolithography process. First, the dry patterning process keeps graphene free from any chemical contamination, which results in a clean graphene-skin interface. Second, the process is time- and cost-effective, which enables rapid prototyping of disposable graphene sensors for future research. Using this method, we have successfully fabricated fully skin-conformable, imperceptible, multifunctional, and long-term wearable GET. To our best knowledge, GET is the first dry electrode that has electrode-skin interface impedance as low as gel electrodes. Our work paves the way for the integration of other functional 2D materials onto the e-tattoo platform.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>: Low-cost, high-performance and imperceptible electronic tattoos with applications in mobile health, assistive technology and internet of thing can widely have impact on public health care and advancement of everyday life. It has been highlighted in more than 20 mainstream news and technology medias including BBC Technology News, IEEE Spectrum, Phys.org and so on. The research sponsored by this award has been disseminated in 3 refereed journal and conference papers and 17 seminars and conference talks. The PI was invited to speak at the Future Shock TV program in China where she also covered GET and the talk has received more than half a million views online. The research outcome has also been presented in the PI&rsquo;s lab open house on the Explore UT day which hosts more than 200 K-12 students each year, in WE@UT camp for rising women high school seniors, to members of&nbsp; Minority Academic Engineering Society, the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), as well as the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) (Fig. 5).&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />1.<span> </span>Ameri, S.K., R.
