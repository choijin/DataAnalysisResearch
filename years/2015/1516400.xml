<AbstractNarration>This award supports the research program of the Principal Investigators concerned primarily with mathematical and computational aspects of "discrete energy problems."  These are problems with classical roots -- the simplest example is that of determining the configuration of a finite number of point charges on a conducting shell interacting via mutual electrostatic repulsion -- yet are relevant to several modern large-scale scientific computing applications.  Representing surfaces and volumes by a large but finite number of points is useful for data sampling methods and for simulating complex geophysical processes such as climate changes and heat diffusion in Earth's mantle.  Minimal energy methods for particles interacting via pairwise repulsive interactions will be used to generate such approximating point configurations.  Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows will play an active role in the research program, which will involve collaboration with scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigative team is (i) developing an asymptotic analysis of discrete energy problems with an external field for nonintegrable Riesz kernels and is applying the theory to develop computationally efficient algorithms for generating large-scale node sets modeling a specified nonuniform density; (ii) analyzing energy asymptotics for periodic problems and their connection to optimal lattice (crystalline) structures; (iii) investigating the geometrical properties of optimal and near optimal polarization configurations on manifolds, especially for large numbers of points.</AbstractNarration>

Three post-doctoral fellows, three graduate students and three undergraduates  played an active role in the project and several co-authored journal research articles.  One main aspect of the research dealt with the creation and analysis of algorithms for discretizing surfaces and volumes; that is, generating finitely many points that are 'good' representatives of the surface or volume. Such "node sets" are needed for approximating solutions to systems of partial differential equations that model certain physical phenomena.

Another aspect of the research dealt with the analysis of the Chebyshev (or  polarization) problem, which involves determining the smallest number of identical sources (injectors) of a substance together with their optimal locations that can provide a required dosage of the substance to every point of a compact surface (volume). Such problems arise, for example, in the implantation of radioactive seeds for the treatment of a tumor. We now list some specific outcomes of the research.   Saff together with postdoctoral fellow A. Reznikov  derived fundamental and sharp asymptotic results for the expected covering radius of N points that are randomly and independently distributed with respect to surface measure on a sphere as well as on a class of smooth manifolds.  Precise asymptotics were also obtained for i.i.d. points in balls, cubes, and three-dimensional polyhedra.  Saff, Reznikov and collaborators derived sharp asymptotics for the expected separation of i.i.d. random points on the d-sphere as well as the expected moments of the radii of spherical caps associated with the facets of the convex hull of such random configurations. Concerning the optimal placement of N injectors, the  PIs, Reznikov and S. Borodachov derived the leading term as N&rarr;&infin; of the maximal weighted N-point hypersingular Riesz s-polarization  constant for a large class of d-rectifiable compact sets in Euclidean space.    For integrable ``Riesz-like'' kernels, Saff, Reznikov, and graduate student O. Vlasiuk  established a new minimum principle from which they deduced the limiting behavior of N-point optimal polarization configurations connecting the discrete and continuous problems. Introducing the notion of weak separation, Saff, Reznikov, and Volberg proved that sequences of optimal  N-point  hypersingular Riesz s-polarization configurations have optimal order of weak separation.   Furthermore, for these sets they established asymptotic covering properties of optimal polarization configurations connected with the optimal covering constant in d-dimensional Euclidean space. The  PIs with post-doc B. Simanek and graduate student Y. Su determined, for a d-dimensional lattice Lambda, the form of the next-order term in the asymptotic expansion of the Lambda-periodic minimal Riesz s-energy as N&rarr;&infin; in the integrable cases. It was further shown that the constant in that term is independent of the lattice.  The  PIs and O. Vlasiuk derived the asymptotic properties  as N&rarr;&infin; of N-point  configurations  minimizing  the  energy  arising  from  a Riesz s-potential and an external field in the hypersingular case.   Formulas for the weak* limit of normalized counting measures of such optimal point sets and the first-order asymptotic values of minimal energy were obtained.  The  PIs with S. Serfaty and T. Lebl\'e derived both macroscopic and microscopic results in the limit as N&rarr;&infin; for random  N-particle systems in R^d interacting via a  hypersingular Riesz potential   and subject to  an external field with respect to the associated Gibbs measure at  scaled inverse  temperature beta.
