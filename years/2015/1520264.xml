<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop an optofluidic platform for applications in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that require enhanced detection sensitivity. In the US, NMR accounts for the largest share of the molecular spectroscopy market, with an estimated value of $700 million in 2013 and $1 billion in 2018. The compact, portable system that will result from this work will find applications in existing, emerging, or new markets connected to areas spanning point-of-care diagnostics, bio-defense, environmental monitoring, and food safety. This technology will also bring new opportunities to analytical science, particularly in studies that demand the high-throughput characterization of varied chemical moieties, as routinely carried out in the pharmaceutical industry. Further, this work will positively impact efforts to improve healthcare facilities through the development of advanced and low-cost diagnostic tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in its ability to circumvent multiple limitations of existing nuclear spin polarization technologies through a robust, low-cost platform that leverages recent experimental findings. The technology to be developed introduces a new, laser-assisted route to enhancing the fractional alignment of nuclear spins in a target fluid, thus reducing the analyte's volume, the acquisition time, and the cost and size of the overall NMR system. The proposed approach articulates fluidics and photonic technologies to dynamically polarize fluids exposed to a properly engineered solid-state matrix. A central goal is to engineer the proposed device and conduct initial characterizations of its performance using model target fluids; the anticipated level of polarization is of the order 0.1% to 1% (i.e., orders of magnitude superior than that possible with commercially available magnets). These 'hyperpolarized' fluids can be used directly for inspection, or as a resource to post-polarize other (e.g., light-sensitive) fluidic systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a widely used spectroscopic and imaging technique with a range of applications in medical diagnosis, biochemical studies, and analytical science. Key to the performance of an NMR device is the so-called ?nuclear spin polarization?, which is a measure of the fractional alignment of the atomic magnetic moments in the sample towards a preferential direction. Typical NMR devices impart polarization through the use of strong magnetic fields, which, unfortunately, generate only minute spin polarization. At the center of this Phase-I SBIR is an alternate route to nuclear spin polarization where the target system &mdash; an arbitrary fluid &mdash; is spin polarized by contact with the surface of a crystal engineered to host select paramagnetic centers, i.e., atomic defects containing a magnetic moment or ?spin?. The paramagnetic centers we employ spin polarize when exposed to laser light of suitable wavelength, and thus serve as a source for the polarization of the nuclear spins in the fluid. The long-term vision of the company is the commercialization of a compact, portable device &mdash; herein dubbed ?SpinPump? &mdash; in the form of a microfluidic chip designed to host a suitable hyperpolarization structure; the fluid gets polarized as it flows through this structure under laser excitation. At the product stage, the SpinPump chip will be commercialized as the core component of an integrated benchtop NMR system or as an add-on compatible with existing high-field NMR magnets.  During this Phase-I SBIR &ndash; which extended over the period of one year &ndash; we made significant progress in the development and implementation of the proposed technique. Major tasks successfully completed during this grant period are:  Assembly and optimization of a test bench-top system integrating magnetic resonance and optical capabilities. Engineering and assembly of a set of test hyperpolarization structures. Design and fabrication of a compact microfluidic chip for delivery and extraction of the target fluid in and out of the hyperpolarization chamber. Engineering of a laser-compatible, microfluidic-chip-adapted interface for radio-frequency and microwave delivery.   Salient milestones reached throughout this grant include:  Observation of efficient NV spin polarization near the diamond surface. Observation of moderate nuclear spin polarization enhancement by contact with optically polarized paramagnetic centers.   Though promising, these results fall short from materializing the full potential of the proposed approach. A key limitation seems to be the type and concentration of paramagnetic centers, presently affected by subtle surface effects. Another issue is the sample volume, still relatively small.
