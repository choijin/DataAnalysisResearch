<AbstractNarration>The proliferation and increasing sophistication of censorship warrants continuing efforts to develop tools to evade it. Yet, designing effective mechanisms for censorship resistance ultimately depends on accurate models of the capabilities of censors, as well as how those capabilities will likely evolve. In contrast to more established disciplines within security, censorship resistance is relatively nascent, not yet having solid foundations for understanding censor capabilities or evaluating the effectiveness of evasion technologies. Consequently, the censorship resistance tools that researchers develop may ultimately fail to serve the needs of citizens who need them to communicate. Designers of these tools need a principled foundation for reasoning about design choices and tradeoffs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To provide such a foundation, this project develops a science of censorship resistance: principled approaches to understanding the nature of censorship and the best ways to facilitate desired outcomes. The approach draws upon empirical studies of censorship as the foundation for models and abstractions to allow us to reason about the censorship-resistant technologies from first principles. The project aims to characterize and model censorship activities ranging from blocked search results to interference with international network traffic. The research develops theoretical models of censorship; reconciles these with large-scale empirical measurements; and uses these observations to design censorship-resistance tools to deploy in practice, as both components of Tor and standalone systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Censorship can occur on a user's device, a server they connect to, or the network in between.  Censorship resistance could take the form of tunneling IP traffic, overlay networks, using end-to-end encryption, or other techniques that are of general importance to Internet security and privacy.  In this effort we spanned all of these possibilities, and made fundamental advances in the scientific understanding of the technologies involved.  We also helped add to a growing body of evidence that censorship may be more about who is saying something than what they're saying.     This project led to at least two security updates to the Linux operating system kernel (a potential third security update is in progress), at least two Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries (2019-9461 and 2019-14899, a potential third CVE is in progress), and updates to the encryption for a major chat application.  Our work was also used by other researchers to demonstrate attacks on the domain name system (DNS) that will be addressed in an upcoming DNS flag day, meaning all DNS servers in the world will need to be updated to protect users.     Also, we documented censorship in social media applications on both the client and server side.  One of our key results in this effort was that, for some types of censorship in some parts of the world, who is saying something is a better predictor of whether or not a post will be censored than what they're saying.
