<AbstractNarration>The University of Wisconsin Madison will host an REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) site in astronomy.  Students will work under close supervision of faculty and research scientists for ten weeks each summer on research projects that span a broad range of scientific areas. This program will benefit society by enhancing the education of undergraduates through research and professional development programs and by extending these opportunities to students from institutions otherwise unable to offer such experiences.  Students will be actively recruited at meetings of several national organizations and through participation in the National Astronomy Consortium, a new partnership that focuses on the recruitment and continued professional development of underrepresented minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research opportunities include experimental physics, instrumentation, and astrophysics. All faculty mentors are required to participate in a training seminar offered at the start of each summer. The program also includes: a lecture series in astrophysics, training in scientific presentations, web-page and Python programming, scientific ethics, graduate school preparation, field trips, and opportunities to participate in public outreach events.</AbstractNarration>
