<AbstractNarration>Subject-verb agreement is pervasive in many languages and it is one of the earliest syntactic relations that children must master. Prior research has suggested that its course of acquisition is different in different languages: early production but late comprehension have been observed in English, Spanish and Xhosa (Bantu) while production and comprehension are both early in French (by 30 months of age). The PIs in this collaborative project, Dr. Legendre and Dr. Barriere, seek to reconcile these results by evaluating the hypothesis that children can detect agreement markers better and earlier in languages in which these markers are both perceptually salient and semantically transparent.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research project will target four languages chosen because their relevant properties allow a number of factors to be teased apart: English, Spanish, French, and Haitian Creole. This project is innovative in seeking to investigate the role of perceptual factors, both at the sentential level and cross-linguistically, and fosters interdisciplinary approaches to the study of language acquisition by melding research in theoretical syntax, psycholinguistics, corpus analysis, and speech perception, and combining their respective research methods.  The project will stimulate international collaborations between the PIs in the US and research consultants in France, and will provide valuable research experience for a post-doctoral researcher, and for graduate and undergraduate students at the two US sites.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigates a crucial milestone in the acquisition of a native language- the syntactic dependency between a subject and a verb.  It adopts a multidimensional approach that combines the use of experimental methods (head-turn preference, eye tracking and video match tasks) and corpus analyses that cast light on the distribution of relevant elements- full and reduced forms of pronouns and subject-verb agreement prefixal and suffixal markers- in the input.  It also considers a broad range of cross-linguistic and cross-dialectal features by examining the speed and pattern of acquisition in three varieties of English (Mainstream American English, and varieties that slightly and greatly differ from Mainstream American English), colloquial Hexagonal French, two varieties of Spanish (Mexican and Dominican) and two varieties of Haitian Creole (Standard Port-au-Prince and Northern Cap Haitian varieties), in more that a 1,000 monolingual and bilingual toddlers and preschoolers- between age one and five- substantial proportions of whom are from low socio-economic backgrounds and from under-represented ethnic groups- including black and hispanic/latino children, that constitute a fast growing proportion of the American school-aged population.  The results of the study provide evidence for the abstract nature of subject-verb dependency as early as two years of age and evidence of productivity at two years six months, and earlier evidence of comprehension than previous studies for English and Spanish.  They also enable us to distinguish between factors that have a facilitating effect on acquisition and those that do not.  The former include:  a) the fact that a language allows for null subjects (pro-drop);  b) the linguistic status of the number marker;  c) semantic transparency that is the degree of consistency with which the phonological form is associated with singular versus plural number;  d) the consistency of the realization of variable markers in the input;  e) Paradigm Cell Complexity (a measure of word-structure complexity that has been proposed to impact language change).  In contrast, the two factors that seem to have a more limited impact include the position of the number marker in relation to the verb and the frequency of the marker in the input.  The relation between receptive (comprehension) and expressive (production) language skills was also examined with controlled elicitation task.  Our findings reduce the gap between comprehension and production that has been documented in the literature and provide evidence for system-based morphosyntactic hypotheses rather than lexically driven account of the development of subject-verb dependencies.  Taken together, these results enable us to establish clear developmental milestones for typical language acquisition which can now inform the development of linguistically appropriate language assessment instruments to be used by educators and clinicians, in order to identify language impairment and facilitate early intervention.  This project provided useful teaching material for undergraduate and graduate students in linguistics and speech-language-pathology majors and for early childhood educators? professional developent. It also enabled undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented minorities, and a post-doctoral researcher to gain and enhance STEM-related research and professional skills.
