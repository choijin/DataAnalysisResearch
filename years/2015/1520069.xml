<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $4,000 were requested and have been recommended to provide for travel support of ten teachers, graduate student and junior faculty presenters at a symposium entitled 'Integrating Polymer Science and Chemistry Research in the Classroom' to be held at the 249th ACS National meeting on March 22-26, 2015 in Denver CO. A similar symposium was last held at the ACS spring meeting in 2013.The Symposium is designed to bring together high school teachers, university faculty, and graduate students involved in creating research-based class-room activities, laboratory experiments, and lectures based on current polymer research for implementation in the classroom. The symposium will serve as a venue for educators to share best practices, exchange classroom activities, and build a network for continuing exchange and collaborative development of research based curricula. Special consideration for the awards will be given for institutions  submitting for the first time, and those serving underrepresented populations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "Integrating Polymer Science and Chemistry Research in the Classroom" symposium held at the 249th ACS National Meeting and Exposition in Denver, CO, March 23rd, 2015, brought together high school teachers, university/college faculty, and graduate students from eight colleges/universities and seven high schools from across the country to share best practices, exchange classroom activities, and establish a network for continuing exchange and collaborative development of research-based curricula.  The symposium was hosted in the Division of Chemical Education and co-sponsored by the Division of Polymer Chemistry (POLY) and the Polymeric Materials: Science and Engineering (PMSE) divisions of the American Chemical Society.  Thirteen oral presentations were provided that described the creation of research-based classroom activities, laboratory experiments, and lectures based on current polymer research for implementation in the classroom.  Abstracts of the symposium are published in the Abstracts of Papers, 249th ACS National Meeting &amp; Exposition, Denver, CO, United States, March 22-26, 2015 (2015), CHED-205 &ndash; 218.  There is a growing need for a workforce trained in STEM fields and for teachers qualified to teach these subjects in order to maintain economic competitiveness of the U.S. Incorporating current research in high school science classrooms provides an opportunity to enrich laboratories and lectures and enhance student interest in polymer chemistry.  Participants in the symposium represented a broad range of diverse institutes with the goal of enhancing student participation in research and encouraging the pursuit of post-secondary education in science and engineering.
