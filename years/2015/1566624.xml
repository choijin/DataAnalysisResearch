<AbstractNarration>Measuring similarity between geometric objects is a common task in many applications: detecting change in a medical scan, recognizing and indexing content in an image or video, comparing protein structures, or automatically picking the right object from a conveyor belt. Input images, shapes, or models come in different representations that have to be transformed to compare them to a large database of possibilities. This project explores transformations of certain classes (nearly affine transformations) using tools like limited Frechet distance and small metric distortions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific proposed problems include computing Frechet distances between terrains and between polygons with holes. Both fixed parameter tractable exact algorithms and polygonal time approximation algorithms will be studied for these problems. The project will also consider the hardness of approximation. For the topic of metric distortions, the proposed problems include computing metric distortions between simple polygons and between discrete point sets. Both exact and approximation algorithms will be studied. The goal is not only to understand the mathematics behind exact transformations, but also to see if approximate transformations will allow faster algorithms with some quality guarantees; most application of similarity measure at present is heuristic, and does not come with guarantees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measuring similarity between geometric objects is a fundamental problem and has many applications, so this project, and the students that it trains, will have potential impact on theory and practice in many areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Measuring similarity between geometric objects is a common task in many applications: detecting change in a medical scan, recognizing and indexing content in an image or video, comparing protein structures, or automatically picking the right object from a conveyor belt.  Input images, shapes, or models come in different representations resulting in different mathematical formulation for the problem of measuring their similarity.   This project studied different possible similarity measures.  Specifically, it was focused on the Frechet distance for comparing geometric surfaces and curves, and low distortion embeddings for comparing point sets.  Comparing surfaces is a common task in protein design and engineering, and low distortion maps are useful for data visualization.   With the support of this award, the PI and his student could achieve the first algorithm for deciding the Frechet distance between two surfaces.  In addition, they found approximation algorithms whose running time can be quantified based on the geometric complexity of the input surfaces.   Also, the research supported by this award resulted in several algorithms for finding minimum distortion embedding of metric spaces into trees (or graphs that are similar to trees).   These algorithms are designed to be efficeint if embeddings of small distortion exist.  Also, they can quickly detect if all embeddings have large distortions, which means that the point sets are dissimilar. Moreover, these algorithms are analyzed based on several parameters of the input such as the intrinsic dimensionality, as such they give insight about the complexity of the problem for different inputs.  Since measuring similarity among objects is a fundamental problem that appears in different applications, it is important to train students with mathematical insight to the problem.  This award supported a student to do his PhD in this area.       Last Modified: 10/09/2019       Submitted by: Amir Nayyeri]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
