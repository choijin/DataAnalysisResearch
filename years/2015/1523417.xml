<AbstractNarration>10th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage (NAS), a premier international forum for the presentation of research results in networking, high-performance computer architecture, and parallel and distributed data storage technologies,  seeks to increase student participation in symposium and the field. The proposed funding would support the travel of eligible US students to the symposium. Travel grants encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort is made to reach out to women and under-represented minorities. Preference is given to students who will present their research at NAS.</AbstractNarration>
