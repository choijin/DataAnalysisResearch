<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on investigating the nucleation or formation of very small new particles in the atmosphere. The method relies on complex calculations involving the structural and thermochemical properties of atmospheric clusters.  Modeling results will be compared with measurements where they are available.  The project will result in nucleation schemes that can be incorporated into regional and global models to reduce uncertainties in the assessment of the climatic and environmental impacts of atmospheric aerosols. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this effort is to develop new schemes of multicomponent nucleation in the atmosphere involving sulfuric acid, water, ammonia, methylamines, and organics. The project consists of 4 tasks: (1) Quantum chemistry studies of neutral and charged ternary clusters; (2) Development of new nucleation models; (3) Application and evaluation of new nucleation schemes in the atmosphere; and (4) Assessing the climate implications of ternary nucleation processes.  The implications of the new nucleation schemes on the aerosol indirect radiative forcing will be evaluated using the GEOS-Chem model.</AbstractNarration>
