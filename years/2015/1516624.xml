<AbstractNarration>This project will use state-of-the-art computational resources, namely Blue Waters, and cutting-edge modeling software in advancing the study of climate change and its potential impacts on our planet over this century. It is expected that results from our studies will be an integral part of the scientific analysis of climate change for the next major international climate assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the next U.S. National Climate Assessment. These assessments are an important input to the national and international policy development process. These analyses will be a significant contribution to the coordinated international special computational studies and model intercomparison to analyze past and projected future changes in the Earth?s climate system. In addition, the results of these studies will be fully available to the scientific community for further analyses and resulting insights into the processes, mechanisms, and consequences of climate variability and climate change. On top of this, these studies will be a major input to studies of the potential impacts of climate change on human society across many different sectors (e.g., health, food, water, energy, transportation) and on ecosystems. No previous global modeling study has provided such high resolution information at the regional scales over the time periods needed to fully analyze these issues. The simulations and analyses are designed to use the Blue Waters petascale computing resources and could not be completed without a computational facility like Blue Waters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two purposes. The first is aimed at better quantifying future regional climate change by running a high-resolution (0.25 degree atmosphere, 1 degree ocean) global coupled climate model, namely an advanced version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), in the framework of CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 6) to meet the needs for the next generation assessments of climate change. CMIP6 will be the next phase in the international coordination of special computational studies to analyze the past and projected future changes in the Earth?s climate system. CESM, one of the world?s best models of the Earth?s climate system, has been developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in coordination with a community of scientists at universities and national laboratories. The second purpose will be specific studies that grow upon our existing NSF PRAC project to further clarify the understanding the effects of small-scale regional features and interactions across spatial scales in climate through even higher-resolution CESM modeling studies on Blue Waters that will push the state-of-the-art for such analyses. For this project, we have assembled a team from the University of Illinois and the National Center for Atmospheric Research comprised of both highly recognized experts in global climate modeling and analysis and experts in computer science and information technology. This team already has extensive experience with Blue Waters (as well as with other high performance computers) based on the existing PRAC project.</AbstractNarration>

The objectives of this project were (1) to quantify changes in future climate extremes using two high resolution versions of the Community Earth System Model (CESM):  one with a high resolution atmosphere (0.25&deg; atmosphere, 1.0&deg; ocean) and the other with high resolution atmosphere and ocean (0.25&deg; atmosphere, 0.1&deg; ocean) where ocean eddies are derived internally instead of being parameterized; (2) to evaluate the effects of dynamical downscaling (DD).  DD inputs time varying boundary conditions from a lower-resolution limited-area global climate model (GCM) into a regional climate model (RCM); and (3) work on climate parameterization uncertainty continues via a multiple physics ensemble (MPE) analysis.     The CESM pre-industrial (PI) control simulation with a fully coupled 0.25&deg; atmosphere and 1.0&deg; ocean completed 100 years.  In extended control simulations, it is desirable to have the radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere below |0.1| W/m2 so that model drift is small and follow-on simulations, such as 20th Century historical or associated climate sensitivity simulations, can be branched with suitably balanced and realistic initial conditions. The PI control running on Blue Waters reached 0.03 W/m2.     The expectation in conducting climate simulations at higher resolution is not necessarily to improve the modeled mean climate state but to capture many aspects of extreme events and diurnal cycle patterns that cannot be resolved at lower resolution. However, we observed improvements to the mean state, notably in precipitation, in the PI control and anticipate that this will translate to a better representation of precipitation extremes.  Five regions of improvement stood out:  the Andes and interior Amazon, the Indian Monsoon region, North America, the Tropical North Atlantic Ocean, and Tropical Southeast Pacific Ocean.     We also studied Earth's future climate at unprecedented resolution &ndash; 0.25&deg; atmosphere and 0.1&deg; ocean &ndash; with a CESM configuration validated recently for present-day climate. It produces a smaller climatological sea surface temperature (SST) bias in the topics than standard resolution runs, and also more realistic interannual variability of Eastern Pacific SSTs.  At this very high resolution, increased confidence can be given to potential future regional climate changes arising from both natural and anthropogenic forcing mechanisms.  For example, by resolving ocean mesoscale features, we found better representation of the SSTs off the US East coast, due to a better Gulf Stream path, which in turn modifies the atmospheric precipitation and storm tracks.     For dynamic downscaling, the Weather Research and Forecast model as the RCM was used to evaluate the performance of six dynamically downscaled decadal historical simulations with 12-km resolution for a large domain (7200&thinsp;km&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;6180&thinsp;km) covering most of North America. The study is based on high-spatial-resolution (12 km) RCM simulations using one numerical model to evaluate the model performance and the uncertainties coming from different boundary conditions and/or different model setup.  The initial and boundary conditions are taken from three separate GCMs and one reanalysis data.  Initial findings for changes in seasonal and annual precipitation using CCSM4 boundary conditions with a business-as-usual greenhouse gas emission for 2085-2094 show statistically significant changes in seasonal precipitation.     We continued using the regional Climate-Weather Research Forecasting model (CWRF) in a MPE configuration at 30-km grid spacing over the United States, to examine uncertainties in the treatment of cloud, aerosol and radiative processes.  When driven by the ECMWF-Interim Reanalysis (ERI), the CWRF ensemble mean exhibits higher prediction skills than the ERI. The variabilities of almost all ensemble members are closer to the normalized standard deviation of the observations than that of the ERI data. This is physically meaningful because the CWRF has a higher resolution and can simulate the spatial variability more realistically.
