<AbstractNarration>1536221&lt;br/&gt;Mosher &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central Valley California Rural Water Infrastructure Development and Outreach Project &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the United States, hundreds of thousands of families do not have reliable access to clean drinking water. This reality impacts the US economy and national security because the areas under the most stress tend to supply much of the nation's food, fiber, mineral, and energy resources. The objective of this project is to mitigate this problem by developing a methodology that will allow local communities to combine resources to overcome this scale issue and to address the maintenance and upgrade backlog of their systems by identifying potential public-private partnerships that will provide financial support. The effort will focus on the San Joaquin Valley in California for its test case, using stakeholder driven workshops to identify the local issues and develop the necessary communal relationships and support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a new and unique approach for helping these rural communities through a combination of stakeholder driven activities and tradeoff analyses. The approach will form the foundation for bringing rural communities together to leverage common resources and increase their economic power, with the end goal of using their collective involvement to pursue private-public partnerships that will fund the necessary system and infrastructure improvements. While stakeholder driven processes, communal approaches, and tradeoff analyses have been used in the past, this effort will be the first to combine the three with the goal of simultaneously developing engineered and financial solutions for the region. The San Joaquin Valley is one of the fastest growing regions in California with an average growth rate from 2000-2010 of 21.6 % and a population of approximately 4 million people. The population is predominantly Hispanic (95.6) with a median income that is nearly half of the California median ($22,792 vs. $58,328 in 2012). In 2006, six counties in the San Joaquin Valley had the highest percentage of residents below the federal poverty line with approximately 49 % of the residents living in poverty. Less than 1 in 3 has a high school education or better. From 2008-2012, about three-quarters (73 %) of the San Joaquin Valley?s economic production is from agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, with transportation and warehousing (4 %), accommodation and food services (3 %), retail trade (3 %), manufacturing (3 %), utilities (2 %) and administrative support and waste management (2 %) making up the majority of the balance. Approximately 50 % of the population works in agriculture producing over 300 crops that represent approximately 13 % of the national agricultural production. The statistics above show that this project will provide broad impacts to a mostly Hispanic and impoverished community that lacks the educational background and technical expertise to tackle such a difficult problem. Through helping communities increase the reliability and quality of their local water supplies, this project may also contribute to local, regional, and national economies by increasing worker production as well as by reducing health costs associated with water quality ailments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The National Water Research Institute (NWRI) and The Chronicles Group, Inc., requested funding from NSF to support a series of stakeholder-driven workshops to identify, raise awareness, and consider solutions to the water quality and water scarcity challenges facing rural communities in California?s Central Valley, which a major producer of agricultural products for the U.S. and world.  Water scarcity is a direct threat to farmers in the Valley, farmworkers who rely on successful crops to maintain employment, and rural community members who require sufficient water to meet basic household needs, such as drinking, cooking, bathing, and toilet flushing.  Nationally and globally, the broader ramifications of insufficient water supply affect the availability of California food products worldwide and the overall economic sustainability of the agricultural business sector.  Locally, it severely limits the ability of small communities to support themselves and thrive.  Both NWRI and The Chronicles Group are dedicated to addressing challenging water supply issues.  NWRI is a nonprofit organization focused on working with scientists and policymakers in the water industry to support research and activities that improve water quality and ensure reliable supplies of water.  The Chronicles Group is a nonprofit that specializes in communicating messages and engaging the public on issues that affect both human and ecological systems, with emphasis on access to drinking water.  NWRI?s role in this project was to organize, plan, and facilitate the workshops, while the Chronicles Group filmed both (1) the workshop and (2) interviews with workshop participants and stakeholders.  As part of this effort, NWRI and The Chronicles Group engaged community nonprofit organizations, Self-Help Enterprises and Rural Community Assistance Corporation, to assist with planning and outreach.  Both organizations already had a presence in the Valley and were addressing the water quality and supply challenges faced by these communities.  Staff from these organizations were trusted by community members, some of whom were migrant workers.   Two workshops were held in the Valley and conducted in English and Spanish to ensure broad community participation.  More than 100 people attended each workshop, including local community members, utility and local government representatives, and staff from the State Water Resources Control Board, which regulates public drinking water systems in the State of California.   The first workshop, held June 15, 2015, at Sierra Vista Elementary School in Arvin, California, focused on the challenges associated with arsenic in water supplies and the implementation of point-of-use filtration devices to remove arsenic as a short-term solution.  The second workshop, held June 16, 2015, at the Orange Center Elementary School in Fresno, California, focused on the challenges associated with nitrites and uranium in local privately-owned wells and the increasing problem of wells being pumped dry due to drought and groundwater overdraft.   Key conclusions from NSF-funded workshops:  Community involvement is crucial in making decisions regarding drinking water and wastewater. RCAC and Self-Help Enterprises have been instrumental in assisting the community with water issues and will continue to do so. No easy solution exists for creating and maintaining adequate infrastructure for community drinking water supplies in the Central Valley, and the community must continue to participate in the process to develop these resources. Educational support must be provided to help community members continue to learn and understand facts about their drinking water supplies. Workshop participants agreed that the NSF-funded workshops were informative and recommended that similar workshops be developed in the future.    The output of this effort included both (1) a 32-page workshop summary report and (2) film footage.  The workshop summary report serves as a case study on how small communities may address water quality and quantity challenges.  The film footage was incorporated into a 92-minute documentary titled, "Beyond the Brink," which examined the water-food nexus, specifically focusing on how water scarcity issues in the Valley could affect national security.  The film was produced by the Chronicles Group and distributed and released in April 2018 by Freestyle Digital Media.  "Beyond the Brink" is available on video streaming services.  Visit the film?s website at https://beyondthebrinkdocumentary.org/ for a complete list of viewing options.    The hope is that anyone &ndash; from farmworker to water industry professional to policymaker &ndash; can watch "Beyond the Brink" to better understand water issues and seek solutions.  The film provides an overview of water quality and quantity issues in the Central Valley, including drought, groundwater contamination, groundwater overdraft, watershed management, agriculture, salinity, water rights, and policy as related to the water-food nexus.  The film is a valuable educational and training resource for anyone interested in understanding more about water scarcity in general and water shortages in the Central Valley in particular.  Furthermore, the film discusses challenges facing small water systems and disadvantaged communities and can be used as an outreach tool to (1) communicate with and educate these groups and (2) help water industry personnel better understand the concerns of these groups.
