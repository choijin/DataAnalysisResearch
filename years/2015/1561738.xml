<AbstractNarration>Researchers at ETR Associates will conduct a mixed methods longitudinal study on the malleable factors that affect community college students? persistence in information and communications technologies (ICT) classes and careers. The project involves a partnership between a research organization, about 25 community colleges, and five external advisors with expertise in higher education research, policy, and teaching. It will test and extend theories of student persistence and build on the team?s prior research on community college pathways to four-year computer science majors. The study will produce evidence on factors that influence retention, degree attainment, and technical skills development for community college students in ICT fields and inform future research about appropriate theory and measurement tools for use in studies about community college to ICT career pathways.  Research results will inform investments in broadening participation programs, institutional and classroom policies and procedures, and intervention programs designed to increase persistence in ICT programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will test a portion of an expanded and adapted theory of student persistence to investigate how different factors influence community college students? outcomes. The project will investigate three research questions: (1) What baseline factors (individual, relational, and institutional) are most related to the intentions of community college students to complete their ICT courses?  (2) What baseline and interim factors are most related to completion of the ICT course? And (3) What baseline, interim, and current factors are most related to other indicators of success that include program completion, technical skill development, and enhanced workforce capacity?  Data analyses will proceed from descriptive and bivariate analyses to multilevel linear and logistic regression analyses. These will be guided by theory as well as prior research on the role of individual, relational, and institutional factors in career pathways. The study will yield evidence about what leads to retention, degree attainment, and technical skills development for underrepresented community college students in information and communications technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in three thematic areas: STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation, and STEM workforce development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The U.S. is facing a shortage of workers trained for an information and communications technology (ICT) workforce that can compete in a global economy, due in part to the underrepresentation of some groups, such as women, certain racial/ethnic groups, and first-generation college students. The large numbers of diverse students at Community Colleges (CCs) interested in obtaining technical training make them a key asset for workforce development. This study describes the individual, relational, and institutional factors that influence and limit CC students’ persistence in ICT education and, ultimately, entering into the workforce.       There are several unique contributions of this study to the broader social science and information and communications technology education fields. First, the data were collected at up to three time points from a diverse group of over 600 students from 17 CCs across the state of California enrolled in entry-level ICT classes. Second, we collected data on multiple levels of potential influence (i.e., individual, relational, and institutional) which allowed us to assess the extent to which these factors impacted the educational pathways of students from groups that are underrepresented in ICT. Third, this study went beyond traditional definitions of academic success that focus on degree completion or transfer to also include completing a technical certificate, skill attainment, and enhanced work capacity.           Intellectual Merit.  The results of this study expand what we know about the different kinds of students that take ICT courses and the longitudinal predictors of persistence of CC students in ICT fields. There was variation in students’ reasons for taking an ICT class, which included personal interest, job-related, and academic. And there were differences in the kinds of educational supports and barriers reported across different demographic groups, as measured by age, gender, and whether students were the first in their family to attend college. Completion of a certificate, degree or transfer was influenced by the extent of prior ICT coursework, computing self-efficacy, the value placed on computing, and gender role stereotypes as measured at the beginning of an introductory ICT course. This shows the importance of those initial beliefs on completion of key academic milestones. In addition, the findings show the important role that relationships  play in students’ long-term success. For male students, more positive interactions with faculty (as reported by students after the class ended) increased the likelihood that students would report enhanced work capacity and complete a certificate, degree or transfer. For female and Black and Hispanic students, being in a romantic relationship increased the likelihood they would complete a certificate, degree or transfer.         Broader Impact. The findings show that gender continues to play a role in student’s persistence in ICT. In this study, the majority of students were male; they reported both fewer barriers and supports to achieving their goals, placed higher value on computing, reported stronger computing self-efficacy and perceived a more positive classroom climate. They were also more likely to earn a certificate/degree or transfer. The findings highlight the importance of IT course preparation and positive interaction with faculty for all students, and for creating a welcoming classroom environment for women, specifically. The findings also show the importance of malleable factors like computing self-efficacy and value placed on computing for students from groups that are underrepresented in computing fields. Based on these findings, we have made several recommendations for CCs that may increase women’s and underrepresented minorities' interest in pursuing IT, including: offering professional development opportunities for faculty and staff that emphasize the role they play in helping students achieve their goals and prepare for the workforce; extending educational services and resources to relational supports (romantic partners, family); and, continued and ongoing equity and inclusion training to further combat gender and racial stereotypes.
