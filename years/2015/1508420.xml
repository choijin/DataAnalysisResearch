<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Phonons are collective vibrations of the atoms in a solid and are the dominant heat carriers in materials such as semiconductors. Phonon transport physics is important as it dictates thermal and other related properties of materials. Normally phonons either travel diffusively, randomly scattering from lattice impurities, or ballistically, in a straight line.   This project aims to investigate a new regime of phonon transport termed  "phonon localization" where the wave nature of the phonons prevents them from propogating. The study could lead to new approaches to engineer thermal properties beyond the current paradigm, in particular achieving ultra-low thermal conductivity, which is important for a wide range of thermal technologies such as thermal insulation and thermal to electrical energy conversion. The project broadens its impacts by providing interdisciplinary education and training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students while attracting underrepresented groups into science. The integrated outreach activities provide education and research opportunities in nano- and energy technologies for disadvantaged, first generation high school students in the greater San Diego area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Anderson localization has been experimentally demonstrated in both fermions and bosons, including electrons, photons (light), and recently with ultrasound. Theoretical studies have already predicted localization of thermal phonons, but until now there has been no experimental verification of these predictions, presumably due to the daunting challenges associated with the perceived experiments. This project aims to overcome these experimental challenges and carry out the first systematic study of phonon localization in low dimensional systems with disorders. The phonon localization regime is experimentally probed by thermal transport measurements of semiconductor nanowires with precisely controlled surface morphology and impurity concentration. Phonon localization signatures to be investigated include the dependence of thermal conductance on the nanowire geometry, surface roughness, and defect concentration as well as the temperature.</AbstractNarration>

To enable the measurement on both material systems, we first developed a measurement platform that has high thermometry and calorimetry platform, which is capable of measuring ~50 microKevin temperature change and &lt; 1 pW/K thermal conductance [1]. On a-Si,&nbsp;&nbsp;we fabricated integrated devices of Si nanoribbons and nanowires with thermal measurement microdevices (Figure 1), which enabled us to systematically measure thermal conductivity of Si nanostructures with characteristic sizes ranging from 5 nm to 2 microns. We found surprisingly high thermal conductivity of over 5 W/m-K in large aSi structures [2] (Figure 2). We also found that the dominant heat carrier in aSi are propagating phonon modes (also known as propagons), which has a broad range of mean free path, ranging from ~ 5 nm to ~ 10 microns. This result can also well explain several previous studies showing size dependent thermal conductivity in a-Si. On the SiO2 front, we have designed SiO2 nanoribbons to study the effect of SPhP resonance on thermal emission of individual ribbons (Figure 3). We devised a scheme to measure effective thermal conductivity of ribbons with various lengths to extract thermal emissivity using a thermal fin model. Our results show that the ribbons with width ranging from 5-11 microns have significantly higher thermal conductivity than that of thin films with the same thickness [3] (Figure 4). More importantly, the emissivity increases at lower temperature, indicating that this enhanced emissivity is due to the SPhP resonance in the ribbons with finite width. Then we further showed that by combining the SPhP resonance and surface plasmon polariton (SPP) with Au nanoparticles we can further enhance the emissivity by about four-fold. These studies highlights the important role of SPhP on thermal radiation properties. Lastly, we show that the presence of the SPhP, which are surface waves with very long propagation length (over 1 mm), can enhance thermal conductivity of heat conduction in SiO2 nanowires. This result was achieved by designing, fabricating and measuring SiO2 nanowires with 100-500 nm width and thickness and 100s of micron in length (Figure 5). For long nanowires, we observed effective thermal conductivity higher than that of bulk SiO2 values (1.4 W/m-K). In addition to research, the project also provides significant training opportunities to students at graduate, undergraduate, and high-school levels. The main graduate student working on this project was a female student. She has achieved outstanding academic and research performance in the area of nanoscale thermal transport physics and is now an assistant professor at National University of Singapore. We have also partnered with several outreach programs at UCSD to provide research and summer internship opportunities to underrepresented undergraduate and high-school students in the areas of thermal physics. For instance, due to the close proximity of UCSD to Mexica, we have trained over 10 Hispanic students over the course of this project. Figure 6 shows two Hispanic female high-school students (left two) and one Hispanic undergraduate student (right) working with a graduate student in the lab to study radiative properties of metal oxide nanowires.&nbsp;</p> <p>References:</p> <p>[1] J.
