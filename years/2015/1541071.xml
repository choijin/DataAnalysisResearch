<AbstractNarration>The progress of science in the United States is dependent on the development of a future STEM workforce that is well-trained, highly effective, and enriched through participation of the diverse talent of the nation. This award is being used to support a week-long strategic planning workshop that will bring together faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students from the Universidad del Turabo, Universidad Metropolitana, and University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sciences, with additional participants attending from government and private sector organizations within Puerto Rico.  The goal of the collaborative effort is to develop sustainable education and research pathways into the marine and coastal sciences for Hispanic students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this workshop is to develop novel educational models, or adapt existing ones, that are necessary for building a comprehensive coupled geoscience education and research program at minority serving institutions in Puerto Rico. The overarching goal is to create a pathway to STEM success that will lead to an increase in the number of underrepresented students from minority serving institutions participating in geoscience-relevant disciplines and careers, as well as increase geoscience literacy. The workshop is bringing together new and existing Puerto Rico partners in government, academia, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector to discuss and develop an educational framework for creating a new linked academic year and summer research curriculum.  The workshop agenda consists of a two-day symposium and strategic planning meeting followed by 5 days of fieldwork and seminars. Participants will include UT,UMET and UMCES faculty, 12 undergraduates and 5 graduate students. The field/seminar components are designed to help identify areas of mutual strength among the collaborators, to inform strategies for developing an effective and sustainable multiyear undergraduate science education and research curriculum at institutions in Puerto Rico, as well as test the efficacy of potential research programs with new and existing partners. Extensive evaluation and assessment of the workshop processes and outcomes will help to document opportunities and barriers for achieving the goals of the workshop.</AbstractNarration>

Over the week-long program, workshop participants discussed research and education strategies, conducted coastal lagoon research activities with students, and engaged in professional development seminars. An in-depth evaluation of the workshop&rsquo;s activities and outcomes was a key part of the project. We found synergies in coastal lagoon research interests across disciplines and among partners from academia, government, non-profits and private industry, identifying a number of novel, transdisciplinary research areas to pursue. There was universal interest among workshop participants to explore projects in molecular biology, ecology, biogeochemistry, hydrodynamics and computer science that could improve understanding of bioluminescent coastal lagoon ecosystem processes. Importantly, these research projects could be coupled to new, experiential learning opportunities for undergraduate students attending non-research universities in Puerto Rico. The workshop also provided a unique opportunity to bring together potential scientist mentors from across multiple organizations in Puerto Rico, all of whom were particularly interested in training undergraduate students to increase coastal and marine science capacity in Puerto Rico.</p> <p>The broader impacts of this workshop were its success introducing a new cohort of students to coastal lagoon research and geosciences and in exploring new ways to improve undergraduate students&rsquo; access to research opportunities. The students participating in the workshop gained a new found appreciation and understanding of marine research. After four days of field, lab and data synthesis work, students presented their lagoon research findings to scientists and their parents at the workshop&rsquo;s science symposium. During these presentations all of the students encouraged their parents to protect the environment and, in particular, to recognize the importance of sustaining the health of Puerto Rico&rsquo;s bioluminescent lagoons, which are ecologically and economically important to the island.</p> <p>By the end of the workshop, over 75% of students reported they felt more confident in their ability to understand geosciences research and over 60% expressed interest in pursuing a Ph.D. in geosciences. Further, all students improved significantly in English competence and oral/written skills from the start to the end of the workshop.</p> <p>The workshop highlighted the current financial uncertainties that students and the scientist-mentors are facing in Puerto Rico and their success in pursuing geosciences research and careers hinged on opportunities to provide support to incentivize student participation. Many of the undergraduate students participating in the workshop come from families with limited education and incomes and must constantly balance school, work, and family commitments. It was clear from the workshop that students were eager to engage in experiential learning opportunities and research. However, they stressed that for them to participate in research, the universities would need to provide course credit for research, stipends for summer internships, and travel support to research sites. In addition, the students highlighted the need for building cohorts of like-minded geosciences-driven students for peer-mentoring and support, and they encouraged the universities to provide meeting spaces, tutoring support and networking opportunities to increase student success.</p> <p>Since the workshop, students have formed environmental clubs, presented their research findings from the workshop at a university-wide student conference, conducted beach clean-ups, and participated in several field trips to meet marine scientists working in the field.
