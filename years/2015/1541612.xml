<AbstractNarration>PI: Fisher, Jonathan &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:1541612 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, whose driving goal is the need for a portable device capable of quantifying biomarkers of traumatic brain injury (TBI), focuses on determining the utility of Electroencephalography (EEG) and Diffuse Correlation Spectrography (DCS) for detecting TBI biomarkers in an animal model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TBI is a very significant issue in both military and civilian medicine. Diagnosis and assessment of TBI patients is generally performed using clinical imaging modalities (MRI, CT). However, the future availability of portable devices for assessing TBI would fundamentally improve the outlook for TBI patients. The diagnosis and treatment of TBI is impeded by gaps in regulatory science due to a lack of quantifiable biomarkers. Two complementary measurement parameters have potential to fill this gap. (1) measurement of somatosensory evoked electrophysiological potentials (SSEPs); and (2) diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS). This proposal seeks to evaluate the utility of these parameters for detecting TBI in an animal model without the need for a baseline, pre-injury measurement.</AbstractNarration>
