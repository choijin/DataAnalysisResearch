<AbstractNarration>Rapid, short-term global warming events in the Early Paleogene (~65-45 Million years ago) were caused by massive greenhouse gas release into the ocean-atmosphere system. These warming events, called "hyper thermals", had far-reaching effects on the evolution of life on Earth, ecosystems, and the carbon cycle. The most extreme of these events was the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (~55.5 Million years ago). Hyperthermals resemble what could happen during anthropogenic climate change, and provide analogs for the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and their long-term effects on life on Earth. By testing earth system interactions during the Paleogene hyperthermals, this interdisciplinary project will provide new insight into global climate-carbon cycle feedbacks and extremes in climate. The research will serve the national interest by improving a widely used Community Earth System Model on high-performance computers, and by synthesizing data and model output with observations from novel isotopic and trace element techniques in marine geology and paleoceanography. Multidisciplinary research and educational activities are integrated and will lead to development and widespread circulation of educational materials on abrupt climate change, thus enhancing training in quantitative science for undergraduate and high school students from diverse backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this collaborative effort involves integration of new biotic, isotopic and trace element proxies with existing data into a state-of-the-art, high-resolution, comprehensive earth system model to test the hypothesis that deep-sea ventilation released a massive amount of carbon from the refractory dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool during hyperthermal events, increasing atmospheric CO2 levels, and thus amplifying climate change through carbon-cycle feedback. The research team will investigate the environmental response (e.g., ocean acidification and deoxygenation) and its impact on pelagic ecosystem structure for three Paleogene hyperthermals with different magnitudes and durations. The project will focus on a key mechanism involving remineralization of organic matter and oxidation of the DOM pool in the ocean, with potentially major implications for future climate evolution, addressing these questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) How might changes in oceanic productivity, organic carbon remineralization, ocean oxygenation, and export efficiency during hyperthermals have contributed to changes in the oceanic dissolved organic matter reservoir? &lt;br/&gt;(2) Could DOM release due to enhanced ocean ventilation have been at least a partial cause of Paleogene hyperthermals?&lt;br/&gt;(3) What are the implications of Paleogene climate?carbon cycle changes associated with DOM storage and release for future extremes in climate and the environment?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New data on planktic and benthic foraminifera, and accumulation of marine barite on the same samples will be obtained and integrated with a large amount of existing data to provide insight into ecosystem-dependent export productivity and remineralization, as well as regionally varying vertical carbon fluxes. Recently gathered data from the equatorial regions will be incorporated in a database to provide initial conditions for the earth system model. The model results will give insight into changes in ocean stratification, vertical carbon gradients, DOM reservoirs, oxygenation, and ecosystem composition during transitions into and out of hyperthermals. In particular, the team will evaluate the possibility of extreme changes in response to ecosystem-related fluctuations in DOM accumulation and subsequent oxidation and emission from the oceans, because the DOM pool is the largest reservoir of easily interchangeable carbon. This mechanism has not been thoroughly explored as a contributor to a transition into a hothouse climate with more extreme weather patterns.</AbstractNarration>

We looked at changes in the oceanic carbon cycle, also called 'the biological pump', through which organic matter produced in the surface waters by microscopic algae moves into the Twilight Zone (100-1000m depth), and from there to the seafloor.

During the transfer from surface to deep sea in the biological pump, organic matter is eaten and oxidized by bacteria, so that very little arrives at the sea floor. We looked at populations of microscopic deep-sea dwelling organisms (called foraminifera), which makes complex little shells of calcite, which are preserved as fossils. These deep-sea foraminifera depend on organic matter arriving at the sea floor from the sunlit waters at the surface for their food. We found that in general, these organisms show&nbsp; - through declines in their abundance and changes in the types of common species - that less food arrived at the deep sea floor during periods of global warming in the past, about 56-45 million years ago. Through collaboration with a geochemist, however, we also found that more organic matter actually moved from the surface into the Twilight Zone. This zone thus received more organic matter from above, but less was deposited out of it at the bottom, to arrive at the deep sea floor and feed benthic organisms. This contradiction can be explained if there is more actual 'use' of the organic matter in the Twilight Zone, i.e., the particles of organic matter (food for the benthos) accumulate in the Twilight zone, where the organic matter is oxidized and dissolved through the activities of bacteria, which during warmer periods 'work harder', i.e., have higher metabolic rates. Through their activities, the oxygen in these zones is used up faster, in oxidizing organic matter, resulting in expansion of Oxygen Minimum Zones. We used our data in preliminary geochemical models, and the model output suggests that one effect of such increased bacterial activity could be a process in which CO2 moves out of the oceans into the atmopshere, thus exacerbating warming. This research project is a collaborative effort, an some collaborators have asked for an extension because of the pandemic; final integration of all data on organisms and geochemistry into ocean-climate models thus still needs to be finished.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/26/2020<br>      Modified by: Ellen&nbsp;Thomas</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1536611/1536611_10387969_1603766209568_FigureEThomas--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1536611/1536611_10387969_1603766209568_FigureEThomas--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Life on the Deep-Sea Floor during Past Period of Global Warming"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1536611/1536611_10387969_1603766209568_FigureEThomas--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Life on the Deep-Sea Floor during Past Period of Global Warming"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Deep-Sea benthic foraminifera (left) and image of the biological pump bringing food to the deep-sea floor</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ellen Thomas</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ellen&nbsp;Thomas</div> <div class="imageTitle">Life on the Deep-Sea Floor during Past Period of Global Warming</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
