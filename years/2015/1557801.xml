<AbstractNarration>Some plant species are able to thrive across a wide range of climates, and the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood.  Characterizing the genetic and physiological basis of local climatic adaptation is especially critical for assessing whether and how plant species, including crops, can persist through periods of environmental change.  Using the widely-adapted species white clover, this project examines the factors that allow this plant to thrive in climates as dramatically different as northern Minnesota and central Florida.  The production of cyanide-containing compounds appears to play a role in this process, particularly for adaptation to heat and drought.  These compounds are also found in several important crop species, and their importance for drought adaptation will be examined in detail for the first time.  Other aspects of natural genetic and physiological variation in climate tolerance will be assessed through field experiments.  The project will provide classroom materials and curricular activities for an ongoing and highly successful inquiry-based educational outreach program developed by the principle investigator, which has already engaged more than 8000 students and 100 teachers nationwide. Students sample and analyze their local clover populations and contribute data to an online database, where they can compare observations with classes from other climates.  Scientific training will be provided to undergraduates, including those from minority backgrounds, as well as two graduate students and two postdoctoral associates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adaptation to local environments plays a key role in the ability of plant species to survive and persist through environmental change, yet the genetic and physiological mechanisms that underlie this process are largely unknown. Through work that integrates QTL mapping of fitness traits, candidate gene analyses of two well-characterized biochemical polymorphisms, and physiological assessments of their fitness impacts, the following questions are addressed, using white clover (Trifolium repens) as a study system: 1) What is the genetic architecture of local climatic adaptation?  Specifically, to what extent does it arise through fitness tradeoffs for alternate alleles of individual genes (antagonistic pleiotropy), or through combinations of loci where individual genes provide a fitness benefit in one environment and are selectively neutral in others (conditional neutrality)? 2) What are the physiological mechanisms by which cyanogenic glycosides function in abiotic stress adaptation? 3) What is the role of gene copy number variation (CNVs) in local adaptation?  This work will rigorously test the function of cyanogenic glycosides, which are found in &gt;3,000 plant species including many crops, in abiotic stress adaptation.  CNVs are abundant in the genomes of many taxa, and the project will directly assess their role in local climatic adaptation, which has not previously been done. The project will also engage high school students and teachers nationwide in hands-on, inquiry-based learning through an ongoing and highly successful outreach program based on clover cyanogenesis, and it will provide training for undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates.</AbstractNarration>

White clover is a perennial plant that has evolved cyanide-containing compounds that are important as an herbivore deterrent and may also play a role in conferring heat and drought stress tolerance.  To examine possible functions of these cyanide-containing compounds, we selected white clover genotypes that differ in their ability to produce them and compared their growth and physiological responses to high temperatures and limited water availability. We found that the ability to produce cyanide-containing compounds did not consistently influence how well the different white clover lines performed in the face of high temperature or drought stress.  In response to high temperatures, photosynthetic carbon reactions were impaired more strongly than photosynthetic light reactions, indicating that processes involved in the carbon reactions should be targeted over those involved in light reactions to improve white clover heat tolerance.  In response to drought stress, typical reductions in photosynthetic carbon were found, but only limited reductions in the function of photosynthetic light reactions.  Even though heat and drought stress responses were not influenced by the ability to produce cyanide-containing compounds in this study, those white clover plants that were able to produce cyanide-containing compounds had lower levels of important stress-response signals.  Our results highlight the complexity of plant stress responses and the need to further explore possible roles and mechanisms of cyanide-containing compounds in plant adaptation to different environments.  This project also provided scientific training for two graduate students and support for one of them for postdoctoral research.
