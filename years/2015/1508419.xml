<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting Professor Alexandru Asandei of the University of Connecticut to develop new approaches for the synthesis of diene-based polymers. Polymers have many important applications in everyday life. One type of widely used polymer is prepared from monomers that belong to the diene class. Diene-based polymers are important components of synthetic rubbers in tires of automobiles and high-impact plastics. Professor Asandei aims to develop a sustainable alternative to the synthesis of diene-based polymers at lower production cost in an approach that targets the use of biorenewable monomers. This fundamental research project spans a wide variety of techniques and methods, providing a multi-disciplinary environment for the education and research training of graduate students and undergraduate coworkers. Outreach to high school students from a variety of backgrounds is also planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synthetically, while the production of random diene copolymers benefits from emulsion radical polymerizations, the synthesis of corresponding thermoplastic elastomer block copolymers involves expensive, water sensitive anionic/coordination polymerizations. Thus, inexpensive, water tolerant, controlled radical polymerizations (CRPs) would be highly beneficial. In this research, Professor Asandei and coworkers aim to provide quantitative understanding of the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of dienes, a process that offers the potential advantages of simplicity, low cost, catalytic nature, tunable, and water tolerance. This research project entails detailed kinetic investigations carried out in inexpensive pressurized glass tubes, which enable both photochemistry and a fast, cost efficient optimization. These studies are expected to provide information on the effect of diene structure, ATRP type, temperature, initiator, solvent, catalyst, ligand, additives and reagent ratios on the molecular weight, polydispersity, rate, side reactions and chain end functionality of associated polymerizations. Such knowledge is expected to enable the development of emulsion diene ATRP, and facilitate the synthesis of complex polydiene-copolymer architectures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The industrial manufacture of polymers of conjugated 1,3-dienes such as butadiene (BD, CH2=CH-CH=CH2) and isoprene (ISO, CH2=C(CH3)-CH=CH2) ranks in the billions of pounds/year, thus rendering their synthesis very relevant.  However, while the large scale production of adhesives, rubbers, coatings and high impact materials based on random copolymers of dienes with acrylonitrile or styrene can take advantage of radical emulsion polymerizations, the industrial synthesis of the corresponding thermoplastic elastomer block copolymers is still carried out by expensive, air and water sensitive anionic or coordination polymerizations which require stringent conditions.    As such, inexpensive and water tolerant, reversible deactivation controlled radical polymerizations (RDCRPs) are highly desirable, and the typical advantages (simplicity, low cost, commercial availability of all reagents, catalytic nature, easy fine-tuning etc.) of the widely popular atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), by comparison with all other RDCRP methods,  and those of emulsion (lower cost, no solvents, large increases in rates) vs. anionic/coordination polymerizations, render emulsion ATRP most suitable for industrial scale-up. However, after 25 years since the original ATRP reports, and over 10,000 papers later, while ATRP currently affords excellent control over styrene and (meth)acrylates, at the start of this project, its extension to dienes was not available.             The intellectual merit of this work consist in the deliverance the first comprehensive, in-depth, quantitative mechanistic understanding of the scope and limitations of diene-ATRP is solution, suspension and emulsion, and of its applications in the synthesis of complex macromolecular architectures.  This was accomplished via extensive kinetic studies of the effect of all the reaction variables [halide initiator (Cl, Br, primary, secondary, tertiary, ester, benzyl, sulfonyl etc.), metal catalyst (Cu, Ni, Fe etc.), ligand (amines, phosphines etc.), solvent (polar, non-polar), temperature (25-150 ?C), light irradiation (visible, UV), ATRP procedure (normal, reverse, ICAR, SARA, photo, etc.)], and also led to the identification and minimization of the complex interplay of various competing side reactions (Diels-Alder monomer dimerization, alkylation/quaternization of the weak allyl halide chain ends with nucleophilic amine ligands).               The broader impact of this research relates to the broad dissemination of the results in the scientific literature as well as by presentations at international meetings (including an ACS best poster award), and especially in the training and education of graduate and undergraduate students especially from underrepresented groups, many of which are currently continuing their education at the postdoctoral and respectively, graduate level.
