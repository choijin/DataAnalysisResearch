<AbstractNarration>Large-scale datasets generated by dynamical systems are encountered in many science and engineering disciplines. For instance, in climate, atmosphere, and ocean sciences the dynamics take place in an infinite-dimensional phase space where the coupled nonlinear partial differential equations for fluid flow and thermodynamics are defined, and the observed data correspond to functions of that phase space, such as temperature or circulation over a given geographical region. Examples also abound in materials science and molecular dynamics. A major challenge is to utilize the vast amount of data that is being collected by observational networks or output by large-scale numerical models to understand the operating physics and make inferences about aspects of the system which are not accessible to observation, including the future state of the system. This project seeks to develop novel techniques for data analysis and prediction in dynamical systems, taking into account model error and spatiotemporal data relationships. Applications are proposed in two high-impact areas in climate-atmosphere-ocean science, namely, tracking and forecasting of multiscale convective waves in the tropical atmosphere and reconstruction and forecasting of Arctic sea-ice thickness. This research will create, document, and make available software for analyzing large-scale data from complex dynamical systems. It will also contribute to curricular development and training of graduate students in this interdisciplinary arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general framework of this research is dynamical systems operating in high-dimensional phase spaces, but generating data with low-dimensional, nonlinear geometric structures. Kernel methods form a natural mathematical framework to construct function spaces on these low-dimensional objects with a well-defined notion of smoothness, which can be used to carry out a variety of data analysis tasks such as dimension reduction, feature extraction, and prediction. For appropriately designed kernels, these tasks can be interpreted in terms of a Riemannian geometry induced on the data. Kernels also provide operators to extend functions on a reference dataset to another dataset of interest. The dynamical systems addressed in the project can represent either nature, or a numerical model approximating nature. In many real-world complex applications the low-dimensional data structures generated by nature and the model will differ. To extract the features of the imperfect model which are maximally consistent with nature, or to assign weights in multi-model ensembles for prediction, this project will study a novel approach where kernel-based out-of-sample extension operators are used to define appropriate metrics for model error. Taking dynamics into account through Takens delay-coordinate maps and other features, these error metrics are incorporated into modified kernels, biasing the geometry of the model data to extract states with high fidelity relative to nature. This project is to use the modified kernels in regularized schemes for learning functional relationships between quantities of interest in dynamical systems. These methods will be applied in reconstruction and forecasting of Arctic sea-ice thickness from observations of oceanic and atmospheric variables, and blended parametric-nonparametric forecasting of large-scale convective organization in the tropics. A further goal of the project is to extend these ideas to operator-valued kernels (so-called multitask kernels) for analysis of vector-valued observables, such as spatially extended fields. Compared to the canonical scalar-valued kernels, these kernels should have significantly higher skill in capturing spatiotemporal intermittency, with geometry and dynamics also playing a role through delay-coordinate maps. This project is to apply these kernels to objectively extract traveling convective waves in the tropical atmosphere from large datasets acquired via remote sensing.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The analysis and prediction of time-evolving phenomena are ubiquitous problems across the physical, biological, and engineering sciences. Examples include the circulation of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans, the folding of proteins, and the flow of air around an obstacle, such as a bridge. <em>Dynamical systems theory</em> provides a mathematical description of these and many other time-evolving phenomena in terms of transformations of the state of the system &nbsp;from one time instance to a future time. The properties of these transformations provide a principled way of identifying basic building blocks (coherent patterns) around which complicated dynamical behavior is organized, as well as predicting the evolution of observables (i.e., quantities that can be measured in experiments) at future times. However, despite their many theoretical advantages, implementing these constructs in practical applications is challenging, particularly in situations involving complex systems with partially known dynamics.&nbsp;</p> <p>In response, the principal goal of this project was to develop techniques for coherent pattern extraction and prediction of time-evolving phenomena which are rooted in dynamical systems theory, yet can be implemented utilizing observations of the systems alone, with minimal prior knowledge of the operating dynamics. &nbsp;This was achieved through a novel use of <em>kernel methods</em>, a class of techniques for harmonic analysis (the branch of mathematics studying the properties of temporal signals) and machine learning, based on measures of similarity (kernel functions) of data. These methods are conventionally employed in statistical analysis tasks such as classification and regression, but the approach in this project was to employ kernel techniques to build data-driven representations of <em>operators</em> governing the evolution (transformation) of observables of dynamical systems with time. &nbsp;</p> <p>Our primary methodological/theoretical contributions include:</p> <p>&nbsp;(i) The development of one of the first fully data-driven techniques for spectral analysis of the <em>Koopman</em> and <em>transfer</em> operators of dynamical systems with rigorous convergence guarantees as the amount of training data increases.

This method, called vector-valued spectral analysis (VSA), successfully addressed the problem of spatiotemporal intermittency in a class of dynamical systems with symmetries, i.e., the tendency of coherent patterns sharing similar qualitative features to appear fleetingly in time and in different locations in space. Figure 2 shows spatiotemporal patterns obtained via VSA applied to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model -- a prototype partial differential equation model exhibiting spatiotemporal chaos. These patterns have a manifestly non-separable space-time behavior, meaning that they cannot be decomposed as the product of individual spatial and temporal patterns.

In particular, we have studied and characterized long-lived metastable patterns in turbulent convective flows, as well as coherent spatiotemporal modes of variability of the Earth's climate system on timescales spanning days to decades. We have also constructed extended-range statistical forecast models for climate phenomena such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation and the Madden-Julian oscillation. Figure 3 shows forecasts of the 2015/16 El Nino event via kernel analog forecasting (KAF) -- one of the techniques developed under the project.
