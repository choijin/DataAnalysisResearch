<AbstractNarration>The practical impact of automatically tracking the diverse procedural and contextual variables affecting biological experiments can be far-reaching. Currently, the majority of research results cannot be replicated, wasting vast amounts of funding and considerable human effort. Moreover, the difficulty of reproducing biological protocols, a necessity in biological research -- and the lack of seamless interfaces for the multitude of devices and data sources around the lab -- severely limits the broader accessibility and proliferation of biological research methods and results. This I-Corps team is developing a platform (BioBright) to facilitate reproducibility in biological experimentation, by implementing networked hardware and software that automatically compares what should have happened in an experiment with what actually happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BioBright is creating an "ecosystem" of software and hardware technologies which enable networked biology. With a platform approach, the goal is to create a line of products that tie into the ecosystem. To date, the team has a patented "context-aware" pipette. One of the initial modes of commercialization includes licensing of this technology to leading pipette and fluid handling manufacturers. Through   continued use of the Business Model Canvas (BMC) framework, the team expects to uncover commercial applications for the proposed technology beyond biology and scientific research. The team's preliminary market research and customer interviews suggest that the first customers may include   commercial research organizations (CRO), laboratory equipment manufacturers and expand into other markets such as plant biology, in-vitro-fertilization, food production/commercial baking, and other applications where high precision, reproducibility, and exacting quality control are critical.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This I-CORPS project was crucial to the development of BioBright as an independent company (https://biobright.org). I-CORPS provided the entrepreneurial lead, now CEO of the company, the skills to interview potential customers and judge product-market fit of the different solutions that were mere hypotheses at the start of this project.  As a result of this project, the team was able to ascertain that academic environments were not a suitable target market due to lack of funds and lack of need ot integrate greater reproducibility in their practices (papers still get published).  Instead, the team realized that pharmaceutical companies are intrisically more motivated to carry out more reproducible and instrumented practices due to the direct cost failure poses on their experiments and business model.  As part of the project, the BioBright team was also able to test a variety of value propositions ranging from tracking pipette motions and actions to small hardware modules used to track the environmental variables affecting experiments in the lab.  In the end, the decision was taken to go ahead with the company and focus on large pharmaceutical and biotech clients. The I-CORPS training and method are used daily by the core BioBright team to continuously evaluate product-market fit and test new hypotheses. For all these reaseons, the BioBright team believes NSF I-CORPS has been and is a core contributor to BioBright's ongoing success.
