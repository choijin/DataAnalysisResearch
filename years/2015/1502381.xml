<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Ellen S. Chih is "Definable Sets and Structures." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Steffen Lempp.</AbstractNarration>
