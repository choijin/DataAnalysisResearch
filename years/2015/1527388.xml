<AbstractNarration>Rapid advances in high-performance computing and widespread availability of massive datasets are bringing about a paradigm shift in the theory and practice of signal representations, geared towards inference and learning. A signal representation is a compressed summary that only retains those features of the signal that are salient for a class of inference tasks. This project provides a comprehensive theoretical and algorithmic framework for signal representations, which is sufficiently broad to cover both the traditional types of signal representations, such as vector quantization and sparse codes, and the more modern types, inspired by recent advances in machine learning and signal processing for Big Data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this framework, the statistical performance and the computational complexity of signal representations are addressed in a unified manner by imposing structural constraints on the encoding map, the decoding map, and the model space of the representation, while simultaneously tailoring these objects to the class of tasks of interest. This unification leads to new theoretical and algorithmic insights into highly structured internal representations that are a key factor in recent spectacular success of deep neural networks on challenging tasks in visual, audio, and speech analytics.</AbstractNarration>

In particular, recent spectacular successes of deep neural networks in a number of challenging speech analysis and computer vision tasks can be attributed in large part to the fact that these architectures crucially rely on extracting intermediate &ldquo;compressed&rdquo; representations of the input signals.

Existing approaches to this problem are primarily ad hoc, and depend on fragile assumptions about the relationship between the training (or source) distribution and the test (or target) distribution.

An emerging problem in machine learning is to quantify the performance of a classifier under adversarial attacks, where an adversary slightly modifies an input, producing a forgery that is misclassified. Such attacks exploit weaknesses in the signal representations used by the classifier and have the potential to be devastating for driverless transportation systems, for instance. By exploiting the connection between the creation of such forgeries and the field of watermarking, a framework was developed for forgery detection that thwarts such attacks.<br /><br />3.

Classical methods, such as VQ or PCA, can be represented in this way by fixing a class of linear decoders. For example, if the codebook consists of K orthonormal basis vectors, then any linear mapping induces a K-point VQ codebook. Similarly, if the codebook is the K-dimensional Euclidean unit ball, then any isometry induces a mapping of the original signal to its top K principal components.
