<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Indiana State University will acquire an ultra-high pressure liquid chromatograph interfaced with a linear ion trap mass spectrometer capable of data-dependent tandem mass spectrometery. The system will be used to separate and analyze the composition of mixtures of substances obtained from various sources including samples obtained from chemical reactions, energy-related research and batteries used for energy storage. In this instrument the liquid samples are allowed to pass through columns filled with substances that interact to various degrees with the sample components and thus the components move at different speeds through the columns. This process allows separation of the components. These species are then analyzed using the mass spectrometer in which the components are ionized and their masses are determined by measuring the mass to charge ratio (m/z) of the ions. This is a widely used analytical tool to determine the composition of a mixture or material. Students will be trained to use this modern instrumentation while working in their research, preparing them for their later careers. The instrument will enable new undergraduate laboratory and research experiences. It will also be used in the Summer Undergraduate Research Experiences (SURE) program which engages a large number of undergraduate students across the sciences. Besides serving multiple departments at ISU, it will support users from neighboring institutions including St. Mary-of-the-Woods College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument will be used in research especially in areas such as (a) isolating, synthesizing and structural elucidating neuroactive natural products; (b) analyzing multimodal signaling systems in sceloporus lizards; (c) correlating analysis of organics and volatile trace elements in carbonaceous chondrites; (d) carrying out cleavage analysis of plant and fungal tyrosinases; and (e) carrying out applications of gas-phase ion molecule chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This new liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system funded by the NSF is a centerpiece of analytical infrastructure in the Department of Chemistry and Physics at Indiana State University.  The mass spectrometer purchased was a Thermo Q-Exactive Focus.  Its high-resolution/accurate mass (HRAM) capabilities coupled with our previously acquired Waters Acquity H-Class ultra-high performance liquid chromatograph with diode array detector provide a powerful combination of separation and identification of components of complex mixtures such as environmental and natural product samples.  The instrument acquired under this grant has enabled research involving faculty, graduate and undergraduate students.   PI Dr. Richard Fitch studies the chemistry, pharmacology and ecology of poison frogs.  These brightly colored amphibians defend themselves from predation with toxic compounds called alkaloids.  Dr. Fitch works with collaborators at the University of Texas at Austin studying the ecology and molecular biology of South American dendrobatid frogs to determine why poison frogs do not poison themselves.  Another productive collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley studies Madagascan mantellid frogs and how color correlates with alkaloid content.  Knowing what alkaloids are present in these frogs is integral to being able to answer these and many other biological questions. The LC-MS system enabled by this grant allows us to separate and identify these toxic alkaloids.  Dr. Fitch is primarily interested in what these toxins are and what they do in biological systems.  In other work with collaborators at the USDA, NIH, Brandeis and Georgetown Universities, they found that the frog alkaloid phantasmidine was not a single molecule, but a surprising uneven mixture of two mirror image molecules called enantiomers in a 4:1 ratio. Its configuration (shape) at a key carbon atom is also opposite that of another frog alkaloid epibatidine.  N-methylepibatidine was also present and differs by only 0.0364 mass units from phantasmidine.  Dr. Fitch could not accurately determine which was which without the high-resolution MS capabilities of the instrument funded by this grant.  The team found that phantasmidine acts at the biological receptor that also binds the tobacco alkaloid nicotine and that the activity profile of phantasmidine is similar to the anti-smoking drug varenicline (Chantix&reg;).  In another project, coPI Dr. Diana Hews in the Department of Biology and her graduate students are studying the femoral gland secretions of territorial blue-bellied lizards (Sceloporus), which the lizards use to attract mates and warn off competitors.  Dr. Hews and colleagues studied volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the secretions of 12 species in this genus. They found that closely related species vary in the relative amounts of VOCs, and that some components covary with climate. With the new LC-MS, we are conducting detailed sequence analyses of the proteins/peptides present in the secretions.  This work is ongoing.  During these studies, we have involved undergraduate students from our Summer Undergraduate Research Experiences (SURE) program as well as students doing research during the academic year as well as in laboratory courses.  Over the 3-year period of this grant, students have performed research with this instrument and presented findings at local, regional and national meetings as well as published work in peer-reviewed journals. This gives students an edge in getting into graduate and professional schools.   New experiments have been developed for laboratory courses including a peptide sequencing experiment for Biochemistry (coPI William Flurkey), a pesticide analysis experiment for Instrumental Analysis (coPI Steve Wolf) and chiral separation for Organic Laboratory Techniques (PI Fitch).  These experiments give undergraduate students hands-on experience with state of the art instrumentation and analysis of the data.  This makes them more marketable for technical careers in the chemical, biological and pharmaceutical industries.  The instrument was also used in a public service outreach to a local resident who was being pushed by an unscrupulous salesperson to purchase an expensive water purification system.  The salesperson purportedly performed an "electrolysis test" turning their normal hard water colors and asserted they were contaminated with pesticides.  We were able to assure the homeowner that their water did not contain any of 32 common pesticides we examined.  Unfortunately, these scams are quite prevalent in rural areas where homeowners may not have the knowledge base or resources to counter such quackery.  Dr. Hews also began analysis of environmental contamination in water samples in the local area in a study of surface contamination and pesticide runoff impacts on vertebrates (fish, frogs).  These studies are ongoing.  Overall, work to date with this instrument has resulted in two peer-reviewed research articles, six conference presentations by PIs and five presentations by undergraduate students at National meetings. In addition, eight undergraduate students participated in numerous university, local and regional poster symposia. The work described above is ongoing and new collaborations are in the works.  We anticipate a long life for this instrument and expect further publications, presentations and research experiences for our undergraduates for many years to come.
