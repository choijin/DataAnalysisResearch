<AbstractNarration>Early developmental exposure to chronic stressors associated with poverty leads to profound disparities in multiple social and health outcomes that persist into adulthood. One specific aspect of brain function that is important for success in school and success in adulthood is self-regulation, which is traditionally studied from a strictly cognitive perspective. However, to meet the demands of different stressful or non-stressful situations, in a healthy system the brain and heart must interact to appropriately prepare the body and brain to respond. Very little is known about how this dynamic interaction between the heart and brain is associated with self-regulation in children and adults or how chronic stress associated with early adversity affects this interaction. This project will significantly improve our understanding of these relationships, which has the potential to contribute to the achievement of a broad range of societally-relevant outcomes for national health and prosperity. Results from this project will provide a critical link between the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience and pediatrics, behavioral medicine, health psychology, and intervention science. This research may also identify potential protective factors to the adverse effects of chronic stress on cognition, which would provide neurobiological targets to inform the development and refinement of interventions. Evidence-based interventions have the potential to improve health outcomes, with numerous and substantial economic benefits, including but not limited to reductions in health care costs, expansions in labor supply, and greater productivity. Work by economists has shown that effective early interventions have substantial positive economic impact, with conservative analyses estimating a return on investment of approximately 7 to 1. Interventions targeting self-regulation also promise to improve individual academic outcomes and quality of life for children from backgrounds of adversity. Greater academic opportunity for underrepresented populations can also increase the diversity and the competitiveness of the domestic workforce, both of which are crucial to the development of a more globally competitive workforce in the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to determine how the dynamic interaction between the heart and brain is associated with attention and self-regulation in childhood and in adulthood, and to identify which aspects of this interaction are the most vulnerable to early adversity and stress. These vulnerable systems are likely to respond positively to early-childhood interventions. The central hypothesis is that two branches of the autonomic nervous systems, the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS), interact with behavior and brain systems involved in attention and self-regulation in young children and adults, and that these functions will influence the relationship between early adversity and attention/self-regulation. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the relative contributions of PNS and SNS mechanisms to behavior and brain function for attention and self-regulation in young children and adults; Aim 2. To determine the extent to which autonomic nervous system functions interact with the brain response to feedback and errors in self-regulation on a trial-by-trial basis; and Aim 3. To develop and refine models of the role of PNS and SNS functions in the relationship between early adversity and behavior and brain function for cognition. We will measure PNS and SNS function at the same time as brain measures of attention and self-regulation using electrophysiology in children and adults from a wide range of socioeconomic status backgrounds. This will contribute to understanding how early adversity impacts brain systems underlying the control of attention and behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[            Adversity experienced early in development leads to profound disparities in cognitive, academic, and health outcomes that can endure into adulthood.  These disparities are costly to society in several ways, including costs related to poor health and reduced workforce diversity and competitiveness.  In order to develop evidence-based approaches to address this growing problem, it is crucial to better understand the multiple risk factors associated with early adversity and how these risk factors are related to differences in brain function that could be potential targets for evidence-based training programs.  Self-regulation, including the ability to pay attention and to inhibit actions when desired, is important for academic and health outcomes.  It is also sensitive to differences in early experience associated with adversity.  We and others have found that self-regulation involves dynamic interaction between the heart and the brain in response to different environmental demands.  Our goal is to better understand these relationships so we can develop and refine training programs and recommend evidence-based policy to address these impactful disparities.             The goals of this project were to improve our understanding of these multiple risk factors associated with early life experience, and how these risk factors are related to the dynamic interaction between the heart and the brain that supports self-regulation.  We recruited more than 100 4-6 year-old children and more than 100 young adults from the community, using a screening procedure to ensure a wide range of early experience.  We built on previous work that examined how multiple and disparate risk factors can have cumulative effects by developing and implementing cumulative risk frameworks that capture a wider range of early experience in children and adults.  We simultaneously acquired heartrate measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system function and EEG measures of brain function for self-regulation in order to more precisely understand the interaction between these systems and how the accumulation of risk factors affects this interaction.              Preliminary results:  we were successful in capturing a wide range of early adverse experiences in both children and adults, and found that differences in these experiences are related to self-regulation.  We assessed risk factors across three domains:  sociodemographic, physical, and psychological.  In children, 40% of the sample has two or more risk factors associated with early adversity across these domains, and in adults, 41% of the sample has two or more risk factors.  Preliminary results suggest that an accumulation of risk factors is associated with decreased self-regulation in children using multiple measures.  For example, in a delay of gratification task, children with more risk factors were less successful in inhibiting their behavior (Fig. 1).  In a response inhibition task, children with more risk factors were less successful in inhibiting dominant responses (Fig. 2).  Analyses currently in progress are examining the association between risk factors, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system function, and brain function for selective attention and inhibitory control in both children and adults.              Outcomes from this project will contribute to a more specific understanding of the ways that early adversity is associated with differences in self-regulation and, most importantly, with the specific physiological mechanisms supporting these abilities.  Improving our understanding in this way can improve training programs for children growing up in adverse environments and therefore at risk for poor outcomes.  We and others have shown that evidence-based training programs targeting self-regulation in families from backgrounds of poverty can improve outcomes for at-risk children.  With an improved understanding of how risk factors are related to differences in heart and brain function, researchers can improve strategies used to improve self-regulation, for example by targeting proactive stress regulation or training the suppression of distracting information.  It may also be possible to target strategies to specific risk profiles.  Given the profound relationship between early adversity and outcomes into adulthood, more refined evidence-based training programs have the potential to improve individual and societal well-being. Improvements in societal well-being have numerous and substantial economic benefits, including but not limited to reductions in health care costs, expansions in labor supply, and greater productivity.
