<AbstractNarration>Topology is a very qualitative part of mathematics; it does not distinguish a round ball from an ellipsoid or a plate or bowl.  The measurements done by topologists are usually mediated by algebraic structures, as the usual notions of length or volume are meaningless in this setting.  The main thrusts of this proposal are to improve our understanding of the connection between the algebraic measurements and the geometry and to study the role quantitative measurements into topology. There are anticipated applications within topology (e.g., to a deeper understand of the symmetry) and outside of it (e.g., to differential geometry and possibly data science). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an attempt to deal with fundamental problems in geometric topology. The classical paradigm in that field is to reduce geometric problems to ones in algebra, either via homotopy theory or via K-theory or quadratic form theory. Typically involved, at its most successful, is some version of a Whitney lemma. This proposal deals with (1) problems involving symmetry, where the relevant Whitney lemma is known to be false and (2) with the understanding of quantitative aspects of solutions to topological problems that are sidestepped in the algebraic treatments. The methods involve Goodwillie's calculus of homotopy functors, controlled topology, stratified surgery, rational homotopy theory, and index theory.  Besides its impact within topology, this work could expand our understanding of the geometry of function spaces, with implications in analysis, and also, indirectly, geometric methods of data analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Topology, sometimes called "rubber sheet geometry", is a central part of modern mathematics that is known for answering qualitative questions.  One of the main thrusts of this project is the development of a quantitative understanding of the solutions to topological problems: how much stretching is necessary to solve a topological problem.  In some ways, this discussion are analogous to the relationship that complexity theory in theoretical computer science has to mathematical logic: the latter studies the solvability of computational problems, while the former is concerned with the amount of resources (time and memory, for example) necessary to solve the problems.  Indeed, over the past twenty years, several instantiations of this somewhat vague analogy have been realized and this project overall pushes for deeper connections between topology and theoretical computer science.  The focus of the current project is on problems of geometric topology that are solved by algebraic means.  This paradigm was dominant in topology during the second half of the last century, and it remains the most important tool used in high dimensions.  The problem is that this method is very indirect: finite dimensional issues are dealt with using infinite dimensional approximations, and the tools used do not even in principle directly give any estimates on the resources.  (For example, one might prove that a set is finite, and that therefore some process done to it will ultimately terminate.  However, no analysis is given to the size of the set, or how speedy the process that acts on the set is; as a result, we can not predict how much time this will take.)  The results of this project both promote additional applications of algebraic tools in geometric topology (with work of Cappell and Yan on symmetry, with Xie and Yu, connecting topology more directly to analysis, and with Dranishnikov and Ferry developing a theory of multiscale topological data inference and connecting it to algebra), and also (in work with Chambers, Dotterer, and Manin) began an analysis of the quantitative properties of function spaces.  Function spaces are spaces whose points are individual functions (an example might be a trying to understand the "space" of all time series data of some sort); these tend to be infinite dimensional and much of analysis and topology derives from their study. The work described above shows that some nonlinear function spaces have a "small world phenomenon" - their diameter is much smaller than one would have expected prima facie.    This work has the potential to impact fields seemingly distant from topology.   Weinberger has worked to build bridges to communities of data scientists, computer scientists and engineers by teaching courses, public lectures, and conference organizing.  In addition, during the period of this grant, he founded the Journal of Applied and Computational Topology that aims to promote the connections of topology to other scientific disciplines and beyond.
