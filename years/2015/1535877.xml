<AbstractNarration>This proposal will support the 2015 Space Weather Workshop to be held in Boulder, Colorado on April 13-17, 2015. This annual workshop brings together representatives of industry, academia and government to present papers and discuss issues related to space weather. This is one of the few opportunities for the broad community interested in space weather to get together. Emphasis at the workshop is on the impacts of space weather on technology including communications, navigation, spacecraft operations and electric power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to bringing the three communities interested in space weather together this workshop invites both undergraduate and graduate students. This provides the students with information on research developments and on how that research is relevant to operations. Because the emphasis of the workshop is to discuss the impacts of space weather on technology and identify the operational needs for space weather forecasting it has high societal value.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) co-hosted with partner agencies, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and National Science Foundation (NSF), the 17th annual Space Weather Workshop (SWW) on April 13-17, 2015 in Boulder, Colorado. This yearÆs workshop gathered 274 attendees from 19 nations. The workshop brings together participants for a week of international discussion on space weather impacts, user needs and requirements, forecasting, and research and modeling developments. A highlight of SWPCÆs annual meeting series is hearing about the remarkably diverse impacts of space weather on today's technology.  2015 marked the 50th Anniversary of 17 routine daily space weather forecast products initiated by the Space Disturbances Laboratory (SDL) in 1965  The workshop consisted of 56 presentations in 11 sessions and 69 posters (including multiple e-posters) in the four poster sessions.  Presenters and attendees delved into pertinent and emerging matters in the space weather community, including national policy, agency perspectives, government and private sector roles, space weather modeling and research, international perspectives, and impacts on specific industry sectors.  Key updates were featured from various federal agencies including OSTP (Office of Science and Technology Policy), NASA, NSF, NOAA, United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the 557th Weather Wing of the U.S. Air Force with respect to their current and future space weather plans.  Keynote speakers included Brent Gordon, NOAA/SWPC, Tom Berger,  NOAA/SWPC, Ernest Hilder, Former Director, Space Environment Center,   Doug Biesecker, NOAA/SWPC, William Murtagh, Office of Science and  Technology Policy, Tammy Dicinson, OSTP, Louis Uccellini, NWS, Alysha  Reinard, CIRES, Adam Szabo, NASA/GSFC, Pat Mulligan, NOAA/NESDIS, Rodney  Viereck, NOAA/SWPC, Howard Singer, NOAA/SWPC, Frank Hill, National  Solar Observatory.  The workshop attracted experts from academia, industry, and government who discussed and drafted preliminary space weather requirements for the GOES-Next satellite series scheduled to launch in 2030.  A highlight at this yearÆs SWW was the unveiling of the National Space Weather Strategy, a White House OSTP led initiative, which addresses the need for a cohesive strategy to ensure the nation is positioned to predict, mitigate, respond to, and recover from an extreme space weather storm.  The workshop featured an interactive SWORM (Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation) Task Force Panel, which outlined the development of strategic goals for government agencies, academia, and the private sector with a focus on establishing benchmarks for space weather events; enhancing response and recovery capabilities; strengthening protection and mitigation efforts; improving the assessment and modeling of impacts on critical infrastructure; and, increasing international cooperation.  With the recent successful launch of NOAAÆs DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory) satellite on February 11th, 2015, a number of presentations highlighted 60 DSCOVRÆs achievements.
