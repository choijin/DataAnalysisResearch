<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Eric Tillman of Bucknell University will devise synthetic routes leading to macrocyclic polymers, which posses a set of properties distinct from their linear analogs and offer potential advantages in diverse areas in which polymers are used. The focus of this proposal is the addition of a radical trap, such as a nitroso group, to an end-to-end atom transfer radical coupling reaction of a dihalogenated linear precursor, creating a scenario where the halogenated chain ends no longer require simultaneous activation to undergo ring closure.  This synthetic route will be applied to the synthesis of a variety of macrocyclic architectures, from cyclic diblock copolymers, chromophore-functionalized cyclic polymers, and even complex multicyclic structures. As a broader impact of the research, undergraduate and Masters-level students will gain valuable training in both synthesis and characterization of polymeric materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymers are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life that utilize plastics, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices.  Cyclic polymers offer a set of properties that often differ substantially from the linear polymers from which they are derived, yet are notoriously difficult to synthesize. Cyclic polymers may be potentially useful in a variety of applications, such as electronic materials and drug delivery vehicles.  This research focuses on both developing a new, straightforward route to preparing cyclic polymers and applying this strategy to prepare polymers displaying complex cyclic architectures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was in effect during my first year at Santa Clara University.  The outcomes of the award were a publication in Macromolecules, (Maya M. Arce, Ching W. Pan, Madalyn M. Thursby, Jessica P. Wu, Elizabeth M. Carnicom, and Eric S. Tillman Macromolecules 2016 49 (20), 7804-7813) which included four Santa Clara undergraduate students as coauthors.  The work described the effect of solvent on the rate of coupling reactions between polymer radicals and nitroso compounds.  By elucidating the mechanism, we were able to show that the rate was tied to two competing equilbria, each favored in different solvent condition than the other.  By adjusting the reaction solvent to approximately equal volumes a polar and nonpolar solvent, the rate of the coupling reaction was found to increase substantially compared to performing the same reaction in either pure solvent.  We were able to transfer this knowledge to the improved synthesis of cyclic polymers formed by an analogous mechanism.  Two student stipends were used for this award, with other funds being instrumental in carrying out the research objectives.  The findings have opened up a new area of research for the group, and we are currently studying competing mechanisms that may both be responsible for the coupling at later stages of the reactioin.  This is important to consider, because the utility of the process would likely be applied to near quantitative dimerization.  To this end, we have submitted an NSF grant that is currently under review.          Last Modified: 11/30/2016       Submitted by: Eric S Tillman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
