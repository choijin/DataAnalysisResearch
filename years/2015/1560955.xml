<AbstractNarration>This research project will conduct a study of fundamental questions in function theory and operator theory using the tools and techniques of harmonic analysis.   The project will address important questions now open to exploration because of recent advances made by the principal investigator and his collaborators.  Resolution of these problems raised will find applications in function theoretic operator theory and yield new tools and techniques that can be adopted by the larger analysis community.  The principal investigator will advise graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, include them in the proposed research projects, and provide mentoring, in order to assist them in transitioning to the next stage of their careers.  Broad dissemination of the results will take place by participation in conferences and posting of the research to the arxiv preprint server.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will combine recent results of the principal investigator with motivation from function theory and operator theory to study questions related to the two-weight Hilbert transform and properties of model spaces.  The first research direction to be explored couples the results of the principal investigator with questions about boundedness and invertibility properties of products of Toeplitz operators.  In particular, the problems to be studied are aimed at obtaining a better understanding of the composition of paraproducts and determining necessary and sufficient conditions for their boundedness.  Connections to the two-weight inequality for the Hilbert transform suggest related problems to investigate.  Resolving the proposed problems will provide more insight into the recent characterization of the two-weight inequality for the Hilbert transform and related properties for Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space.  An additional research direction, based upon the principal investigator's recent results and their connection to the description of the Carleson measure for model spaces, will be pursued.  The open question of obtaining a characterization of the Riesz bases for model spaces leads to problems related to reverse Carleson measures for the model spaces, and their relation to two-weight inequalities for the Cauchy and Hilbert transforms.  Additional directions of investigation connect to bilinear forms and commutators on model spaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research objective of this proposal was to conduct a deeper study of fundamental questions in function theory and operator theory using the tools and techniques of harmonic analysis.  The proposed research was based on recent contributions made by the PI, and leverages the skills and knowledge developed through prior National Science Foundation awards.  Some research highlights of this award are: Characterization of BMO via Commutators in certain settings:  A fundatmental property of operators is if they commute (i.e. the order in which the operations are done doesn't impact the result).  Specific questions about commutators of certain Calderon-Zygmund opertors and a multiplication operator are of fundamental importance in operator theory and partial differential equations through the theory of Hankel operators and via the div-curl lemma in physics.  The behavior of these commutators can be understood using certain norms on function spaces.  Several of the recent projects were focused on understanding the role of the funciton space BMO and commutators of singular integral operators.  In particular, results obtained under this award provided a characterization in the setting of pseudoconvex domains with minimal smoothness, on stratified Lie groups, in spaces of homogeneous type.  These results extend the well-known classical theory that was developed in the 1970s by Coifman, Rochberg, and Weiss for the Euclidean space.  Miscellaneous Projects: Several projects with junior researchers were connected to various questions in harmonic analysis and operator theory.  One project provided a new proof of the weak-type estimate for multilinear Calderon-Zygmund operators; another focused on a characterization of compact operators on a domain in several complex variables.  A construction of a multi-wavelet in general weighted settings was provided and applications to one and two weighted estimates for Calderon-Zygmund operators were studied.  A detailed study of flag Hardy spaces was also undertaken.  These projects further developed existing methods in harmonic analysis to address questions in function theory and operator theory that are at the forefront of research in the area.  Graduate students and postdocs were advised and mentored as part of this award.  This helps to supplement the pipeline of well-trained students in the STEM disciplines.  Numerous papers were written and published in peer-reviewed venues.  The results were further disseminated through seminar and conference presentations.
