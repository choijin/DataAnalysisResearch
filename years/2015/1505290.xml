<AbstractNarration>UWM STEM CELL is a pilot project to address pedagogical and sociocultural issues that contribute to the lack of persistence and the flow of talented and interested students away from science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors at the early-career undergraduate level. Many aspirational STEM students lack the cultural knowledge about how to operate successfully in a university setting, have little idea what a STEM career entails, and have academic backgrounds that are deficient. STEM CELL will fundamentally reorient the institutional culture from an attrition model to one that is focused on student outcomes emphasizing STEM persistence, learning, enthusiasm and informed decision making. The project will sustain students in need of academic support, provide individualized guidance regarding STEM major and career choices, and immerse students in practical, integrative, early academic career experiences to help inform their chosen fields of study and career paths. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will accomplish its goals through the comprehensive application of a suite of low-cost, high-impact interventions, including intentional course alignment across disciplinary boundaries among courses in mathematics, chemistry, and biology, implementation of active learning modes of pedagogy, development of a learning community with integrated academic and social supports, and explicit attention to issues of relevance including the construction of a dynamic individual development plan.  This comprehensive intervention will be rigorously evaluated and tested by a randomized trial, with the intervention explicitly co-planned alongside the evaluation design.  This evaluation will provide unambiguous information regarding the effectiveness of this scalable, sustainable comprehensive intervention and thus will be relevant to institutions of higher education nationwide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Building academic structures that foster student success in STEM fields is a high priority in the field of science education.  This project examined how intentionally breaking down barriers between discipline-specific courses impacts the success of the student as a whole, and whether student success can more profitably be viewed in terms of multiple measures spanning disciplines rather than through the very focused lens of traditional, discipline-specific excellence.  The ultimate goal of this program was institutional transformation, in particular a more complete understanding of the different ways that formal and informal student environments interact to lead to student success.  Of particular interest was the power of a co-requisite model in accelerating students through early-college background content courses.  Also of interest was the development of informal student support networks that self-nucleate within the cohort.      UWM STEM CELL was a demonstration project that sought to engage incoming students who aspired to a STEM major upon entering the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) but enter the institution needing support in mathematics and/or chemistry, i.e., below the calculus level in mathematics and needing the equivalent of high school chemistry to advance in their STEM majors.  In targeting these aspirational students at UWM, the project reached a disproportionately underprepared population of first-generation, underprivileged and minority students who, as past evidence suggests, are at risk in their transition to a STEM major as well as the larger issue of successfully adjusting to college.     The primary goals of the project were to develop a structure that helps students demonstrate an accelerated commitment to a STEM major.  This was accomplished by completing the following sub-goals:  Faculty alignment workshops Cohort model and embedded career-focused advising Including interventions designed to support underprepared students in their first year In-classroom student support services Intensification of student experience though integrative activities: Extension of laboratory experiences through application seminar      Key results of this project included similar or better success in introductory or preparatory mathematics and chemistry courses by the students in the cohorts, completion of similar or more total credits in the first year by the students in the cohorts and similar GPA by the students in the cohorts when compared to reference groups from past cohorts as well as a group based upon a small randomization study.  Additionally, the project slowly evolved to include more students (including nursing and engineering majors in year 3) to the final step of institutionalization of the project by changing the prerequisite structure of the preparatory chemistry course (year 4 of the project).  With this final step, there was no difference in success between students who are co-enrolled versus those who took the courses separately.  There was a difference when considering students in the introductory mathematics course where the co-enrolled students performed higher (79%) than the students who took the courses separately (70%).  These results were very positive and offered continued confirmation of the project successes.      Finally, when considering performance differences between underrepresented minority students (URM) and non-URM there was a "success gap" between URM and non-URM students in introductory math and chemistry courses (when taken separately).  However, particularly encouraging and very positive results were that for the students who were co-enrolled, the URM and non-URM students succeeded without any "success gap".  Additionally, when considering the success of URM students in the traditional sequence vs. co-enrollment, again there was no difference.  What was perhaps the most positive result was that for the students who successfully completed both Preparatory Chemistry and Intermediate Algebra in the same semester, there was not difference between URM and non-URM students.     Overall, the results of this project are not only encouraging but excellent evidence to support other institutional transformation projects where underprepared students are supported to seek program courses earlier in their program.     Students who participated in the program consistently remarked that it was the cohort environment that facilitated development of peer to peer connections that was the most valuable experience of the program.  From the formal environment standpoint, the most important realization was that academic intensity with appropriate support could significantly accelerate student progress towards degree and opened the possibility for leading order changes in longer-term student persistence in STEM fields as well as reducing student debt due to faster progress towards degree.  These lessons suggested that intentional design of programs can impact STEM student persistence and success at the institutional level, and that student-focused inquiry about program design is as important as student-focused mindsets within individual courses. The key program results suggest that similar interventions can double the likelihood of a student persisting through early college STEM sequences to the level where they can declare a major.
