<AbstractNarration>An underlying theme of arithmetic geometry is the existence of solutions to polynomial equations whose coefficients lie in fields other than the complex numbers. Historically, equations having extra symmetry have been a focus of inquiry since the automorphisms of the corresponding geometric object provide extra structure which helps illuminate the set of solutions. The PI's research is about functions on curves defined by polynomial equations with coefficients in a finite field. The goal is to analyze invariants of algebraic structures attached to these curves, to determine how these invariants vary across parameter spaces for the curves, and to investigate which exceptional structures occur. As a broader impact of the proposal, the PI will collaborate with the Fort Collins Museum of Discovery to build activity kits about cryptography for children. The PI is also involved with other initiatives that have broader impacts: the PI is a leader of the WIN network, whose goal is to vitalize the research careers of women in number theory via new research collaborations; and the PI was a co-organizer of the Arizona Winter School from 2010-2015.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curves and abelian varieties exhibit new phenomena in positive characteristic p. These phenomena typically arise due to the underlying presence of morphisms of degree p. They lead to important cohomological invariants, such as the p-rank, Newton polygon, and Ekedahl-Oort type. The goal of the PI's proposal is to prove: (non)-existence results about abelian varieties and curves with given invariants; and structural results about the stratifications induced by the invariants on various moduli spaces. In particular, the PI will investigate supersingular abelian varieties and Jacobians; the interplay between automorphisms and p-torsion invariants; formulae, akin to the Deuring-Shafarevich formula, for the variation in more refined invariants of the Ekedahl-Oort type in terms of ramification data; and rational points of curves over non-algebraically closed fields. Key techniques include: intersection of divisors on moduli spaces; degeneration to singular curves of compact type; results about monodromy of families of curves; cohomology calculations (de Rham or of resolutions); and actions of Frobenius and Vershiebung.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Pries 2019 Project Outcomes Report DMS-15-02227  Curves, Covers, and Cohomology.  Between 2015 and 2019, the PI developed and published new research and led training activities for students.  The focus of the work was the topic of curves in number theory and arithmetic geometry.  Broader impacts: The major training activity was a summer Research Experience for Undergraduates during summer 2018 at Colorado State Universty.  The PI worked with one graduate student and six undergraduates to research Hurwitz curves over finite fields.  The group wrote a paper about the new results and won an outstanding poster award at the joint mathematics meeting in 2019.  For another training activity, the PI worked together with two graduate students to develop worksheets for children to learn cryptography.  The PI and graduate students helped children with these worksheets at a science outreach booth and at the boys and girls club of Fort Collins.     Intellectual merit: the PI completed new research about cohomology of curves and Galois covers of curves.  This research was disseminated by the PI during 28 research talks at universities and research conferences.  The PI published 8 journal papers, 3 proceedings papers, and one book chapter.  In addition, there are an additional 4 publications of the PI awaiting publication and 4 others under review.  Some of the topics that the PI focused on were Galois actions on homology of Fermat curves and Newton polygons of curves in positive characteristic.  The PI led research groups at two women in number theory conferences.  The purpose of these workshops is to train graduate students who are women in number theory and to develop research networks among women in number theory.  The PI also trained graduate students as part of the PIMS graduate summer school and at Colorado State University.
