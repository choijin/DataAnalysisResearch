<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Eastern Kentucky University, located in Richmond, KY, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks, during the summers of 2017- 2019. Students will be based in Richmond, and will conduct ecological research at remote field stations in a region of high biodiversity but impacted by mountaintop coal mining, logging, and other disturbances. Students will work directly with faculty mentors and collaborators, including agency professionals, and will participate in all aspects of research including study design, data collection, analyses, and presentation of results. A weekly workshop will provide additional learning opportunities on topics such as ethics and the responsible conduct research, leadership, and career development. Participants will engage with their community and develop communication skills with scientists, land managers, and the public, while exploring the implications of their own research in a setting rife with controversy related to the economic and cultural tradeoffs of resource extraction and environmental conservation. Research findings could help shape resource management in a way that brings socioeconomic benefits to the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Student participants will include individuals from the study region, and from other parts of the nation, often from very different socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic backgrounds.  First generations college students, students with disabilities, and veterans will also be recruited. Students will learn how research is conducted and communicated, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://biology.eku.edu/reu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. David Brown at david.brown@eku.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Stephen Richter at stephen.richter@eku.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Disturbance Ecology in Central Appalachia REU site provided scientific training in field ecology methods to students with otherwise limited opportunities for research training, while immersing them in a cultural landscape to learn about the ecological, social and economic complexities of natural resource conservation. Thirty-two undergraduate students participated over three summers, of which 88% of participants were from underrepresented groups, financially disadvantaged, or first-generation college students. A focus of this REU was to recruit rural and financially disadvantaged students of Appalachian descent, which was successful: 60% of students came from Appalachian communities, 28% were from rural communities, and 60% were Pell eligible. Participating students came almost exclusively from small state universities, HBCUs, and small private colleges, with 95% of participants coming from non-PhD granting institutions. Almost all of the home institutions of students in our program are relatively little known, low-endowment institutions where students otherwise had little opportunity for research. Two high school teachers participated as part of a Research Experiences for Teachers, and one high school student participated as part of a Research Assistantships for High School Students.</p> <p>Students participated in training activities and structured learning through workshops and group activities, individual learning as part of mentor training, peer interactions, and collaborations with agency professionals. Examples of these activities include graduate school workshops, non-academic career panel discussions, statistics and GIS workshops. Students also explored the natural history and disturbances of the region with contrasting trips to old-growth forest nature preserves and mountain top removal coal mines. The focus of student activities was a collaborative research project with their mentor and lab team. Students were part of a mentoring network that included multiple levels of interactions among students, faculty, graduate students, and agency professionals. Students also benefited by interacting with past participants at professional meetings and other organized activities. Research projects addressed questions about ecosystem sustainability and resilience in a region that has undergone a long period of intense anthropogenic disturbance and deconstruction. Research was conducted on a variety of taxonomic groups that included studies of plants, bats, birds, amphibians, snakes, fish, and aquatic macroinvertebrates. Methods included trapping, trail cameras, telemetry, remote sensing, and various lab techniques. All of the students presented their research multiple times and in different formats during the summer of their participation, and almost all students presented at regional or national conferences in the year following their participation. Most participants have graduated and many are now pursuing graduate degrees or employed as professional biologists.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/28/2020<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;Brown</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598635795472_2019_group_web--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598635795472_2019_group_web--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2019 cohort"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598635795472_2019_group_web--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2019 cohort"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Participants in REU Site: Disturbance Ecology in Central Appalachia</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Brown</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;Brown</div> <div class="imageTitle">2019 cohort</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598638040259_20170719_140705--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598638040259_20170719_140705--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fish sampling"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598638040259_20170719_140705--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fish sampling"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students sample fish on Ohio River</div> <div class="imageCredit">Unknown</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;Brown</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fish sampling</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598640292625_LCWsign--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598640292625_LCWsign--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Lilley Cornett Woods"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598640292625_LCWsign--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Lilley Cornett Woods"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Lilley Cornett Woods was the site for many REU student research projects and training activities</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Brown</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;Brown</div> <div class="imageTitle">Lilley Cornett Woods</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598640513488_IMG_1436_l--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598640513488_IMG_1436_l--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tree measurements"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598640513488_IMG_1436_l--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tree measurements"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU students measuring trees</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Brown</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;Brown</div> <div class="imageTitle">Tree measurements</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598640955092_lcw_fc_mistnet2_62019--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598640955092_lcw_fc_mistnet2_62019--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bird banding with REU"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598640955092_lcw_fc_mistnet2_62019--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bird banding with REU"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Mist netting warblers</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Brown</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;Brown</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bird banding with REU</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598641222992_IMG_7151_l--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598641222992_IMG_7151_l--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2018 REU cohort"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559980/1559980_10411918_1598641222992_IMG_7151_l--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2018 REU cohort"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2018 cohort at old-growth forest</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Brown</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;Brown</div> <div class="imageTitle">2018 REU cohort</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
