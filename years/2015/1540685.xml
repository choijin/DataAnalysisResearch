<AbstractNarration>Algorithms based on spectral techniques tend to be fast and to have a simple and elegant structure; their analysis helps explain the empirically good performance of related heuristics that are adopted in practice; and their analysis often uncovers useful mathematical relationships between algebraic and combinatorial graph invariants, which can have useful applications outside of algorithm design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this grant explores new algorithms for cut and clustering problems, rigorous justifications for popular spectral clustering heuristics, and various relationships between the spectral profile of a graph and its combinatorial properties. The PI and his collaborators will study the use of multiple eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of a graph in the design of clustering algorithms, they will provide rigorous analyses of clustering heuristics based on multiple eigenvectors, and will explore combinatorial characterizations of eigenvalue near-multiplicities. New approaches to the use of random walks and other probabilistic processes will be explored in the design of graph partitioning algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is working on a monograph on the three related themes of sparsest cut approximation algorithms, constructions of expander graphs, and analysis of random walks in graphs. The three topics are closely related mathematically, but they are pursued by largely distinct community; the monograph will emphasize the connection and encourage researchers in each of the three areas to pursue research in the others.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project advanced the state of the art in spectral graph theory and in spectral graph algorithms, introducing novel ways of applying linear algebra to the study of networks.  The main results were new generalization of Cheeger?s inequality, a classical result that relates the existence of sparse cuts in a network to the second smallest eigenvalue of a matrix associated to the network, called the Laplacian. The PI and his collaborators proved a refined version of this inequality, involving several Laplacian matrix eigenvalues, showing that a graph partitioning algorithm by Fiedler performs better than its classical worst-case analysis in a broad class of networks. The PI and his collaborators also proved that if the spectrum of the Laplacian exhibits a sufficiently large eigenvalue gap then the network admits a clustering with useful properties, which can be found efficiently. The outcomes of this project validate  the use of multiple Laplacian eigenvectors in widely deployed spectral clustering algorithms by providing a worst-case analysis of spectral clustering. The PI and his collaborators also applied spectral techniques to the study of simple distributed algorithms, leading to the analysis of new self-stabilizing consensus algorithms and new distributed algorithms for community detection.  In terms of broader impact, this project supported the development of a new course on spectral graph algorithms that was taught once at Stanford and once at Berkeley. The PI made 142-page collection of lecture notes, plus an additional 11-page annotated bibliography freely available online. The project was instrumental in the professional development of Shayan Oveis Gharan, whose dissertation received an Honorable Mention for the ACM Doctoral Dissertaion award, and who is now an assistant professor at the University of Washington, and in the professional development of Pasin Manurangsi, who received the STOC 2017 Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award while working on this project, and who is currently a graduate student at Berkeley.
