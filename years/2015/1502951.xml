<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to reconstruct changes in regional hydroclimatic conditions during the Holocene from sites on the Hawaiian Islands to investigate how these changes might be related to variations in the dominant modes of climate variability over the Pacific. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the project is to explore how the North Pacific circulation responded to external forcing and what caused low-frequency variations of the mean climate state and changes in the high-frequency variability around the Hawaiian Islands.  This goal will be addressed by using newly derived hydro-climate paleoclimate data and existing transient paleoclimate model simulations from SynTraCE-21.  The development of new proxy data is an essential step towards filling the gap between tropical marine paleoclimate records and archives from the surrounding continents. This project will aid in a greater understanding of storm track strength and location, as well as providing support for post-doctoral scholars and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hawaiian Islands are a good site for this research because they are located under the descending branch of the Hadley circulation, a region that offers insights into the tropical-extra-tropical climate connection and has the potential to provide new insights into extra-tropical storm activity.   The results from this model-data comparison could be a critical component in assessing the confidence in the reconstruction of the North Pacific climate during the mid-Holocene.</AbstractNarration>

Here we addressed the question how the winter climate had changed over the central North Pacific during the past 12,000 years. In order to reconstruct past circulation pattern we collaborated with researchers from Hawai'i and analyzed climate model simulations (TraCE-21ka simulations) together with new proxy records? (that is biological and chemical markers that are sensitive to climate) found in soil and sediments buried below peats and bogs in the Hawaiian Islands. We investigated the changes in the North Pacific upper level winds and the changes in precipitation in the region of Hawai'i and found systematic trends: From the early Holocene (11,000 years ago) through the mid-Holocene (6,000 years ago) into pre-industrial times, the Hawaiian rainfall decreased in the model simulations. &nbsp;The trend is mostly a result of the changes in the storm tracks over the North Pacific in response to melting ice sheets and orbital changes. The model simulations that we analyzed allowed us to study the cause-effect relationships between regional climatic changes in Hawai'i and the orbital changes, greenhouse gas concentrations, and the melting ice sheets from the last ice age. It was found that the melting ice-sheets caused a major reorganization of the storm tracks over the North Pacific. At the same time the orbital changes resulted in changes in the temperature contrast between tropics and polar regions, which control the major wind circulations and thus the rainfall in Hawai'i. We compared the model results with the Hawaiian proxy data. The proxy data are sensitive to the regional hydroclimatic conditions on the islands. Various chemical and biological markers indicated a drying trend from the early Holocene towards present day. Although several other signals on shorter time scales interrupted this trend we conclude that the effects from ice-sheets and the orbital changes were the key drivers of the circulation changes and the rainfall changes in the central North Pacific.</p> <p>Our research addressed one important goal of the NSF's program, the quantification of errors and uncertainties in climate reconstructions. Our research focused on the questions:&nbsp; Is it possible to reconstruct the large-scale circulation pattern from proxy records (many proxy records are sensitive to temperature or precipitation)? And how confident can we be that the applied statistical methods can reproduce the changes in the circulation during times when Earth's orbit around the Sun was very different from today and large-ice sheets still covered parts of the North American continent? Answers to these questions came from a theoretical study that applied one of the existing statistical reconstruction methods to the temperature and precipitation data from the model simulations. Using model simulations gave us the advantage that we can compare the reconstructed circulation with the modeled circulation pattern. During the research project we were able to show that the traditional method fails when applied to the reconstruction of the mid and early Holocene climate. Furthermore, the cause for the breakdown in the reconstruction skill of the method was studied. Based on the results an improved method was developed. By combining the observed proxy data with paleoclimate model simulations the statistical results can be aligned with physically consistent climate states. In order to rigorously test our method, we will have to conduct additional tests with true proxy data, which is planned to be done in a follow-up study.
