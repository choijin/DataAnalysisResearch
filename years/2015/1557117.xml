<AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This philosophy of biology project engages in conceptual analysis of the notion of a lineage, which is roughly a line of decent from ancestors, and related notions. The project focuses on questions of what lineages are, how they are nested, and how this hierarchical organization was built through evolution. The scope of the project is broad and the consequences far-reaching. How lineages interact across levels is centrally important, for example, in studying how gut microbes influence mate preference in fruit flies and impact what we treat as units of selection; in how we conceive of when polar and brown bears diverged, given the hybridization between those groups; or in how we think about parental lineages as we manipulate how mitochondrial lineages are transmitted from one human generation to the next. A particularly impressive feature of the project is its interdisciplinary focus. The project includes an interdisciplinary workshop, Species in the Age of Discordance, scheduled for spring 2017. The workshop will directly engage the public through outreach events including a Biohumanities Public Lecture Series event on taxonomy in the 21st century, which will be held at the downtown Salt Lake City Public Library. The PI will also coordinate with the Utah Museum of Fine Arts and the Natural History Museum of Utah on an exhibit featuring the work of artists collaborating with taxonomists, including a public lecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central aims of this proposal are to articulate a "levels of lineage" perspective, describe the core commitments of that perspective, and identify how these inform researchers and generate novel research questions. Biological lineages are hierarchically organized, but nesting of those lineages may be "leaky" due to a variety of evolved biological mechanisms and processes. Detecting these patterns of discordance provide evidence for a sophisticated multilevel account of evolution, and require biologists to revise core commitments (theoretical, conceptual, methodological, etc.). The levels of lineage perspective identifies the conceptual resources biologists draw on in these projects. It will extend and consolidate recent work in microbiology, systematics, phylogenetics, and evolutionary and population genetics, among other fields. This project aligns with recent work in demanding a diachronic approach by treating the core apparatus of biology as products of evolution. For example, rather than treating the biological hierarchy as a background assumption, researchers are instead prompted to ask, why this hierarchy, or even one at all? Answering these questions provides further resources and research questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This project, "Evolution and the Level of Lineages," is about how lineages move through time, space, and each other, and diverge, diversify, and grade away from and into one another in the process. It is about how these levels of lineage interact and evolve. The central aims of this proposal are to articulate a 'levels of lineage' perspective, describe the core commitments of that perspective, and identify how these inform researchers and generate novel research questions. To accomplish thse aims, the following goals were identified:        Run a series of 3 interdisciplinary workshops.  One at the PI home  institution (U of Utah), one at a major Biology meeting, and one at a  major Philosophy meeting. Publish articles from the meetings in a special issue of a journal. Draft up articles. Present findings at relevant research venues. Develop an online module on phylogenetic trees and lineages as part of a broader impact project.   Each of these goals was successfully met, satisfying both the intellectual merit and broader impacts envisioned in the original proposal.  Each will be briefly elaborated on below.  A central component of this proposal was hosting three related interdisciplinary workshops on "Species in the Age of Discordance."  The first of these was hosted at the University of Utah (the PI home institution) in March 2017.  Over 50 participants gave talks, with additional participants presenting posters.  Some participants were invited, others were selected through peer-review process.  This workshop was intentionally designed to foster interdisciplinary research networks, e.g., the workshop was designed as a series of sessions pairing biologists with philosophers, historians, and other social scientists of biology.  Other infrastructure was included to encourage cross-disciplinary discussions and network building.  Several researchers have maintained these coneections, even co-authoring papers together.  The second iteration of this workshop was selected as a pre-meeting workshop at the 2017 Joint Evolution Meeting, requiring pre-registration of attendees.  (The Evolution Meeting is the joint annual meeting of three major evolutionary biology professional societies.)  Attendance was robust, hitting capacity (of around 80 attendees).  Interest continued to grow as the meeting began, and the workshop had standing-room only attendance.  At the Evolution meeting the format included presentations by three philosophers of science and three biologists, with plenty of robust discussion from the biologists in attendance.  At both the University of Utah workshop and the Evolution Meeting, undergraduate research assistants were included.  This presented the opportunity to train future researchers in interdisciplinary methods and help build research contacts for these students.  The final iteration of this workshop was as a symposium at the 2017 International Society of History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Biology meeting, where the audience was a mix of philosophers, historians, and biologists.  There were two major scholarly products from these meetings and associated research supported by this project.  The first was the publication of a selection of the talks from the three meetings in a special issue of the journal Philosophy, Theory and Practice in Biology.  This interdisciplinary journal publishes work at the intersection of biology and social sciences of biology, and was a perfect venue.  10 articles were ultimately included in this volume, though other articles were published through support of this project (both by the PI and researchers involved in activities supported by this project).  Those articles appear in philosophy and biology journals.  The other major product supported by this project is the online module, "Bears, Species, and DNA."  This was developed by the PI and graduate and research assistants supported by this project, in conjunction with the University of Utah's Genetic Science Learning Center (GSLC).  The GSLC is one of the world's leaders in developing online biology content intended to reach broad audiences.  This module was targeted at students in grades 7-12, though is suitable for undergraduate classrooms and for the general public.  "Bears, Species, and DNA" is part of the "Speciation" unit of the GSLC's "Evolution: DNA and the Unity of Life" module.  It is an interactive module using recent work on the divergence of polar and brown bears to help students learn how biologists use different lines of evidence to construct competing hypotheses---and how they reconcile or select among those hypotheses.  It prompts students to consider speciation as a process, learn about what divergence means in an evolutionary context, and to consider how the mechanisms of speciation leave genetic, behavioral, and morphological artificats that biologists can collect as evidence to reconstruct that process.  Additional resources are provided for people to explore both the biology behind the unit, or how philosophers and social scientists of biology contribute to these and other topics in biology.  In sum, the goals of this project were clearly met, and it advanced scholarly work in this area while generating tools to broaden participation in the sciences.
