<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a fundamental change in how people interact with electronic devices. Whether a cell phone or wearable fitness tracker, the form of current electronic devices is ultimately limited by the rectangular and rigid display. This project will develop highly transparent and elastic displays, achieving an order of magnitude improvement in mechanical elasticity when compared to state-of-the-art flexible displays. The increased flexibility will result in a transformative technology, enabling a wide range of novel conformal and wearable electronics. Applications immediately pertinent to the commercial wearable electronics market include clothing- or skin-mounted fitness trackers and health monitors. Applications pertinent to the military include adaptive camouflage and wearable heads-up displays. This project will enable the development of an elastic drop-in replacement for existing rigid display technologies, directly enabling a flexible form factor for a wide range of current electronic devices. This project will bring an innovative display to market that will permanently change how people interface with electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and fabricate highly elastic and transparent displays. Current displays are limited in flexibility due to the rigid, brittle materials employed, specifically indium tin oxide (ITO). This project will replace all rigid materials with stretchable nanomaterials, specifically graphene and carbon nanotubes, resulting in a highly transparent and elastic organic light emitting diode display. Graphene and carbon nanotubes offer the technical advantages of high optical transparency and electrical conductivity. Most importantly, these nanomaterials provide superior elastic properties with demonstrated strain limits greater than 20%.  The technical advantages of the advanced nanomaterials employed will enable the development of a video display with the functionality of a TV, yet as thin as paper, as transparent as glass, and as stretchable as rubber.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Under NSF SBIR Phase I award 1549079 from the National Science Foundation, NEOVEL Technologies developed n- and p-type doped, stretchable, transparent electrodes. These n- and p-type doped electrodes were used as cathode and anode, respectively, in the development of a stretchable and flexible organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display. NEOVEL&rsquo;s patent pending elastic OLED (E-OLED) advances the mechanical form factor of current rigid or curved OLED displays by enabling the ability to stretch. Phase I work successfully demonstrated three critical areas of feasibility: first, stretchable, conductive, and transparent electrodes were demonstrated that are work function tuned to optimize OLED performance; second, basic proof-of-concept E-OLED displays were fabricated; and third, manufacturing scalability of all materials and processes explored was validated, motivating continued E-OLED development under a Phase II award.</p> <p>During Phase I work, technical feasibility of E-OLED fabrication was demonstrated. R&amp;D began with the development of custom stretchable and transparent elastomer substrates. Next, NEOVEL worked with an electrode manufacturing partner to deposit stretchable, transparent, and conductive electrodes onto the elastomer substrates, as shown in Figure 1. A high-purity deposition process resulted in stretchable electrodes with exceptional electronic properties, free from chemical contaminants or dopants. A major milestone was achieved in verifying compatibility of electrode deposition equipment with and electrode adhesion to NEOVEL&rsquo;s custom stretchable substrates. The as-deposited electrodes were next chemically modified with both n- and p-type dopants. Stretchable p-type anodes with optical transparency of 85%, work function of 5.4 eV, sheet resistance of 126 &Omega;/?, and strain limits &gt;60% were achieved. Stretchable n-type cathodes with optical transparency of 89%, work function of 3.8 eV, sheet resistance of 830 &Omega;/?, and strain limits &gt;60% were also developed. Table 1 summarizes key electrode performance achieved during Phase I work. Furthermore, Figure 2 shows that NEOVEL&rsquo;s doped electrodes demonstrate minimal change in sheet resistance with strain, in stark contrast with electrodes prior to doping. NEOVEL additionally succeeded in patterning the deposited electrodes with high-throughput laser machining, as shown in Figure 3, without significantly affecting the underlying substrate. These stretchable, doped, and patterned electrodes were used to subsequently develop a stretchable and flexible E-OLED. A<strong> </strong>light-emitting polymer (LEP) was laminated between stretchable cathodes and anodes, demonstrating the capability to successfully fabricate E-OLEDs based on stretchable electrodes, as shown in Figure 4. Phase I R&amp;D achievements directly demonstrate the technical feasibility of developing a fully functional E-OLED display prototype in continued Phase II efforts.</p> <p>In additional to demonstrating technical feasibility of developing an E-OLED, during Phase I efforts NEOVEL also validated that all materials could be sourced in volume and fabrication processes could be scaled to support millions of units per year with the ultimate goal of a roll-to-roll manufacturing process. A major milestone of Phase I work was demonstrating commercial viability of the stretchable electrodes. NEOVEL demonstrated that the stretchable electrodes can meet all technical performance requirements (mechanical strain limit, optical transparency, sheet resistance, and work function range) for use in E-OLEDs, as well as be produced in high-volumes with commercially scalable deposition methods. When produced at high volume, NEOVEL&rsquo;s manufacturing partner can deposit electrodes at a cost of ~$45/m<sup>2</sup>, competitive with indium tin oxide (currently the industry standard for transparent, conductive electrodes) at ~$30/m<sup>2</sup>.</p> <p>All other materials and processes were selected and verified to support mass-production, including elastomer substrate materials, chemical dopants, and LEPs. Furthermore, substrates are prepared by tape-casting followed by thermal curing, electrodes are patterned with high-throughput laser machining, and electrodes are doped by solution-processing; all fabrication methods are compatible with high-volume batch or roll-to-roll manufacturing.</p> <p>During Phase I work, NEOVEL successfully developed stretchable n- and p-type doped electrodes with electronic, optical, and mechanical properties sufficient for subsequent E-OLED development. These stretchable electrodes subsequently were used to fabricate an E-OLED structure using commercially available materials and high-throughput, low-cost fabrication processes. NEOVEL has demonstrated the ability to successfully conduct R&amp;D and achieve technical milestones under NSF SBIR funding. The progress accomplished in Phase I demonstrates that NEOVEL&rsquo;s technical team can quickly innovate to overcome technical challenges, advancing the proposed E-OLED technology. Phase I efforts demonstrate that NEOVEL has the technical expertise to successfully lead research in the area of stretchable OLEDs, including the fabrication, characterization, and optimization of the proposed E-OLED technology. Additional, NEOVEL&rsquo;s patent pending E-OLED technology is the first entirely stretchable OLED display being commercially developed. The novel form factor results in a potentially disruptive technology applicable to the growth market of wearable electronics. Not only is there significant commercial value in developing E-OLEDs, but there is also a unique scientific and technical merit in this novel display technology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/02/2016<br>      Modified by: Nicholas&nbsp;W&nbsp;Petrone</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1549079/1549079_10405854_1472816926003_Table1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1549079/1549079_10405854_1472816926003_Table1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Table 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1549079/1549079_10405854_1472816926003_Table1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Table 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Table 1.
