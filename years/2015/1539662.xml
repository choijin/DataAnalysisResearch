<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds to purchase a current-generation X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer in the GeoAnalytical laboratory at Washington State University, in order to continue to provide a reliable chemical analysis service to the geoscience community. The WSU GeoAnalytical Laboratory is considered an important component of academic geoscience research and research training in North America through the analytical services it provides, most notably for the research community studying volcanic processes. Basic research in this field underpins applications to natural hazards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The XRF facility at WSU is employed in a broad range of geological, environmental science, and archaeological research. Chemical composition is a necessary part of the description of igneous rocks, gives fundamental information about weathering and sedimentary processes, and is growing in application to geoarchaeology. Projects that use data from the instrument include studies of super-eruptions from calderas and large igneous provinces.  Additionally, chemical analysis of Earth surface materials such as sediments, paleosols and archaeological materials feeds the knowledge base for global change science, including past human impacts on the environment. Ensuring a steady supply of trained geochemists and skilled technicians into the national workforce is therefore essential to the future health of society.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The investigation of igneous rocks, with relevance to their origin, volcanic hazards, and ore deposit formation, is largely conducted through chmical analysis at resolutions from the bulk rock to nano-scale. Bulk chemical analysis of igneous rocks forms the basis for classification (this is especially true of volcanic rocks), provides basic information that can be used on a stand-alone basis for some research objectives, and very often underpins additional investigations using micro-scale and other analytical techniques. Bulk chemical analysis of metamorphic and sedimentary rocks and archeological materials, while less common, is growing in importance. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is the method of choice for analysis of the rock-forming elements Si, Ti, Al, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, Na, K and P, and also provides precise and accurate data for numerous trace elements, notably Sc, V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba, Pb and Th at the concentrations found in most rocks. For many years, the GeoAnalytical Laboratory at Washington State University has provided an XRF service to the scientific community, serving as an internal, regional and nationwide facility primarily used by academic and government agency researchers. The existing XRF instrument in the lab was 13 years old and nearing the end of its useful life, hence the goal of this project is to replace it, in order to continue providing a service to the scientific community. The instrument selected, following evaluation of data quality from those offered by competing vendors, was the ThermoFisher Perform'X Advanced WD XRF Spectrometer. The quality (precision, accuracy, reproducibility) of data that this machine is capable of generating is excellent. Unfortunately, the instrument delivered to WSU was very breakdown-prone and experienced literally hundreds of fatal errors during the first 20 months of attempted operation. Due to the persistence of our laboratory staff and the vendor's service engineers, the instrument is now stable and functioning as intended but the project has overrun the original end date by more than a year. We shall be transitioning our main workload to the new instrument by the end of 2018, and look forward to contuniuing to provide XRF analyses of geological materials to the scientific community for years to come.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2018<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wolff</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1539662/1539662_10442684_1543531233185_IMG_1060--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1539662/1539662_10442684_1543531233185_IMG_1060--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Perform'X"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1539662/1539662_10442684_1543531233185_IMG_1060--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Perform'X"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The new instrument in our lab</div> <div class="imageCredit">John Wolff</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">John&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wolff</div> <div class="imageTitle">Perform'X</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
