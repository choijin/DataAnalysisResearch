<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the development of a unique low cost power analog Integrated circuit system ASSP (Application Specific Standard Product) that will be mass deployed worldwide in the light emitting diode (LED) lighting industry. Based on an innovative power supply design, significant cost savings and reliability is achieved through integration.  Furthermore LED lighting companies can significantly reduce the cost of manufacturing of LED Street lighting, enabling LED lighting to be sold to municipalities worldwide at a far lower cost than exists today. Cities worldwide can save significant amounts of energy and therefore costs by implementing LED lamps using this unique power supply system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable for the first time a highly integrated power supply chip set, designed for municipal light emitting diode (LED) lighting, to significantly reduce energy consumption by intelligently managing urban lighting, while achieving significantly longer lifetime, higher efficiency and reliability.  An analog power supply integrated circuit system will be developed to allow a high degree of integration, and incorporate interfaces for communication, remote sensing and monitoring. The integrated circuits will be modeled, prototyped, and tested using simulators, and hardware and software will be optimized to achieve the best results. This analysis will enable manufacturing of prototype units in a very short interval, and allow mass production and deployment of the integrated circuits worldwide. Using the technology developed, energy savings of over 75% compared to conventional lighting will be realized by intelligently configuring urban lighting to optimum localized needs.</AbstractNarration>

The demonstration of this can be seen at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9plg0GzDEE    This ACPLux(tm) prototype demonstrates that communication can be embedded in a luminaire and the attributes of the luminaire, and that of the individual LED?s, can be reported back to the user in a recognizable format. A luminaire operates in a stressful environment of temperature, humidity, and limited space, making the task more difficult.  Care had to followed in the luminaire construction, so that it would operate normally, within these extreme environmental conditions. Furthermore innovation had to be developed to transmit the data through a cellular communications link.    The ACPLux system also retrieves GPS location and time of day through the Internet, which is accessed through the cellular network, and enables the system to "power-off" at sunrise and to "power-on" at sunset exactly, dependent on the luminaire location.  Furthermore, the user can establish user defined "power-on and "power-off" times for a luminaire (groups of luminaires) based on the time of day and location.  For instance, a municipality might determine that an area of the city doesn't need light throughout the evening hours and to save energy could establish a custom dimming cycle for these areas.  Also the system provides a means of "command &amp; control" of LED lighting.  This is accomplished through monitoring and measuring various in lamp functions such as temperature, open &amp; short circuits, current and voltage values, and "faults" and report these measurements through an embedded cellular connection to a central location. This data is stored in a cloud based monitoring system, Shairebook(tm), which empowers users to use the data to optimize maintenance procedures, predict future lamp failures, optimize lamp replacement cycles and optimize operation of the installation.

Originally a dual integrated circuit solution was proposed to accomplish the above ACPLux functions in a production environment.  Through this project, the complexity of the system was reduced and a single custom mixed analog and digital integrated circuit will be pursued in the second phase of the project.  In addition innovation was created which resulted in Shairebook, which will also be pursued and developed in the second phase of the project.
