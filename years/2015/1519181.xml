<AbstractNarration>This project examines how one portion of the Chinese population?the growing professional middle class?is engaging with religious practice and asks how they are using these practices to make sense of their success and place in their country and global society. Why is a rapidly modernizing society that underwent forced secularization now awash with religious activity even in the face of continued governmental control of religion? What does this growth of religion actually look like in people's everyday lives, and how do they use these religious practices, beliefs, and identities to make meaning and build community? Drawing on critiques of the&lt;br/&gt;standard sociological theories of religion and ways of conceptualizing and measuring of religion, this project uses the lens of religious practice to analyze distinctively Chinese ways of practicing religion that transcend established religious lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data collection involves community observations and interviews with individuals from the following communities: self-identified Buddhists, Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, and the non-religious in a prefecture-level city on China's eastern seaboard. Using a combination of qualitative methods (ethnography, in-depth interviews, and photo elicitation interviews),  this project will answer the research questions by examining the religious practices of the cosmopolitan sector of Chinese society while also analyzing distinctively Chinese ways of practicing religion that transcend established religious lines. The research also will examine key tensions in the lives of this population and the ways that they use religion to address practical concerns, make meaning, and pursue happiness in the context of rapid social, cultural, and economic change. This project will further our knowledge of both contemporary Chinese society and the role of lived religion among the global middle class.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My research examines how one portion of the Chinese population&mdash;the growing professional middle class&mdash;is engaging with religious practices and asks how they are using these practices to make sense of their success and their place in both their country and global society.  How can we explain the fact that a rapidly modernizing society that so recently underwent forced secularization is now awash with religious activity even in the face of continued governmental control of religion?  What does this growth of religion actually look like in people?s everyday lives, and how do they use these religious practices, beliefs, and identities to make meaning and build community?   This project uses ethnography at a Buddhist temple and a Protestant church and over seventy in-depth interviews to answer these questions by examining the religious practices in which educated Buddhists, Protestants, and non-religious professionals engage. Drawing on critiques of the standard sociological theories and ways of conceptualizing and measuring of religion, this project uses the lens of religious practice, based on the theoretical work of Martin Riesebrodt (2010) and Adam Yuet Chau (2011), to demonstrate how educated professionals? social position orients them towards religion in a distinctly rationalized and individualistic way that transcends established religious lines.  I find that they engage with religion in similar ways regardless of their religious tradition: religion is, in short, something to be studied, and this study is perceived as necessary to avoid being a surface or "superstitious" practitioner, against whom they build strong symbolic boundaries.  With an emphasis on rationality and science, these educated practitioners delegitimize and distance themselves from the types of emotional, "uncultured," and superstitious practices that constitute a central component of popular Chinese religion and popular forms of religious traditions such as Christianity.  In doing so, they are exerting their moral authority as educated and cultured persons of high quality to delimit appropriate religiousness, a process that serves to draw and reinforce class boundaries as well as religious ones.  These efforts also inadvertently support the state?s rhetoric on the appropriate forms and location of religion as well as what it means to be a rational and modern person of high quality.  In short, their religious practices help them deal with and adjust to the challenges of living in a rapidly changing society, but it does not lead them to confront the existing social, economic, and political configuration.  The growth of religion in post-Mao China poses a distinct challenge to many key sociological ideas developed in a Western context, including the conceptualization of religion, various secularization theories, and the very meaning of modernity. While it has received increasing attention in recent years, both foreign and Chinese scholars have barely begun to scratch the surface of the topic.  This project begins to fill this gap by comparing how Buddhists, Protestants, and the non-religious in the professional middle class engage in religious practice.  In the process, it examines the ways in which a privileged sector of the Chinese population is grappling with the rapid economic, social, and cultural changes that China has undergone since the introduction of capitalism in the late 1970s.  In doing so, it also provides a portrait of Chinese modernity and highlights the ways in which China's different secularization path has shaped individuals' understandings of and engagement with religion.
