<AbstractNarration>Warm dense matter (WDM) has been the focus of research for astrophysics, fusion physics, high-energy physics, and energy applications among others. Due to the limitation in the instrument's spatial resolution, one fundamental question remains: how will electrons behave after being ejected from a material? The recent advancements in picosecond electron schlieren radiography (PESR) is now making it possible to investigate this problem. Through collaboration with Dr. Jie Chen from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, an expert in ultrafast dynamics, the EAPSI fellow will conduct the experiment, develop and perform the data analysis to participate in the mapping of the physical shape and time evolution of the ejected electrons. Understanding the behavior of ejected electrons is expected to contribute to advancement in fundamental knowledge in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, in this project, the EAPSI fellow will explore the possibility of extending the current picosecond electron schlieren capability from the time consuming multiple-shot to the more efficient single-shot mode. This will increase the spatial resolution to a level of sensitivity capable of directly measuring the ejected charge dynamics, which can be further converted to transient electric fields by using Maxwell?s equations. These new measurement capabilities will offer insight into the physics governing the laser-induced plasma dynamics. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>
