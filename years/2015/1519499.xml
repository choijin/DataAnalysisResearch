<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project advances a new approach for reducing infection rates associated with medical devices.  The global urinary catheters market in 2013 was estimated at $2.4 billion, and the United States market was $1.1 billion.   The average resulting healthcare system treatment cost related to catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) is estimated between $500 and $1,000 for each infection or between $500 million and $1 billion annually for the total market. This project will support development of a Foley catheter that is expected to significantly reduce the incidence of these CAUTIs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a novel technology that results in the release of a high concentration of antimicrobial silver ions near the surface of the device.  In this project, we will generate an antimicrobial Foley catheter that incorporates the company's proprietary technology so as to provide for significantly improved antimicrobial control compared to existing devices. The objective of this Phase I project is to produce an electronically activated catheter that will provide a minimum of 3-log additional reduction in bacterial count over the current market-leading antimicrobial catheter, for all bacterial species tested.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) afflict 600,000 patients in the United States each year.  Puratec, LLC, is developing innovative antimicrobial technologies so as to reduce the incidence of CAUTIs.  Puratec, LLC made significant progress on the development of its Pura-Fx catheter through the successful completion of the Technical Objectives from the Phase I program that was designed to move from prototype to a commercial catheter. In the Phase I program, Puratec generated a commercially viable Foley catheter that was shown to: 1) be fully functional in vivo; 2) provide enhanced in vitro antimicrobial activity against several urinary tract bacterial pathogens when compared to a market-leading antimicrobial catheter; and 3) provide a sustained local concentration of antimicrobials in vitro.  These activities and accomplishments have provided support for further development in a Phase II program that will focus on advancing the commercialization of the catheter and conducting in vivo efficacy studies.  The prototype catheter device at the onset of Phase 1 was an early proof-of-concept device with limited functionality as a catheter.  The technology behind the Pura-Fx uses advanced  electronics, which at the time, including two large electrical enclosures each about the size of a shoe-box and at least one multi-meter.  These electronic items were necessarily tethered to the catheter and also plugged into a wall electrical outlet.  During Phase 1, the electronics were miniaturized and enhanced with additional functional capabilities in order to create a catheter with commercial viability.  In addition to the electronics, significant modifications were made to the catheter, the catheter's electrode design and electrode mounting.  To achieve these technical milestones regarding the catheter's mechanics,  custom mold tooling and various custom tools used for assembly were designed and implemented.  The modified catheter design that was achieved in Phase I was shown to be fully functional as a catheter.  Extensive in vitro performance testing against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus ran concurrent with the catheter development.  The Puratec catheter reduced the amount of viable bacteria by more than 3-log reduction against all five of the bacteria species assessed.
