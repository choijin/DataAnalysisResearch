<AbstractNarration>Adopting a new way to address an existing question often yields new insights or answers. This project focuses on hemiparasites - plants that obtain resources both by making their own via photosynthesis and by stealing resources from the roots of other plants - to understand direct and indirect effects between plants and their herbivores. The novel twist here is that plants mediate interactions among different trophic levels, determining how a plant parasite affects a plant predator and vice versa. The research will have direct application to the management and recovery of two rare species: the hemiparasite is federally listed as threatened and the herbivore is an endangered butterfly. The investigators will partner with federal and state agencies to restore both species. This research will also provide research training to a post-doctoral research associate, a graduate student, and an undergraduate student. All will be actively mentored in responsible conduct of research, field and lab data collection, analysis, and outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organisms used in this study co-occur in grasslands of the Pacific Northwest US. Experimental mesocosms will be assembled that contain host plants, hemiparasites, and herbivores. Mesocosms will contain high or low numbers of plant species that can serve as hosts for hemiparasites. Hemiparasitism will be manipulated among plants, and herbivores will be allowed to feed on the hemiparasites in a subset of the mesocosms. Hemiparasite survival, biomass, and secondary chemistry will be measured to determine how they are affected by host community composition, and herbivore performance will be related to host plant community and to hemiparasite resources. Stable isotopes will be used to track fluxes of carbon and nitrogen from the host plant community to the hemiparasites, and through the hemiparasites to their herbivores. The research will exploit an ecologically understudied situation in which plants function both as producers and as consumers to provide new insights into how multi-trophic interactions structure ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Hemiparasitic plants photosynthesize but can also parasitize other plants.  They occur in ecosystems around the world, and in some cases can structure the ecosystem such as by increasing plant diversity.  This project demonstrated some of the interactions between hemiparasites and other organisms.  Understanding these interactions is essential to determining the roles of species in ecosystems, and to their management.  We focused on two species, golden paintbrush (Castilleja levisecta) and harsh paintbrush (Castilleja hispida).  These species can parasitize the roots of other plants - their hosts - through structures called haustoria.    Taylor?s checkerspot (Euphydryas editha taylori), a butterfly, can lay its eggs on golden paintbrush, harsh paintbrush, and lanceleaf plantain (Plantago lanceolata), a non-hemiparasitic species.  Under controlled conditions, fewer eggs were laid on golden paintbrush than on the other species, though most females laid eggs on all three species.  Newly hatched larvae did not favor one species over another, but strongly favored paintbrush bracts over paintbrush leaves.  Larvae grew less if fed paintbrush leaves than either paintbrush bracts or plantain leaves.  In the field, larval survival varied with the identity of the species they ate.  In addition, Taylor?s checkerspot larvae do not eat the plants that paintbrushes are parasitizing, yet the survival and growth of those larvae was indirectly affected by host identity.    We conducted several greenhouse experiments in which hemiparasites and hosts were grown in pots.  Competition occurred in all pots, but parasitism was either allowed or was prevented by enclosing the root systems of hemiparasites in mesh bags.  Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) was affected differently by golden paintbrush and by harsh paintbrush, and these effects depended on whether plants were experiencing drought or normal conditions.  Golden paintbrush grew larger when pots were fertilized with phosphorus and it was parasitizing yarrow than when it was parasitizing Roemer?s fescue (Festuca roemeri) or was unable to parasitize either species.  This suggests that hemiparasites are poorer competitors for phosphorus than their host plants are, and that host effects differ among species.   We continue to work on several aspects of this project.  We have captured images of haustorial connections, and estimate that these hemiparasitic species obtain ~ 20% of their carbon from their hosts.  We are investigating whether hemiparasites also obtain other benefits from their hosts, such as bacterial endophytes.  And, we are measuring the mineral nutrient concentrations of a range of hemiparasites and non-hemiparasitic species to determine whether hemiparasites have nutrient-rich tissues.  Finally, we are growing a variety of hemiparasites in the greenhouse to test whether annual hemiparasites have stronger effects on their hosts than do perennial hemiparasites.   The results of this project demonstrate that we need to know more about the biology of individual species of hemiparasites, particularly their physiology. Hemiparasites can directly impact their hosts and organisms that feed on them, but can also mediate interactions between organisms that otherwise would not interact directly. Non-hemiparasitic plants differ in their effectiveness as hosts and in their sensitivity to parasitism.  Hemiparasites likely also differ in their ability to parasitize hosts and in their effects on ecosystems.   This project provided valuable training and professional development for multiple graduate and undergraduate students.  Project results were shared through peer-reviewed publications, oral and poster presentations, public lectures, and field trips.  Finally, this project directly informed the recovery and management of threatened and endangered species. Taylor?s checkerspot is endangered, and golden paintbrush is threatened, under the Endangered Species Act. We partnered with government agencies and non-profits working to recover these taxa. In particular, information about the suitability of various host plants for golden paintbrush, and food plants for Taylor?s checkerspot, are helpful to the conservation of these species.
