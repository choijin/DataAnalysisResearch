<AbstractNarration>This research project addresses the need for enhanced modeling and simulation of flexible multibody dynamics (FMD) that can accurately capture friction-induced behavior, including stick-slip motion and Schallamach detachment waves. Such system-level frictionally excited vibrations can greatly degrade efficiency and lifetime, and may be especially significant where compliant materials are in frictional contact with relatively rigid bodies, as in soft robots, engineered biological systems, and other emerging engineering areas. In addition to modeling and simulation, this research will apply the enhanced FMD formulations -- together with complementary experiments -- to study biomimetic surface patterning for influencing and controlling undesired frictionally induced behavior. The FMD simulation tools arising from this project will reduce the need for expensive and time-consuming design prototypes in important US industries, including automotive, manufacturing equipment, and robotics. The project includes outreach activities to increase participation of underrepresented groups in engineering through K-12 internship and training opportunities in the investigators' labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary research objective is to explore the applicability and enhancement of flexible multi-body dynamics simulation tools for analyzing Schallamach waves, and related stick-slip contact dynamics. Resolving such frictional behavior will be accomplished using new and efficient contact formulations, together with efficient implementations and solution procedures. Detailed experiments will test the multi-body dynamics predictions and suggest directions for further refinements. In later stages of the research, both computation and experiments will be exercised to demonstrate new capabilities for exploring design changes, such as various micro- and macro-scale patterns, that can regularize sliding and limit detrimental stick-slip and vibration behavior. Successful completion of the research effort will greatly increase our ability to design and tailor multi-body systems incorporating soft elements while significantly extending the reach of flexible multi-body dynamics simulation to new and important research areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of the grant work was on understanding detachment wave-induced instabilities in systems where relatively soft materials are in rolling contact with rigid bodies. The high adhesive friction between an elastomer and its counterpart generally impedes sliding in the accepted sense. Instead, displacement is accommodated by Schallamach waves of detachment, which are surface wrinkles that move across the contact zone. However, this has received little research attention in systems undergoing rolling contact, such as belt drives, tires, conveying systems, and others. This research used both experimental and theoretical approaches to study the rolling contact mechanics in a simple flat belt drive, with particular focus on capturing and elucidating the mechanisms associated with friction detachment waves.    The research carried-out during the life of the grant made the following original contributions:  We developed a second-to-none tribometer for capturing the contact instabilities and the global dynamic response of a prototypical belt drive system. This machine allowed us to describe, visualize and examine soft-rigid contact mechanics in belt drives. We found for the first time experimental evidence that, in a simple belt-drive system under low speed operation, the displacement between the belt and the pulley is accommodated primarily by detachment events rather than sliding. This calls into question the universal validity of the sliding-based approach to analysis of rolling friction of elastomeric surfaces. We showed that contact instabilities associated with detachment waves can serve as a sole source of self-oscillation in the belt drive system and that, counterintuitively, the problem cannot be resolved by manipulating the system’s inertia. This finding will help in searching solutions for self-oscillation problems in other systems involving soft rolling motion, which is ubiquitous in countless engineering applications. We proposed a new measurement approach and a new model for the estimation of the frictional losses in rolling motion incorporating detachment events. The proposed model may be applied to the calculation of the dissipated energy in other systems involving soft rolling contact. We demonstrated that a novel biomimetic surface patterning design can be successfully implemented in rolling to mitigate detachment waves and self-osillations. Use of this surface-modification approach may also be instrumental for better understanding and possible reduction of energy losses, noise pollution, vibration-induced inaccuracies, wear, etc. associated with dynamic effects in rolling.
