<AbstractNarration>Copepods are ubiquitous animals in marine environments and play a critically-important function in the food web of the world's oceans. The ability of a copepod to sense fluid motion provides an advantage for critical survival tactics such as finding food, finding mates, and avoiding predators. This project will examine the capability of copepods to detect turbulent flow. A turbulent-like flow will be mimicked in a laboratory aquarium as a small vortex (i.e., swirling motion like a tornado), and copepod swimming behavior will be observed in and around the vortex. The goal is to understand the variations in the sensory ecology of three species of copepods with three representative sensor arrays to better explain their temporal and spatial distribution in the ocean in response to turbulence conditions. The project also has a strong education and outreach plan. It will provide interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students in fields such as engineering, biology, and computational sciences.  Further, research results will provide context for planned outreach efforts to educate the general public at local high schools and aquariums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will deconstruct the turbulence-copepod interaction by performing detailed kinematics analysis of swimming in three species of copepods in and around a laboratory realization of a Burgers' vortex that mimics in situ turbulent vortices in the dissipation range of scales. The goal is to test the hypothesis that the copepods Acartia tonsa, Temora longicornis, and Calanus finmarchicus detect hydrodynamic cues related to vortices in turbulent flows and actively respond via changes in swimming kinematics. Using a custom designed and calibrated apparatus, a turbulent-like vortex will be created in the laboratory. By holding the turbulent vortex stable in space, cameras will be focused on a small region of the feature to record the animal behavior relative to well-quantified flow characteristics. The approach has the advantage of eliminating the time-varying and stochastic nature of turbulent flows that make such mechanistic understanding so challenging to achieve. Hypotheses will address questions about the influence of swimming style, setal array architecture, and the interaction of chemical and hydrodynamical cues on the turbulence-copepod interaction. Specifically, the investigators will examine how copepod species with different sensory structures and swimming orientation respond to a stable well-defined laboratory stimulus to determine how copepods exploit the shape and orientation of turbulent features. The species of copepods chosen for this work provide a range of sensory architectures, swimming orientations, sizes, and mate tracking abilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Copepods are the most abundant multi-cellular organisms on earth and play a critically-important function in the food web of the world’s oceans.  They provide an important conduit for the flow of energy from primary producers (algae) to the higher trophic levels including commercially-important fish species, seabirds, and marine mammals.  Turbulent processes have been shown to alter metabolic rates, predator-prey encounter rates, grazing rates, egg production, swimming behavior, and population dynamics of marine copepods.  It has been hypothesized that copepods detect and respond to turbulent features by aggregating within the turbulent eddies.  These aggregates may enhance mating success but also may increase their chance of being eaten. The purpose of this project was to examine the capability of copepods to detect turbulent fluid motion in the ocean.  This project tested the hypothesis that the copepods Acartia tonsa, Temora longicornis, and Calanus finmarchicus detect hydrodynamic cues related to vortices in turbulent flows and actively respond via changes in their swimming motion. A turbulent-like flow is mimicked in a laboratory aquarium as a small vortex (i.e., swirling motion like a tornado) with characteristics corresponding to typical turbulent vortices that copepods are likely to encounter in their habitats, and copepod swimming behavior was observed in and around the vortex.  The three copepod species were chosen due to the differences in the geographical location at which they are found, their swimming and mating behaviors, and differences in their sensory architecture.  Acartia tonsa is a hop-sinker with a 3D sensor array and shows significant changes in swimming kinematics and an increase in relative swimming velocity and hop frequency with increasing vortex strength. Furthermore, in moderate-to-strong vortices, A. tonsa follows circular trajectories around the vortex, which would increase encounter rates with other similarly behaving copepods.

The responses to the Burgers vortex flow are species specific. While all three species followed circular trajectories around the vortex (which would lead to aggregations and increase encounter rates), T. longicornis (a cruise swimmer with a planar setal array) demonstrates a mild behavioral response to the vortex (compared to the A. tonsa response).  Calanus finmarchicus (a swim-sink mode copepod with a planar setal array) demonstrates a stronger reaction to the orientation of the vortex compared to the other species.  In sum, these results provide insight to the ecological consequences of the behavior and may help to explain their horizontal and vertical distribution in the water column.   The project also had a strong education and outreach effort.
