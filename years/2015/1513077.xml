<AbstractNarration>This project aims to create an innovative interactive visualization facility at Wellesley College. The facility consists of combined large-scale horizontal and vertical interactive surfaces, which support touch, pen, and tangible interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plans for using the facility for research and teaching activities include Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research on novel interaction techniques for large-scale interactive surfaces, social media analytics, visual programming, learning analytics for intelligent learning interfaces, and visualization of biological, neuroscience, and chemistry information. In particular, the facility will enable research on: 1) novel interaction techniques for large-scale multi-surface environments; 2) new interactive visualizations for various domains including journalism, genomics, neuroscience, chemistry, and learning analytics; 3) understanding of how large-scale multi-surface environments impact collaborative learning of complex concepts; and 4) design guidelines and best-practices for large-scale multi-surface interactive visualizations for collaborative exploration.</AbstractNarration>

The outcomes from this project contribute to four areas of current research: 1) Interactive tabletops and surfaces? 2) ubiquitous computing? 3) Computer supported collaborative work? and 4) Tangible interaction (TEI) design for informal science learning. Intellectual merit:  The breadth of the research questions explored using the facility demonstrates that multi touch interaction can be used to support a variety of tasks and domains, including the exploration of protein structure, collaborative learning of STEM concepts in informal learning environments, and block programming. The project resulted in two novel interactive applications for informal science learning: BacPack - a museum exhibit for exposing museum visitors to the core ideas of synthetic biology and biological engineering? and Habitat Explorer a multitouch application for teaching children about Data Science. Evaluating BacPack in a museum environment, contributed to understanding what design choices foster engagement with an interactive exhibit and help to communicate complex scientific concepts to a wide audience. We also created a multi-touch interface, which supports the manipulating of protein structure in a video game for citizen science, and explored the role of touch interactions in collaborative block programming.   In addition, the project produced findings, which shed light on how groups of eight users collaborate on a decision-making task around a large-scale interactive tabletop. These are important findings considering the increasing availability of multi-device environments, and the key role of co-located collaboration by larger groups in both work and educational settings (e.g. board meetings, committee meetings, seminar classes).
