<AbstractNarration>The Great Lakes Geometry Conference (GLGC) will be held March 13-15, 2015 at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The GLGCs are a well-established international conference series held annually in the Great Lakes region, rotating among different universities. The aim of the next GLGC is to bring in distinguished speakers in geometry and physics to celebrate the fruitful union of 4-manifolds and gauge theory for the last 30 years. One primary goal of this program is to expose graduate students and early career mathematicians to some of the most important new developments in these areas. In addition, we hope that the intermingling of the subject matter will encourage collaborations between researchers in different areas. We will also highlight the connections with mathematical physics which will hopefully foster interdisciplinary collaborations.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coupling of the 4-manifold topology and gauge theory from physics was one of the major creations in the new era of the interactions between mathematics and physics in the 1980's. Since then we have witnessed tremendous progresses such as the invention of Donaldson theory, Seiberg-Witten theory and various Floer homology theories. In addition to celebrating these achievements in the conference, we aim to assess the current developments and look into the future of the subject.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A conference website has been set up to inform the community of the opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masmak/greatlakes2015</AbstractNarration>
