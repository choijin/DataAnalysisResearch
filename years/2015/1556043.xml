<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be the discovery of new ionization technology for use with mass spectrometry.  This technology will enable lower cost, lower energy use, and reduced user expertise, which may potentially drive mass spectrometry into large and underserved markets such as medical diagnostics and field portable instruments designed specifically for use in homeland security, bedside diagnostics, or bio-threat detection. The new technology changes the current understanding of ionization processes used in mass spectrometry and provides opportunities for new innovations to advance science through improved measurements, impacting fields such as health, safety, and security. The aims of this Phase II project are to develop interfaces to incorporate the platform developed in Phase I on most major mass spectrometer manufacturer's instruments and to develop technologies for rapid automate analyses even of surfaces.  The research of Phase II is aimed to better understand the fundamentals of this new technology in order to drive commercial success in high sensitivity rapid analyses at a competitive price. Mass spectrometers are widely used representing a $4 billion industry of which ionization technology represents a significant commercial opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase II project proposes to revolutionize ionization in mass spectrometry by providing commercial products that utilize a simple and powerful ionization technology. The newly discovered process spontaneously converts large and small, volatile and nonvolatile compounds to the gas-phase ions necessary for analysis using mass spectrometry without employing currently used high cost lasers or high voltage. The method is broadly applicable for analysis of compounds such as drugs, lipids, carbohydrate conjugates, peptides, and proteins directly from bodily fluids or tissue, as well as synthetic polymers and inorganic catalytic surfaces.  This technology is anticipated to augment or even replace older ionization methods in applications such as clinical analyses, pharmaceuticals, forensics, environmental, and food safety. The aims of the Phase II project are to implement the multifunctional platform developed during Phase I on a variety of manufacturer's instruments, automate the process to allow lower cost and faster analyses, and provide an automated surface analysis platform.  Besides determining the best sample preparation methodologies and choice of solvents/matrices, the research objectives include innovative automated sample introduction technologies that eliminate the need for a conventional "ion source" while reducing the pumping requirements, which currently hinder development of small, low-cost portable mass spectrometers.</AbstractNarration>

Ionization methods widely used today were introduced in the 1980?s and earned the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. &nbsp;These technologies require either a laser in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (<strong>MALDI</strong>) or high voltages in electrospray ionization (<strong>ESI</strong>).

With the new ionization technologies, the ?ion source? used in MS is reduced to a simple inlet linking atmospheric pressure to the vacuum inside the mass spectrometer.&nbsp; The technologies for converting small and large compounds to gas-phase ions for analysis by MS being commercialized by MSTM lower cost while achieving outstanding performance through simplicity, sensitivity, robustness, and providing complementary information not obtained with &nbsp;the established ionization technologies.</p> <p>During Phase I, a manual platform was developed as the minimal viable product capable of ionization from solid matrices, as with MALDI, and termed matrix-assisted ionization (<strong>MAI</strong>) or from solutions, as in ESI, and termed solvent-assisted ionization (<strong>SAI</strong>). In building this manual product, MSTM realized that ESI could easily be accommodated making the product the first multi-ionization low-cost ionization platform which provides flexibility for the user and broadens the range of compounds which can be detected with a single mass spectrometer.&nbsp; The manual platform (see attached picture) requires only about a minute to exchange with the commercial ion source on a mass spectrometer, providing new capabilities without sacrificing any capabilities of the instrument manufacturer?s ion source.&nbsp;</p> <p>The primary goal in Phase II was to automate MAI.&nbsp; Similar to the multi-ionization manual platform, the automated platform was designed to encompass capabilities of ESI, MAI, and SAI.&nbsp; Both a prototype platform and a revolutionary lightweight, small footprint, multi-ionization automated alpha platform, termed <em>Ionique </em>(see attached picture), were built and validated. Both the manual and automated platforms use custom made flanges for fast installation and removal from commercial mass spectrometers manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waters, and Agilent. Additionally to the multiple ionization methods, the platform is flexible in its ability to analyze samples from a variety of formats including well plates holding 96 or 384 samples. As a final product development MSTM designed and implemented user-friendly software. &nbsp;</p> <p>The TECP supplement, in collaboration with a leading mass spectrometer manufacturer, was designed to demonstrate Ionique for bacterial analyses. The outcome was demonstration that bacteria, even&nbsp;<em>E. coli</em>&nbsp;strains, could be differentiated with MAI and identified from a training set library using 3D principal component analysis (PCA) protocols.&nbsp;It was further shown that the multi-ionization capabilities of Ionique allowing ESI and MAI from the same samples in less that 2 minutes gave improved identification relative to either ionization method alone. &nbsp;This success demonstrates the potential for the new ionization technologies and the automated Ionique platform to impact critical societal needs in areas such as medical diagnostics and environmental analyses.&nbsp; &nbsp;The outcome of the STTR Phase I, II, and TECP projects are two unique products which significantly enhance the capabilities of MS while reducing costs and providing the scientific, and eventually the medical community, more comprehensive results through cost effective use of older and newer ionization technologies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Additionally, during Phase II, MSTM, collaborating with the Trimpin lab at Wayne State University, demonstrated a new approach to sample introduction by MAI which has proved exceptionally robust, rapid, sensitive, low cost, and user friendly providing the possibility of expanding mass spectrometry to the masses where expertise is limited and samples are acquired without sample cleanup. MSTM received an NSF Phase i award to explore the possibilities of this new ionization approach. &nbsp;</p> <p>These NSF sponsored STTR and TECP projects resulted in training of five postdoctoral fellows in research relative to commercialization as well as several undergraduate students who gained valuable experience through interactions with MSTM personnel and postdoctoral fellows.&nbsp; MSTM has received significant worldwide interest in our technologies including our TECP partner.&nbsp;The importance of the new ionization technologies was demonstrated by the awarding of the prestigious Beimann Medal to Prof. Sarah Trimpin, MSTM cofounder, for her critical role in the discovery and development of the new ionization technologied.&nbsp; For more information visit www.mstmsolutions.com.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/10/2019<br>      Modified by: Charles&nbsp;Mcewen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556043/1556043_10420238_1548204479626_CMIonique2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556043/1556043_10420238_1548204479626_CMIonique2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ionique being installed on Mass Spectrometer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556043/1556043_10420238_1548204479626_CMIonique2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ionique being installed on Mass Spectrometer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">MSTM President installing the Ionique multi-ionization automated platform of a Thermo Fisher Scientific Orbitrap Exactive.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Picture by Dean Jarois</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Charles&nbsp;Mcewen</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ionique being installed on Mass Spectrometer</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556043/1556043_10420238_1548203404005_MSTM2019groupandproducts--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556043/1556043_10420238_1548203404005_MSTM2019groupandproducts--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MSTM Personnel and Products"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556043/1556043_10420238_1548203404005_MSTM2019groupandproducts--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="MSTM Personnel and Products"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">From left to right MSTM President, Prof. Charles McEwen with Ionique multi-ionization automated platform, Dr. Darrell Marshall with ASAP source, CTO, Dr. Milan Pophristic, and CEO, Prof. Sarah Trimpin with the Ionique manual multi-ionization platform.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Picture by Dean Jarois</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Charles&nbsp;Mcewen</div> <div class="imageTitle">MSTM Personnel and Products</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556043/1556043_10420238_1548205626759_IoniqueatWSUwithSAIautomation--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556043/1556043_10420238_1548205626759_IoniqueatWSUwithSAIautomation--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ionique demonstration at Wayne State University"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556043/1556043_10420238_1548205626759_IoniqueatWSUwithSAIautomation--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ionique demonstration at Wayne State University"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Demonstration of Ionique multi-ionization automated platform installed on a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap at Wayne State University.
