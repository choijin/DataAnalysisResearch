<AbstractNarration>SUSY 2015 (The 23rd International Conference on Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions) is the primary yearly conference for the presentation of ideas regarding new physics beyond the Standard Model (not just supersymmetry) and experimental results relevant thereto. It covers not only high energy physics but also related areas of cosmology and the early universe. It attracts 300-400 top researchers (both theorists and experimentalists, students through senior faculty) in all new physics areas. The conference lasts for 6 days and includes both plenary talks (about 25 thirty-minute talks) and seven daily parallel sessions (in combination containing of order 150 talks, each being of order fifteen minutes). The parallel sessions are designed to allow students and early career physicists to bring their ideas and results to the attention of the full community. The conference is essential for all researchers in the various fields to remain fully up-to-date with respect to the progress made by and ideas being developed by other researchers in the many sub-fields of relevance. It is the critical venue for dissemination of recent and planned research. By bringing the full spectrum of researchers together, the generation of new ideas is greatly enhanced and sped up. Often, new critical mass collaborations are formed among theorists and new ideas for the analysis of existing data and forthcoming data are generated. New approaches to experimentally confirming or eliminating/constraining theoretical models often emerge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Society benefits in many direct and indirect ways from support of theoretical and experimental physics in the areas on which the conference focuses. The conference re-inforces and motivates the newest generations of physicists pursuing research careers in this and related very highly sophisticated fields. It is focused on ideas that potentially explain the most elementary particles and most basic forces of nature. Such understanding has often yielded substantial benefits to society. The developments in experimental techniques, detectors and accelerators necessary for probing the particles and forces, have frequently led to very substantial spinoffs. Many medical advances have resulted from the very sophisticated detector and accelerator developments needed for the field to progress.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The discovery of a Higgs boson in 2012 and subsequent measurements confirming that it has properties very much as predicted by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics leaves many open questions.  Most particularly, quantum field theory predicts that without additional "beyond the SM (BSM)" physics there is no reason for its mass to be as small as found (125 GeV, i.e. about 130 times the mass of a proton). The most attractive BSM model that would explain such a small mass is the theory of Supersymmetry according to which all the SM particles would have "partner" particles that are substantially heavier than their SM counterparts.  If they have masses not much heavier than 2000 GeV, then because of quantum field theory cancellations it would be "natural" for the Higgs boson to have the observed low mass.  Thus, the high energy physics community has devoted considerable effort to the theory of supersymmetry and the search for supersymmetric partner particles, especially with regard to understanding the nature of the possible signals for such particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) currently operating at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.  The fact that this year saw the 23rd International Conference on Supersymmetry (attracting close to 300 participants in this and the past 4 years) is testament to the importance attached to this theory and to the search for associated experimental signals.     The 23rd International Conference on Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions was organized by the Physics Department and the HEFTI group at UC Davis. The meeting was held at Lake Tahoe during August 23-29, 2015. Since its inception in 1993, this annual SUSY conference has become the world's largest international meeting devoted to new ideas in high energy physics. The main focus of the conference was theoretical, phenomenological and cosmological aspects of supersymmetric theories and other approaches to physics beyond the Standard Model from the electroweak scale to the Planck scale. Constraints and observations from all relevant experiments were presented and/or summarized.     At the conference there were 38 thirty-minute major plenary talks over a period of 6 days given by the best-known researchers in the field as well as 222 twenty-minute parallel talks presented in 8 parallel sessions during 4 afternoons.  The latter included many presentations by students and post-doctoral researchers and highlighted the incredible talents of the up-and-coming young professionals entering the field.     Topics covered during the conference included:     Higgs Theory and Experiment  Supersymmetry Phenomenology and Experiment  SUSY/String Models  Fundamental and String Theory  Particle Cosmology Theory and Experiment  Flavor Violation Theory and Experiment  Alternative Theories  Precision Computations and Monte Carlo Tools, all areas       The NSF funds received in support of the conference were entirely used to help support the local costs and travel costs of the students and postdocs attending.  These funds were vital to ensure that all the young researchers who wanted to attend could attend.  Many of the students and postdocs said they could not have come without support.  Overall, the success of and attendance at SUSY 2015 ensures that the field of Supersymmetry will remain robust and can respond to "signals" related to SUSY or other BSM physics in the data from the Large Hadron Collider as it comes available during 2016.     For more details regarding SUSY 2015, including the full timetable of all talks as well as links to the electronic "slides" presented in each of the talks can be found at the conference website: http://particle.physics.ucdavis.edu/workshops/susy15/.
