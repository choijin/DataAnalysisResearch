<AbstractNarration>The Fiftieth Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will be held at Baylor University from March 10-13, 2016.  The first meeting in this series  was held at Arizona State University in 1967.  The organizers expect the conference to attract between 150 and 200 participants from the United States and abroad.  The scope of the conference  encompasses both classical fields like set-theoretic topology and continuum theory, and also the fields of dynamical systems, geometric topology and geometric group theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spring Topology Conference brings together researchers from several  areas of topology.  There are five parallel sessions representing set-theoretic topology, continuum theory, dynamical systems, geometric topology and geometric group theory.  The conference has six plenary and twelve semi-plenary talks.  These talks serve to highlight the major advances in the field for the year.  Each year one of the plenary talks is reserved for the winner of the Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award, which is given to a promising junior topologist.  This year's meeting will also feature  one-day workshops on March 9, the day before the conference begins, aimed at graduate students and junior researchers. The Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference seeks the active participation of graduate students, young researchers, women and under-represented groups. The grant provides funds to support travel for invited speakers, graduate students and researchers without external support.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Baylor University hosted the 50th Annual Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference (STDC) March 10 to March 13, 2016.  In the last fifty years, the SpringTopology Conference has established itself as one of the largest and most successful annual topology conferences. The conference attracted just over 200 participants from the United States and abroad. The scope of the conference was quite broad, encompassing not only classical fields like set-theoretic topology and continuum theory, but also the fields of dynamical systems, geometric topology and geometric group theory.  This conference brings together researchers from several important areas of topology. There were five parallel sessions representing general topology, continuum theory, dynamical systems, geometric topology and geometric group theory. The conference had six plenary and twelve semi-plenary talks. These talks serve to highlight the major advances in the field for the year. Each year one of the plenary talks is reserved for the winner of the Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award, which is awarded to a promising young topologist.  This year the award was bestowed on Yinhe Peng.  This year we organized several one-day workshops on March 9, the day before the conference began, aimed at graduate students and beginning researchers. Overall, the conference is an excellent venue for participation in a large number of very active research areas.  We put a lot of effort in to including women, young mathematicians, grad students and other under-represented groups, not only as participants but also as session organizers, workshop leaders, semi-plenary and plenary speakers.  Our efforts paid off, as we had a high percentage of speakers and organizers from under-represented groups.  Workshops:  We had three workshops the day before the conference.  The workshops were lively and well-attended by primarily graduate students and beginning researchers.  One workshop was in Continuum Theory and was given by Logan Hoehn.  He gave a day long discussion on his recent proof of the classification of planar homogeneous continua, a solution to a century old problem.  Another workshop was in Dynamical Systems and was given by Krystyna Kuperberg, a leading mathematician in that field.  The third workshop was on the interaction between set-theory and topology and was given by Alan Dow.  Special Session Organizers:  The conference runs five parallel special sessions for contributed talks 20 minutes in length.  Each session had between 25 and 35 contributed talks spread out across the four days of the conference.  We took care to include women and other under-represented groups as special session organizers, and we instructed them to also ensure broad participation in their sessions. The five sessions were organized by the following mathematicians:  Continuum Theory:  Sergio Macias, UNAM Jonathan Meddaugh, University of Birmingham Patrick Vernon, Xavier  Dynamical Systems:  Lori Alvin, Bradley University Krystyna Kuperberg, Auburn Roland Roeder, IUPUI  Geometric Group Theory:  Pallavi Dani, LSU Chris Hruska, UW-Milwaukee Becca Winarski, UW-Milwaukee  Geometric Topology:  Jim Fowler, Ohio State Kevin Schreve, University of Michigan Carrie Tirel, UW-Fox Valley   Set-Theoretic Topology:  Alan Dow, UNC-Charlotte Gary Gruenhage, Auburn Paul Szeptycki, York  Plenary &amp; Semi-Plenary Speakers:  The plenary and semi-plenary speakers gave talks of 50 minutes and 30 minutes respectively.  Several women and young people were included in this list of key-note speakers.  The following people gave these talks:  Hannah Alpert, M.I.T.  Grigori Avramidi, Ohio State  Stewart Baldwin, Auburn  Igor Belegradek, Georgia Tech  Jan Boronski, National Supercomputing Center, Ostrava  Matthew Day, University of Arkansas  Jeffrey Diller, Notre Dame University  Chuck Hagopian, CSU-Sacramento  Logan Hoehn, Nipissing University  W.T. Ingram, Missouri University of Science and Technology  Judy Kennedy, Lamar  Olga Lukina, University of Illinois, Chicago  Ana Mamatelashvili, Auburn  David Milovich, Texas A&amp;M International  Piotr Oprocha, AGH University of Science and Technology  Yinhe Peng, University of Toronto  Rodrigo Perez, Indiana University &ndash; Purdue University Indianapolis  Tam Nguyen Phan, Binghamton University  Tim Riley, Cornell  Kim Ruane, Tufts  Alex Shibakov, Tennessee Tech University  Local Support  Baylor University provided generous support for the conference.  The office of the Vice Provost for Research paid for the hotel shuttles.  The Dean of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences Office paid for all of the coffee and conference breakfast and afternoon catering, and the Department of Mathematics paid for all of the printing services.  The total of this support was over $10,000.  Impact  Besides the research announcements made at the conference,  the outcomes of a major conference like the STDC is primarily that which the NSF would qualify as "Broader Impact," as is apparent from the description above.   For many graduate students, this conference was their first experience attending a conference and presenting a paper.  Many participants came from small colleges without extensive NSF support, and this conference is the only support granted to their research.    Overall the conference was quite successful as a major research conference, as an educational outreach via the workshops, and as a venue for increasing participation in mathematics to under-represented groups.
