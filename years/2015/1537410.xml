<AbstractNarration>Membrane-based materials possess fluid compartments separated by thin bilayer membranes.  These membranes are capable of mimicking cell membranes, and carefully arranged membrane networks have been considered for use in engineering applications ranging from hearing aids to actuators.  This award supports fundamental research on the ability of the membrane to convert mechanical force into meaningful outcomes such as energy conversion and controlled diffusion through the material network.  The goal of this work is the advancement of a low-cost material that is simple to assemble while still useful for industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to renewable energy.  The research is highly interdisciplinary, combining mechanical, electrical, biological, and chemical engineering.  Results from this award will be used to promote interdisciplinary research projects and to develop open-source educational tools and predictive modeling software. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is evidence that these membrane-based materials may be activated and controlled by mechanotransduction, harnessing the unique emulsive elasticity of the material.  The multiphysics interactions between applied mechanical force and the response of the internal membranes are not well characterized, requiring new models and experiments for their study.  This hypothesized link between material deformation and membrane activity is investigated in detail through this award, creating mechanical models linking the deformation of the bulk material to subsequent deformations of the internal membranes.  This task is accomplished through coupled experimental and theoretical work.  First, large networks of the membrane-based material will be created.  Then these networks will be deformed through various methods including bulk displacement, magnetic forces, osmotic shocks, and high-frequency vibration.  Each of these methods for material excitation produces different responses in the interfacial membranes, and will allow for the determination of parameters such as the bulk modulus, stiffness, and damping of the material components.  These values will be used to populate models for the material deformation, wherein the material will be simulated as collections of fixed-volume compartments with variable surface elements and contours, examining the dynamic changes in material morphology.  This project is designed to address the gaps in current models for the mechanical deformation of the material, and will illustrate the necessary parameters for meaningful mechanotransduction in membrane-based materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bioinspired research recognizes that nature contains many elegant solutions to complex engineering problems.  A common foundation for these natural solutions is the use of a hierarchical cellular structure in which individual building blocks are woven together to provide the desired emergent properties or capabilities.  Therefore, reproducing these features with an approach inspired by cellular mechanics will offer new advances in bioinspired materials.  This is accomplished here through a bottom-up approach to synthetic biology, creating webs of biological membranes to govern transport and exchange within a synthetic tissue. These synthetic tissues are created through aqueous droplets dispersed in an oil reservoir with dissolved phospholipids, forming adhesive bridges between the droplets that may be functionalized with biomolecules to replicate the capabilities of biological membranes.  The goal of the project was to examine how the mechanics of the droplets were linked to the properties of the interfacial membranes.  The majority of existing works focus primarily on modeling the membranes as electrical elements without considering the contributions from the surrounding droplets, resulting in static synthetic tissues.  However, this project recognized that it is possible to tune or modify the properties of the lipid membranes by deforming the droplets themselves, regulating the properties of the membranes through mechanical force.  The outcomes of this project include, in chronological order, the 1) development of ferrofluid-enabled droplet interface bilayer networks for contact-free mechanical manipulation, 2) the development of a droplet printer for creating heterogenous synthetic tissues containing adhered magnetic and non-magnetic droplets, 3) development of a model demonstrating how magnetic fields may be combined with the printed tissues to promote dynamic reconfiguration and changes in the membrane architecture, and 4) the development of new methods for enabling the formation of transport pathways dependent on relative droplet locations.  In brief, the project successfully demonstrated mechanical activation of droplet-based materials through a combination of experimental and computational tasks.  The intellectual merit of this project includes the 1) development of new models coupling mechanical and electrical phenomena for predicting the behavior of the synthetic tissues as well as 2) investigating the potential for magnetic manipulation of droplets through ferrofluids. These tasks were accomplished through a combination of experimental and computational work.  The broader impacts of this project include the 1) development of new techniques and methodologies that may be applied towards bioinspired materials and brain-inspired physical computation as well as 2) the training of graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students in interdisciplinary research.
