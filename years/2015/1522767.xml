<AbstractNarration>A wide variety of systems exhibit rare events -- events far from the average system behavior with low probability of occurring.  Rare events can have significant consequences, and improved understanding of their occurrence can aid in the design or management of such systems. The characterization of the likelihood of rare events is essential in all systems in which stochasticity plays an important role, as it allows us to take advantage of such events if they are desirable and to avoid them if they present a threat. The outcomes of this project will contribute to the understanding of rare events in complex systems, in particular, fluid dynamics and related geophysical systems. Further applications include the characterization of extreme events in the context of epidemics, population dynamics, and molecular biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop efficient computational methods to characterize the most likely way rare events occur in complex stochastic systems and to estimate the tails of their probability distributions. For this purpose, the investigators will develop efficient algorithms to compute the so-called "instantons" that are minimizers of the action functional that large deviation theory associates with the stochastic differential equation describing the system's evolution. Numerical methods to calculate instantons will first be developed in the context of turbulence (in particular Burgers equation, magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD), Navier-Stokes equations, and the surface-quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation) driven by diffusive processes. Then the investigators will extend the methods to stochastic equations that are driven by non-Markovian noise (fractional Brownian motion) or jump-processes, which play an important role in physics, biology, and chemistry. Finally, the investigators will calculate fluctuations around the instantons to get finer estimates of their probability of occurrence via prefactor calculations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rare events often have a drastic impact despite their low frequency of occurrence. Examples include hurricanes, financial crises, heat waves, or tsunamis that are few and far between but have devastating consequences. Other important phenomena such as phase transitions, chemical reactions, or conformational changes of biomolecules also involve rare events.

In this project, we investigated methods to solve the large deviation optimization problem, and applied them to a variety of systems arising in different fields.   One example was the life-cycle of a model of bacterial colonies. Accounting for the inherent fluctuations in the system's evolution,  we found that colonies can have a distinct life-cycle in which a rising global population causes a dense bacterial colony to form, which then declines by local cell death, before dispersing to re-initiate the cycle. These results, which hint at some aspects of the biofilm-planktonic life cycle, were explained using the tools from large deviation theory mentioned above.   Another example was that of rogue waves, that is, waves of extreme height that appear suddenly on the surface of the ocean and can be serious threat to boats and other naval structures.
