<AbstractNarration>This workshop project aims to create the Early Career Faculty Travel Grant Program for the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE). The overall intent is to increase the numbers of underrepresented minorities who successfully pursue engineering academic careers.  Support will be provided to early career faculty, post-doctoral scholars, and senior level graduate students to participate in the Annual National Society of Black Engineers Convention.  It is intended that participation in various workshops sponsored by NSBE will enhance the professional success of these individuals.  Additionally, the creation of a pool of underrepresented minorities who form a collaborative and supportive community and provide mentoring to each other and to other doctoral and post-doctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity enables education and mentoring of early career African American faculty and provides them with opportunities for professional development. They participate in the NSBE Annual Convention activities that will support their future success in research funding and other scholarly activities.  These include the Technical Professional Conference and Graduate Student Mini-Conference, which conduct workshops on professional development, leadership development, and entrepreneurship, as well interactions with industry attendees.  Through the engagement in the convention participants are developing supportive personal and professional relationships with other African American engineering faculty. A mixed methods evaluation plan that uses surveys and focus groups measures the level of success the program had in increasing self-esteem and the intent to persist within academia as well as identify how participants intend to utilize the information they have received to better themselves and aid the next generation of academic researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Early-Career Faculty Travel Grant  (ECFTG) program granted funds to faculty teaching three years or less, post-doctoral scholars, and senior level graduate students to participate in the 41st and 42nd Annual National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) Convention. They participated in sessions developed by the Academic and Research Leadership Network (ARLN) Symposium which is co-located with the NSBE conference. The mission of ARLN is to prepare minority engineers in academia, industry, and government whose careers focus on research for leadership and success . The ECFTG participants also engaged in a mixture of activities from NSBE's Graduate School and Professional sessions as well as multiple networking opportunities.  The goal of the ECFTG was to positively impact the nation's welfare by increasing the ranks of underrepresented minorities in the academy.  Activities were designed to build the professional success of early-career African-American engineering faculty by:  Providing resources for development of scholarship, publications, and conference presentations; improving classroom teaching; providing mentoring; bolstering self-esteem; providing professional development for research projects; serving as role models for the next generation of African-American scholars; and developing professional relationships.  It was anticipated that the broader impacts of the ECFTG program would include the creation of a diverse pool of early-career faculty for universities and for government and industrial laboratories; for funding agencies to diversify their review panels; to develop content for and teach workshops that are critical to the success of the current NSBE graduate school conference(GSC); to introduce ideas for increasing minority interest in the Ph.D in ways not currently possible; and to be role models for the built-in convention audience of emerging African-American engineers.  Fourteen ECFTG recipients attended the NSBE/Academic and Research Leadership Symposium (ARLS) in 2015 and 17 participated in 2016. A different independent evaluator was engaged to survey the participants of each conference.  Data was drawn from two major sources: rosters of workshop attendees and a survey sent via email after the conference.  Respondents were asked to provide feedback on the usefulness of ECFTG's professional development opportunities on a scale of 1 to 5. Overall, no session had a mean lower than 3, indicating that the participants on the whole felt that the sessions were professionally beneficial.  Both evaluations found that the strongest impact of the ECFTG program was on improving the performance, skills, and attitudes of participants in research and teaching. The most significant benefit was expansion of informal professional networks among African-American engineering professionals.  In 2015, ECFTG was most influential for participant's teaching, mentoring, outreach, and dissemination activities. Participants gave the highest ratings to the following outcomes: Gaining insights as early-career faculty, receiving mentoring, increased self-esteem, sharing insights with the professional community, and developing professional relationships.  In 2016, the program was most impactful through the development of informal professional networks, research skills, and scholarship.  2016 attendees rated the following outcomes most highly: Developing professional relationships, developing as a scholar, gaining insights as early-career faculty, acting as a role model for the next generation of African-American scholars and receiving mentoring.  When 2015 and 2016 ECFTG recipients were asked why they would recommend that others attend the NSBE/ARLS conferences, the opportunity to network was the most consistent response. Participants saw the conferences as a unique way to meet other early-career faculty, and to connect with more seasoned veterans of academia. In open-ended comments, they said that they received good advice about teaching...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
