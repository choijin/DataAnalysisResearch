<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to identify the reasons why microorganisms can live where they live. The focus is on identifying livable conditions in the environment, with the goal of explaining how temperatures and geochemical compositions combine to allow and support microbial life. Two things have to be true for an environment to be habitable: there have to be sources of energy, and those sources of energy have to persist long enough for life to take advantage of them. Things that burst into flame are not good to eat. Habitability can be quantified by combining methods to calculate the amounts of chemical energy available to microbes with measurements of the rates that resulting reactions happen with and without microbes present. The importance of this approach is that it can be used in diverse environments from soils to deep in the Earth's crust, allowing an expansion of scientific understanding of how our planet supports life, and even in biological systems including the human gut where there could be surprising applications to improve human health. In this study, environments that support microbes that use iron reactions as their source of energy will be studied including hot springs, acid mine drainage, and cold springs fed by snowmelt. By examining the same processes across diverse environments, this case study of the microbial iron cycle will serve as a template for future studies of other chemical energy sources. Ultimately these efforts will allow researchers to explain underlying reasons for the immense microbial diversity found on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two things have to be true for microbes to gain chemical energy from the environment. First, there must be a source of energy. This requires the presence of compounds in differing oxidation states that are out of thermodynamic equilibrium with one another. Second, there must be mechanistic difficulties that are keeping those compounds from reacting, which means that the chemical energy cannot dissipate by itself. Using this energetic reference frame, geochemical habitability can be defined and quantified by the combined presence of thermodynamic and kinetic limitations at diverse environments on and in the Earth. As an example, microorganisms across the phylogenetic tree of life gain energy by reacting dissolved reduced iron with oxygen in environments ranging in temperature from freezing to boiling and pH values between 2 and 7. However, not all combinations of pH and temperature are habitable. In high-pH environments this reaction occurs rapidly on its own, which prevents microorganisms from using it, and the pH where this kinetic barrier occurs decreases with increasing temperature. In acidic environments, however, the abiotic oxidation reaction rate is significantly slowed, allowing microorganisms to catalyze iron oxidation and conserve some of the energy released. However, increasing acidity lowers the energy yield, ultimately creating an energy boundary to habitability at the lowest values of pH. Combining such energetic and kinetic boundaries permits habitability to be mapped for individual reactions using geochemical variables that include pH, temperature, and concentrations of reactants and products of the reaction. It is a goal of this research to generate habitability maps for the case study of iron oxidation and reduction reactions. Geochemical data from fieldwork at hot springs, acid mine drainage, and cold springs fed by snowmelt will be used to calculate energy supplies. Field experiments of biotic and abiotic rates of iron oxidation and reduction will determine kinetic limitations. Complementary lab experiments will provide abiotic rates. Molecular analyses will reveal the microbes likely to be responsible for driving the biological iron redox cycle in these environments. The resulting multi-dimensional habitability maps for several iron oxidation and reduction reactions will provide a framework for future studies of many other chemolithotrophic metabolic process throughout surface and subsurface environments on Earth, which will quantitatively constrain the discussion of habitability on other planets.</AbstractNarration>
