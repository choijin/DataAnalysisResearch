<AbstractNarration>This award uses funds, under the auspices of the EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) program, for a project aimed at examining the causes and significance of perplexing inconsistencies in radiocarbon dates coming from 20,000 year old deep water sediments at the northeast Bermuda Rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deep, northeast Bermuda Rise is a classical location for study of climate over the last glacial cycle because of its high deposition rates and good preservation of foraminifera. Since it is also contains one of the deepest records of climate change and Bermuda Rise cores have been studied for over 30 years, it has become a standard reference section for climate history. Hence, getting the radiocarbon dating right is critical to calibrating time in this region and, perhaps, elsewhere if the inconsistencies in age dating are systemic and not simply local.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities fit well into the potentially transformative, high risk, and exploratory nature of the EAGER programs because it is hypothesized that results from this project will show that sediments on the seafloor can be "unmixed" by dating every sample. If this hypothesis is rejected, the resulting chronology will nevertheless be an improvement on the present situation, where important results are waiting for an improved age model before they can be published. If the hypothesis is accepted, however, the new chronology could inspire new research on this and other locations in the western North Atlantic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cores from the Bermuda Rise targeted for this project would be a valuable resource for future researchers as they will have internally consistent stratigraphies and chronologies and future proxies for ocean and climate change will be linked in a common temporal and sedimentological framework.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Radiocarbon dating is an essential tool for understanding the ocean?s role in climate change because, first, it provides a chronology based on the calcium carbonate shells of planktonic foraminifera.  Second, because radiocarbon dates on benthic foraminifera reflect the elapsed time since deep waters last exchanged with the atmosphere, it also provides a means of assessing the strength of the ocean?s overturning circulation.  That circulation, in turn, is an important control on Earth?s climate.  The deep, northeast Bermuda Rise is a classical location for study of climate over the last glacial cycle because of its high deposition rates and good preservation of foraminifera.  Because it is also contains one of the deepest records of climate change, and Bermuda Rise cores have been studied for over 30 years, it has become a standard reference section for climate history.  Recent work has pushed the limits of radiocarbon dating in Bermuda Rise cores to establish the timing of events on the century time scale.  This has involved dozens of radiocarbon dates over the approximately 20,000 years (20 ka) since the end of the last glaciation, and close sampling at key times in Earth history has revealed small but significant inconsistencies in the radiocarbon dates. As these inconsistencies are critical to understanding the interaction between ocean, terrestrial, and atmospheric climate, we made additional radiocarbon measurements to help distinguish signal from noise in the interval between about 13,000 to 14,500 years before present.  The new dates revealed an oscillation in radiocarbon ages that appears to be systematic, that is, not random "noise."  These data appear to reflect either a previously unrecognized change in the atmosphere radiocarbon activity, or a newly-resolved change in the age of Sargasso Sea surface waters.  Although we do not yet know the source of this change, we can now safely conclude that the onset of a circulation pattern in the deep western North Atlantic similar to today occurred about 1000 years later at 4.5 km (depth of Bermuda Rise) compared to shallower locations where the change happened at about 14,500 years before present.   Although it will be challenging to develop an accurate chronology for Bermuda Rise because of these complicated new result, we cannot improve on the situation until we have better records of atmospheric radiocarbon activity.  Until that time, the large body of work based on Bermuda Rise cores will be published using a conservative chronology based on the new data.  New Bermuda Rise cores collected in 2007 will be a valuable resource for future researchers and they will have internally consistent stratigraphies and chronologies.  Thus, existing and future proxies for ocean and climate change will all be linked in a common framework.        Last Modified: 08/22/2016       Submitted by: Lloyd D Keigwin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
