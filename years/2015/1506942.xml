<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B program and the Chemical Measurement &amp; Imaging program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Kazunori Koide of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh will develop new classes of chemical reagents with useful fluorescence properties.  The goal of this research is to exploit the characteristics of hydrogen peroxide and mercury for the development of fluorescence detection methods.  The project lies at the interface of organic, analytical, inorganic, and biological chemistry, and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels.  This group is also well-positioned to provide interdisciplinary education and training for undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.  Outreach activities involving freshman college students will be part of the project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, chemosensors that fluoresce when exposed to mercury or hydrogen peroxide will be developed. For mercury detection, the principal investigator proposes to exploit organic reactions catalyzed by mercury.  The catalytic systems will amplify fluorescence signals, yielding highly sensitive analytical methods.  The catalytic reactions include a sigmatropic rearrangement and a cyclization reaction, both of which will produce a fluorescent product from a nonfluorescent starting material upon exposure to mercury species. These methods will be applied to the analyses of wastewater from coal-fired power plants.  Mercury will be quantified below 0.1 ppb levels.  For hydrogen peroxide detection and quantification, a [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement mediated by hydrogen peroxide, which creates a green fluorescent dye from a nonfluorescent precursor, will be used. The objective is to develop new probes for detecting and quantifying hydrogen peroxide in living human cells. Toward this objective, nonfluorescent rearrangement substrates will be made.  When the substrates react with hydrogen peroxide and the rearrangement occurs, a green fluorescent fluorescein derivative will be produced.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merits: The palladium-catalyzed Tsuji&ndash;Trost reaction has been extensively studied under synthetically relevant conditions. Despite the increasing use of the Tsuji&ndash;Trost reaction in other areas (e.g., chemical biology), the paucity of kinetic studies at micromolar concentrations of substrates in water has impeded progress. We found that a fluorescence-based high-throughput method provided massive Eyring plot data and revealed three kinetic regimes. The associated turnover-limiting steps (TLSs) were assigned as the oxidative addition (regime 1; &Delta;H&#10727; &gt; 0), nucleophilic attack (regime 2; &Delta;H&#10727; &asymp; 0), and association (regime 3; &Delta;H&#10727; &lt; 0, inverse temperature dependence). A kinetic profile under particular conditions depended on the substrate concentration and reaction temperature.     Chemists frequently encounter problems associated with trace palladium in synthetic samples because palladium is widely used in synthetic organic chemistry. We previously reported a colorimetric method for trace palladium quantification, the only high-throughput method implemented in the pharmaceutical industry. However, slight changes from the published reaction conditions have caused reproducibility problems, with little understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms. In the current study, we took a combinatorial approach to investigate the method and found that excess NaOH was a culprit for the lack of reproducibility. We changed the reaction conditions and procedure accordingly, which substantially improved reproducibility. The reaction under current conditions followed Michaelis&ndash;Menten kinetics, allowing for predicting reaction rates on the basis of the substrate concentrations.     Broader impacts: (1) We have published the discoveries not only in peer-reviewed journals but also in Twitter and ChemRxiv to make the findings more accessible to the general public. (2) The PI has coordinated the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program for female and under-representative minority undergraduate students to promote STEM research. (3) The PI served as a poster judge at the Undergraduate Research Symposium at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. (4) The PI has served as a reviewer for many peer-reviewed journals.            Last Modified: 08/29/2020       Submitted by: Kazunori Koide]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
