<AbstractNarration>Diabetes is a global and national epidemic. One in ten healthcare dollars in the U.S. is spent on costs directly attributable to diabetes. Persons with Type-1 diabetes, especially children and the elderly, can experience sudden drops in blood sugar, that is, they can become hypoglycemic. This can be very dangerous if it remains unrecognized. The metabolic processes that lead to hypoglycemia generate odorants in human breath and perspiration. The specific odorants are not known by the medical community, but trained diabetes alert dogs can recognize the onset of hypoglycemia from odorants in a patient's breath. This award supports the basic research to identify the odorants of hypoglycemia in human breath and the development of a noninvasive hand-held smart sensor able to detect the odorants and communicate health information to patients, caregivers, and family members. Development of the smart device will improve health-monitoring options for persons with Type-1 diabetes, ultimately leading to decreased healthcare costs and improved lifestyles for the patients and their caregivers. This research will provide interdisciplinary research experiences to graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, this project will support participation of underrepresented groups and educational outreach programs for K-12 students and teachers across Indiana and the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The metabolic processes that lead to hypoglycemia cause the production of specific volatile organic compounds in human breath. This fact is not currently used by the medical community to monitor diabetes or track the onset of hypoglycemia. However, trained diabetes alert dogs are able to identify these compounds and recognize the onset of hypoglycemia. Following this, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel smart device able to detect the volatile organic compound profile in human breath that correlates with hypoglycemia. This will be accomplished in three steps. First, the identification of the hypoglycemic-signature breath profile, which will be validated by testing with diabetes alert dogs. Second, the development of a nanosensor array capable of detecting the identified compounds. Third, the incorporation of the nanosensor array into a portable smart device. The monitoring of volatile organic compounds in breath challenges the existing way of thinking that glucose is the only useful metabolic marker of hypoglycemia. This work will also aid researchers in understanding metabolic pathways associated with hypoglycemia. Moreover, the intuitive and secure mobile application interface that will be developed will effectively communicate relevant healthcare information.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Hypoglycemia occurs when a person's blood sugar is below the healthy range, and is most common in persons with type1 or type 2 diabetes that take insulin to treat their diabetes. Hypoglycemia, if not detected and treated quickly, can lead to serious complications. One way some people detect their hypoglycemia is by using Diabetes Alert Dogs. This project was inspired by canines' ability to detect hypoglycemia, which they do through their sense of smell. This is different than all current methods, which measure glucose levels in blood or other biological fluids. Using scents (volatile organic compounds, VOCs) is noninvasive, so there is no need to take samples from blood or other fluids. Another advantage is that while the prototype was designed for the user to breathe into it, future plans are to develop a truly passive air-sampling sensor that could be used with infants, elderly, and in hospital rooms as an early warning system. This project at Indiana University-Purdue University&nbsp; Indianapolis (IUPUI) proposed to accomplish three aims: identify changes in VOCs in human breath that can detect or predict hypoglycemia; develop an array of chemiresistive sensor elements to detect VOCs of hypoglycemia; and build a portable breathalyzer prototype linked to a smartphone app, in order to identify hypoglycemia in a breath sample.</p> <p>The first aim was accomplished by collecting breath samples at a summer camp for children with type 1 diabetes, and from adults who underwent a hyperinsulinemic clamp procedure where the subjects' blood glucose levels were slowly lowered to hypoglycemic levels and then returned to normal. Breath samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and machine learning to discover a panel of VOCs that could classify hypoglycemic from normal samples. Researchers achieved 95% accuracy predicting hypo in a training data set, and over 90% accuracy in a different, testing data set. The identified panel of VOCs was the basis for designing and testing sensor array elements. Another finding from the clamp study was that VOCs became dysregulated before the patients' glucose levels registered hypoglycemic. This means that a breath sensor can potentially predict hypoglycemia sooner than systems that monitor blood glucose levels.</p> <p>For the second aim, the group developed and tested sensor array elements (sensors) that work by trapping different VOCs in breath on the sensing layer for a short time. The sensors are conductive polymer composites coated on interdigitated electrodes (Figure 1). When VOCs interact with the sensing layer, the resistance of the circuit changes according to the concentration and type of VOCs. The sensors that were designed and built are selective, reproducible, stable for up to 36 days and have an excellent range of detection for VOCs in human breath. &nbsp;In the third aim, sensor elements (array) were integrated into a prototype breathalyzer. The signals from the array are then correlated with a hypo signature. The results are then transmitted to a Hypo Alert App, programmed for a smartphone or device, by Bluetooth. This Hypo Alert App has the capabilities to inform the patient and their caregivers if the patient is hypoglycemic, approaching hypoglycemic, or normal.</p> <p>The project impacted a broad community of students and researchers. The hands-on sensor fabrication process was implemented in a lab setting with high school students and teachers as part of an NSF-ITEST summer program at IUPUI (100 students and 30 teachers participated over three years). NSF-ITEST program at IUPUI is a two-week long educational summer camp that draws participants (primarily from underrepresented groups and those from high needs metropolitan high schools) to engage in a program that introduces nanotechnology concepts and applications through learning by doing in an effort to boost STEM interest.
