<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator will explore questions in characteristic p &gt; 0 algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.  Explicitly, he proposes to apply methods of commutative algebra to study adjoint line bundles in characteristic p &gt; 0, especially to produce global sections.  Such line bundles are crucial when classifying the central objects of algebraic geometry.  Over the complex numbers, the standard techniques to study adjoint line bundles include Kodaira-type vanishing theorems.  These theorems are unavailable in characteristic p &gt; 0, thus methods of the Frobenius morphism and test ideals from commutative algebra will be employed instead.  The PI also proposes to use methods of algebraic geometry to study questions related to singularities in commutative algebra.  The Principal Investigator will also run several mathematics camps for high school students.  He will employ students to help develop software related to test ideals and singularities in characteristic p &gt; 0.  Finally he will continue to organize conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry is a very active field of mathematics.  Explicitly, it is the study of geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) made up of the solutions to polynomial equations (for example, the parabola is the solution to y = x^2). Characteristic p &gt; 0 algebraic geometry is the study of these equations and their solutions when the underlying rules of arithmetic have changed.  For example, instead of simply 4 + 4 = 8, in characteristic p = 5, once we get to 5 we start counting at 1 again so that 4 + 4 = 3 (like counting hours of a clock). This type of arithmetic and related algebra and geometry is heavily employed in modern cryptography and coding theory.  The running of camps, conferences and the development of software will also help train the next generation of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Principal Investigator (PI) Karl Schwede studied areas of mathematics.  Intellectual Merit.  Specifically, the PI studied the subjects of Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra. Algebraic Geometry is the study geometric shapes defined by algebraic equations like y = x^2 which describes the parabola. Commutative Algebra is the study of algebraic properties of functions, frequently on those geometric objects.    Within these areas, the PI worked extensively on what is called positive characteristic (as opposed to the classical theory of geometry, sometimes called characteristic zero). Positive characteristic is a world where there are different types of arithmetic; for example, clock arithmetic is such an example where 5 + 10 = 3 because 5 hours after 10:00 is 3:00. This arithmetic leads to a new theory of geometry and algebra both distinct but inspired by the more classical familiar theories. These sorts of theories are important in modern secure communication technologies.  The PI wrote numerous papers on algebra and geometry in the positive characteristic setting, frequently inspired by the classical characteristic zero world.  On the other hand, the PIs work in the positive characteristic setting has inspired some of his other work in the classical setting.  The PI, with Linquan Ma, also studied mixed characteristic which can be viewed as a bridge between the classical world of algebra and geometry and the positive characteristic world.
