<AbstractNarration>Throughout history, scholars have contemplated the origins of language. In 460 BCE, Herodotus reported that two children, isolated from language and raised in a cabin, began to speak Phrygian. His conclusion was that Phrygian must be the first human language. In modern linguistics, the idea of an innate Universal Grammar that is hardwired in the human brain has had a major impact on the field. If the Forbidden Experiment, as described by Herodotus, were performed now, what might we learn about the origins of language or about language universals? What structures would emerge as resilient properties of human communication that require little or no input? We cannot perform this experiment, but we can look to situations in which children are deprived of natural language. Deaf children with no access to spoken or signed language often develop 'home sign systems'. By documenting these systems we gain a unique perspective on processes of language development and language genesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subjects of this research are two adult home signers living in separate Máíjùnà villages in Peruvian Amazonia. RCM is 30 years old; ST is 65. Neither has ever been exposed to a conventional sign language. Nevertheless, these two men communicate with those around them through gestures and signs. This research project investigates the grammatical structures present in their home sign systems and how those systems compare to one another. The PIs explore the question of whether attitudes toward deafness and sign language have allowed more complex features to develop in these two home sign systems than in previously reported home sign systems. Primary research goals are to establish the level of conventionalization that has taken place within the home sign systems of RCM and ST, to identify any linguistic relationship between their two systems, and to probe the degree to which hearing community members adhere to their systems of communication.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When deaf children are born into non-signing communities, they develop what is called a "homesign" system. This is a gestural system of communication that arises through interaction with the hearing people in the community. Under the right circumstances, homesign systems can develop linguistic features such as consistent word order, hierarchical structure and a stable lexicon.  The goal of this study was to document the sign system used by members of the Maijiki community, an indigenous group in the Peruvian Amazon. Of particular interest was how the structure of the community and the interactions between deaf and hearing people affected the emergence of the sign system.   Two deaf Maijuna men, who have never lived in the same village and who are over 30 years apart in age, use the sign system as their primary communication system. Yet the signing of these men, and of the hearing people in their communities, exhibits many commonalities. The aim of this work is not just to identify what linguistic properties have arisen in this homesign system, but also to understand how the system has been shaped by the community in which it emerged. To this end, the signers, both hearing and deaf, were considered as belonging to a homesigning "speech community". I then asked: How does this community function? And how do the interactions within this community facilitate or contribute to the development of the homesign system?  The sign system used in the Maijuna communities differs from the prototypical definition of a homesign system. The deaf population is small (2 individuals, 3 in recent memory) and dispersed. Nonetheless, the time-depth of the sign system is approximately 65-years and there is evidence that RCM, the younger deaf signer, may have acquired lexical items that originated with ST, the older deaf signer, despite RCM and ST never having lived in the same village.  The grammatical analysis described the strategies used by RCM and several hearing signers to mark argument structure. I found that hearing signers relied more on word order than RCM did. All the hearing signers were highly consistent with each other and, contrary to expectations, were more consistent in their production of word order than RCM was.
