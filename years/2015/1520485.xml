<AbstractNarration>The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be to enable the biochemical conversion of sugars into fatty acids that can be used to make fuels such as biodiesel. Xylome Corporation is using biotechnology to engineer a yeast platform that will produce fatty oils. This will facilitate conversion of existing biofuel and biomass byproduct streams into useful commercial fatty acids while reducing processing costs. The production of fatty acids will facilitate production of the initial downstream target which is biodiesel, but longer term, the technology could enhance production of higher value second-generation biofuels.  Xylome?s proposed technology could produce approximately 1.2 million gallons of biodiesel/yr. worth about $4 million from the byproducts of a single 70 million gallon ethanol plant. Beyond sugars from byproduct streams of existing ethanol plants,  Xylome?s technology platform could facilitate fatty acid production from cellulosic and hemicellulosic sugars serving as a feedstock for cellulosic biofuel production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first objective of this Phase I research project is to enable lipid production during growth. The second will be to relieve cellular capacity constraints. The project will alter regulation of genes that limit production and introduce pathways that expand capacity. Yeasts, and fungi synthesize lipid when given excess carbon and limiting nitrogen, but low levels of lipid synthesis occurs during cell growth. Normally lipid only accumulates in cellular vacuoles after cell division has stopped. This requires extended cultivation times, and the amount of lipid that can be formed is constrained by the cell volume. The proposed approach will overexpress the enzymes for lipid synthesis so that the engineered cells will produce oil during growth while maintaining high levels of metabolic activity. New pathways will be introduced along with processes that will enable continuous lipid recovery. These modifications should enable a) lipid production in continuous high-density culture, thereby overcoming inherent low rates of lipid synthesis, and b) continuous separation of lipid, thereby alleviating the need for cell harvest, rupture and extraction.</AbstractNarration>

By unlocking the biological potential of nontraditional yeast species, Xylome aims to develop environmentally friendly biofuels and chemicals. Nontraditional lipid generating yeasts are distant cousins of the more familiar beer/bread/wine-making variety, and although they are much less studied, lipogenic yeasts have unusual abilities that make them very attractive for industrial development. Xylome is conducting basic research into their genetics, biochemistry and metabolic regulation to increase their capacities for lipid synthesis. Xylome&rsquo;s vision is to genetically modify these novel yeasts so they will consume widely available agricultural waste products, thereby converting them into new sources of sustainable energy.</p> <p>The metabolic pathways for lipid synthesis can operate very efficiently, as many of us know, but the factors regulating synthesis are not well understood from biochemical and genetic perspectives. Xylome&rsquo;s research is identifying key metabolic steps in lipid synthesis and generating basic knowledge about which are most critical in determining lipid accumulation. By changing the genes that control enzyme levels and protein structures, lipid biosynthesis can be regulated.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>In the U.S. alone, there are currently more than 200 ethanol-manufacturing plants that collectively produce about 14 billion gallons of ethanol per year from domestically grown corn supplies.&nbsp; They are also creating millions of tons of fiber and dissolved organics as low-value byproducts. This industry exists in a challenging economic environment, where narrow profit margins are constantly vulnerable to drought and market forces that can drive grain prices up and fuel prices down. Xylome is alleviating these factors by developing novel yeast biotechnology to make America&rsquo;s ethanol producers more profitable, efficient, and competitive. Xylome&rsquo;s yeasts are capable of consuming low value byproduct streams from the grain ethanol industry and converting them into yeast oil suitable for biodiesel or other higher value applications.&nbsp; Yeast oil from waste organics can be used to create clean burning and environmentally friendly fuel or lubricants.</p> <p>Through the support of a National Science Foundation SBIR Phase 1 grant, Xylome has engineered our non-conventional yeasts to produce large quantities of oils from the organic byproducts of the ethanol industry.&nbsp; Significantly, North American ethanol plants produce more than 65 billion pounds of such organic residues that could be used as the feedstock for our system. Xylome&rsquo;s research team has successfully developed state-of-the-art genetic tools for our yeasts, which have enabled us to increase the expression of key genes for yeast oil synthesis. Our most important accomplishment has been determining which genes are required to enhance oil production, and we have demonstrated that increasing the expression of these critical genes can greatly improve the production rate and total oil accumulation. Our best performing yeast strains can now make twice as much oil as the naturally occurring strains when cultivated on waste organic byproducts from ethanol manufacture. We have also begun to demonstrate commercial feasibility of by testing our strains on a larger scale, and validating our results. &nbsp;</p> <p>Xylome&rsquo;s yeast oil has great potential for becoming a new feedstock for renewable fuels and chemicals. Biodiesel is currently produced mainly from vegetable oils such as soy, corn, and palm, each of which could be put to better use as food for human consumption. Unlike these sources, Xylome&rsquo;s yeast oil is produced from existing agricultural wastes, and does not require any additional land use or competition with food supplies. Moreover, yeast oil has a much higher energy density than ethanol and could be more compatible for transportation or aviation fuel.</p> <p>If universally adopted, Xylome estimates that its technology could potentially generate at least 1 billion gallons of biodiesel per year from existing ethanol byproducts. This process could also create thousands of new permanent private sector jobs. Xylome&rsquo;s fermentation technology could enable the domestic ethanol industry to reduce operational costs, improve sustainably, and contribute to lower-carbon emission solutions. These results are our first steps towards completing our mission to unlock the full potential of renewable, economical, and clean-burning biofuels.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/09/2016<br>      Modified by: Thomas&nbsp;W&nbsp;Jeffries</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1520485/1520485_10368609_1470765016732_Groupshot--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1520485/1520485_10368609_1470765016732_Groupshot--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Xylome team"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1520485/1520485_10368609_1470765016732_Groupshot--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Xylome team"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Chris Calvey, Terese Nelson, David Mokry, Tom Jeffries and Tom Kelleher make up Xylome's close-knit research team in their laboratories at the University of Wisconsin Research Park in Madison.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Thomas Kelleher</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Thomas&nbsp;W&nbsp;Jeffries</div> <div class="imageTitle">Xylome team</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1520485/1520485_10368609_1470764288369_TereseNelson--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1520485/1520485_10368609_1470764288369_TereseNelson--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Terese Nelson"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1520485/1520485_10368609_1470764288369_TereseNelson--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Terese Nelson"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Terese Nelson is a mainstay for the team by making media, transferring cultures, ordering supplies and keeping the lab functional.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Thomas Kelleher</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Thomas&nbsp;W&nbsp;Jeffries</div> <div class="imageTitle">Terese Nelson</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1520485/1520485_10368609_1470764500028_David--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1520485/1520485_10368609_1470764500028_David--rgov-800width.jpg" title="David Mokry"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1520485/1520485_10368609_1470764500028_David--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="David Mokry"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">David Mokry and Chris Calvey are Xylome's lead yeast molecular biologists.
