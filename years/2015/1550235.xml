<AbstractNarration>The goals of this four-day workshop on the Neurobiology of Stress are to bring together researchers from diverse disciplines and at all professional levels (undergraduate student to full professor) to share and discuss recent advances in the neurobiology of stress research, promote intensive exchange of ideas across disciplines, foster community among stress researchers, and nurture professional development for trainees and junior faculty participants. This workshop, which takes place in Newport Beach, CA, is the 4th of a biannual workshop series that offers the only small forum focused on the neurobiology of stress. The award provides support to junior faculty, trainees, and high school science teachers to attend this workshop.  The intellectual merit of the workshop derives from its relatively small size, which promotes interactions and extensive exchange of ideas among participants, the assembly of top neuroscientists in the field of stress, and the multidisciplinary nature of the plenary session topics. With a substantial fraction of the speakers being women and about half of the participants being trainees, including trainees recruited through national minority scientist networks, this workshop reaches out to and offers opportunities for groups underrepresented in science.  The inclusion of local science high school teachers in this workshop seeds dissemination of insights in classrooms.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics of this workshop on the Neurobiology of Stress range from epigenetics and stress to evolutionary perspectives on stress, and incorporate recent advances in molecular biology, genetics, microbiotics, imaging, and systems biology.  The format entails 5 plenary sessions with 4 speakers each; 2 roundtable sessions, one of which is dedicated to mentoring of trainees in small informal groups; poster sessions (trainee presenters only); and one keynote lecture. Workshop participants will be invited to contribute manuscripts reporting findings related to workshop topics to the open access journal Neurobiology of Stress.  The broader impacts of this workshop include broadening participation, extensive opportunity for exchange across professional levels, and public outreach to the local schools.  These aspects, combined with the workshop's central goal of exchanging and advancing promising new ideas in stress research, constitute long-term benefits for the larger stress neurobiology community.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A three day Workshop on the Neurobiology of Stress was held April 12-April 15, 2016 at Irvine, CA. The Workshop brought together 154 individuals, most of whom were researchers that study stress-brain interactions and the basic neurobiology of these interactions. The meeting attracted a balanced representation of women (57%) and men, with broad geographical US representation (participants from 22 different states) and a significant international presence (participants from 10 different countries). The Workshop provided a unique scientific forum where new advances relevant to the study of stress neurobiology were critically evaluated and integrated into the collective knowledge and perspectives of active basic stress researchers. Scientific sessions included presentation and discussion of new developments in the understanding of the neurosystems, neurochemistry, epigenetics and systems biology that supports stress responses and stress adaptation (Workshop program and abstracts publicly available at: <a href="http://www.stress2016.org">http://www.stress2016.org</a>). Review articles based on Workshop content will be published in two scientific journals (Neurobiology of Stress; and Stress: The International Journal on the Biology of Stress). A central component of the Workshop was the fostering of the scientific and professional development of trainees in STEM disciplines who have an interest in stress neurobiology.
