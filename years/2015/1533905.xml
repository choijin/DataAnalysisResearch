<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate a computer aided design (CAD) framework that can be used for verification and reliability analysis of hybrid bio-silicon circuits used for designing biosensors. It is envisioned that similar to integrated circuit (IC) CAD design tools, the same framework will be useful in biosensor system optimization and in the discovery of new sensing modalities that combine proteins and silicon circuits at a system level. Similar to an IC design-flow, the proposed simulation and analysis framework will be used to verify the functionality and reliability of biosensor systems before undertaking laborious fabrication and experimental procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With advances in micro-nano-fabrication, the emerging biosensors can integrate an ever increasing number of detection elements on the same device. This has opened the possibility that perhaps exploiting spatial redundancies across multiple detection experiments could be used to alleviate the effects of biosensor artifacts using forward error-correcting techniques. However, the full potential of this technique in biosensing methods can only be achieved on high-density arrays that can potentially integrate millions of protein-based circuits. The proposed research would serve as a simulation and analysis framework to verify the functionality and reliability of these high-density assays before undertaking painstaking fabrication and experimental procedures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an outreach component of this proposal, the PI plans to make software tools and the library of protein-based circuit models publicly available through a webportal. The users will be able to modify the software and integrate the modules with other circuit simulation tools. From the perspective of a computer scientist or a VLSI researcher the software could serve as a useful tool for explorations in the area of hybrid bio-silicon circuits without resorting to time-consuming laboratory experiments. The PI is also strongly committed to the training of women, underrepresented and K-12 students. Different outreach programs which are available at Michigan State University be used to recruit students to participate in the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project investigated a computer aided design (CAD) framework called&nbsp; FAST (Factor-graph based Analysis of Stochastic circuiTs) that can be used for functional verification of large hybrid bio-silicon circuits, combining proteins, silicon circuits and non-silicon substrates. The intellectual merits of this project involved mathematical modeling of a generic biosensor based on combinatorial affinity probes, modeling of biosensor channel artifacts and noise, and the saturation properties of the receptor probes. Using the models, the FAST framework was then used to investigate the fundamental limits of biosensor error-correction. Our modeling study has shown that using receptor probes with specific combinatorial properties can significantly improve the system capacity by facilitating joint detection of multiple analytes. This is in contrast to the conventional wisdom prevalent in the design of proteomic assays where the receptors are synthesized to be target specific with minimal levels of cross-reactivity with non-specific targets. It is envisioned that the availability of capacity bounds will provide a more systematic approach for designing the receptors (antibodies, aptamers or enzymes) since their binding properties can be optimized to maximize the assay throughput. To validate the FAST framework, we designed and fabricated different variants of low-cost, forward error-correcting (FEC) paper-based biosensors based on silver-enhancement based self-assembly. In one instance, we showed how to design biosensors where radio-frequency antennas self-assemble based on the presence of target analytes. In another instance, we demonstrate how quick-response (QR) code can be self-assembled and can be used for remote biosensing. These low-cost biosensor platforms can be used for end-to-end food-supply chain monitoring, where these tags could be potentially attached to every food-package. The broader impact of this project has been training of graduate and undergraduate students. The project has supported the doctoral thesis of two students and has resulted in seven peer-reviewed journal papers and three conference paper. Two software packages were developed in this project that have been made available to the public through a web-portal. One of the packages is the basic FAST simulation engine based on factor-graph representation of biomolecular circuits. The other software package is an optimization tool for designing and estimating the capacity of a generic affinity based immunoassay.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/16/2017<br>      Modified by: Shantanu&nbsp;Chakrabartty</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1533905/1533905_10132584_1513478663582_QR_RFID--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1533905/1533905_10132584_1513478663582_QR_RFID--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Paper-based biosensor platforms optimized using FAST"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1533905/1533905_10132584_1513478663582_QR_RFID--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Paper-based biosensor platforms optimized using FAST"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">End-to-end food supply-chain monitoring using low-cost paper-based biosensors.
