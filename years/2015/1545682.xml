<AbstractNarration>The Cognitive Development Society seeks to promote the attendance of young scholars from groups traditionally underrepresented in the field at its 2015 meeting taking place October 9-10 in Columbus, OH. The award will support travel awards to students, post-docs and young investigators from underrepresented groups. To promote networking and professional socialization for these awardees, funds will also support a new mentoring program to ensure a positive and productive conference experience for the young scholars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mentoring program will match each young scholar with a more experienced scholar in the field, one with similar research interests. Through an organized meeting at the start of the conference with their mentors, mentees will have the opportunity to forge new professional relationships and broaden their academic network. The young scholars will also be promoted at the conference by being acknowledged during an awards ceremony. Mentors will also support their mentees by attending the young scholars' presentations. These activities are intended to ensure that attending the CDS 2015 conference is a positive and productive experience for young scholars from traditionally underrepresented groups, and to increase the likelihood that attending the conference will yield a positive impact that endures beyond the conference itself.</AbstractNarration>

It also provided the opportunity for the mentors and mentees to discuss their shared research interests. Mentors were asked to attend the young scholar?s presentation. To encourage mentor participation and commitment to their mentees, the mentors had their conference registration fees waived. Significant Results: Twenty-five travel awards were given to young scholars from a broad range of underrepresented groups.  The impact of the travel award and mentoring program were assessed with an online Qualtrics survey where young scholars could provide their anonymous feedback on the experience. In general, young scholars were enthusiastic about the experience and extremely appreciative of the support. Many of them noted that they appreciated having diversity be broadly defined, going beyond underrepresented groups that are defined solely by ethnic or racial background to also include scholars who are first-generation college and those with a disability.
