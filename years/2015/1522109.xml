<AbstractNarration>1522109&lt;br/&gt;Kelly, William J.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel award will enable US scientists and engineers (including two graduate students) from the Biochemical Technology Division (BIOT) of the American Chemical Society (ACS) to participate in the 3rd European Congress of Applied Biotechnology (ECAB3). ECAB3 will be held in conjunction with the 10th European Congress of Chemical Engineering (ECCE10) in Nice, France from September 27 - Oct 1, 2015. ECAB3/ECCE10 will also be held in conjunction with the 5th European Process Intensification Conference (EPIC5). The global theme for the conference is "Chemical and biochemical engineering for a new sustainable process industry in Europe".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A goal for ECAB3 is to have BIOT partner with the European Section of Biochemical Engineering Science to provide an integrated program featuring US and European speakers in three important technical areas: Downstream Processing, Biopharmaceutical Production and Biocatalysis/Biotransformation. An additional goal is to create a student program that involves European students as well as US students. The cross-cultivation of scientific ideas from US to Europe will form a basis for dialogue and potential collaboration to expedite the advancement of biotechnology processes and products.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The National Science Foundation awarded this proposal to help cover the expenses of 12 US scientists and engineers (including two graduate students) from the Biochemical Technology Division (BIOT) of the American Chemical Society who participated in the 3rd European Congress of Applied Biotechnology (ECAB3) which was held in conjunction with the 10th European Congress of Chemical Engineering (ECCE10) in Nice France on September 27 &ndash; Oct 1, 2015.  The European Congress of Applied Biotechnology (ECAB) is one of the major activities of The European Section of Biochemical Engineering Science (ESBES) organized in conjunction with the European Congress of Chemical Engineering every other year.  One goals for the Nice meeting was for BIOT  to partner with ESBES to provide an integrated program featuring US and European speakers in three important technical areas: Downstream Processing, Biopharmaceutical production and Biocatalysis/Biotransformation.  A second goal was to allow for some (two) US graduate students to participate and connect with EU graduate students.  Finally, a BIOT-ESBES "Future-planning" meeting was held, with leaders from both organizations together in the same room, during which ideas for future collaborative activities were devised and plans were made to initiate the projects deemed to have the most potential impact.           A diverse ACS BIOT subcommittee was created in the Spring of 2015, for the purposes of identifying US scientists and engineers to invite as technical presenters at the ECAB3 conference in Nice.  The final group of 12 BIOT representatives included 7 faculty, 3 industrial scientists and 2 graduate students.  These US scientists were experts specifically in the fields of:  Biopharmaceuticals, Downstream Bioprocessing and Biocatalysis.  Overall there were many high quality presentations, and that many of the projects were focused on very practical problems.  There are certainly areas of US-EU collaboration in this space as there is more of an emphasis in "white biotechnology" in the EU as compared to the US.  Also there were several talks focused on CO2 utilization which is less controversial in the EU and this is an area that will clearly be expanding globally in the future.  The flavor of the ECAB3 Bioseparations  sessions was distinct from that of typical ACS BIOT sessions which tend to have a strong focus on the chromatographic purification of recombinant proteins, mainly monoclonal antibodies, with high current relevance to the biopharmaceutical industry.  While biopharma-oriented, chromatographic processing of recombinant proteins was certainly well-represented at ECAB3, there was a significant number of talks with themes of natural products extraction and purification, bio-based fuels and intermediates purification, so-called alternative (non-chromatographic) processing and non-protein product purification.  This also likely reflects the fact that most of the presenters at ECAB3 were from academia whereas the typical ACS BIOT  session talks will tend to have more biopharma industry speakers.  At a broader level, it is clear that continued collaboration between ACS BIOT and ESBES in jointly developing Biotechnical programming at meetings in the US and EU will be incredibly helpful to the field.  These venues give researchers and their students, especially for those groups in both the US and EU without significant international profiles, an opportunity to engage with a much-broader cross-section of the international research community.           Perhaps the most important outcome from this meeting was that a "Future-Planning" meeting was held with BIOOT and ESBES members in attendance. This meeting concluded with each attendee being asked to vote for the two best ideas that they heard.   The recommendation then from this group of ESBES and BIOT representatives was to first pursue the ideas which were both focused on benefitting graduate students working in the Biotechnology and Bioengineering.   Specifically, a virtual meeting of US and EU students is being organized for 2016, and a webpage has been developed for BIOT?s student chapter in Philadelphia that will allow for some information exchange.   Finally,  discussions are beginning regarding an international bioprocess design competition that would allow EU and US graduate students to work on a current challenge facing the Biopharmaceutical industry  together.
