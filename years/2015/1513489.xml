<AbstractNarration>As the world faces a large outbreak of Ebola epidemic, several vaccines are currently in clinical trials with a reasonable chance of being available in the field in early 2015. Since the initial amount of vaccine will be limited, the understanding of Ebola epidemic dynamics is essential for maximizing the effectiveness of public health intervention through a combination of targeted vaccination, monitoring and quarantine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with developing a realistic but at the same time mathematically tractable and statistically predictive dynamic model of the current world-wide Ebola epidemics.  The modeling approach that divides the population into three groups (susceptibles, infected, and removed--the so-called SIR model) and its various generalizations has been used historically as an important tool in deciding whether epidemics grow or dissipate.  The investigators expand the traditional model of an SIR stochastic epidemic on a graph with a given degree distribution,  in order to account for the Ebola-specific features.  These include, among others, incorporating a class of individuals at high risk of infection (e.g., health workers), and incorporating a dynamic network structure that reflects how contacts with different segments of the population change over the course of infection within host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new mathematical model describing the way in which Ebola spreads through a network of human contacts, both in rural and urban areas as well as across countries and continents, will be informed by the actual  field data from   various parts of the world including Africa and the United States. It is expected that the model will allow  public health and government officials to quickly analyze a host of different  intervention scenarios  in order to  speed up the current epidemic's  dissipation and to select the most effective way of preventing, or at least minimizing, the future outbreaks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Between 2014-2016, West Africa has experienced the largest outbreak of the Ebola hemorrhagic fever   in history, with multiple countries affected and at some point a real risk of a global pandemic deu to multiple  individual cases reported in Europe and in North America.  In response to the outbreak, US though its  CDC started to coordinate technical assistance for Africa  with other U.S. and U.N.  agencies, the World Health Organization, and other domestic and international partners.  In order to effectively predict the resources needed  for  this  public health intervention, our project's  scientific   team was   tasked with developing a predictive model of the disease spread  as well as with  analysis of the outbreak's likely  impact on the existing medical and social infrastructure in the affected  countries. Using a wide variety of scientific  techniques spanning  areas  from higher mathematics and computer science  to sociology and cultural anthropology, we were able to make mutiple predictions on the size and duration of the Ebola outbreaks in different African countries.  In particular, the analytical results obtained by our group indicated early on the likely  cresting of the epidemic at the level far below the U.N. prediction. The key component which made our analysis more accurate than many others was the  proper accounting for  the social and behavioral   changes in the communities infected by the Ebola virus in respone to the symptotm of disease as well as the effects of  public health information campaign.
