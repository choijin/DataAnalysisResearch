<AbstractNarration>Recent economic research has uncovered major changes in patterns of social mobility throughout the world. In the United States and Western Europe, middle classes that consolidated during the 20th. century are now observed to be in decline. Conversely, in countries such as Brazil, India, and China, where middle classes did not previously comprise a significant segment of the population, middle classes have increased significantly. These changes are of obvious economic importance. However, their wider social and political significance has been the subject of little rigorous research. This comparative anthropological project will address this gap. Anthropologists Dr. Marvin Benjamin Junge (State University of New York, New Paltz), Dr. Sean Mitchell (Rutgers University), and Dr. Charles Klein (Portland State University) will collect wide-ranging comparative and longitudinal data to illuminate the significance and consequences of the new middle class's historic rise. Not only will the results from this study be important for social scientific theory, they also will have important policy implications, contributing to our understanding of the relationships between economic growth, poverty reduction, and the consolidation of democracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out in Brazil, which is one of the key global sites where these transformations have been occuring. Over the past fifteen years, approximately 40 million Brazilians have exited official poverty classifications. The investigators will undertake a three-year study in three cities (Fortaleza, Rio de Janeiro, and SÃ£o Paulo) to understand the meanings, material transformations, and identities associated with social, economic, and geographic mobility among Brazil's "previously poor." In each project city, the researchers will focus intensive data collection on people living in one home community. These case studies will combine:(1) participant observation in important spaces where new middle class individuals experience and express economic mobility (e.g., their neighborhoods, shopping malls, churches, bus and subway stations, community centers, recreational venues, health clinics, and public squares); (2) a baseline head of household survey (660 subjects); and (3) in-depth, annual interviews (130 subjects per year). These data will support the identification of potential subgroups within the new middle class and enable the researchers to assess longitudinally how individuals respond and communities to economic and political change at national and global levels.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Long known for stark inequality, in the early years of the twenty-&#64257;rst century Brazil experienced unprecedented socioeconomic mobility, with 35 million Brazilians leaving poverty and policy analysts and the media hailing the arrival of a "new middle class." Then, ongoing political upheaval and a severe recession beginning in 2014 left many upwardly mobile Brazilians in precarious economic situations. This four-year project examined these developments over the period 2016 to 2019, with particular focus on class identities, political attitudes and practices, and the ways in which socioeconomic mobility plays out in everyday life. The study's findings are based on eight separate research trips to Sao Paulo's Zona Sul/southern zone, a 400-person household survey in four neighborhoods, and 55 in-depth interviews and seven focus groups with community residents.</p> <p>Household survey data reveal that most respondents believed they had improved their financial situation over the past 15 years, yet few thought they had moved up on the Brazilian socioeconomic pyramid. Nor did respondents demonstrate a consolidation of middle class identities; instead, most continue to see themselves as working class or working poor rather than middle class or "new middle class." Nonetheless, if Brazilian class hierarchies remain largely intact, consumption patterns have changed markedly with many lower-middle-class, working-class and lower-income households now having items and experiences that were once the near exclusive provenance of traditional upper-middle-class families, such as cell phones, computers, cars, and airplane travel. These findings suggest that even though most economically ascendant individuals may not themselves as middle class, their symbolic and material worlds have fundamentally unsettled longstanding ideas about class in Brazil.</p> <p>In these transformations, an unprecedented number of lower income Brazilians have accessed higher education. Most pursue their post-secondary education at for-profit, private schools, which have expanded dramatically in recent years due to new scholarship and student loan programs, tax breaks for for-profit higher education institutions, and aggressive marketing toward lower income students. The project's interviews and focus groups suggest that rather than simply being the victims of clever marketing, first-generation college students mobilize their resource networks and community cultural wealth to support their educational goals in the face of significant financial, time, and emotional challenges. For many, the dream of a college degree is not only about investing in their future, but also a self-conscious resistance to the inequalities that characterize urban periphery communities in Sao Paulo and Brazil more generally. These university-based political engagements are part of a wider growth of cultural politics at the margins of the state, political parties, and longstanding social movements that intensified in Sao Paulo during the time of the study. These political activities are grounded in what I call "insurgent cosmopolitan periphery subjectivities," through which Zona Sul residents assert a positive view of the often-maligned periphery and work against the multiple forms of discrimination periphery residents face in relation to class, race, gender, region, sexuality, and other markers of social difference.</p> <p>The project's data also offer insight into the jarring landscape of Brazilian politics in recent years. Nearly all survey respondents report very low levels of engagement with formal forms of politics, and most do not identify with the Worker's Party, who analysts ofte credit with having played a key role in Brazil's poverty reduction. At the same time, there is significant variation in voting patterns and social attitudes in the study neighborhoods, with Black voters more likely to have supported the Worker's Party presidential candidate Dilma Rousseff in the 2014 national election, and voters under 30 and voters who self-identified as lower middle class more like to have supported the center-right candidate Aecio Neves. Respondents under 30 years old also had more meritocratic attitudes about economic advancement, and more progressive views on gender roles and gay marriage than their older counterparts, while Black respondents supported for a wider range of social movements than their white or <em>parda </em>(brown/mixed race) counterparts. These differences can be seen in voting patterns in the 2018 election of the extremely conservative Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil's president -- two project study districts narrowly supported Bolsonaro, while the other two strongly supported Fernando Haddad, the Worker's Party candidate. These data suggest that periphery political attitudes and practices are perhaps not best understood according to predefined and static categories (e.g., conservative, leftist, feminist, Black, middle class, working class), but rather through the lens of contested moralities that play out in everyday life, with individuals enacting shifting definitions of "us" versus "them" that mobilize different dimensions of their identities in response to continuously changing economic, political, cultural, and social environments.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified:
