<AbstractNarration>Buhler&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1516324&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This project systematically extends a recently discovered data analysis method that allows a precise wave-vortex decomposition of flow measurements along a fast-moving aircraft, ship, or satellite trajectory.  Such a decomposition is crucial for the understanding of the observed data in many cases, especially in atmosphere and  ocean fluid dynamics, where we are often presented with a complex jigsaw puzzle of waves and vortices far beyond the threshold of our contemporary simulation and observation tools.  For example, this is highly relevant for extracting the maximum value out of expensive measurements obtained by aircraft, ships, and satellite-based remote sensing.  The method plays fundamentally into our understanding of difficult fluid-mechanical processes that are highly relevant for climate dynamics.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The new method is generally applicable to any fluid mechanical problem that involves stable stratification and/or Coriolis forces due to background rotation.  Preliminary results with the new technique have been promising, but the technique is limited by a number of restrictive assumptions that had to be made to derive it cleanly.  These include assumptions about horizontal isotropy and three-dimensional spatial homogeneity of the data as well as an assumed lack of statistical correlations between waves and vortices.  The present project seeks to remove these restrictions, to make the new technique much more broadly applicable.  This is achieved through a combination of theoretical analysis, modelling, and numerical simulation, as well as comparison and testing with real data from the atmosphere and ocean.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Despite our best supercomputing efforts, the intricate fluid dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans at small scales eludes direct numerical simulation at the present time, and this is unlikely to change for several decades.  High-resolution observations are therefore crucial to guide our understanding of these systems and to allow us to fill-in the gaps in the numerical models.  The most highly resolved observations stem from instruments carried aboard ships or aircrafts, and these measurements are very expensive.  It is crucial to extract maximum information from these data to get value for money!  Over the last decade methods have been devised that allow disentangling the contributions in the data due to slow vortices from those due to fast-moving waves that are superimposed on these vortices.  This is a crucial achievement, as these two kinds of motion correspond to very different physics.  This is familiar to anyone who has ever played with scattering surface waves off a bathtub vortex!  Now, this project has extended the applicability of these wave-vortex decomposition methods by allowing for more realistic settings.  For example, a ship track might cross the Gulf Stream at different angles, but the wave-vortex decomposition method should ideally always produce the same results. With the research outcome of this project, it will do so now, even though it failed in previous methods.  Similar advances have been achieved by considering detailed wave structures in the vertical direction, and by allowing for stronger vortex motions, which can lead to falsely diagnosed additional wave motions with the eaerlier schemes.  Taken together, the mathematical and numerical advances achieved in this project will significantly sharpen the tools needed to understand atmospheric and oceanic motions across a vast range of spatial scales that are inaccessible to present-day computational simulations.
