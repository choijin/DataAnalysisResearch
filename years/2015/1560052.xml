<AbstractNarration>REU Site in Physics and Astronomy: Supporting Undergraduate Research at Geneseo (SURGE)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SURGE provides an exciting ten-week research experience to a cohort of six to eight undergraduates each year at the State University of New York at Geneseo, a nationally recognized center of excellence in physics education. REU students are integrated into small teams of undergraduate researchers working closely with a faculty mentor, who nurtures their experimental, analytical, and communication skills. Students also experience physics in action by visiting regional facilities, where they interact with practicing physicists. Active recruitment at community colleges expands research opportunities for underrepresented students and for those with limited research prospects. Retention of students in physics, especially women and other underrepresented groups, is supported by showing them how physics research addresses societally relevant problems, and also through an online mentoring community that persists after completion of the summer experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students in SURGE deepen their understanding of physics and astronomy through direct application of physics concepts to solve intriguing problems using state-of-the-art instrumentation. They design detection systems for inertial confinement fusion experiments, develop novel materials science techniques, analyze observational data on massive stars and on nearby open clusters, employ scanning probe microscopy, engineer automated positioning systems, and measure the optical properties of atmospheric aerosols. SURGE also expands knowledge about the impact of undergraduate research experiences, based on nationally normed assessments, independent evaluations, and post-experience assessment surveys.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the summers of 2016 through 2019, the SURGE program (Supporting Undergraduate Research at GEneseo) enabled a total of 26 undergraduate physics students to participate in ten-week scientific research projects which would otherwise have been difficult for them to access.  The State University of New York at Geneseo, a nationally recognized center of excellence in physics education, has a longstanding and successful summer research program for its own undergraduates.  SURGE students from other institutions were able to participate in this rigorous program of research.  They integrated into small teams of undergraduate researchers working under the close supervision of a faculty mentor, who nurtured their experimental, analytical, and presentational skills.  Through this program, SURGE REU students were able to increase 1) their expertise with laboratory techniques, 2) their ability to analyze data and other information, 3) their readiness for more demanding research, 4) their understanding of how scientists work on real problems, 5) their clarity of career paths including interest in graduate school, and 6) their effectiveness in oral presentation.  Undergraduate research experiences have become an important step in pursuing a career as a doctoral-level scientist.  However, such experiences are not readily available to students at small colleges, and especially at community colleges.  Twenty-two (85%) of the students in the SURGE program came from home campuses that do not provide the opportunities that can be found at larger research institutions.  Students were encouraged to continue in physics-related career paths, as the program coordinated visits to regional facilities where they could experience physics in action.  Example field trips include visits to the University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics, to Moog Aerospace division, to the Rochester Institute of Technology (Center for Imaging Science and Center for Computational Relativity and Gravitation), and to various components of Cornell University (the High Energy Synchrotron Source, the NanoScale Facility, the Laboratory of Plasma Studies, and others). INTELLECTUAL MERIT  Through the SURGE REU program, students worked on exciting projects with important applications in physics and astronomy.  Some worked on improving the sensitivity of solid state nuclear track detectors while others calibrated the sensitivity of radiochromic film, both used in inertial confinement fusion experiments.  Some constructed a mobile solar and wind energy package.  Some analyzed the information capacity of quantum-entangled communication channels.  Some located extra-galactic planetary nebulae using Hubble space telescope data.  Some completed a photometric analysis of open cluster NGC6603.  Some parallelized computer code for predicting Mie scattering from aerosols.  The broad areas of application allowed the SURGE participants to see in each other?s work a much wider range of opportunities than if they had been concentrated in a single research group.  The impacts that these experiences have on the students? futures is also being monitored.  Tracking of students in the program will not be complete until five years after the conclusion of the program.  However, SURGE students? self-reported attitudes have already contributed to the nationally normed SURE III survey, which analyzes the impacts of such summer programs on undergraduates opinions and plans.  When complete, our tracking of SURGE alumni career paths will add to understanding of the importance of undergraduate research experiences. BROADER IMPACTS  Whenever allowed by the timing of the funding, the SURGE program used active recruitment at community colleges.  As a result, eight of the participants (31%) came from community colleges.  Ten others (38%) came from colleges which were judged to provide few research opportunities to their own students.  We believe that the SURGE experience will improve retention of these students in the physical sciences.  Many of the community college students have moved on to four-year degrees, and students reported that the experience enhanced and clarified their personal goals.  One goal of the recruiting strategy was to enhance opportunities for underrepresented groups.  Although our participation by racial minorities did not exceed the proportions in the field, we were able to attract 14 women (54%), well above the typical representation in academic degrees in physics (around 20%).  Coupled with our emphasis on retention, this will have a positive influence on gender balance in physics.       Last Modified: 08/24/2020       Submitted by: James G Mclean]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
