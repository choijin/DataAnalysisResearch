<AbstractNarration>Stratospheric ozone is an important greenhouse gas that also protects the planet's surface from destructive solar ultraviolet radiation. Depletion of the ozone layer occurs through a series of chemical reactions in which ozone molecules are destroyed by reacting with halogens (chlorine, bromine, etc.) with some of the halogens originating from man-made halocarbons. These reactions are enhanced with cold temperatures at stratospheric altitudes. Current computer models are capable estimating the magnitude of ozone hole development in the stratosphere over the polar regions, but the models underestimate the amount of stratospheric cooling as compared to measurements made by ground-based remote-sensing LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) instruments. This project seeks to better understand the role of atmospheric gravity waves in the Earth's stratosphere and their potential effects on the Antarctic ozone layer. Accurate forecasts of the Antarctic ozone hole parameters by coupling atmospheric chemistry and climate models are critical for monitoring ozone hole recovery. This, in turn, is important for understanding whether or not the goals of the Montreal protocol are being met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model will be used to account for effects of atmospheric gravity waves that propagate upward in the lower atmosphere and, therefore, affect atmospheric circulation, stratospheric temperature, and consequently behavior of the Antarctic ozone layer. A number of Antarctic ground-based lidar data (from McMurdo, South Pole, Davis, Syowa stations, and past observations at Rothera Station) will be used to validate and examine the WRF modeling results. The enhanced gravity wave parameterization will be used to run "The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model" (WACCM) to study the stratospheric circulation and temperatures above Antarctica. This research effort is a cost-effective investment that will advance the state of knowledge of lower atmosphere dynamics and improve or correct parameterization of gravity waves and, thereby, improve models of the lower atmosphere. In turn this will improve understanding of how lower atmosphere processes can affect ozone depletion reactions. The award will support an early career female scientist with her first NSF funding, as well as support an undergraduate student.</AbstractNarration>
