<AbstractNarration>This award supports two multi-disciplinary workshops in Washington, DC, at which scientists, lawyers, and media professionals will explore the relationship between scientific uncertainty and ethical and professional norms in communicating and teaching complex Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) concepts effectively and ethically. The workshops will build on a previous pilot workshop funded by the NSF and run by the Environmental Law Institute (ELI) that brought scientists, lawyers, and journalists together.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the workshops are three-fold: 1) to facilitate more effective cross-discipline communications by deepening participants' understanding of the approaches their peers take to address scientific uncertainty, and the ethical and normative reasons underlying these approaches; 2) to promote more transparent and constructive debate on major scientific issues by deepening public understanding of the ethical and disciplinary constraints on scientific, legal, and media professionals charged with communicating scientific uncertainty; and 3) to bring the challenges in understanding and ethically communicating scientific uncertainty and potential solutions to the forefront through technical and non-technical presentations, peer-reviewed publication, and outputs for lay audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivation behind convening the workshops is the notion that public decisions are heavily informed by the data, information, and analysis developed and communicated by scientists, lawyers, and members of the media. Yet each of these professions thinks about scientific uncertainty differently shaped in large part by their own internal ethical standards and professional norms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In April and December 2016, the Environmental Law Institute (ELI) organized and convened two multidisciplinary workshops, titled Scientific Uncertainty and Professional Ethics in Science, Law, and Journalism and Scientific Uncertainty and Professional Ethics: Getting from Strong Public Science to Sound Public Policy. Sequels to an 2014 ELI event, the workshops? stated goals were:  (1) to facilitate more effective cross-discipline communications by deepening participants? understanding of the approaches their peers take to address scientific uncertainty, and the ethical and normative reasons underlying these approaches;  (2) to promote more transparent and constructive debate on major environmental and public health issues by deepening understanding of the ethical and disciplinary constraints on scientific, legal, and media professionals charged with communicating scientific uncertainty; and  (3) to bring the challenges in understanding and ethically communicating scientific uncertainty and potential solutions to the forefront through technical and non-technical presentations, peer-reviewed publication, and outputs for lay audiences.  About 50 participants attended the April workshop, and more than 40 &ndash; half returning, and half new participants &ndash; attended the December workshop, for a total of over 70 unique participants.  Prior to the April workshop, ELI hosted an online webinar, "Issues in Communicating Scientific Uncertainty," in which three panelists examined the different roles that scientists, lawyers, and media professionals play in addressing scientific uncertainty.

The results were reported in that workshop?s proceedings, available at https://www.eli.org/sites/default/files/docs/nsf_workshop_proceedings_april_2016.pdf. Survey responses painted a picture of the major challenges for each profession. For scientists, these include a lack of trust of journalists; a lack of support within the university/tenure culture for time spent speaking to journalists; and a lack of training on how to effectively communicate with mass audiences.  Major challenges experienced by journalists include space and time limitations that make it difficult or impossible to fully describe concepts that are already not intuitive to many news consumers; limitations of language, as it is difficult to clearly articulate the value of uncertainty for the research process in a way that is easily understood; inability of the journalist to discern the validity of a scientist?s argument; and the reality that headlines are not effective in communicating nuance&mdash;to the contrary, headlines tend to convey a sense of certainty.  The biggest challenges faced by lawyers are a lack of scientific training; the fact that many lawyers work in an adversarial context, where uncertainty can ethically provide an opportunity for tactical advantage; the legal profession?s tendency toward bright-line answers and all-or-nothing results; and the need to protect society (or at least clients) in the face of the uncertainty inherent in scientific research.  At both workshops, the participants explored these challenges to communicating scientific uncertainty as they relate to two specific issues &mdash; climate change and the production and labelling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
