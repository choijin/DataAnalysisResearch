<AbstractNarration>Non-technical description:&lt;br/&gt;Magnetism in thin layers or films of materials, and at interfaces between multiple layers, has attracted attention for many years. This is due to basic scientific interest, but also technological importance, as magnetic films enable such devices as the hard disk drives that now power cloud storage. Despite the maturity of such "spintronic" technologies there remain surprising gaps in the understanding of such materials, as well as major obstacles to next generation devices. One example is the manner in which magnetism can be induced in otherwise non-magnetic metals by injecting electrons across an interface with a magnetic metal. This is termed "spin injection", the subsequent motion of the electrons enabling "spin transport". Despite the fact that working technologies rely upon these effects, many fundamental questions remain unanswered, including what limits how far injected spin currents can persist. The goal of this project is to understand exactly this, focusing on the all-important role of imperfections in the materials. In addition to elucidating the poorly understood basic physics, this also contributes to the development of next generation hard drive read heads. This project does this not only with conventional magnetic metals, but also in the new realm of conductive oxide materials. In addition to impact in both science and technology, these activities train undergraduate and graduate students in an active, interdisciplinary research field, directly contributing to a skilled US workforce. Outreach to the public is also achieved, primarily through an educational program developed by the principal investigator that can impact up to 500 school students a year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description:&lt;br/&gt;This project uses the separation of charge and spin currents enabled by the nanoscopic lateral non-local spin valve to dramatically improve the understanding of spin injection and relaxation in metals and oxides. The goal is to develop a general physical understanding of the factors that limit spin diffusion lengths and lifetimes in non-magnetic metals and oxides, thus directly contributing to the exploration of low resistance-area product sensor technologies for next generation hard disk drive read heads. The factors inducing spin relaxation in non-magnetic metals are being systematically deconvoluted in this work, providing a full understanding of the role of magnetic impurities, spin-orbit scattering centers, grain boundaries, surfaces, interfaces, and phonons. The research additionally includes novel experiments aimed at understanding the role of local magnetic moments, Kondo physics, and even magnetic interactions and fluctuations on spin transport in metals with magnetic impurities. The work will gradually move from conventional metals to conductive oxides, exploring the opportunities provided by highly spin polarized complex oxide spin injectors, the prospects to understand the fundamentals of spin injection, diffusion and relaxation in oxide metals, and the potential for fascinating new physics combining spin transport with electronic phase transitions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spintronics is a field of scientific and engineering research that is attempting to achieve great advances in microelectronic devices by unlocking the potential of the "spin" of the electron, i.e., the property that gives rise to magnetism. The field has already enabled a revolution in data storage in hard disk drives (extensively used in cloud storage) and is poised to disrupt other technologies.  Transporting spin from one place to another is a key need in spintronic devices, which was addressed in this three-year project. In essence, this NSF funding was used to advance the understanding of how spins move in metals, in particular how far they can travel in simple non-magnetic metals such as copper and aluminum. This is a limiting factor in many spintronic devices, and an open problem in fundamental physics. For the first time the physical mechanisms behind this were quantified fully in some simple cases, providing invaluable information for future device design and development. In particular, magnetic impurity atoms in these non-magnetic metals  were understood to play a very negative role in limiting spin transport, an effect that was understood and even mitigated in this work. On the whole the work performed under this project has substantially advanced the understanding in this key area of spintronics, with both fundamental scientific and engineering benefits. Eight publications in the scientific literature resulted from this work, in addition to numerous conference presentations; the work was thus broadly disseminated to the scientific and engineering community.     Broader impacts of the work were attained in many areas, including human resource development through the education of a number of graduate and undergraduate students, through outreach efforts of the principal investigator at the University of Minnesota, and through the potential long-term societal benefit from technology advancement in computing. Concrete examples include the graduation of a Ph.D. student in physics now employed at a high-technology company, and the potential use of metallic spin transport devices (of the type used in this work) in read heads in hard disk drives.
