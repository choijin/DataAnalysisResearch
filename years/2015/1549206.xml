<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable ultra high bandwidth energy-efficient optical interconnects in supercomputers and data centers. By resolving network bandwidth bottlenecks, the project enables greater disaggregation and more efficient utilization of compute servers and memory, which dominate costs in data centers. Decreasing communication energy use will  address 30% of energy consumption in data centers, which are expected to use 130 billion kilowatt hours per year by 2020 in the US alone. This means that, if all US data centers were to adopt this technology for all interconnects by 2020, they would reduce energy use by 37 billion kWh annually. Commercially, the total addressable market for a product which can address this problem is $24B and grows at 20% per year.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the development of electro-optic packaging and a multi-wavelength laser source for super-high bandwidth-density optics-enabled CMOS chips. These technologies, which are not available today, are essential to the production of a 1 Tb/s optical interconnect using chips built in a commercial CMOS foundry. Development of these capabilities will enable a plug-and-play 1 Tb/s demonstration product, so that potential customers can test its capabilities in their own data center and supercomputer systems, and ultimately will enable scaling production of a commercial product. The anticipated effects will be to make compute resources more efficient, preventing the need to build more data centers, and reducing the growing costs and environmental footprint of computer infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Ayar Labs, Inc. helps companies keep up with skyrocketing volumes of data by miniaturizing fiber optic transceivers and making them in silicon chips, bringing the super-high bandwidths and low energy use of fiber optics inside computers. While the previous academic work by the Ayar Labs co-founders focused on the development of the technology on each chip, the optical fiber attach and packaging remained a key hurdle towards portable demonstrations of this technology. In Phase I of this Small Business Innovation Research project (SBIR), we combined both device design and packaging developments to enable portable demonstrations of Ayar Labs?s monolithic optical transceivers, which are manufactured in a standard CMOS foundry ("zero-change" photonics). To simplify packaging of Ayar Labs chips through existing vendors and tools, we designed, simulated, and tested new tapers and grating coupler arrays conforming to off-the-shelf packaging specifications. The new coupler arrays are designed for 10 &mu;m mode field diameter (MFD) and with couplers spaced at 250 &mu;m pitch, while achieving &lt;2 dB of coupling losses and good matching between simulation and tested silicon. In addition, we verified that these designs do not violate manufacturing design rules from the CMOS foundry.. In addition to new device development, we identified and sourced fiber holding blocks and utilized a custom packaging house to successfully perform fiber-attach to our chips. These tasks enabled a portable electrical/optical demo using our existing chips and confirmed that the materials and steps used for fiber-attach had no adverse effects on our transceivers. Finally, new measured device performance enabled us to move to a standard wavelength range. At this new range, we identified vendors and potential partners for supplying laser components. Through this Phase I SBIR project, Ayar Labs can now complete an end-to-end demonstrator of "zero-change" CMOS photonics technology. The broader implications of this SBIR include enabling high-bandwidth optical communications directly to network switches, processors and memory, using technology that consumes a fraction of the energy required by present-day technologies.
