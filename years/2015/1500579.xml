<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations to successfully complete high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  The LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (LSAMP-BD) activity provides two-year support at the post baccalaureate level for students from historically underrepresented minority populations to matriculate in STEM graduate programs with the ultimate goal of earning a doctoral degree in a STEM discipline.  Participants are selected from LSAMP institutions nationwide. The Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Florida-Georgia LSAMP), under the leadership of Florida A &amp; M University, a Historically Black College/University (HBCU), has chosen Florida International University (FIU), a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) as the host for the 2015-2017 BD program in which a cohort of twelve LSAMP BD students will engage in STEM research, academics and professional development leading to completion of the STEM terminal degree.  The programs promote systemic change in graduate education practices and policy in ways that increase the success of individual students on the doctoral pathway and the effectiveness of STEM graduate programs continuing the goal of diversifying America's STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve cohorts of students have matriculated in the Florida-Georgia LSAMP BD programs at the following sites:  Florida State University, University of South Florida, University of Florida and Florida International University since 2003. For the 2015-2017 cohorts, the host of the Florida-Georgia LSAMP BD program will be Florida International University. The program includes collaborations and linkages with other STEM networks and resources as well as other graduate programs, such as NSF's Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) and other regional LSAMP-supported graduate education programs.  The BD program at FIU provides a comprehensive set of support services that monitors student progress, builds a strong BD community, and increases BD students' academic and professional skills. Institutional resources are committed to ensure participants' successful completion of the STEM doctoral degree. This BD program will be externally evaluated and students will be tracked throughout its duration and into STEM careers following completion of STEM doctoral degree programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the 2015-2017  FGLSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate project at Florida International University was to increase the number of NSF LSAMP students and alumni who obtain STEM graduate degrees, to successfully transition them into post-graduate careers, and to contribute to the concerted effort to grow the domestic Hispanic/Latino and African American/Black students who are significantly underrepresented in doctoral education in science and engineering. BD fellows were recruited from throughout the Florida-Georgia LSAMP (including FIU) and LSAMP alliances nationwide.   This project has successfully leveraged student opportunities from other federal, state, and privately funded programs including the McKnight Doctoral Fellowship Program, NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program, and National GEM Consortium to recruit talented minority students.  The institutional promotion of the program through individual successes of the fellows and the broader impact has resulted in further commitment of the university leadership and the increased recognition of the high value and alignment of the BD program goals with FIU?s Beyond Possible 2020 strategic objectives.      This BD activity supported 12 LSAMP alumni as fellows and also extended opportunities for additional first-year minority STEM doctoral students to participate in BD retention activities with the goal of developing a supportive community and reducing the "sense of isolation" often encountered by URM students within their graduate programs (Allen-Ramdial, Campbell, 2014). All of the fellows enrolled in degree specific coursework and participated in BD professional development activities. Highlights of this cohort include the following: 1) national recruitment that resulted in the recruitment of BD fellows from five LSAMP alliances (Florida-Georgia, Peach State, Texas, Garden State, Louisiana); 2) NSF GRFP fellowship submissions by all BD fellows that resulted in 1 fellow becoming NSF-GRFP recipient; 3) Seven McKnight Doctoral Fellowship recipients 4) One GEM fellowship recipient 5) 1 internship at Intel, Seattle, Washington; 5) travel awards for student conference presentations. 8) BD fellows authored five peer-reviewed publications. The anticipated PhD completion rate for the cohort is 88% (16/18).   The program has generated three important findings about key conditions for the successful retention of graduate students.   Mentorship. Since the beginning of its inaugural BD activity in 2013, FGLSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate has developed a mentoring program and selected a cadre of graduate mentors with a proven track record of effective mentorship practices to mentor/train the BD Fellows. The FIU model builds on the widely recognized principles that effective mentoring at the graduate level is critical to high levels of retention, completion of graduate degrees, and subsequent career achievements (e.g Lovitts, 2001; Titus &amp; Ballou, 2013). Because of the BD program at FIU,   relationships with the faculty, some of which has never mentored minority PhD students before, have been very successful. Through careful monitoring of the student progress and consistent communication of the BD program objectives by the BD staff, the faculty has become a stakeholder and a partner in ensuring the success of the program.    Cohort Socialization. At FIU, we see that the cohort experience and the ability to share information and issues has also proven critical in maintaining the fellows? motivation level and commitment. The cohort socialization has also proven invaluable in creative positive role models and a safe environment, in which the fellows are able to share their graduate experience and learn from one another.  In the words of one of the fellows, "Making a real connection with the BD fellows and staff is what I value the most.  I believe it is that connection that gives me the confidence to seek help when I need it.  Developing trust within the BD fellows and staff should always take priority. That?s the key to keeping fellows from dropping out."  Ability of multiple cohorts to interact with another promotes a sense of clear progression and builds a community of like-minded individuals who face similar challenges and opportunities in the graduate school.  STEM Outreach. Observations from the 2015-2017 BD cohort at FIU seem to confirm the link between the cohort socialization, professional development, and K-12 and STEM outreach of the BD program and graduate retention rates. For underrepresented minority (URM) students in doctoral programs who often feel academically and socially isolated, community engagement can increase confidence through interaction with faculty members and "social membership" within the academic program. This, according to Tinto?s theory of doctoral student persistence, will lead to professional career attainment and professionalization (Sweitzer, 2009). The BD program at FIU has significantly reduced the academic and social isolation of URMs in doctoral studies as till 2012 URMs were a small fraction of doctoral students in STEM at FIU.
