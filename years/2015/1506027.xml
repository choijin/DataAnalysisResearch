<AbstractNarration>The General Theory of Relativity discovered by Einstein tells us that the familiar, everyday force of gravity is a manifestation of something much stranger: the bending of the geometry of space-time by matter. Many of the most dramatic of observed astrophysical phenomena, seen through the windows of electromagnetic radiation or gravitational effects, occur in regions of strong gravitational and/or electromagnetic fields. Phenomena like relativistic jets outpouring from centers of galaxies or those marking the death of a massive star in a supernova explosion are examples of scenarios that can only be explained by carefully describing gravity and electromagnetic fields simultaneously. The magnetic field of the neutron star that results from a supernova explosion can be a billion times stronger than the strongest human-made magnets.  Its gravitational field can be so strong that a spoonful of matter at the neutron star surface can weigh as much as a mountain on Earth.  This award supports research on the strong-field environments of neutron stars and black holes, objects for which these strong-field phenomena are especially prominent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific systems to be studied are point masses orbiting black holes and magnetically dominated (force-free) plasmas near stars and black holes.  The techniques are mainly analytical as opposed to numerical. Self-force effects on a point mass orbiting near a rapidly spinning black hole will be computed and used to inform astrophysical source modeling as well as thought experiments testing the cosmic censorship conjecture.  Equations for the self-force will be formulated in alternative gauges and alternative gravitational theories.  New force-free solutions will be found by exploiting spacetime methods and developing new perturbative techniques, with an overall goal of developing a broad understanding of force-free electrodynamics and its application to electromagnetic energy extraction from astrophysical black holes.  The project will contribute to the training of Ph.D. students, and the research results will be disseminated to the public through research publications as well as news articles and public lectures where appropriate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research involves theoretical investigations of the extremes of gravity, electricity, and magnetism.  Our goals are to better understand the fundamental laws of nature and to leverage this understanding to explain or predict the behavior of astronomical systems.  This award supported the training of students and outreach activities to engage the public, such as public lectures. The scientific results of the award can be grouped into three categories, as follows.  1) Plasma near nuetron stars.  Neutron stars are spherical objects with a mass density more than a trillion times that of earth, which drive electrical currents through surrounding plasma at voltages a billion times greater than the highest-voltage transmission lines made by humans.  We studied the behavior of the plasma in these conditions, finding exact mathematical descriptions of the propagation of disturbances in the electrical current flow.  We also found convenient formulas for the precise structure of the global electrical circuit, as a function of the magnetic field on the surface of the neutron star.  This helps to learn about the structure of neutron star magnetic fields from observations of X-rays from neutron stars.  2) Rapidly rotating black holes.  Any material body has a "breakup speed": rotate the body any faster, and it will fly apart.  A black hole, on the other hand, can rotate arbitrarily fast, subject only to the fundamental bound that its edge moves no faster than light.  When a black hole rotates near this maximum rate, its gravity simplifies dramatically.  We studied the behavior of particles, electromagnetic fields, and gravitational waves near rapidly rotating black holes.  We found unique "smoking gun" observational signatures that could be used to detect the presence of a rapidly rotating black hole in nature.  3) Spacetime holography.  Spacetime holography is the idea that gravity can be described by mathematics involving only two spatial dimensions instead of three.  There is significant evidence in favor of this speculative idea, but no definitive proof.  We studied a peculiar property of gravity in the presence of so-called "extremal" black holes, where observers falling into the black hole experience high-energy phenomena.  We showed that this effect has no obvious holographic description, raising a puzzle for the idea of holography.       Last Modified: 11/29/2019       Submitted by: Samuel E Gralla]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
