<AbstractNarration>Faculty pedagogy and interactions have been shown to play a significant role in students' decisions to leave STEM majors, and female students in particular report experiencing negative classroom interactions. This project addresses that problem by examining what and how faculty members think about gender, and how that shapes their educational practices and developing relevant intervention materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forty-five engineering faculty members spanning multiple disciplines and career levels at three different institutions are participating in in-depth qualitative interviews that examine their perspectives, practices, and decision-making vis-Ã -vis gendered facets of engineering education. The findings from the interviews are being used to create faculty development materials and educational materials for future faculty members. Characterizing what and how faculty think about gender will provide a basis for appropriate and successful interventions for faculty and future faculty because rather than merely picking an intervention haphazardly, interventions should be strategically selected to align with the most salient issues or problems. Materials are being implemented at faculty development centers, workshops at national engineering education conferences, and in a newly created graduate course at Oregon State University. Faculty development materials created enhance intellectual infrastructure locally and nationally by providing the first research-based interventions of this kind. Curricular materials created enhance intellectual infrastructure locally and nationally by educating future engineering faculty on how to create more gender-equitable classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project met its Intellectual Merit goals by advancing knowledge of what and how engineering professors think about gender and women in engineering and engineering education. Published findings provided new insights into professors&rsquo; ways of not knowing about gender, gender and teamwork, and how policy is an important - but underexplored - tool for addressing gender inequalities. This project resulted in 4 peer reviewed journal articles, 8 peer reviewed conference papers, 2 workshops, 1 magazine article, and 1 poster presentation. One of the conference papers was awarded Best Paper at the European Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference in 2015. Journal articles were published in multiple fields, namely engineering education, higher education, and Science and Technology Studies, thus demonstrating the interdisciplinary reach of the project&rsquo;s findings. PI Beddoes also presented an invited keynote address based on this work at a CDIO and Diversity conference in Sweden in 2018. Broader impacts from this project were ultimately focused on broadening participation in engineering. Outcomes related to broad dissemination of understanding and training included development and dissemination of an online training tool called TARGIT. TARGIT, which stands for Training And Resources for Gender Inclusive Teamwork, helps engineering instructors learn how to facilitate more inclusive teamwork in their courses. Broader impact outcomes also enhanced infrastructure for education through an undergraduate course on Gender and Engineering, which PI Beddoes created and taught to engineering and science students at the University of Massachusetts Lowell in 2017. Additionally, this project advanced discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning by training one graduate students and one postdoctoral scholar.</p> <p><strong>Publications and presentations from this project:</strong></p> <p>Beddoes, K.
