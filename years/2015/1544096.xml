<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The science of science policy community requires a focal scholarly conference of international scope to provide a gathering place at which results can be shared, connections made and a common identity forged.  The Atlanta Conference on Science and Innovation Policy meets the need for a scholarly forum with the continuity, depth and richness of content required to sustain a vibrant scholarly conversation around the study of science policy.  The 2015 Atlanta Conference on Science and Innovation Policy brought together the global science of science policy community to provide a showcase for the highest quality scholarship addressing the multidimensional challenges and interrelated characteristics of science and innovation policy and processes.  The Conference sought to foster the intellectual development of the science of science policy (SciSIP) community and integrate the US and international communities.  The Atlanta Conference meets the need for a SciSIP scholarly forum with the continuity, depth and richness of content required to sustain a vibrant scholarly conversation around the study of science policy.  The conference welcomed over 240 attendees from 30 countries who engaged with over 200 presentations.  The conference furthered the development of graduate students who are included in poster session in which senior attendees and provide feedback.  52 students attended.  The conference broadened the conversation beyond academics; 50 of the attendees were not presenting.  The conference fostered awareness among American academics of science of science policy research in Europe, Asia and developing countries. The conference strengthened networks among US science of science policy researchers and their international colleagues.
