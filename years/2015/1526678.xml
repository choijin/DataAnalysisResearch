<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop means to improve information quality and use in emergency response, increasing the value of using messaging and microblogged data from crowds of non-professional participants during disasters. Despite the evidence of strong value to those experiencing the disaster and those seeking information concerning the disaster, there has been very little effort in detecting the relevance and veracity of messages in social media streams.  The problem of data verification is one of the largest problems confronting emergency-response organizations contemplating using social media data. This research directly addresses this known problem by methods to measure relevant and verifiable information. The results of this research will have a direct pipeline to organizations involved in emergency response.  Therefore the research has the potential to help organizations, which respond to emergencies, make use of large amounts of citizen-produced data, which in turn may improve the speed, quality, and efficiency of emergency response leading to better support to those who need them, and more lives saved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to the field of Emergency and Disaster Studies by mapping the key decisions made during an emergency response, the information needs, type, form and flow during those decision points, and most importantly, assessing data quality and verifiable standards for each. It will also investigate relevant and verifiable identifiers (or features), provide weights, incorporate these into an analytical framework, and use the results of the analysis as input to scalable computational models. The work will design algorithms that can estimate the relevance and veracity of messages in a high-volume streaming text comprised of short messages. Given the diverse backgrounds of the team, it will contribute to the use and development of socio-technical systems theory to analyze the integration of technical and social systems. The output of the models will match the organizational needs of responding organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The world is experiencing more natural disasters. These disasters are occurring more frequently and are more severe than in the past. This increase in number, frequency, and severity also increases the impact these disasters have on human lives as we see growth in casualties, property damage, and displaced people. Using real-time social media data allows crisis responders to go where the need is greatest. As the numbers of crises increases, being able to effectively and efficiently respond will become more and more important.    This research has contributed to the scientific understanding of social media usage patterns during a crisis including communication among citizens, communication from authorities to citizens and vice versa, and communication among authorities (including inter-organizational social networks). Our team has shown promising results in using natural language processing, sentiment analysis, data mining, and machine learning interventions in automating the process of identifying useful, relevant, and trustworthy information in social media crisis data.    Our research developed and deployed a reusable information technology infrastructure to classify and aggregate social media postings so that they can easily be used by responding organizations. Our team developed techniques to automatically detect truth and deception within streams of social media data. The data is used by responders and the public in real time, resulting in people and property being better protected. This enhances the ability of crisis responders to confidently make use of crowdsourced data.          Last Modified: 11/30/2020       Submitted by: Andrea Tapia]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
