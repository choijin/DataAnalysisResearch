<AbstractNarration>Nocturnal thunderstorms in the central United States provide rainfall for productive agricultural regions but also can pose hazards to lives and property through flooding and severe winds.  In 2015, NSF funded a large group of scientists to collect data on these nighttime thunderstorms.  This award will make use of that data by conducting very small scale numerical modeling studies to determine what initially triggers the thunderstorms, a process known as convective initiation.  The research has the potential to improve understanding and modeling of these events, giving forecasters more information about when and where thunderstorms may happen.  The award would also contribute to human resource development by funding an early-career researcher, providing an opportunity for an undergraduate student to participate in a research project, and allowing the researcher to develop a seminar course based on the field campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Plains Elevated Convection at Night (known colloquially as PECAN) field campaign was conducted in the Great Plains region in June and July of 2015.  The campaign included numerous observational platforms, such as mobile radars, aircraft, vertical profilers and surface instrumentation.  In this project the researcher intends to assimilate data from the campaign into an ensemble with nested mesoscale and convection-resolving grids.  The primary focus of the research is to accurately reproduce the evolution of the nocturnal mesoscale environment in which convective initiation occurs and to determine which specific small- and large-scale processes result in parcels lifted to their level of free convection.  The ensemble data assimilation experiments will employ the WRF-ARW and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble analysis software configured as an Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter.  Fifty ensemble members will be used and the researcher plans to employ a triple nested model grid strategy with the finest grid spacing of 0.4 to 0.6km.  In addition to the work on identifying processes triggering nocturnal convection, the researcher will also conduct forecast sensitivity experiments.</AbstractNarration>
