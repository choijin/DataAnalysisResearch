<AbstractNarration>The Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Engineer at the University of Maine System improves the utilization of existing computational infrastructure provided by the Advanced Computing Group (ACG).  This position promotes the use of advanced computing across all campuses of the University of Maine System through live seminars at each campus, short courses live-streamed to other campuses, and virtual office hours.  The CI Engineer assists with data management throughout the data lifecycle, from proposal preparation through long term archiving.  This includes best practices for data security and integrity as well as the utilization of different storage platforms for different performance needs. In addition, the CI engineer assists individual researchers in optimizing codes supporting individual research and inter-institutional collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The position supports the single university initiative by helping faculty, staff and students use existing cyberinfrastructure to collaborate across campuses.  These activities provide the CI engineer with a better understanding of research needs, so he/she also provides a voice for users in the design of future ACG infrastructure.  He/she also improves the efficiency of the University of Maine's K-12 outreach by providing special technical support for the ACG Outreach Coordinator.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  By the most direct metrics, the Cyberinfrastructure Engineer program has been successful, meeting all our goals.  Since adding the Cyberinfrastructure Engineer active users, core hour usage, cloud users and active virtual machines are all up.  Visibility within the research community has also improved.  The Cyberinfrastructure Engineer was a key participant in General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) MRI grant that was received in 2019.  It was a collaborative effort among the School of Computing and Information Sciences, the Innovative Media Research Center, the Climate Change Institute, the School of Forest Resources and the School of Marine Sciences. In addition, the Cyberinfrastructure Engineer coordinated the cooperation of researchers from four of the smaller universities in the University of Maine System to submit a follow-on MRI proposal for GPGPU resources designed to expand those capabilities to the remote universities.  He worked on the projects for the School of Forest Resources, with two concluding in the reporting period and one project still ongoing.  These projects involve parallelizing the processing of satellite imagery using machine learning techniques to generate maps of topics of interest to researchers.  The sub-project with the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC), involving mentoring a student who was preparing disturbance maps related to Spruce Budworm infestations in Northern Maine, concluded during the reporting period.  It was concluded with a student poster presentation at the Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing (PEARC ?18) conference.  Also concluding during the reporting period was a project involving the parallelization of the processing for LIDAR data.  This project was initiated based on the success of the disturbance and species presences maps and also involved the Cyberinfrastructure Engineer working closely with a student developer to help the research re-home software for a cluster computing environment. Two addition projects were added, including a project involving Data Fusion from multiple Support Vector Machines on remote sensing data, and a project to provide robust missing data handling (involving the extreme gradient boost approach) for missing and noisy data.  We worked with a team of researchers in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont on the recently awarded INSPIRES Track-2 EPSCoR program. The Cyberinfrastructure Engineer serves as our representative on the INSPIRES team and is also collaborating with the researchers on a couple of the projects, aiding in developing high-performance workflows.  The Cyberinfrastructure Engineer collaborates regularly with the other members of the Northeast Cyber Team, including the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC), on a regular basis, serving as a mentor to student projects and involved in the researchcomputing.org effort.    In a related effort, we joined the Northeast Cyber team in building the ASK.CI.  That website is a project to provide research computing information to the general public through a search-engine friendly website.  The ACG at the University of Maine System participates in the ASK.CI website through a hosted sub-domain of the site.  The Cyberinfrastructure Engineer developed the initial seed articles for the UMaine site and serves as the moderator. Based on this involvement our Cyberinfrastructure Engineer served as a panelist on a presentation about ASK.CI sites for the Campus Research Computing Consortium (CaRCC).  The Cyberinfrastructure Engineer coordinated the Virtual Computing Laboratory project that was developed in collaboration with the Cybersecurity Program of the UMS to more effectively make use of Cloud Computing resources in the support of pedagogy.  The project allowed virtual machines configured to support specific Cybersecurity tools to be shared across a virtual classroom of students through common browsers. The project also featured a dynamic gateway interface that allowed virtual machines to be spun up or down to meet the demand, while minimizing the resource cost of devices not in use.  He also performed a study project to determine if it were feasible to integrate our guacamole-based VCLs with Shibboleth authentications.  The Cyberinfrastructure Engineer developed our prototype mini-cluster for use in the Proof-of-Concept of the Eastern Research Network project.  The ERN Proof of Concept demonstrates the ability of universities, research centers and regional network providers to facilitate collaboration across the many disparate institutions.  Once the prototype was stabilized it was deployed as our cluster for the broader ERN project, and is currently working as part of the larger project.  The prototype is currently federated with machines from other institutions to allow easy resource sharing.  Collaborators on this project included Rutgers, MGHPCC, Yale, Columbia, Penn State University and many others.  The Cyberinfrastructure Engineer participates in the ongoing activities for the ERN activities.          Last Modified: 09/08/2020       Submitted by: Bruce E Segee]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
