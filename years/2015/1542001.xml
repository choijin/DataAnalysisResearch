<AbstractNarration>This project provides funding to bring together members of the tectonics community to conduct a workshop and related activities that are aimed at producing a white paper that will develop ideas regarding future challenges in the fields of tectonics and and related disciplines. The last such endeavor was over twelve years ago and the new workshop will reflect changes that have occurred during the past decade, as well as identifying pertinent and promising new areas of scientific research. In addition, the workshop will address and prioritize infrastructure needs and data systems that will be needed to facilitate future research in tectonics, and promising directions and needs in related geoscience education. The workshop will involve representatives of the community and will seek input from interested individuals at all stages of development of the document. The workshop will be held at the University of Wisconsin on July 22-14, 2014 will bring together a diverse group of scientists whose research addresses various aspects of tectonics. A series of follow-on activities will engage members of the community that are not able to attend the workshop, including post-workshop discussion groups and town hall meetings at professional society meetings. These meetings will be followed by an open comment period. A white paper synthesizing results of these activities will be completed in 2016. The white paper will specify the support needed to sustain or increase productivity in critical areas, which will facilitate communication with funding agencies, policy makers, and university administrators at all levels, and it will articulate the importance and relevance of research in tectonics research to society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been over a decade since the last white paper summarizing important research challenges in tectonics and structural geology was produced. In the intervening time, there have been significant changes in: 1) Priorities in the relevance and significance of scientific topics; 2) Field and laboratory research methods and emerging technologies; 3) Challenges and opportunities in infrastructure and data systems; and 4) Relevance and impact of research in tectonics on societal issues. These changes underscore the fact that this is an opportune time to revisit and assess the future of tectonics as a community. The overarching goal of this project is to identify pertinent and promising areas of new scientific research, recognize and prioritize infrastructure needs that are necessary to making scientific progress, and articulate the societal relevance of research in tectonics. A further goal is to make this workshop a community building activity, in which the community is actively involved and engaged.</AbstractNarration>

The community vision is presented in the following document:  Huntington, K.W., and Klepeis, K.A., with 66 community contributors, 2018, Challenges and opportunities for research in tectonics: Understanding deformation and the processes that link Earth systems, from geologic time to human time.
