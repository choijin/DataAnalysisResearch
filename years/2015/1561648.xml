<AbstractNarration>Student Engagement in the Preservation of Historically Significant Collections at Rancho Santa Botanic Garden&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural history collections offer a lens into the past and a means to envision the future. Collections are especially important in predicting biodiversity change with shifts in climate and land use. The Herbarium at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden (RSABG) houses more than 1.2 million specimens and is heavily utilized for research, education, and public outreach. From multiple sources, the Herbarium acquired 30,000 plant specimens collected by ten significant 20th century botanists. 70% of these were collected from 15 of 34 designated world biodiversity hotspots; 30% represents the California Floristic Province biodiversity hotspot. These specimens are in critical need of curation owing to poor storage conditions. Several specimens have been identified as critical for describing and naming species new to science. Curation of these collections will provide physical access to collections currently unavailable for study, promote discovery of species new to science, and yield new distribution and phenology data. Importantly, curation will ensure critically needed preservation. Digitization efforts will provide access of this rich source of specimen data to researchers, students, and the public. Integral to the project are activities involving the participation of graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students. Notably, RSABG will expand on a successful undergraduate internship program by engaging underserved youth from the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. Especially targeted are at-risk and transitional aged youth at the high school level, who will be trained in a six-week summer junior intern program. All interns will participate in five workshops that will serve to connect students to collections, natural history, and biodiversity. An exhibit at RSABG will highlight the activities and student participation in the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As herbaria serve expanding needs for research, education, and conservation management, it is critical that collections of historic, taxonomic, and geographic significance are curated and digitized, ensuring their availability for research through investments in their long-term security. Through various sources, the Herbarium at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden acquired 30,000 vascular plant specimens of historic, taxonomic, and geographic importance representing the collections of ten significant botanists of the 20th century. These specimens are in danger of deterioration, owing to unsatisfactory past and current storage conditions (e.g., non-archival newspapers). Thus, these collections are in critical need of curation and improved storage to secure them for posterity. Several specimens have been identified as type material that was thought to have been lost. The principal objective of this three-year project is to curate and digitize these specimens through student participation. A large cadre of students at different levels in their academic career will participate in all aspects of the project, including specimen preparation, databasing, imaging, and georeferencing. Specimen data will become available for more than 18,000 species of vascular plants in ~350 families. All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio, GBIF, the Consortium of California Herbaria, and the RSABG Herbarium web portal. Additional information about RSABG, its outreach activities, and the results of this project is available at http://www.rsabg.org.</AbstractNarration>

Plant specimens are especially important in helping to predict biodiversity change with shifts in climate and land use. The Herbarium at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden (RSABG) houses more than 1.25 million specimens and is heavily utilized for research, education, and public outreach. From multiple sources, the Herbarium acquired 30,000 plant specimens collected by ten significant botanists of the 20<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>century. 70% of these were collected from 18 of 36 designated world biodiversity hotspots; 30% represents the California Floristic Province biodiversity hotspot alone. These specimens were in critical need of curation owing to poor storage conditions. In addition, several specimens were identified as valuable type material (i.e., specimens used to describe and name species new to science). Curation of these collections has provided physical access to specimens previously unavailable for study, and has the potential to promote the discovery of species new to science as well as yield new distribution data on species and information on flowering and fruiting times and how they may be changing with respect to shifts in our climate. Importantly, the curation of these specimens has ensured critically needed preservation. The herbarium?s digitization efforts (databasing and imaging) enabled access of this rich source of specimen data to researchers, students, and the public. Integral to the project have been the curation and digitization activities involving participation from graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students. Notably, during the course of this project RSABG expanded on its successful undergraduate internship program by engaging at-risk and transitional aged youth at the high school level in a six-week summer junior intern program.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What is Involved in Curating and Digitizing Historic Collections?</strong><br />The collections of ten noteworthy botanists of the 20<sup>th</sup>century were retrieved from an inadequate off-site storage facility, moved into climate control storage with routine monitoring for insect pests, sorted, researched, and evaluated by Administrative Curator Mare Nazaire. 30,000 specimens were targeted as the highest priority based on their relevance to science, collector, geographic region, and importantly, those in most critical need of curation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Specimens were sorted by collector and the collector's numbering system and matched to their field notebooks. Senior curatorial staff identified any specimens that lacked a species determination. Collection information from the notebooks (or sometimes collection information could be found on the newspapers they were pressed in) was entered into a spreadsheet to make labels for the specimens. Specimens were then mounted onto archival herbarium paper, accessioned and barcoded, and imaged. Images were sent to online database portals for greater access to these specimens.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An important step in the digitization process is to georeference the location where the specimen was collected (assign latitude and longitude coordinates to the locality). The majority of these specimens were collected between 40-115 years ago, before GPS technology was developed or used for collecting plants. Georeferencing the specimen record allows for further research to be conducted, such as determining whether the distribution of a given species has changed over time. Once curation and digitization steps were completed, specimens were filed into the herbarium for long-term preservation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Project Outcomes</strong><br />A total of 25,225 specimens were completely processed: 13,713 specimens were incorporated into the RSABG Herbarium, 11,512 were sent to other institutions as duplicate material (botanists often collect more than one specimen of a given species at a given location and time, and "duplicates" are sent to other herbaria via exchange). An additional 4,660 specimens were assessed for their value: many of these have no collection notebooks and are without collection information, and therefore cannot be processed. Of these, 1,020 Australian specimens were sent as a gift to an Australian herbarium for determination where experts there will identify the specimens and incorporate these into their collection.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project provided training in herbarium curation and digitization for eight graduate students, 18 undergraduate interns, five junior interns, and three volunteers. For interns we offered several workshops, including curatorial and digitization techniques, plant identification, plant diversity in biodiversity hotspots, approaches to plant conservation, and scientific contributions of the botanists in the collection. The students who have participated in the project have emerged with a new skillset in curation and digitization and a solid basis in and appreciation for natural history collections.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All specimen data and images resulting from this project has been made available through several collections portals, including iDigBio, GBIF, and the herbarium's own database portal. The final piece of this project, an exhibit in 2019 -&nbsp;<em>Pressed in Time: Botanical Windows on a Changing World -</em>&nbsp;was on display in the RSABG gallery and highlighted the project, including curation and digitization activities and student participation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/03/2020<br>      Modified by: Mare&nbsp;Nazaire</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1561648/1561648_10415540_1580764147533_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1561648/1561648_10415540_1580764147533_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Specimen repair"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1561648/1561648_10415540_1580764147533_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Specimen repair"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Graduate Research Assistant Sophie Winitsky repairs one of Lyman Benson's specimens in the project.
