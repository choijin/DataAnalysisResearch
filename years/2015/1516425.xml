<AbstractNarration>The "Virtual Laboratory and Curriculum Development for Secure Mobile Computing" project at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) will develop a set of courses and a virtual laboratory in mobile system security with an emphasis on securing smart phones.  The courses that will be developed will include topics such as Android taint analysis using existing tools or development of new tools, scalable Android security threat analysis on applications (apps), and smart phone forensics. To support the courses a virtual laboratory will be developed that will allow students to experiment with secure mobile computing.  The laboratory will be available via a web-based interface will allow users, from around the country, to access the resource on a 24/7 basis.  Students that participate in the courses and the associated virtual laboratory will be in a position to address and mitigate security concerns in in sensitive domains such as banking, military operations, healthcare, and law enforcement, where there is a rising danger associated with malware targeted at mobile devices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide opportunities for students to carry out coursework with extensive laboratory exercises and to participate in programming competitions in smart phone security.  Project evaluation will be overseen by two external evaluators.  Evaluation will be based on feedback obtained from students and users of the virtual laboratory.  Students will be surveyed while they are in school, at graduation, and on a monthly basis the year after they have graduated.  This will allow the evaluation team to determine the efficacy of the tools that will be developed as a result of this project.  Results of this work will be published in journals and at conferences such as ACM TISSEC, IEEE TDSC, IEEE S&amp;P, ACM CCS, NDSS and USENIX Security.  The virtual laboratory will be incorporated in security competitions that will help to further spread the adoption of this work beyond that of the host institution.</AbstractNarration>
