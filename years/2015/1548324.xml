<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the development of a flexible micro-hydro energy generation system that can provide clean, reliable and affordable energy for individuals and small communities/cooperatives in remote and developing regions. It promises to have clear performance advantages over competing solutions at Watt and Kilowatt scale while providing the lowest cost of total ownership. This is relevant to the global marine hydrokinetic (MHK) market which applies to energy generation from the world's rivers, tides, ocean currents and even manmade constructions such as irrigation canals and effluent pipes. MHK energy is a socially and environmentally friendly alternative to hydroelectric power as no dam is required to extract energy. This market is potentially lucrative but is still very nascent due to high technology costs, concerns over turbine survivability, fish friendliness, and difficulty in permitting these deployments, especially in the US and Western Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will transform a biomimicry-based design into a stable MHK rotor that can support flexible power take-off configurations. The baseline design was created by reverse-engineering the ultra-efficient, low-turbulence flow geometry of mammalian cardiovascular systems. When applied to a MHK rotor, the resulting geometry allows for the conversion of energy from a longer stretch of flowing water, which can lead to similar power/energy generation to that of traditional MHK rotors but with half the required depth. During the project, the shape will be varied to result in a predictable, stable design with maximum efficiency of output under variable flow conditions. The proposed R&amp;D plan is a primary research effort in identifying the variables that lead to predictable, high performance, MHK rotor design utilizing such methodologies as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), prototyping and water tank testing. In addition, greater understanding of this design will also expand the body of knowledge in the rapidly emerging field of biomimicry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This SBIR Phase I project addressed the subtopic Sustainable Technologies for Energy Efficiency, Capture, Storage and Use.  PAX Scientific, Inc. (PAX) with support from Real NewEnergy is developing a biomimetic rotor for a flexible power take-off called the BladeRunner. The minimum viable product proposed is a micro-hydro system for remote, off-grid and underdeveloped economic regions. The SBIR Phase I award was a first step towards transitioning the PAX Rotor from a promising concept to a stable, reliable component for affordable, clean energy generation in areas normally considered prohibitive due to economic and geographic constraints. The PAX Rotor was designed by reverse-engineering the ultra-efficient, low-turbulence flow geometry exploited by mammalian cardiovascular systems, swimming fish, and other marine organisms, which are the subject of decades of research by PAX. The resulting geometry allows for the conversion of energy from a longer, shallower stretch of flowing water, limiting the need for rotors with large diameters and the great depths to accommodate such devices. The tasks proposed for Phase I were challenging, addressing the Intellectual Merit component of the NSF goals, with the proposed BladeRunner product for affordable, clean energy addressing the goal of Broader Impact.  Figure 1 summarizes the Phase I project tasks and their interaction.  CFD Modeling The building blocks of a predictive CFD model are:  Geometry (CAD and mesh) Numerical details for convergence and steady/unsteady approach Physical modeling (material properties and boundary conditions) Automation of results   Work on these aspects took place prior to small-scale physical testing at California State University, Chico. Once the physical tests were completed, final simulations utilizing the established mode and method were conducted.  The PAX team was pleased to report success in developing and implementing a CFD methodology for the PAX Rotor.  Small-Scale Testing The goals for experimental testing were the following:  Recreate the CFD simulation for correlation Characterize initial PAX Rotor performance across a wide range Evaluate scalability for water velocity, rotational speed, and size Study debris handling capabilities Compare PAX biomimetic rotor efficiency to conventional technology Evaluate flexible take-off feasibility The small-scale testing was also highly successful and greatly increased the team?s knowledge of the PAX Rotor.  With the characteristic curve of the rotor under several flow conditions, PAX was able to establish strong correspondence to the CFD simulations, thus proving that PAX can use scaling to accurately predict rotor performance at other flow conditions and rotor sizes.  Further optimization work can now be done using simulations or experimentally at small sizes, which saves considerable cost and time.  Secondly, the team found that after only a small number of design changes, the PAX Rotor produced a large jump in efficiency, and is able to generate at least twice the power of a conventionally-designed rotor for a given size and flow condition. This, in combination with good indicators from both the debris handling test and flexible shaft installation, demonstrate the unique performance attainable using PAX?s biomimetic geometries and have increased the team?s confidence level in the feasibility of the BladeRunner system. System Integration The final task of Phase I was a system integration study for the 500 Watt micro-hydro system. The team mapped out the full power conversion chain from mechanical energy generated by the rotor to 12V DC for battery charging. This approach addressed the various options and their associated benefits for the following BladeRunner components:  Device generator AC-DC converter Voltage regulator Battery technology   This was an important step in determining the feasibility of BladeRunner and has also greatly influenced the strategy for next phase of product development. Figure 2 illustrates the power conversion chain for BladeRunner. Conclusion  This SBIR Phase I grant resulted in successful development of the pieces needed to optimize, scale and test the BladeRunner micro-hydro system at full scale (500 Watt).  PAX Scientific and its partners greatly appreciate the opportunity to have participated in the Phase I Program.  We are proud of the promising results we have achieved and are excited to further develop the BladeRunner technology.
