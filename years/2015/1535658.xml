<AbstractNarration>This project will develop foundations for novel design of low-power and high-resolution image sensors, beyond the state-of-the-art. The potential outcome of this research is two orders of magnitude power reduction and ability to achieve real-time image reconstruction. The research activities have the potential to make significant impact on number of different industries. Image sensors have been used in extremely wide range of applications to directly enhance the quality of human life, including communication, entertainment, security, medical diagnosis and many others.  The PI's will involve a number of graduate and undergraduate students from under-represented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will systematically investigate the optimal designs of all major blocks used in image sensors. The project aims to develop novel design ideas for compressive sensing, resulting in potential order-of-magnitude improvements in trade-offs between energy use and performance. The research will be conducted within the I/UCRC Center for Embedded Systems and the project has Center's strong support, and active participation from its member companies, which will pave the way for the transition of the project outcomes into commercial products that will benefit society at large.</AbstractNarration>
