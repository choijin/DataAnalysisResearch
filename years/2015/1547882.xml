<AbstractNarration>This proposal is in combinatorial representation theory, the focus being on tensor power centralizer algebras. These are generalizations of the group algebra of the symmetric group, the Brauer algebras, braid groups, and Temperley-Lieb algebras, and arise as algebras of operators preserving symmetries in a tensor space. The proposal includes two main projects. (1) The first will unify and expand the theory of affine and degenerate affine Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebras. These algebras arise via the study of knot and link invariants, but also in Schur-Weyl duality with symplectic and orthogonal Lie algebras and quantum groups. For the PI and collaborators, the latter connection has facilitated a completely parallel treatment of the affine and degenerate affine BMW algebras, which has already yielded new findings and simplified previous constructions. The result is a wealth of surprising connections across the literature, including to symmetric functions, central element constructions, and the K-theory and cohomology of orthogonal and symplectic Grassmannians.  (2) The second project will develop the theory of two-boundary centralizer algebras, which were brought to the community?s attention via recent work in loop models and quantum spin chains. By exploring the symplectic symmetry in certain type-A tensor spaces, realizations of the type-C affine Hecke algebras as centralizer algebras may arise. Techniques developed will generalize to two-boundary BMW algebras as the symplectic and orthogonal analog; similarly, two-boundary Hecke-Clifford algebras may be in Schur-Weyl duality with type-Q Lie superalgebras. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of representation theory is to take otherwise intractable algebraic objects, break them into their most basic pieces, and build them back up again, gaining salient information in the process. Combinatorics offers many simple yet remarkably powerful tools for keeping track of those smaller pieces, the reconstructions, and the data gathered. Since the birth of combinatorial representation theory at the turn of the 20th century, we have learned how to harness these tools for use in quantum mechanics, crystallography, molecular biology, voting theory, and many other disciplines. In mathematics, the research proposed by the PI will be of broad interest, including to those studying symmetric functions, Lie theory, quantum groups, braid categories, algebraic geometry, low dimensional topology, mathematical physics, and differential equations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit. Daugherty studied diagram algebras, which appear throughout mathematics, ad well as in closely-related fields, such as physics, computer science, and biology.  Birman-Murakani-Wenzl (BMW) algebras and their generalizations have origins in knot theory and physics, but also appear in categorification and are now connected, through Daugherty's work, to algebraic geometry and representation theory of Lie  superalgebras. Hecke algebras appear in representation theory, geometry, and number theory.  Partition algebras have become new tools for old questions in representation  theory, and by outcomes of this grant, have important consequences in the theory of symmetric functions. Daugherty's work is showing the approach of expressing algebras as quotients of braids to be broadly applicable.  Specific outcomes.  BMW algebras: Daugherty's work provided a unified approach to affine BMW algebras and their degenerate versions, computing important structural information and providing a more natural perspective on the role of the parameters intrinsic to defining these algebras. This perspective was then carried over to the "super" setting, in computing the previously elusive representations of the periplectic Lie superalgebra, and important object in representation theory and quantum field theory. Hecke algebras: Using braids to express elements of the affine Hecke algebra of type C, along with combinatorial tools, Daugherty computed representations of this broadly familiar algebra for generic parameters, a task that had proved prohibitively difficult with previous approaches. Work was then begun on applying these results to related objects appearing in statistical mechanics.  Partition algebras: Recently, partition algebras have appeared in the study of representation-theoretic stability, and open questions about fundamental objects in finite group theory. Daugherty's work generalized the partition algebras in two important ways. First, by defining a related, but smaller algebra, with the goal of simplifying its representation theory and its relationship to applications in group theory. Second, by studying its limiting behavior, better defining its relationship to stability questions.   Broader impact. Daugherty co-organized a Special Session in combinatorial representation theory at the January 2015 Joint Mathematics Meetings, as well as two Sonia Kovalevsky math days for middle and high school girls at Dartmouth College.
