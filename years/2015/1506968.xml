<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to prepare cellulose nanomaterials that perform as advanced functional materials. Sustainable feedstocks of nanocellulose such as nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and nanocrystalline cellulose (NC) will be the platform for the development of a new class of advanced functional nanomaterials. These nanomaterials represent an appealing platform for the attachment of specially designed polymer chains that will allow for the transformation of simple, renewable, and abundant cellulose into materials that can be used for technological applications. The advanced properties of these new materials will be demonstrated in selected sensor applications. Cellulose is the primary component in the cell wall of most green plants, and therefore the most abundant organic material on the planet. Because of its useful materials properties it is one humankind's most widely used natural resources.  The development of advanced products based on abundant cellulose nanomaterials as a feedstock could reduce our reliance on petroleum-based polymers and contribute also to ecological sustainability.  The project will provide research training and education to students who will be taught new techniques and advanced characterization methods, as well as implementation of nanomaterials into industrially relevant fabrication processes.  The project also will serve to attract undergraduate students to the program and to enhance diversity of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The research and education in this project is designed to help maintain US competitiveness in new areas of sustainable nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary scientific goal of this project is to prepare cellulose nanomaterials that perform as advanced functional materials. In this project, sustainable feedstocks of nanocellulose such as nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and nanocrystalline cellulose (NC) will be the platform for the development of a new class of advanced functional nanomaterials. These nanomaterials represent an appealing platform for the attachment of semiconducting polymer moieties to enable the utilization of simple, renewable, and abundant natural materials for advanced optical and electrical applications. This goal will be accomplished through a carefully crafted project where (a) new grafting chemistries will be explored, (b) new semiconducting polymer/cellulose nanomaterial composites will be characterized, (c) an understanding on how semiconducting polymer properties are affected by attachment to cellulose scaffolds will be realized, and (d) the advanced properties of these new materials will be demonstrated in selected sensor applications. An understanding of methods and limitations to fabrication will be developed and selected applications will be explored as a demonstration of the material's potential technological value. Numerous applications may be enabled by these materials -- e.g., sensors, functional papers, batteries &amp; capacitors, displays, electrochromic devices, photovoltaic devices, etc. The project will provide research training and education to students who will be taught new techniques and advanced characterization methods, as well as implementation of nanomaterials into industrially relevant fabrication processes.  As part of this education, the students will be encouraged to attend scientific regional and national meetings.   The project will serve to attract undergraduate students to the program and to enhance diversity of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The research and education in this project is designed to help maintain US competitiveness in new areas of sustainable nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>

In all, the work resulted in several patent applications and the publication of 15 peer reviewed scientific papers, numerous invited and contributed research talks &ndash; in the US and Internationally.   Broader Impacts:  There can be no question that organic electronic materials themselves are of great interest with whole industries being created around such materials: technical applications in mind include, but are not limited to, OLED/PLED displays, organic transistors, low-cost devices, and last but not least organic materials for energy conversion.  The studies outlined in this project have helped answer questions about patterned conjugated semiconductor polymer layers.  We have addressed these issues and help to bring a greater understanding to these important materials.  The societal implications of our research have ranged from the development of a fundamental understanding of these new materials to the fabrication of completely new devices potentially impacting industry, the economy, and our energy infrastructure.  Education of students and training them to help maintain US competitiveness in new areas of nanotechnology has been a major broader impact of the project.
