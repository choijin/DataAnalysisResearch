<AbstractNarration>NRT-IGE: Science Writing and Rhetorical Training: A New Model for Developing Graduate Science Writers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students are trained to write for discipline-specific journals, but they typically receive little instruction in communicating to public and non-specialist audiences. This lack of practical training persists despite the importance of engaging members of the public in scientific research to support policy decisions and science literacy. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Rhode Island will address this gap and promote students? scientific learning through communication and engagement. The model to be tested is a training program in academic and non-academic science writing for both graduate students and science faculty, which will include a series of courses, workshops, and internships, the development of a Graduate Science Writing Center, and an emphasis on a variety of writing projects. This project will contribute to the next generation of scientists who can communicate with other scientists and the public and will train a set of faculty who support students in that work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this program is to work with graduate students and faculty to implement a new cross-disciplinary model of science communication training that integrates diverse types of science writing and communication from the beginning of and throughout graduate students' scientific training. A key to the training model offered is grounding in rhetoric, the academic discipline devoted to the persuasive power of language that includes studies of argument, public discourse, and civic engagement. The rhetorical approach will have three distinct features: habitual writing, multiple genres, and frequent review. Graduate students will write early and often to create a habit of writing. They will practice writing across multiple genres for academic and non-academic audiences. Graduate science writers will plan and draft their writing and then enter a process of review and revision in one-on-one and small group tutorials in classrooms, online peer review forums, and a Graduate Science Writing Center. Workshops for cohorts of Graduate Science Writing Fellows, Faculty Science Writing Fellows, and Faculty Science Writing Mentors will provide a rhetorical foundation and serve as a basis for individual, pedagogical, and curricular change. Faculty Fellows will be guided to adjust syllabi and writing projects for their graduate courses to incorporate more writing earlier in their courses and more opportunities for review and revision. Assessment of short-term and long-term student learning outcomes, writing tool adoption by faculty, programmatic outcomes, and project-level management will determine which components will be carried into the future and can serve as a model for similar programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training.  The Innovations in Graduate Education Track is dedicated solely to piloting, testing, and evaluating novel, innovative, and potentially transformative approaches to graduate education.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The NRT-IGE: Science Writing and Rhetorical Training: A New Model for Developing Graduate Science Writers (SciWrite@URI) was a four-year project developed and housed at the University of Rhode Island (URI). SciWrite@URI?s goal was to train science graduate students and graduate faculty in a new cross-disciplinary model of science writing and communication that embedded rhetorical training early and often during a science graduate student?s tenure. SciWrite@URI relied on three principles based in research and pedagogy from rhetorical theory and writing studies: habitual writing; frequent peer-review; and writing across genres for multiple audiences. These principles helped graduate students develop voices, skills, and capacities that enable them to effectively communicate their science to multiple audiences, including public and policy makers, and disciplinary, academic audiences. By training science graduate students and graduate faculty who mentor and teach, SciWrite@URI developed long-term capacity in science writing and communication training in URI laboratories and graduate classrooms and now serves as a model for writing-focused graduate science training across the country.&nbsp;</p> <p>SciWrite@URI formally trained 12 graduate students and 15 faculty. It also served approximately 135 graduate students and 53 faculty via SciWrite@URI workshops, classes, and events; an additional 120 students attended the newly established Graduate Writing Center that emerged from SciWrite@URI; and seven students who have pursued the Graduate Certificate in Science Writing and Rhetoric created by this award. Over four years, SciWrite@URI tested various ways to embed this evidence-based model into courses, programs, and certificates. We developed a standardized but flexible rubric, based in evidence and best practices, to assess written and oral communications that are academic- or public-facing. Additionally, the SciWrite@URI team published, ?Better Science Through Rhetoric: A New Model and Pilot Program for Training Graduate Student Science Writers?. This article highlighted ways in which concepts and best practices from the writing and rhetoric field can help science graduate students improve their writing. Year one pilot results showed that graduate science students who completed a SciWrite@URI scaffolded two-workshop series reported an increase in maintaining habitual writing practices, an increased willingness to participate in peer review, and an increase in confidence as both writers and scientists. Beyond the pilot year, SciWrite@URI Graduate Fellows created public-facing science writing products--including science backgrounders, feature stories, profiles, and interview content--through writing-based internships.&nbsp; SciWrite@URI Faculty Fellows incorporated emphases on habitual writing, frequent peer-review, and writing across genres in their graduate syllabi. We conclude from these results that graduate students who have received rhetorically-informed SciWrite@URI training have become more confident, more flexible writers with increased capacity for communicating their science to disciplinary and non-science audiences.</p> <p>SciWrite@URI?s wide-ranging impacts were observed campus-wide. SciWrite@URI worked with science graduate students and faculty from 15 programs in four colleges. SciWrite@URI Graduate Fellows and graduate student participants received training in being writing tutors, program assessment, research competencies, and project management. SciWrite@URI Faculty Fellows received hands-on training to make writing more habitual among students, facilitate frequent peer review, and build capacity in their students to write for a variety of audiences and in multiple genres. SciWrite@URI also collaborated closely with the URI Graduate School, the Metcalf Institute for Marine and Environmental Reporting, and Writing Across URI (URI?s writing across the curriculum initiative) in order to further disseminate SciWrite@URI activities and resources. SciWrite@URI was instrumental in conceiving of, and obtaining university support to create a permanent Graduate Writing Center, administered by the URI Graduate School. To train SciWrite@URI Graduate Fellows to be peer writing tutors, our team developed a training curriculum informed by rhetoric and writing pedagogy and adapted from Oregon State University?s Graduate Writing Center (see Figure 1). This training program is now the basis of all graduate peer tutor training at the Graduate Writing Center which will continue to offer SciWrite@URI workshops and resources. SciWrite@URI played an important role in the development of three new URI graduate-level courses in science communication and was also responsible for creating the Graduate Certificate in Science Writing and Rhetoric now coordinated by a SciWrite@URI PI. Graduate students from biological sciences, nutrition sciences, natural resources, and marine sciences have sought out this new certificate, which had the highest enrollment of any URI certificate program in 2018-2019. In working with Writing Across URI, SciWrite@URI has helped to increase the use of online peer review software in courses and lab groups. Related, our team collaborated to develop an online peer review guide for graduate student proposals that all URI graduate students can use for receiving peer feedback and faculty can use to more easily embed frequent peer review in their courses and labs. In summary, SciWrite@URI developed or assisted with the incorporation of new graduate courses, a graduate certificate, a graduate writing center, an online writing platform, and workshops that represent long-term tools by which graduate students and faculty at URI will continue to increase their capacity in science writing and communication.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Ingrid&nbsp;E&nbsp;Lofgren</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1545275/1545275_10387078_1567183247009_SciWrite.ProjectOutcomesReport.Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1545275/1545275_10387078_1567183247009_SciWrite.ProjectOutcomesReport.Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1.
