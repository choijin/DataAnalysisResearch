<AbstractNarration>1561622&lt;br/&gt;Ketcham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program grant supports continued operation of the University of Texas Computed X-ray Tomography (UTCT) Facility over a two year period. The CT scanner at UT was specifically designed to enable x-ray tomography of a range of geological materials and sample sizes. The technology was developed from commercial biomedical CAT scanners with the adoption of a higher energy x-ray source and higher resolution CCD detectors to allow micron-scale imaging of geological samples. The technique allows for completely non-destructive imaging of the exteriors and interiors of samples. Differences in x-ray attenuation that occur due to variations in sample density and the elemental composition of the material along the x-ray path are digitally recorded by a CCD. Samples are mounted on a rotating table in front of the x-ray source. Radial 2-d slices of the attenuated x-rays are stacked by vertical translation of the sample table. Resultant x-ray sinograms are then reduced via computer algorithms to render high resolution 3-D images of the density distributions within samples. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A recent upgrade of the UTCT high energy system has increased both resolution and scanning speed, lowering costs for lab clients and opened a multitude of new research possibilities. In particular, it enables 4-D scanning of systems in motion (during fluid flow, cooling, heating, strain, etc.). Exploration and exploitation of these new capabilities for an expanded range of studies including studies of fluid flow through fractured and porous media with relevance to groundwater hydrology, hydrocarbon reservoir extraction enhancement and carbon dioxide subsurface sequestration will be enabled by this renewal award. Continued support will benefit a large and diverse set of research constituencies. Over the previous period of support, UTCT has served over 190 principal investigators, most of whom are Earth scientists spanning the full breadth of subdisciplines, including petrology, paleontology, structural geology, hydrology, meteoritics, and economic and petroleum geology. UTCT's clientele also includes many researchers in other fields, principally biology, engineering, and anthropology. Three-quarters of investigators were from outside the University of Texas. The facility will continue to support user training through developed short courses and assist users in data reduction routines.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and may advance the national prosperity and welfare through advancing knowledge of the behavior of water and hydrocarbon in the subsurface as well training students in cutting edge analytical methods in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was the continued support of the University of Texas High-Resolution X-ray Computed Tomography Facility (UTCT) as a shared NSF multi-user facility in order to provide top-quality high-resolution X-ray CT data widely and inexpensively to the geological and wider scientific community.  High-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT) is ideally suited for many geological applications, as it nondestructively creates 3D imagery of the interiors of rocks, fossils, meteorites and other materials.  In this regard, during the 30-month period of the grant, we performed 4471 hours of invoiced scanning for 169 unique investigators, most of whom are earth scientists.  We also provided free test scans to 52 investigators, in order to test the utility of CT for specific applications, or as proof-of-principle in support of planned grant proposals.

In addition, 2% of scanning hours were for commercial clients, providing them with access to our special capabilities and UTCT staff and students with experience in a wider range of practical applications of CT.  Total invoicing for the three-year period was $832,697.  Apart from providing our scanning services, we continuously improved our data quality, through upgrades and continuous development of our instrumentation and software.  Our instrumentation continued to perform well, although it is beginning to show its age, as our Xradia scanner and the X-ray sources in our NorthStar scanner are all over ten year old, and are in increasing danger of failure due to replacement parts no longer being available.  We continue to make improvements to our Blob3D and Quant3D software for CT data analysis, and to develop tools for reducing image artifacts.  We released for the research community a new version of our Blob3D software that can be run without downloading additional software.  A measure of our success in providing access to CT imagery and sophisticated analysis and visualization tools for the scientific community is that our data are featured in 223 peer-reviewed papers either published or in press from 2016 through late 2018.  Our data also contributed to 34 student theses and dissertations completed in 2016-2018.  Examples of the innovative and groundbreaking scientific publications that have featured our data in the period from 2016 through 2018 are illustrated in figures 1-4.  Our biological and paleontological data are also curated and disseminated on our Digimorph digital library (www.digimorph.org), which hosts over 1200 specimens. Digimorph.org has had over 125,000 unique visitors in 2018.  We are working with a number of entities (the Texas Digital Libraries; the Digital Rocks Portal through EarthCube) to explore ways to further increase access to our data products.  The UTCT facilities are widely used by graduate and undergraduate students, including visiting students as well as those from the University of Texas.  Students have been trained in 3D data processing and visualization, in support of their projects or projects of their supervising faculty. UTCT hosted three short-course workshops on the use of CT data for geological and paleontological research.   In 2017 UTCT hosted the first North American ToScA (Tomography for Scientific Advancement) symposium, with over 70 students and scientists as attendees.  The ToScA series, whose purpose is to bring together scientists across disciplines to share and discuss research that utilizes CT, was founded in the UK five years ago by the Natural History Museum, London, in collaboration with the Royal Microscopical Society.  They selected UTCT as the natural locus to expand this effort in North America, and worked collaboratively with UTCT staff, principally lab manager Jessie Maisano, to organize it.  Dr. Maisano is now taking the lead in organizing the next ToScA symposium, which will be in Gainesville, Florida in March 2019.   By providing state-of-the-art CT capabilities and maintaining open access to it, UTCT has enabled many researchers to acquire CT data that would otherwise be unobtainable.  For other researchers with alternative access to CT data, UTCT still serves as a backup when their instrumentation is unavailable, and as a source of know-how in acquisition, analysis, and visualization techniques, and turning those data into science.
