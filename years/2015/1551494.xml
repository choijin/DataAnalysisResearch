<AbstractNarration>The investigators will advance the goals of the Institute for Scientist &amp; Engineer Educators (ISEE) through inputs gained at the planned workshop, with the theme "Building Institutional Capacity".  The ISEE is piloting new Chapters to expand beyond the University of California, Santa Cruz, where ISEE is headquartered. This expansion has been driven by the impact of ISEE's programs and by ISEE alumni's enthusiasm for staying connected to a community that values education and mentoring efforts. ISEE alumni from institutions across the U.S. will share ideas about the challenges and important positive steps needed to build influence toward inclusive teaching and mentoring at their home institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommendations from this workshop will be applicable beyond ISEE and collaborating institutions, to the astronomy community in general. The recommendations from this workshop will contribute to an expanded plan for leaders in astronomy, and related fields, to engage with a more diverse community of scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this project, "Building Institutional Capacity for Inclusive Teaching and Mentoring," includes a plan for a unique community of early career astronomers to make astronomy and related fields more inclusive and diverse, by changing how STEM is taught and mentored. The group convened in a workshop and generated a set of recommendations that included:  How to incorporate inquiry and related inclusive teaching practices in the classroom (both larger-scale efforts and subtle shifts). How to design and mentor research projects in inclusive ways. How to engage colleagues such as faculty and administrators in inclusion. Strategies for junior faculty members and early career professionals that balance other demands (such as getting tenure). Communicating about inclusive mentoring and education efforts.   The "Building Institutional Capacity for Inclusive Teaching and Mentoring in Astronomy" workshop was held from November 6-8, 2015, at Asilomar Conference Center, California. A total of 37 participants attended the workshop, representing 16 different institutions: Michigan State University; University of California, Santa Cruz; University of California, Los Angeles; University of California, San Diego; University of Hawaii; Midwestern University; University of Texas, Austin; Maria Mitchell Observatory; McGill University; University of Toronto; Cal Poly San Luis Obispo; University of Houston; Stanford University; University of Chicago; College of St. Scholastica; University of Colorado, Boulder.
