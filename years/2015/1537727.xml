<AbstractNarration>The study of diagenesis in carbonates uses classic tools of C and O isotopes and trace elements and now there are a number of additional geochemical proxies and methods that are potentially available. The PI proposes to examine the influence of diagenetic process upon the isotopic systematics of two of these proxies, sulfur and boron, as well as take a new look at factors controlling the carbon isotopes of organic material and inorganic carbonates. This work will be carried out mainly in Plio-Pleistocene sediments using material collected by shallow water and land drilling as well as the ODP. Material will include unaltered samples as well as those affected by diagenesis involving freshwater and marine fluids. In addition to the more Modern samples, the PI will also study B within older, Neoproterozoic, sections which have been proposed by some to have both retained their original geochemistry and by others to have been influenced by diagenesis. The PI will test one of the most established criteria for determining that the carbon isotopic signals are original, rather than diagenetic, mainly the presence of a correlation between the carbon isotopes of organic and inorganic material, which has recently been questioned. The work has implications for paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic studies. Other broader impacts include graduate and undergraduate training, outreach to high school students and collaboration with the Miami-based Creative Learning and Engagement Opportunities program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI suggests that the study of diagenesis in carbonate rocks using geochemistry is at an exciting point. Not only have the classic tools of C and O isotopes and trace elements continued to improve in terms of their accuracy, sensitivity and microsampling ability, but there are a number of additional geochemical proxies and methods of applying these proxies potentially available. Some of these proxies need to be refined while others wait to be discovered and developed. The PI will examine the influence of diagenetic process upon the isotopic systematics of two of these, sulfur and boron, as well as take a new look at factors controlling the carbon isotopes of organic material and inorganic carbonates. This work will be carried out mainly in young carbonate sediments (Plio-Pleistocene) deposited on the flanks and surface of carbonate platforms using material collected by shallow water and land drilling as well as the ODP. Material will include supposedly unaltered samples as well as materials which have been unequivocally affected by diagenesis involving freshwater and marine fluids. The rationale for this proposal is that the isotopes of C, B, and S have already been used over a wide ranges of geological time scales to interpret changes in the Earth?s geochemical systems. Such work is being undertaken without some of the fundamental understanding of the processes which may alter these proxies. In addition to the more Modern samples, the PI will also study B within Neoproterozoic sections which have been proposed by some to have both retained their original geochemistry and by others to have been influenced by diagenesis. Finally, one of the most established criteria for determining that the carbon isotopic signals are original, rather than diagenetic, mainly the presence of a correlation between the carbon isotopes of organic and inorganic material, has recently been questioned. Hence there is a need to establish to what extent such correlations indicate that the signals are original or whether in fact the presence of a correlation indicates that diagenesis has actually occurred. The work has implications for paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic studies. Other broader impacts include graduate and undergraduate training, outreach to high school students and collaboration with the Miami-based Creative Learning and Engagement Opportunities program.</AbstractNarration>

Amongest the ideas is that the variations arise from changes in climate, changes in rates of volcanic eruptions, or interactions with extraterrestrial  objects.  Of particular utility has been the ratio of the two stable isotopes of carbon, 13C and 12C.  Decreases in the ratio of these isotopes, such as have occurred over the past 25 myrs, are commonly interpreted to have represented increased oxidation of organic carbon.

Such changes in the carbon isotopic record are present throughout the geological record and are commonly interpreted as being original in nature.  However, there are other processes which can alter the ratio of these two isotopes and cause them to be unrelated to the original carbon signal present in the environment where they were formed.  One of these is the early alteration of the rocks, a process known as diagenesis.  Such diagenetic processes are well documented in the Modern environment where it is easy to observe them in action, but in the ancient rocks they are largely ignored.  Furthermore, a series of criteria have been applied to rocks to assess whether the they are unaltered, criteria which are fundamentally flawed.  In this project we have delved further in factors which not only affect the ratio of 13C to 12C, but also other geochemical system such as boron and sulfur isotopes.   Boron isotopes (11B and 10B) can in Modern systems give an indicator of the pH of the environment and have been used in studies of foraminifera and corals to document changes in pH during the glacial stages and as a result of ocean acidification.  In ancient systems, B isotopes have been used to examine changes in pH during important boundaries which are frequently associated with changes in  13C and 12C.  However, there have been only limited studies of 11B and 10B  which have studied change during periods of well constrained diagenetic changes.  Sulfur isotopes (34S and 32S) have also been used in conjunction with C isotopes to study changes in the global carbon cycle.  While changes in the sulfur isotope ratio are frequently reported as reflecting changes in the original S cycle, diagenetic processes can affected also influence these ratios.  We have used a combination of these isotopes to study the influence of diagenesis upon the geochemical record in environments such as the Bahamas, The Maldives, Enewetak, and The Great Australian Bight.  The attached figures gives some examples.  The figure from the Maldives shows changes in the carbon isotopic values associated with the presence of dolomite.  The dolomite forms in association with non-deposition surfaces which allow time for the oxidation of organic material which alters the C isotopes composition.  These changes are unrelated to the global carbon cycle.  The figure from the Bahamas shows similar lowering of the C isotopic composition associated with a hiatus.  At the same time our sulfur isotope measurements indicate an increase related to bacterial sulfate reduction.  Once again these changes in S are unrelated to global changes in either sulfur or carbon cycles.     Work in this project will shape how these geochemical proxies are interpreted in the future.          Last Modified: 12/17/2020       Submitted by: Peter K Swart]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
