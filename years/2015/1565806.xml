<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding support to the Conference in Harmonic Analysis which will be held on March 16-20 on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The conference is devoted to recent developments in harmonic analysis. It will feature 25 talks by leading mathematicians in the field, as well as a number of opportunities for junior participants to share their recent work and learn about open problems.  This will be especially beneficial to  graduate students and young researchers.  Funding will be available to help defray lodging and travel expenses for speakers and junior participants.  The organizers will especially encourage the participation of women and members of underrepresented groups.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature recent research results and methods in harmonic analysis. Topics will include oscillatory integrals, Fourier restriction and multiplier problems, the role of affine invariant measures, Wolff inequalities and decoupling, extremizers for inequalities in classical analysis, weighted inequalities, and problems associated with measures on sets of fractional dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information about the conference will be made available at www.math.wisc.edu/ha_2016</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is a summary of the outcomes of NSF-DMS Conference grant 1565806, for an international conference in harmonic analysis.    The week-long conference brought together leading researchers from around the world to discuss recent developments at the cutting edge of harmonic analysis research.  The conference also provided opportunities for junior researchers to present their work in short talks and posters and facilitated a number of long distance collaborations by our participants.    Intellectual Merit:  The scientific focus of the conference was threefold:  harmonic analysis approaches to the study of partial differential equations arising in physics and engineering; optimization and extremizer questions in Fourier analysis; and harmonic analysis problems with a strongly geometric flavor.  The conference featured 22 one-hour lectures by world-renowned senior researchers and provided an opportunity for another 22 rising stars in the field to present their recent work in (10) half hour lectures and (12) posters.  Slides from most of the speakers' talks have been made publicly available on the web.  In a 90 minute open problem session, ten researchers discussed some of the most important open questions in the field; these have been condensed into a document that the organizers have made publicly available.    Broader Impacts:  The chief broader impact of the conference was the dissemination of knowledge, through the talks themselves, the posters, the public availability of speakers' slides, and the eventual publication of an edited list of open problems.  The conference provided training and networking opportunities for junior researchers who were able to interact with senior mathematicians, to present their work, and to pursue collaborations with harmonic analysts from around the world.
