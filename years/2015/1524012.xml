<AbstractNarration>Support for IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference( BIOCAS2015) , October 22-24, 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) is a premier international forum for presenting interdisciplinary research and development activities related to medicine, life sciences, physical sciences and engineering that will shape tomorrow's medical devices and healthcare systems. It brings together researchers, designers, clinicians, and engineers from industry, academia, and government, along with graduate and undergraduate students, to disseminate the latest cutting-edge research results and innovative solutions for today's complex health problems at the frontiers of biomedical engineering, life sciences, and circuits and systems. The conference also includes one full day of tutorials, offered by prominent researchers and pioneers in the hot topics, which is meant to educate the attendees in areas of high demand. The 11th edition of the IEEE BioCAS will be held from Oct. 22-24, 2015 in Atlanta, GA. The NSF funds will be used to cover or assist with the attendance expenses for three categories of students and post-docs from domestic US institutions: 1. Senior undergraduate or junior graduate students, who are not yet at the stage to have their own papers at the conference, however, have demonstrated a strong academic background demonstrated by their GPA and two strong letters of recommendation, 2. Senior graduate students who have accepted papers at the conference with strong reviewer scores and a strong letter of recommendation from their advisor, 3. Post-doctoral fellows who have accepted papers at the conference with strong reviewer scores, but do not have any other source of funding to support their travel or registration. This grant provides numerous benefits to these students, who may not otherwise be able to attend, by providing them with education and networking opportunity in advanced multidisciplinary fields, brightening their future prospects and benefiting the society.</AbstractNarration>
