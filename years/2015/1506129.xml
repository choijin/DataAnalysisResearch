<AbstractNarration>This award supports an effort to expand and enrich the COMPASS program at UC Berkeley, which is aimed at improving the education and retention of under-represented students (primarily in Physics). There are five universities with similar programs based on the COMPASS model: University of Colorado Boulder, University of Maryland College Park, Rochester Institute of Technology, Chicago State University, and Arizona State University.  This project joins these institutions and UC Berkeley to form the Access Network, designed to develop best practices through shared expertise.  The Access network will support the development of programs intended to improve diversity and access in physics by innovating strategies to build Compass-like programs in new contexts. The network will enhance the efforts of each individual site, build knowledge of best practices for launching new programs, and share this knowledge with the physics community. A robust evaluation of the project will identify the impact of the network on supporting diversity programs and how it contributes to the dissemination of successful strategies and program elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Access network will: (a) empower students and faculty - especially those from marginalized and/or underrepresented groups - as agents in the design, implementation, and iterative improvement of retention efforts, (b) facilitate communication and community among those involved in such efforts, and (c) create and maintain a repository of materials and strategies, all in order to (d) support local communities in adapting these materials and program elements to their unique contexts and populations. To achieve these goals, the project will engage in the following activities: (1) an annual assembly of the member programs, (2) inter-program communication through regular conference calls and inter-institutional travel, (3) documentation of local and inter-institutional innovations, and (4) synthesis and dissemination of member programs' educational materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Access Network, formed in 2015 with support from the National Science Foundation, brings together nine institutions to cultivate a culture that welcomes and values students' different identities in physics. Each institution had individually implemented programs that rested upon research-based strategies to support inclusion: mentorship, community building, authentic scientific experiences, and emotional support. Driven by a set of shared principles (e.g., student voice, community building) and a suite of programmatic offerings (e.g., mentorship, model building courses, community events, early research opportunities), each site is tailored to the needs of its unique population, ranging from a large number of Deaf and hard of hearing students at the Rochester Institute of Technology to Black commuter students at Chicago State University. The Access Network arose from the realization that, while many of these programs had successfully increased equity and inclusion, alone they were difficult to sustain and scale due to high leadership turnover, lack of community support, and lack of resources. The Access Network addresses this by providing resources, expertise, and knowledge related to equity work, institutional change, and STEM education.  The Access Network's most visible activity is an annual Assembly, a 3-4 day workshop that brings together campus leaders from all Network sites. Consistent with the network philosophy of fostering student agency and leadership, each Assembly is planned, organized and run by student Assembly Fellows with guidance from project Core Organizers. Assemblies have been held at Arizona State University, Rochester Institute of Technology, the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and have averaged between 50 and 60 participants each. Workshops are held on a variety of thematic topics surrounding equity and inclusivity, including: a) coping strategies in graduate school b) women in STEM, c) LGBT+ scientists, d) mental health, e) supporting diverse groups of students, and f) universal design.
