<AbstractNarration>There is an increasing need to predict materials response and failure behavior at macroscopic scale from its microstructural composition. In brittle and quasi-brittle materials, such as glass, concrete, rocks, and ceramics, failure is particularly  sensitive to the microstructure leading to a large  scatter in  failure loads. Most existing fracture models fail to reliably predict this scatter. This award supports fundamental research in developing theoretical and computational tools for fracture of brittle and quasi-brittle materials that directly link their microstructure  to failure loads and the scatter observed. Brittle and quasi-brittle fracture mechanics finds applications in a variety of material and structural designs and plays a central role in many other fields. For example, ceramics are used with metals to develop high-strength and light-weight materials for armor designs and aerospace industry.  Rock fracture, whether occurring naturally as in earthquake or manmade for enhanced oil recovery and CO2 sequestration is another example. Finally, obtaining more accurate probabilities of fracture reduces uncertainties in current design practices and can aid in the assessment of the structural integrity of existing infrastructure systems. Educational goals focus on development of short course toolkits on random models and computational tools to attract high school students to STEM fields, and software modules that will be shared with scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of stochastic partial differential equations provides systematic approaches for the propagation of randomness in an analysis in general. However, there is currently no means to relate material microstructures to initial random field description needed for these stochastic models. This research fills the knowledge gap by deriving continuum models that directly translate microstructure distribution to the initial material field description. Unlike common homogenization schemes, stochastic representative volume elements still preserve the spatial variability and randomness of material. This enables realistic modeling of brittle and quasi-brittle fracture. To ensure accurate rendering of this theoretical model an advanced finite element model is formulated that can efficiently capture complicated fracture patterns by incorporating both bulk and interfacial failure mechanisms. Moreover, a novel adaptive computational scheme eliminates the sensitivity of the failure load on initial mesh discretization and guarantees the estimation of probability of failure within the user-specified error bounds. The microstructure-based probabilistic fracture model approach aims to explain a variety of phenomena that are not well captured with commonly used deterministic models. Some examples are size effect in brittle and quasi-brittle materials, scatter in failure load, and formation of complex fracture patterns even under uniform loads.</AbstractNarration>

In homogenization, a Volume Element (VE) is generally large enough to be considered representative. That is, for a stationary (macroscopically homogeneous) macroscopic region, the same set of properties are homogenized at all points by using Representative Volume Elements (RVEs).

Moreover, fracture response, especially post-ultimate load, can be highly stochastic particularly for quasi-brittle materials. When the VE is not large enough to be considered representative, it still can be used to homogenize the effect of material microstructure to mesoscopic properties. These VEs are called Statistical Volume Elements (SVEs). Unlike RVEs, the use of SVEs, not only maintains material inhomogeneities but also results in different statistical realization of the same material geometry. The former aspect can maintain sufficient material inhomogeneity at the mesoscale to enable capturing realistic fracture patterns. Moreover, since the SVE-based homogenized properties exhibit statistical variations, its multiscale failure analysis can capture the scatter in response post past peak load.</p> <p>Figure 1 shows three types of SVEs used for homogenizing elastic and fracture properties of microcracked rock and two-phase composites in collaboration with the University of Saint Thomas (UST) and the Ohio State University (OSU). The one-point Probability Distribution Function (PDF) and two-point covariance function of homogenized fields shown in figure 2 are two functions that were used to realize statistically consistent random fields. The numerically calibrated size effect shows the decrease of the mean and statistical variations of material strength for a VE as the VE size increases.</p> <p>The statistics of the homogenized properties and Karhunen-Loeve and other methods are used to realize statistically consistent mesoscopic fields for elastic and fracture properties. These fields are used for macroscopic fracture analysis. Figure 3 shows how direct discretization and adaptive operations of the Spacetime Discontinuous Galerkin method in spacetime enable capturing complex fracture patterns at the macroscale.</p> <p>The advantage of using SVEs is shown in Figure 4. The top row shows three random fields for fracture strength realized based on the statistics of 1x1, 2x2, and 8x8 SVEs, plus one with a uniform value. The fracture patterns in the bottom row show that when a uniform fracture strength field is used or a large VE is used for homogenization, the fragmentation patterns are not realistic and lack microcracking and crack branching events that are observed in dynamic brittle fracture.</p> <p>Figure 5 shows the propagation of inhomogeneity from the micro to meso and to macro scales. For a Yuen-Long marble 5 different microcrack length distributions with identical mean crack length are chosen. A sample mesoscopic fracture strength field and the PDFs of mesoscopic fracture strength fields are shown next. A sample macroscopic fracture solution and the macroscopically averaged strain versus stress responses corresponding to the 5 different microcrack length models are shown next.
