<AbstractNarration>The 2016 Institute on Collaborative Language Research (CoLang 2016) will be held at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. CoLang brings together leading practitioners of language documentation from across the world to provide cutting-edge training in language documentation techniques and collaborative practices. Over a period of five weeks, including two weeks of workshops followed by three-week, in-depth field methods classes, participants engage in hands-on training in best practices in linguistic field research. Uniquely, CoLang focuses on collaborative documentation, engaging specialists from within language communities of underrepresented groups with academicians in knowledge sharing. All participants learn and teach, providing formal instruction via workshops or practicum teaching, participating in classes that take them out of their familiar areas and challenge them to engage with cultures and material new to them, and by networking with their colleagues around the world. In this way, CoLang builds a growing network of language workers who support each other in developing valid and sustainable approaches to language documentation.</AbstractNarration>
