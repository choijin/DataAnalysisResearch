<AbstractNarration>An AGU Chapman conference on transport in highly heterogeneous porous media, with a particular focus on the MADE site (MS, USA), will be held at the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia October&lt;br/&gt;5-8, 2015. Transport of contaminants and other compounds in groundwater systems remains a serious research question as well as a pressing societal problem.  This meeting will convene researchers in transport in highly heterogeneous aquifers at the field scale with those interested in aquifer characterization and solute transport modeling to: 1) discuss the latest advances in subsurface characterization and modeling research, 2) define unresolved questions about aquifer characterization and modeling in highly heterogeneous aquifers, and 3) identify promising avenues for future research in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dealing with heterogeneity, particularly high multi-scale degrees of heterogeneity, in flow&lt;br/&gt;and transport properties is one of the grand challenges in groundwater hydrology. Experiments&lt;br/&gt;and modeling on the Macrodispersion Experiment (MADE) site, have yielded significant advances.&lt;br/&gt;However, many questions and challenges remain regarding transport in highly heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;media, the scale for characterization of subsurface heterogeneity, and the effectiveness of&lt;br/&gt;various models to predict transport in such systems. There is an urgent need to gather the&lt;br/&gt;research community to synthesize the state of current knowledge,  This conference will synthesize what has been learned, identify and prioritize key future challenges in this field, determine promising avenues for improved aquifer characterization and modeling efforts, and, most importantly, catalyze collaborative&lt;br/&gt;and synergistic research by bringing together researchers with a diverse range of expertise to focus on common goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dealing with the effects of high degrees of heterogeneity in aquifers is one of the grand challenges in groundwater hydrology. The unknown and complex makeup of the subsurface hinders our ability to accurately predict flow and transport of contaminants, thus also compromising our ability to reliably remediate currently contaminated sites as well as prevent future contamination. Three decades of research, including experiments at and modeling of the well-known Macrodispersion Experiment (MADE) site near Columbus, Mississippi have yielded significant advances. However, many questions and challenges remain. A consensus arose that there was an urgent need to bring the community together to synthesize the state of current knowledge and define where we should go.      To this end, an AGU Chapman conference (?The MADE Challenge for Groundwater Transport in Highly Heterogeneous Aquifers: Insights from 30 Years of Modeling and Characterization at the Field Scale and Promising Future Directions?) on transport in highly heterogeneous porous media, with a focus on the MADE site, was held at the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia in Spain from October 5-8, 2015. The meeting brought together top researchers from across the world to: 1) discuss the latest advances in subsurface characterization and modeling, 2) define unresolved questions about aquifer characterization and modeling in highly heterogeneous aquifers, and 3) identify promising avenues for future research in these areas.  Having a strong United States presence at this conference ensured that the USA continues to play a leading role in this fundamental and important field of research for years to come. Additionally, it was important that a sufficient fraction of the US representation was made up of young researchers who will ultimately be the leaders of such research efforts in the future. The NSF support from this grant was specifically directed to provide funding for 15 early career US-based researchers including PhD students and postdoctoral fellows, to attend this conference.  Additional support was used to bring three more senior US-based researchers, all foremost authorities in this field, to give invited lectures, as well as partially support travel for three conference conveners from the US, also experts in the field, who beyond organizing the conference also gave presentations there.  The two most significant achievements of this NSF support were: 1) facilitating the attendance of these early-career researchers to ensure that they could interact directly with and learn from leading experts in a productive, collaborative and relaxed environment; and 2) ensure the transfer of knowledge and motivation across generations in this important discipline so that US institutions will continue to produce international leaders in the field.
