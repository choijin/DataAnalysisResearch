<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Miguel Garcia-Garibay from University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and colleagues Louis Bouchard, Richard Kaner, Alexander Spokoyny and Jeffery Zink aquired a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer with solid state capabilities. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as those that allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies impact synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students at the University of California at Los Angeles. This new high-field NMR spectrometer, to be placed in an open-access, shared instrumentation facility, enriches the research experiences of the many graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and undergraduate researchers who pursue research projects utilizing solid-state NMR. The research supported by the use of solid-state NMR is very broad-based, encompassing materials characterization, chemical synthesis, toxicology, and instrumental analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as: (a) amphidynamic crystalline materials based on inertial rotors and dipolar arrays; (b) in situ imaging of chemically reacting flows; (c) high throughput screening of anti-fouling and anti-bacterial coating films; (d) naturally occurring proteins and other biomolecules that act as robust and generalizable dispersing agents for metal oxide nanoparticles; (e) cationic surface coatings on non-toxic nanoparticles that enhance cellular uptake especially those where the toxicity increases with the molecular weight on the polymer coating; (f) the unexpected effect of the aspect ratio of nanorods on cellular uptake; (g) cerium dioxide nanowires of precisely controlled length that can be synthesized using hydrothermal methods; (h) metallic surface states in thalium compounds; (i) robust thin films for desalination; (j) polymers produced from boron-rich clusters; and (k) nanoparticle-based machines for trapping and releasing molecules from mesopores.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is an analytical technique used in synthetic chemistry for structural elucidation.  NMR can be used to determine conformation, or 3D structure, of the molecule of interest either in solution or as part of a crystalline or amorphous solid. NMR can also be used to investigate molecular dynamics, as well as quantitative analysis.  The main goal for this project is the acquisition of a new state-of-the-art high field solid-state NMR spectrometer for the analysis of structurally complex materials. The spectrometer is housed in the UCLA Molecular Instrumentation Center (MIC), which is a campus-wide, integrated facility that provides access to shared, sophisticated instrumentation for the broader research community at UCLA.  For the past 2 years, the new Bruker Avance III HD 600 MHz NMR spectrometer has been producing high quality data to help advance the science in several research groups in the Department of Chemistry at UCLA.  For example, the group of Louis Bouchard studies conventional and novel semiconducting materials. Their research bridges the areas of topological insulators (an area of interest in condensed matter physics over the past decade), nanoscience, and thermoelectricity.  In particular, the ideal topological insulator has a bulk interior characterized by an electrically insulating material, while the boundary exhibits a conductive surface (metallic states). The metallic properties of these edge and surface states display new and unexpected physics. Microscopy techniques (such as STM and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy) have been the main workhorses for the study of these surface states. However, these techniques typically require samples to be either high-quality thin films or single crystals and to be at low temperatures. Solid-state NMR techniques were developed to study these materials at higher temperatures and under ambient conditions, to investigate both lower quality and amorphous materials.  The Richard Kaner group, in the division of inorganic chemistry, focuses on metal borides, which are of scientific interest due to a range of physical properties including superhardness and superconductivity. These superhard materials are characterized by high valence-electron density and are typically metallic. These properties are thought to arise from, or at least be influenced by, the various boron bonding environments found in these materials. Solid-state NMR provides information on the interaction between boron and metal atoms within these structures. The different topology of the boron atoms in the various crystal structures strongly affects the conformation of the charge density of the metal atoms around the boron atom and results in peculiar modifications of their electronic band structures. These modifications result in the very interesting physical properties of these materials, such as superhardness.  The group of Miguel Garc&iacute;a-Garibay designs novel solid structures that incorporate molecular units that rotate in a controlled way to exhibit useful collective effects and properties in the crystal such as dichroism and birefringence.

The instrument has also been used to obtain information about various fluorinated rotors capable of remarkable dielectric behavior. The group is also beginning to characterize the motion of molecular rotors containing magnetic dipole moments using the new instrument.  Researchers from the Jeffrey Zink group study silica (silicon dioxide) particles that are mesoporous.  Different molecules can be attached to the surface of these particles in preparation for interesting future applications ranging from medical imaging with metals bound to the particles to drug loading and triggered release for biomedical applications by pores "capped" with cyclodextrin molecules.  Solid-state NMR spectroscopy has been used to determine the effectiveness of surface functionalization on these particles.  The Yves Rubin group in the Organic Chemistry division has been utilizing the NMR spectrometer for the past two years to carry out experiments to elucidate the structure and physics of insoluble organic polymers and graphene nanoribbons (GNR).   GNR are commonly used in the following applications: Field effect transistors, Light emitting diodes, Solar cell systems, Liquid crystals, and Transparent conductive electrodes among others.
