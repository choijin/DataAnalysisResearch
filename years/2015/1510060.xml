<AbstractNarration>The Fall 2015 meeting of the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference will be at Rice University on November 6-8, 2015. To date the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 52 times. The conference has become an extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The next series of conferences will have seven primary host universities: Rice University, Texas A&amp;M University, The University of Texas at Austin, University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and (jointly) Texas Christian University and The University of Texas at Arlington. By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. In so doing, the conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to discuss their research as well as offering a venue for regional scholars and young people. This stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&amp;M University) on a project to foster research opportunities for select young faculty at these institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the upcoming conference at Rice University will concentrate on "Metric and Conformal Geometry". Accelerated by the work of Gromov, metric techniques have gained an important place in Riemannian geometry, especially in the study of conformal structures. This development has deeply affected understanding, particularly of Teichmuller spaces, conformal dynamics, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and symmetric spaces of non-positive curvature. In recent years, some of these metric techniques have also been important in the study of certain random conformal processes. The conference features leading researchers in these various fields, each of which has roots in metric and conformal geometry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://math.rice.edu/NewsEvents/Conferences/TGTC2015/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference (TGTC) was conceived as a mechanism by which both the educational and the research atmosphere of the community of geometers and topologists could be enhanced.  The TGTC has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 58 times.  There is now considerable research activity in geometry and topology in Texas and the surrounding states.  In order to maintain this, the TGTC is organized so as to advance three specific goals as follows. (1) The TGTC is committed to bringing researchers of national and international stature to Texas to discuss their research and to interact with mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states. (2) The TGTC provides the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states a convenient forum to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis.  The geographic region is so large that few reasonable alternatives exist.  The conference strongly encourages both individual research and productive cooperative efforts between schools. (3) The TGTC is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base.  Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate.  One outcome has been the development of an ongoing collaboration among the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference, Fayetteville State University, and Prairie View A&amp;M University, whereby young faculty from these institutions attended all six conferences (two per conference).  These faculty have reported favorably about research contacts made, pertinent talks, and present and future ideas and publications.
