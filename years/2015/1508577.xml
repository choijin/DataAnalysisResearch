<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Society has long been fascinated by diamond as the hardest known substance. Can a material harder than diamond be created? Answering this question is not so straightforward because the very definition of hardness employs diamond as the reference, and when materials under test approach or potentially exceed the hardness of the diamond-based indenter, results are difficult to interpret. A new class of superhard materials is being developed based upon nano-polycrystalline or nano-twinned structures of diamond and related compounds containing carbon, boron and nitrogen together in the same structural configuration as diamond. These materials are synthesized at high pressures and high temperatures in large-volume presses. Physical properties of novel superhard materials are investigated using a newly-developed ultrasonic system that measures the speed of sound waves at GHz frequencies. The results precisely determine physical properties such as the shear modulus, which are fundamentally correlated to hardness. New materials rivaling or potentially exceeding natural diamond in hardness and thermal stability can make possible the fabrication of ultrahard machine parts that do not burn or wear down under stress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: High-pressure high-temperature synthesis of single-crystals intermediate in composition between cubic-boron nitride (c-BN) and diamond demonstrate a solid-solution wherein hardness and thermal stability are optimized for a certain range of compositions. Identifying the ideal composition requires improved measurement and theoretical understanding of hardness-elasticity relationships. Whereas conventional hardness measurements on materials harder than c-BN are difficult to interpret because of plastic deformation of the indenter, a novel GHz-ultrasonic interferometer is developed to measure the elastic constants of materials in the superhard and ultrahard classes with very-high precision. Under that direction, diamond-like compounds containing carbon, nitrogen, and boron and having nano-polycrystalline or nano-twinned structure are targeted to produce materials without cleavage, with high thermal stability, and with hardness rivaling and potentially exceeding natural diamond. The research improves the fundamental understanding of the relationship between hardness and elasticity thus advancing the ability to design and predict the properties of ultrahard materials. The proposal is timed to take advantage of newly developed synthesis techniques and characterization methods. Graduate student training focuses on skills for job placement in related fields in industry, academia, and at the National laboratories. Outreach activities feature participation in Project Excite, a program providing after-school enrichment experiences in science and mathematics to minority students from local elementary schools.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>High-pressure research and development of functional, diamond-like superhard materials for applications in ceramics, high-power electronics, magnetic materials, and energy materials have the potential to impact society in areas of national security, job creation through technical training, and economic growth through industrial applications. Under this award, research improved our fundamental understanding of how hardness, elastic properties, defects, and mechanical properties relate to one another in high-pressure ultrahard and superhard ceramics. The primary defects in both natural and synthetic diamond include nitrogen (N), and boron (B), which can substitute for carbon (C) in the diamond structure. Such defects can not only affect the color of diamond, but contribute to useful properties such as semiconducting behavior. The interest in defects had two-fold purpose: to explore hardness-elasticity relationships in the large gap between the hardest industrial material, cubic boron-nitride (with Vickers Hardness, Hv ~60 GPa) and pure diamond (Hv ~120 GPa), by studying defect diamond (mainly boron-doped diamond) and also B-C-N solid solutions in the diamond structure. The second interest in defects pertains to creating and characterizing superhard materials with useful electronic characteristics such as p- and n-type semiconductivity. The PI's experimental mineral and materials physics laboratory at Northwestern University specializes in high-pressure science and technology, with applications ranging from materials science for extreme environments to geophysics and synthetic chemistry. Graduate students participating in this award were trained in a diverse range of activities revolving around the general area of high-pressure science of ceramics and glasses in extreme environments. Science goals included gaining a fundamental understanding of physical properties in the extreme, such as bonding and elasticity. New ultrahard B-C-N nanocomposites as well as boron and oxygen-doped diamond were synthesized and characterized as having high thermal stability and/or semiconducting behavior. Such materials may find eventual application as high-temperature abrasives or electronic components for high-power applications and use in extreme environments. In collaboration with theorists at Northwestern, the PI participated in a study to explore and predict high-pressure phases using a new high-throughput linear approximation to enthalpy (LAE) method. In collaboration with a solid-state chemistry group at Northwestern, several of the LAE-predicted intermetallic compounds of bismuth were realized experimentally using in-situ high-pressure high-temperature diffraction at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. New research directions emanating from this award mirror the goals of creating materials for extreme environments by harnessing extreme environments to create new materials with various societal applications.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/15/2018<br>      Modified by: Steven&nbsp;D&nbsp;Jacobsen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
