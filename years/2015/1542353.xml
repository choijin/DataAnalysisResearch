<AbstractNarration>The Analysis and Visualization of large scale data is a major challenge of modern science. As new data acquisition devices are built to generate more accurate, high resolution information, scientist struggle with the difficulty of gaining access and making practical use of the information generated. Doctors need to be able to make diagnoses with high resolution pathology images to make the best diagnoses for their patients. Researchers need to use high resolution microscopy data to gain a better understanding of human biology. Engineers need to explore high resolution sensing and simulated data to develop new processes and devices. For these reasons, large data analysis and visualization tools proposed in this project are becoming a critical component in the science discovery process. This new management and processing of Big Data allows translating raw data into faster discovery and understanding leading to actionable information, such as the diagnosis from a doctor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed ViSUS software framework was designed with the primary philosophy that the visualization of massive data need not be tied to specialized hardware or infrastructure. In other words, a visualization environment for large data can be designed to be lightweight, highly scalable and run on a variety of platforms or hardware. The proposed software can visualize data from nearly any image capture source or simulation. Due to the large size of datasets, it is emphasized that the data samples cannot all be loaded into main memory. As a result, it is not feasible to use standard implementations of visualization and analysis algorithms on commodity hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to complete the first release with the minimum features needed to turn the proposed software into a commercial product. The team also intends to conduct a pilot test to gather concrete customer feedback in functionalities and user interactions while making the first release available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Our NSF award allowed us to  participate in the NSF Innovation Corps Teams Program in the Georgia Tech April 2015 Cohort  with a Kick-off workshop from  April 13-15, five online classes on Tuesdays, 1-4 PM Eastern, April 21, 28, May 5, 12, 19, and a final workshop: May 28-29.  Every week we had to make contact with 10 to 15 customers via in person visits, video conferencing, or sometimes phone calls, in order to meet a goal of having conducted 100 interviews from April 13th to May 28th.  Additionally, every week throughout the workshop we presented in a 10 minute talk to our peers and the teaching team what we did, what we learned and what we were going to do next.   All of the lessons learned in our journey were placed in the context of a Business Model Canvas, particularly focusing on defining our Customer Segment and Value Proposition, as well as Customer Relationships, Channels, Key Activities, Key Resources, Key Partners, Cost Structure, and Revenue Streams. The overarching goal of the work conducted during the granting period was to find where the pains of the customers we interviewed overlapped with solutions our technology may provide.  We pivoted from our original hypothesis of a market in histopathology labs to using our technology to enable farmers and crop consultants to fully utilize massive aerial surveys seamlessly in management deci- sions, a transformative capability leading to reduced inputs (fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides) and increased yields.  The outcomes of our award include identification of the customers for our technology, and preparation for applying for further funding through the NSF SBIR program in order to conduct the research necessary to create a software product for use in agriculture.
