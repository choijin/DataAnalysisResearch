<AbstractNarration>Los Angeles Pierce College Engineering Graphics &amp; Design Technology (EG&amp;DT) and Architecture Technology (AT) programs are bridging the disconnect between learning and perceived relevance by providing students with opportunities to develop and implement solutions to problems in their community. The project replicates professional experiences while providing direct benefits to society as students design and implement solutions to existing problems in a multidisciplinary, collaborative environment. The Collaboratory Achievement Project To Impact the Value of Architecture &amp; Engineering Technology Education (CAPTIVATE) develops a program where students engage with effective role models, have culturally responsive experiences, and recognize the EG&amp;DT and AT programs as a pathway to professions with social impact. This approach benefits students, campus, employers, and the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Los Angeles Pierce College is working to engage EG&amp;DT and AT students in an experiential learning environment that fosters students' intrinsic motivation in order to advance them toward a credential and strengthen their 21st century skills, particularly problem-solving and collaboration. CAPTIVATE coordinates curricular and extracurricular projects consisting of six key components: project-based learning, multidisciplinary collaboration, real-world connection, community partnerships, tangible impact, and environmental sustainability. Los Angeles Pierce College will strengthen its partnerships with area businesses by aligning curriculum with workforce needs, and providing a conduit for meaningful engagement across the sector. Los Angeles Pierce College is developing a replicable framework that includes generalized and project specific outcomes. Models developed through this project will be shared with other institutions and faculty that are looking to make meaningful change in their programs.</AbstractNarration>

Additionally, implementation of Collaboratory projects created mutual benefit to students and the local community, with projects that addressed water capture in drought prone areas, the reduction of waste through composting systems, and the development of urban farming systems for campus food production to support students facing food insecurity.  These projects led students to recognize their potential to positively impact their local community and society as a whole.
