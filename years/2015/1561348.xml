<AbstractNarration>Cyberinfrastructure enables collaborative research and significantly impacts scientific capacity and knowledge diffusion. In response to the growing need for quantitatively evaluating outcomes and impact of federal investment on research, this project deploys new data, tools, metrics, and methods for assessing the impact of cyberinfrastructures and the data services built on them. This research helps researchers and policy makers understand how cyberinfrastructure affects collaboration dynamics and network structures of researchers.  Datasets organized by longitudinal, thematic, topical, geographical, institutional, and author dimensions provided, which researchers, policy makers, and students can access and use to explore data-intensive science of science and innovation policy related research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metadata from GenBank, patent data from U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and funding data from NIH ExPORT are analyzed with descriptive statistics and models from Complex Network Analysis. The project not only examines the topological properties of the data submission and publication networks, but also the temporal ordering of collaborative relationships and the overlap of the sequence submission and publication networks. Through slicing, plotting, and visualizing data, appropriate sampling strategies and algorithms are developed to more deeply explore collaboration networks, both structurally and temporally. Algorithms used in community detection, machine learning, and visualization serve as primary computational methods in this research. Data products to be shared with research communities include 1) discovery lifecycle datasets containing sequence submissions, publications, and patents as well as the links between them and 2) funding factor datasets containing links between U.S. federal funding data and the discovery lifecycle datasets.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Collaboration Capacity </em>is a term used to describe the ability of an individual, group, or institution to assemble and effectively use the S&amp;T human capital in collaborative research. It measures not only how much S&amp;T human capital one may accrue but more importantly, how effectively he or she can utilize the S&amp;T human capital to enhance collaboration capacity. This project developed a Collaboration Capacity Framework and used a novel data source?GenBank metadata and incorporated patent data to empirically test and validate the Framework. The Framework considers S&amp;T human capital, cyberinfrastructure, and science policy as enablers for collaboration capacity. Cyberinfrastructure includes data and publication repositories, software tools, and discovery services. Science policy ensures resource allocation and dissemination of research outputs. The Framework provides not only a theoretical lens for examining and interpreting how three enablers impact collaboration capacity, but also operationalizes the metrics for assessing their impact. Two groups of measures are included in the Framework: &nbsp;the data production measures, such as team size, node positions in network, connectedness of nodes, data submission counts, and dataset size, and the data-to-knowledge measures, including publication productivity, ratio of data submissions to publications and to patents, ratio changes over time, time from data submissions to publications and to patents, team size vs. data submission network dynamics.</p> <p>Another contribution of this project is the creation of a data collection that contains GenBank metadata from its inception in 1982 to December 2018 and related patent data. This data collection contains 1,232,866 authors in data submissions, 872,328 authors in publications, and 243,120 patents with 523,576 inventors/authors, which generated about 1.5 million cumulative connections between authors in the patent network, 6 million in the publication network, and 5.3 million in the dataset submission network. The analysis of this data collection so far has generated a number of significant findings:</p> <ol> <li>Changes in the ratio of data submissions vs. publications can be an indication of collaboration capacity for research teams or individuals. The result shows that there was a gradual increment in the ratio of data submissions vs. publications in GenBank up until 2005, and then the ratio sharply increased from 1.09 to 4.01 around 2006. Such an increase in number of data submissions (as well as authors) in producing the same publication suggests that publications on average are building on more sequences than before. In other words, data-intensive science raised the need for more data to support a publication. &nbsp;</li> <li>There was a sharp drop in the total number of authors in the data submissions network from 2016 to 2018. This finding resonates with a research finding that there has been a steady drop in grant-eligible young principal investigators (PIs) in NIH R01 grant awards. Coincidentally, the number of sequences submitted to GenBank started to drop sharply in 2013: the rate of increase from a peak 28% in 2005 decreased to 5.08% in 2013 and subsequently to 1.92% in 2019, a historically low rate of increase in sequence data submissions. </li> <li>The percentages of authors overlapping across data submission, publication, and patent networks have been low for all the time covered by the dataset. Most authors in data submission and publication networks were not in the patent network. Even though there was an upward trend, these percentages were still lingering between 10-18%. The author overlapping percentages between data submissions and publications were much higher compared to those for the patent network. However, these percentages were never above 50% over the time period under study. The low overlap percentages in authors in three networks reveal some potential areas for further investigation: crediting culture in research community, "invisible labor" related to data production, and the impact of these practices on workforce and productivity.&nbsp;</li> <li>The number of authors in data submission networks had a steep but steady increase up until 2016. Then starting from 2016, the decrease in the number of authors in the data submission network was alarmingly fast. Both publication and patent author networks had a relatively flat increase over the two decades and similar decreasing pattern, though not as alarming as the data submission network. </li> <li>The clustering coefficients for both publication and data submission networks showed a downward trend while that of the patent network remained relatively flat and started an upward trend in 2016. The decrease in clustering coefficients suggests that the GenBank networks are no longer dominated by a small number of highly connected ?hub? nodes as they were during the 1990s and early 2000?s and tend to be flatter with scattered, smaller interconnected clusters.<strong> </strong>This was also observed from the network visualizations. Starting from 2008, the networks became less concentrated on one dominant hub. More regional clusters or communities emerged with strong local connections. </li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/24/2019<br>      Modified by: Jian&nbsp;Qin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577190484822_CCF--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577190484822_CCF--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Collaboration Capacity Framework"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577190484822_CCF--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Collaboration Capacity Framework"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Collaboration Capacity Framework</div> <div class="imageCredit">Created by Jian Qin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jian&nbsp;Qin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Collaboration Capacity Framework</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577191109563_clusteringcoefficient--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577191109563_clusteringcoefficient--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Clustering coefficient"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577191109563_clusteringcoefficient--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Clustering coefficient"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Clustering coefficient distributions for data submission, patent, and publication networks: 1992-2018</div> <div class="imageCredit">Created by Jian Qin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jian&nbsp;Qin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Clustering coefficient</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577190645754_#authorsinthreenetworks--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577190645754_#authorsinthreenetworks--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Numbers of authors in three networks"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577190645754_#authorsinthreenetworks--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Numbers of authors in three networks"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Number of authors by number of publications, data submissions, and patent applications in GenBank, 1992-2018</div> <div class="imageCredit">Created by Jian Qin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jian&nbsp;Qin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Numbers of authors in three networks</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577191312186_overlappingauthors--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577191312186_overlappingauthors--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Overlapping authors"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577191312186_overlappingauthors--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Overlapping authors"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Percentages of overlapping authors in publications, data submissions, and patent applications in GenBank, 1992-2018</div> <div class="imageCredit">Created by Jian Qin</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jian&nbsp;Qin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Overlapping authors</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577192376437_datasubmissionnetworks2005and2018--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577192376437_datasubmissionnetworks2005and2018--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Data submission networks"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561348/1561348_10441831_1577192376437_datasubmissionnetworks2005and2018--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Data submission networks"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Data submission network in 2005 when the increase of sequences submitted was at its peak time and in 2018 when both the sequences submitted and data authors were at the lowest level.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Created by Jian Qin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jian&nbsp;Qin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Data submission networks</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
