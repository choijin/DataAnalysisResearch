<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Diana Aga and Professor Mary A Bisson of the University at Buffalo to investigate the influence of plants on the surface chemistry, fate and toxicity of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) that are becoming widely used in many industrial, agricultural and consumer products.  Plants are among the organisms that will be directly impacted by ENMs entering the environment, therefore an improved understanding of the uptake mechanisms and translocation of ENMs by plants is needed to facilitate the assessment of potential risks associated with environmental contamination by ENMs.  The broader impacts of this work include the generation of fundamental knowledge that is critical in developing new regulations to minimize the negative impacts of ENMs, and in promoting compatibility between environmental safety and nanotechnology. Experiments in environmental science are being developed for a science summer camp geared toward middle school children who are disabled and/or economically disadvantaged. The research team is also introducing educational materials to area high school teachers on the applications and implications of nanotechnology that can be incorporated into the high school science curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these goals, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are used as model ENM and Arabidopsis thaliana serves as the model plant species in the series of experiments that are being performed to elucidate the mechanisms of internalization and transformation of AgNPs in plants.  This research identifies important interactions between AgNPs and natural organic compounds in plant root exudates that result in surface modifications and changes in the speciation of ENMs. The composition of root exudates from Arabidopsis thaliana, and the changes that occur when plant is treated with AgNPs are being characterized using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Wild type and mutant species Arabidopsis are used to determine the role of endocytosis mechanism and metal transporters in the uptake of ENMs. The localization and speciation of Ag in the plant cells are being determined by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Engineered nanomaterials</strong> (ENMs) are used in a myriad of applications in agriculture, therapeutics, environmental remediation, and consumer products, leading to concerns of possible negative impacts on the environment and human health during unintentional exposure. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) are two of the most widely used ENMs in consumer products and agriculture due to their antimicrobial properties and low-cost. As a result, these ENMs are likely to be introduced into the environment as contaminants, when products containing AgNPs or CuO NPs are disposed of in landfills, or leach out from products during washing, reaching wastewater treatment plants and eventually surface waters. Increasingly, treated wastewater is reclaimed for non-potable water reuse, such as in agricultural and landscape irrigation. This practice can introduce contaminants into the environment, potentially exposing plants and animals to ENMs. Therefore, in this study, the bioaccumulation and toxicological effects of AgNPs and CuO NPs were evaluated on a mode plant (Arabidopsis Thaliana) and on different human cell lines, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>: In order to study the effects of ENMs at concentrations that are below their LD50 (lethal dose that causes death of 50% of the tested organisms upon one-time exposure), a novel approach called metabolomics was used. This method allows for the comprehensive analysis of the changes in the biochemistry in the test organism by measuring the concentrations of amino acids and lipids upon exposure to different levels of ENMs. Metabolomics focuses on the analysis of small molecules (primary and secondary metabolites) that provide information on the mechanism of ENM toxicity on plants and animals at sub-lethal dose or concentrations that are environmentally-relevant. The study also used imaging techniques to locate the ENMs in the specific tissues of the plants. Finally, the concentrations of ENMs that accumulated in the test organisms were determined in order to evaluate the extent at which metals from the ENMs are taken up in tissues.&nbsp;&nbsp;Results from these studies revealed that even low-levels of AgNPs and CuO NPs elicit responses in plants and human cells that may result in long-term chronic effects that may not be manifested by changes in plant growth or by counting cell death, but rather can only be measured using a metabolomics approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the combination of imaging and metabolomics approaches provided a better understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity of these ENMs on the model plant and human cell lines used in these studies. The fundamental knowledge obtained from this research will be critical in developing new regulations to minimize the negative impacts of ENMs, and promote compatibility between environmental safety and advancements in nanotechnology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>: All members of this team served as research mentors for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students who participated in research related to the impacts of ENMs on plants and animals, as well as in the development of analytical tools used in metabolomics, cell imaging, and chemical analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Innovative experiments in Environmental Science were developed and implemented in high-needs urban schools; development of science and technology classroom materials are aligned with state science learning standards, and inquiry-based curricula.
