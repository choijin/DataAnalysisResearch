<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), entitled, "Bioengineering and Biomanufacturing", will engage a diverse cohort of students in research projects with an intellectual focus on engineering biological systems and biomanufacturing. A combination of computational and experimental research will be conducted on projects related to biomedical, chemical or biological engineering. The development of engineered biological systems for medical, biotechnological or chemical applications remains an important research challenge for a broad range of applications.  The proposed REU site will focus on both the research and development that goes into developing new bio-based technologies and their manufacture.  The proposed integrated training experience will guide undergraduate students, recruited from underrepresented groups from non-research-intensive schools, through a research project; while also helping them understand how they could pursue an engineering career. Cohort building and inter-cohort interactions between REU students and graduate/high-school students will be integrated into the program for community building and to provide students with opportunities for mentoring and to serve as mentors to future engineers and scientists. The programs' research results will be disseminated broadly by the PIs, participating faculty, and students via scientific publications, conference presentations, and internet-accessble materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each undergraduate student will conduct research over a ten week summer experience on a project that is designed for his/her abilities, under the mentorship of both a faculty member and graduate student. The twenty participating REU faculty have highly active, externally funded research programs and include undergraduates in their research teams and as co-authors on publications. Weekly workshops that address communication, ethics, mentoring, and the nature of research will help the students gain professional skills and personal confidence that are critical for their success.</AbstractNarration>

The results of these efforts were that the REU program received 131 applications for summer 2017, 144 applications for summer 2018, and 137 applications for summer 2019. The REU program was very successful in attracting a large number of applications in each of the three years and overall the application profiles were stable throughout the period of the grant. The number of female applications fluctuated between 78 and 75, which corresponds to 54-55% of the applicants being female, and the number of URM applications was between 24 and 27 which is approximately 20% of the received applications for each year. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">These numbers clearly show that the recruiting efforts were able to attract a large, and diverse number of applications.</span></p> <p><strong>REU Student Data</strong></p> <p>The quality of the applications received was also excellent. This enabled the PI to accept a diverse group of excellent students for each year of the program. Additionally, the students&rsquo; acceptance rate of the offer to participate in the REU was very high (&gt;80%). A total of 30 students participated in the program during the three year time frame. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At least 60% of the REU students for each of the three years were women</span> and the program hosted between three and seven REU students each year who belonged to an underrepresented group. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The average GPA of the students participating in the program was very high</span>, between 3.8 and 3.9, for each year in the program. This was mainly due to the large and deep pool of excellent applicants.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The goals set for recruiting and participation of students from underrepresented groups as well as the qualifications of the students were met or exceeded for each year of the grant. </span></p> <p><strong>Performed Research and Publications/Presentations</strong></p> <p>There were three specific research-related milestones that the students had to meet for the REU: (1) a brief presentation of what their work is going to be about after a week in the program, (2) an extended abstract of their work approximately halfway through the program, and (3) a poster presentation at a symposium during the last week of the program. In addition to this, the students were asked to participate in the activities of the groups that they were assigned to.</p> <p>As a general rule, each REU student was assigned to one faculty mentor and one graduate student mentor. Several publications and presentations at national/international meetings resulted from the work performed by the REU students (two journal papers in press and 20 conference presentations).</p> <p><strong>Results from Pre-/Post-REU Student Surveys</strong></p> <p>Prior to the 2017 REU, two of the students had not been previously exposed to research and only 1/3 student had previously been engaged in a summer research program. Despite those numbers, 6 of the 9 students expressed an interest in graduate school and the remaining 3 were undecided per the pre-REU survey. The students were given the same survey at the end of the REU. 8 of the 9 students stated that they wanted to go to graduate school and obtain a PhD and one student expressed an interest in getting a job after obtaining a BS degree. All students stated that the REU helped them with forming an opinion on what they wanted to do in their careers.</p> <p>For the 2018 REU, three of the students had not been previously exposed to research and only 1 student had previously been engaged in a summer research program. Despite those numbers, 7 of the 10 students expressed an interest in graduate school and the remaining 3 were undecided per the pre-REU survey. The students were given the same survey at the end of the REU. Nine of the ten students stated that they wanted to go to graduate school and obtain a PhD and the tenth student was now considering either graduate or medical schools. All students stated that the REU helped them with forming an opinion on what they wanted to do in their careers.</p> <p>For the 2019 REU, half the students had either no prior exposure to research or only in an unstructured setting. Four of the students indicated that they were planning to study towards a PhD and two were considering attending professional school prior to the REU. At the end of the REU, these numbers increased to eight and two, respectively.</p> <p>While one has to be careful when analyzing data with just 10 data points for each year, there was a clear trend in the data showing that <em>the REU program increased the students&rsquo; interest in going to graduate and/or professional school.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/02/2019<br>      Modified by: Juergen&nbsp;Hahn</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311522829_P8010471--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311522829_P8010471--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU Poster Presentation 2019"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311522829_P8010471--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU Poster Presentation 2019"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU Poster Presentation 2019</div> <div class="imageCredit">Juergen Hahn</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Juergen&nbsp;Hahn</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU Poster Presentation 2019</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311558210_P8010474--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311558210_P8010474--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU Poster Presentation 2019"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311558210_P8010474--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU Poster Presentation 2019"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU Poster Presentation 2019</div> <div class="imageCredit">Juergen Hahn</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Juergen&nbsp;Hahn</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU Poster Presentation 2019</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311602548_P8010477--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311602548_P8010477--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU Poster Presentation 2019"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311602548_P8010477--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU Poster Presentation 2019"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU Poster Presentation 2019</div> <div class="imageCredit">Juergen Hahn</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Juergen&nbsp;Hahn</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU Poster Presentation 2019</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311774422_IMG_1817--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311774422_IMG_1817--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU 2018 Lab Work"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311774422_IMG_1817--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU 2018 Lab Work"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU 2018 Lab Work</div> <div class="imageCredit">Juergen Hahn</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Juergen&nbsp;Hahn</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU 2018 Lab Work</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311932621_IMG_1832--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311932621_IMG_1832--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU 2018 Lab Work"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559963/1559963_10431266_1575311932621_IMG_1832--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU 2018 Lab Work"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU 2018 Lab Work</div> <div class="imageCredit">Juergen Hahn</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Juergen&nbsp;Hahn</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU 2018 Lab Work</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
