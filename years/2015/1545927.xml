<AbstractNarration>Mountains form natural barriers to wind flow.  As winds in general, and storms in particular, approach mountain ranges, mountain waves develop above and downstream of the barrier.  At the same time, low-level flow may become blocked and diverted around the periphery of the mountains.  These flows are often too small in scale to be accurately captured by global weather and climate models, but produce drag on the large-scale flow that must be parameterized.  This research includes the training and professional development of two graduate students, including one under-represented minority.  Results will be shared through journal articles and conference presentations, including webinars organized by the Mountain Meteorology Committee of the American Meteorological Society (AMS).  The results of this research will also benefit water resource managers, hydrologists and those studying the current state of our climate and potential future shifts in mid-latitude storms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study attempts to place parameterization on a firmer theoretical foundation.  The large-scale responses to orographic drag will be studied through the analysis of high-resolution numerical simulations.  Heavy precipitation over mountains is largely driven by the passage of large-scale weather systems.  Prototypical theoretical studies of the interactions of these weather systems with idealized mountain ranges have not previously been undertaken due to the complexity of modeling large- and small-scale flows.   This research builds on prior studies of multi-scale interactions in dry air flow by the inclusion of moist flow as a result of the combination of mid-latitude cyclones and more localized ascent forced by topography into vigorous updrafts and enhanced precipitation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mountains exert a profound influence on the weather and climate. In this project we investigated two important aspects of the interaction between mountains and the atmosphere.  A common thread in both investigations was the use of state-of-the-art computer models to study fundamental mountain-weather relationships. The first sub-project examined process that typically occur when a current of air, with or without significant moisture, flows over a mountain range. The second sub-project examines how precipitation is enhanced as mid-latitude low-pressure systems encounter mountains.     When an air stream encounters a mountain barrier, "mountain waves" may be set up above and downstream of the barrier, and the low-level flow may be blocked and diverted around the flanks of the mountain. These disturbances are too small in scale to be resolved in global weather and climate models, but they produce an important drag on the large-scale flow that must be parameterized. In this project we helped place such parameterizations on a firmer theoretical footing and also determine the large-scale responses to orographic drag through the analysis of high-resolution numerical simulations.  In particular we showed how the wave response and associated wave drag differ in a slowly evolving prototypical atmospheric environment from that in a much studied but over-idealized numerical experiment where the mountain is exposed to a time-independent and horizontally homogeneous oncoming flow.     We also showed how mountain waves can have a major impact on the distribution of the energy of atmospheric motions across different horizontal scales.  Our results help answer a long-debated question about the processes responsible for the observed distribution that dates back 50 years.  This topic is important because the rate at which energy falls off from a maximum at planetary scales, to smaller values at shorter spatial scales (like the size of thunderstorms), is believed to be the major factor determining the intrinsic predictability of atmospheric motions and their associated weather patterns.     Although heavy precipitation over mountains is largely driven by the episodic passage of large-scale weather systems, prototypical theoretical studies of the interactions of an isolated ridge with such systems had not yet been undertaken, due in part, to the difficulty of simultaneously modeling complex large- and small-scale flows. In this we research we demonstrated that the combined influence of lifting due to mid-latitude cyclones, together with the more localized ascent forced by the topography, can produce more precipitation than that which would be obtained from a simple sum of the vertical velocities generated separately by the mountain without the cyclone or the cyclone without the mountain. We identified several factors that could be responsible for this, including nonlinearly enhanced updraft velocities and changes in the processes that govern the formation of rain and snow inside clouds.     Broader impacts of this research include the professional development of three graduate students whose work was wholly or partially supported by this grant.  All these students developed scientific and communication skills.  The P.I. also worked with a National Weather Service forecaster to help unravel a puzzling high wind event in eastern Nebraska.   Most broadly, orographic precipitation is a key source of water for a large fraction of humanity. By developing a better understanding of how precipitation is enhanced when large-scale weather systems pass over topography, this research can provide guidance to water resource managers and hydrologists trying to maintain water supplies in the current climate and planning for the effect of possible future shifts in mid-latitude storminess.
