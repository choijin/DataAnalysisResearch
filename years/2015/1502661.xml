<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Jeffrey Galkowski is "Scattering by thin barriers and quantum ergodicity for mixed systems." The host institution for the fellowship is Stanford University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Andras Vasy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant DMS-1502661 resulted in twenty publications and preprints and helped to organize an important summer school in semiclassical analysis.  Intellectual Merit: The research produced from this project falls into several projects. The first project unified the treatment of sup norms norms and averages for Laplace eigenfunctions, extended and improved all known bounds on sup norms and averages, and resulted in the first quantitative improvements under dynamical assumptions. The next project studied the L^2 behavior of restrictions of eigenfunctions to hypersurfaces. One paper gave sharp upper bounds on the growth of an eigenfunction hear the glancing set and another paper proved unique continuation type lower bounds for Cauchy data on open subsets of hypersurfaces. Moreover, under a geometric control assumption these unique continuation type lower bounds can be replaced by uniform lower bounds. These results also produce null-controllability for the heat and wave equations from a hypersurface. The next project concerns quantum chaos and showed that every Laplace operator is arbitrarily close (in a certain operator norm) to being quantum unique ergodic. That is, to an operator all of whose eigenfunctions distribute uniformly on the cosphere bundle. The next project cocerns the Steklov problem and studies the interior behavior of Steklov eigenfunctions. The first article proved a conjecture of Hislop--Lutzer on the decay of Steklov eigenfunctions; harmonic extensions of eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet to Neuamann map on a manifold with boundary. The next article considered the two dimensional case and show that these harmonic extensions typically oscillate very slowly away from the boundary.  The next two projects concern scattering theory. The first, concerns resolvent and resonance bounds scattering on general manifolds. This project, consisting of three articles, produced sharp estimates sharp estimates on resonance free regions when singularities escape at a fixed rate, the first fractal Weyl laws on the number of resonances for general trapping, and optimal bounds on resolvents for non-trapping manifolds.
