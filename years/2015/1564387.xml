<AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor William Taylor of the University of Central Arkansas and his undergraduate research team are studying reactions between small molecules and ions which both contain atoms of halogen elements (the halogens include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine). The ions contain transition metal elements (for example copper, nickel or gold).  Many important industrial processes today involve catalysts that contain transition metal atoms.  The studies in Professor Taylor's laboratory thus inform the broader area of catalysis, which is a key part of the production of an estimated 90% of all chemical products.  Catalytic processes have a tangible environmental benefit by either direct remediation of pollutants or by reducing the environmental burden of industrial chemical production. Undergraduates participating in this work benefit from a valuable research experience that increases retention rates in the sciences, and prepares them for a variety of career choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores the influence of electronic modifications to metal centers via the ligand environment on bond activation in neutral molecules. Studies addressed in this project examine the chemistry of MX+ (M=Ni, Cu, Au; X=F, Cl, Br, I) with a number of halogenated compounds known to be potent greenhouse gases and ozone depleters. In addition, reactions of CuX+ and AuX+ (X=Cl, F) with methane are examined in order to explore low-energy processes leading to the functionalization of this abundant, yet relatively inert, chemical resource. All reactions are studied experimentally in the gas phase using a selected ion drift cell reactor which generates transition metal ions in a sputtering glow discharge source. These metal ions are then be chemically modified with the addition of the desired halogen, mass selected, and introduced into a drift cell containing the neutral reactant molecule of interest.  Analysis of reaction products is carried out using a second quadrupole. Experimental results are complemented computationally with density functional calculations and MP2 theory to gain additional insights into possible reaction mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>
