<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, co-funded by the Divisions of Materials Research and Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation, is to enable 20 U.S. students and 10 U.S. new investigators to attend the 23rd World Forum on Advanced Materials, to be held May 11-15, 2015, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The Forum, also known as the PolyChar short courses and conference, is focused on polymer properties, characterization, synthesis, and processing. The Forum is an international meeting that is returning to the U.S. after over ten years and will be bringing experts from around the world to the U.S.  PolyChar 23 will consist of a day of 9 short courses by leading international scientists, followed by 4 days of symposia, including 4 plenary talks by leading scientists in the field, 2 plenary talks by young scientists, and the Flory medalist talk. The funds from NSF, and commitments from other resources, will be used to organize and attract a diverse group of U.S. graduate students, U.S. young investigators, high school teachers and their students, STEM students from four-year regional colleges, and international students and young investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, co-funded by the Divisions of Materials Research and Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation, is to enable 20 U.S. students and 10 U.S. new investigators to attend the 23rd World Forum on Advanced Materials, to be held May 11-15, 2015, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

The Forum is an international meeting that is returning to the U.S. after over ten years and will be bringing experts from around the world to the U.S.   PolyChar 23 will consist of a day of 9 short courses covering areas in microscopy, photochemistry, wear and scratch resistance, solid-state NMR, rheology and processing, glass transition, scattering, dynamic mechanical properties, and micromechanics. This is followed by 4 days of symposia, including 4 plenary talks by leading scientists in the field, 2 plenary talks by young scientists, and the Flory medalist talk. The funds from NSF, and commitments from other resources, will be used to organize and attract a diverse group of U.S. graduate students, U.S. young investigators, high school teachers and their students, STEM students from four-year regional colleges, and international students and young investigators.</AbstractNarration>
