<AbstractNarration>The conference "Lie Algebras, Vertex Operator Algebras, and Related Topics" will take place August 14-18, 2015 at the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana. The conference web page is http://www3.nd.edu/~conf/LieConf15/. This conference will bring together junior and senior researchers engaged in mathematical research related to the intersection of and interaction between the fields of algebra, geometry, and theoretical physics. The broader impacts are twofold: training of younger scientists and dissemination of new results and techniques. Expository talks by senior researchers will introduce junior researchers to the frontiers of mathematical research in the topics of the conference. The conference will provide an excellent setting for the exchange of ideas and for developing new collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is intended to be an important occasion for deepening and developing our understanding of  Lie algebras, vertex algebras, quantum groups, and related structures from several different perspectives (algebraic, combinatorial and geometric), with some emphasis given to those fields of mathematics in which James Lepowsky and Robert Wilson made significant contributions. This conference is a necessary component in the timely development of these and related areas, especially in view of rapid developments in theoretical physics. The focus of this conference will be on the following topics: Representation theory of Lie algebras and quantum groups; Vertex operator algebras and their representations; and applications of Lie algebras, quantum groups and vertex operator algebras to other areas of mathematics and mathematical physics.</AbstractNarration>

These researchers came together to celebrate the work of James Lepowsky and Robert Wilson, share the newest results in their field &mdash; the algebraic and geometric foundations of string theory and related pure and applied mathematics arising in these models. They discussed important open problems related to areas of pure mathematics and applications to physical models, including string theory, number theory, topology, and the study of symmetries that help us better understand deep mathematical mysteries and develop models for the world in which we live. Many graduate students and early career mathematicians participated. New results and techniques were presented. And a significant portion (25%) of the participants were women. The conference proceedings was published this year as "Recent Advances in Lie Algebras, Vertex Operator Algebras and Related Topics" in Contemporary Mathematics, 695 (2017), American Mathematical Society. The conference expanded our knowledge and understanding of Lie algebras, quantum groups, vertex algebras, and related areas in mathematics, and helped researchers keep abreast of the rapid developments in areas of theoretical physics and mathematics.  The conference helped in the training of younger scientists, helped to disseminate new results and techniques, allowed for meaningful exchanges and interactions of researchers across disciplines within mathematics and physics.  The resulting conference proceedings is of benefit not only to the participants, but also to all researchers in mathematics and physics who have interest in these important areas of research.
