<AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State governments are commonly referred to as "laboratories of democracy?"because for many&lt;br/&gt;decades they have experimented with new policy solutions to society's most important problems.&lt;br/&gt;Public policy scholars and practitioners of politics often look to the states for innovative policies&lt;br/&gt;that can be emulated by other governments across the country; a process referred to as policy&lt;br/&gt;diffusion. However, the complex relationships between the states (that is, the patterns,&lt;br/&gt;pathways, and mechanisms underlying how policies actually diffuse from one state to another)&lt;br/&gt;are not well understood. In this research, the PIs develop innovative tools and&lt;br/&gt;data to facilitate the large-scale computational and data-intensive study of policy diffusion. They&lt;br/&gt;seek to develop and utilize the largest database on states' decisions to adopt policies to better&lt;br/&gt;understand which states are policy leaders, which are policy followers, and why. This will&lt;br/&gt;provide a novel, expansive, and systematic view of the policy diffusion process that covers the&lt;br/&gt;American states. As a result, policymakers and other interested stakeholders will have access to a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive look at the spread of innovation among state governments regarding financial,&lt;br/&gt;environmental, health, security, and other social problem domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Aspects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to make three central contributions to the study of public policy diffusion.&lt;br/&gt;First, it will produce a database on the adoption of hundreds of policies in the American states, at&lt;br/&gt;least tripling the size of the largest database currently available and yielding a sample of policies&lt;br/&gt;that is more representative of the universe of policies for which states make laws. It will also&lt;br/&gt;leverage these new data to map and analyze the network pathways according to which policies&lt;br/&gt;diffuse (i.e., establish states that are leaders and followers in the diffusion of policies). As&lt;br/&gt;recently published research by the principal investigators shows, cutting-edge computational&lt;br/&gt;methods can be applied to large databases containing information on when policies were adopted&lt;br/&gt;by which governments in order to identify underlying networks along which policies persistently&lt;br/&gt;diffuse. Another key contribution from this research is to improve upon the existing method for&lt;br/&gt;inferring network ties in ways that are most suitable for policy diffusion research (as well as&lt;br/&gt;social science more generally) and implement it in a user-friendly package in the R statistical&lt;br/&gt;environment. A final contribution, which is intended to maximize the potential user-base of these&lt;br/&gt;data and methods, will be to build an interactive online portal to the data, complete with&lt;br/&gt;visualizations and automated analytics.</AbstractNarration>

These data were compiled from smaller existing databases, academic publications, and policy-tracking websites. The new data more than triple the size of the largest prior such database, and offer opportunities for scholars, policymakers, and policy advocates to study the spread of single policies across the American states or to examine the overarching patterns by which policies spread. This allows users to identify states that are innovators, both in terms of adopting new policies faster and by influencing other states decisions to adopt those policies. For example, we estimate that California has become the dominant leader in policy influence overall, Minnesota is the most influential in civil rights polices whereas South Carolina has been very influential in Education policies. &nbsp;</p> <p>The State Policy Innovation and Diffusion (SPID) database has been posted online for public access. It includes adoption dates for each of the 50 American states for 728 different policies coded by topic area as well as extensive documentation about our sources and methods.

The SPID Dataverse houses the SPID data itself as well as various products created from the data, including static and dynamic state policy innovativeness scores. To date there have been over 1800 downloads of the data and nearly 2000 total downloads of the data and related products. These data and outputs are described in an article published in <em>Policy Studies Journal</em>, &ldquo;A New Database for Inferring Public Policy Innovativeness and Diffusion Networks.&rdquo;</p> <p>In addition to sharing the policy data and related outputs, the work has a produced a number of other broader impacts. The SPID Dataverse is designed to be dynamic so that the PIs can add additional products and related information to the existing resources. It also allows other scholars to add their own related contributions or outputs of the SPID data to make the SPID Dataverse a crowdsourced, community resource. To facilitate use of the data, the PIs have produced and released statistical packages for network inference in R (<em>netinf</em>) and Stata packages to generate state innovation scores (<em>stpolinn</em>) and to measure adoptions by source states (<em>sources</em>) to help model policy diffusion. The PIs have also hosted a series of workshops on the data and related methods for latent network estimation at conferences, including the 2017 and 2018 State Politics and Policy Conferences. Along the way they have successfully employed women and minorities on the project, including undergraduates interested in learning more about the application of data analytics in Political Science.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/14/2019<br>      Modified by: Frederick&nbsp;J&nbsp;Boehmke</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1558509/1558509_10432946_1552574506237_innovnsf01-map-allratescore--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1558509/1558509_10432946_1552574506237_innovnsf01-map-allratescore--rgov-800width.jpg" title="State Policy Innovativeness from SPID, 1912-2017"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1558509/1558509_10432946_1552574506237_innovnsf01-map-allratescore--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="State Policy Innovativeness from SPID, 1912-2017"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Smoothed dynamic innovativeness scores, 1912-2017</div> <div class="imageCredit">Frederick J.
