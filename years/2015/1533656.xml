<AbstractNarration>The energy consumption and material cost for modern data-centric computing systems have been rapidly expanding over the past decade.  Unfortunately, a significant amount of the energy and material expense is being wasted to create enough tolerance to manufacturing defects, process variation, reliability degradation, etc.  As the technology scaling is becoming prohibitively expensive, it is highly desirable to develop a novel computer system with real-time reconfigurability to cope with the variability stemming from both manufacturing and user demand.  Unfortunately, conventional CMOS technology has not provided us such a capability because once an integrated circuit is fabricated, it can no longer be modified.  However, the very recent development of non-volatile memory devices, specially the emerging memristor device, have opened the door for a new design paradigm with real-time reconfigurability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leveraging the memristor?s real-time tunability, large on-off resistive ratio and CMOS process compatibility, this project explores a new design and synthesis methodology of large scale integrated circuits with real-time reconfigurability.  By intelligently integrating novel memristor device based self-healing circuits with detection and tuning functionalities, a new computer system can perform real-time adjustment without allocating a large amount of design margin and thus achieve significant energy and cost saving.   With this in mind, this project will perform (1) device level modeling and design kit development for memristor integrated VLSI and mixed-signal design, (2) circuit level design to create robust self-healing digital and mixed-signal system, and (3) design automation development to enable large scale integration of the proposed reconfigurable design methodology.  For broader impact, the project provides a unique training opportunity to the students to obtain a broad knowledge base and out-of-box thinking capability through the cross-layer research activity in this project.  The developed design kit and methodology will be available to the community to inspire innovative VLSI and mixed-signal circuit design with memristor devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The energy consumption and material cost for modern data centric computing system have been rapidly growing over the last decade.  A significant amount of energy and cost have been spent to deal with the variability of manufacturing process as well as to create reconfigurability on the computer chips using existing CMOS integrated circuit (IC) techniques.  This is because once a microprocessor chip is made, the chip cannot be altered leading to significant design overhead to provide margins for potential issues caused by process variation and high cost to deliver built-in reconfigurability for the chip to support different configurations.  To reduce such a cost borne by existing computer system, this work exploits emerging technology to enhance the reconfigurability of modern microprocessor chips.  As a result, significant improvement on chip’s robustness and energy efficiency can be achieved.   To create a reconfigurable system, this work leverages the use of emerging technology, such as non-volatile resistive RAM (RRAM) or memristor device which has a programmable variable resistance value.  By making use of both the resistance and the non-volatile memory function of memristor device, reconfigurability of an IC chip can be realized.  This project intelligently designs circuits which utilize such devices to deliver a new computer system with real-time reconfigurability to overcome the performance loss due to manufacturing variability or high cost for required functionality support.  Because a new design paradigm is introduced by the proposed scheme, novel synthesis and design automation process are also developed to fully materialize the new circuit capability.  As a result, the proposed techniques lead to significant improvement in energy efficiency and system robustness rendering a new scalable design methodology for the next generation computing system.     A list of significant technical outcome from this project includes: (1) a novel "self-healing" circuit was developed based on memristor devices.  The "self-healing" circuit can real-time detect error from timing violation of the manufactured chip and automatically tune the operation of the chip to fix such errors.  This design not only leads to significant saving of power but also reduces the manufacturing cost of silicon chips. (2) A dynamically reconfigurable accelerator chip was delivered leveraging the memristor devices.  Through a series of circuit design and algorithms in design automation techniques, the developed accelerator chip and associated design methodology lead to a new class of reconfigurable processors with significant cost and power reduction.    (3) Leveraging the developed reconfigurable circuits, this project also developed hardware secured computer chips which cannot be easily reproduced or reverse-engineered by stealing the design files, e.g. schematic or layout.  The developed memristor based camouflaging circuit does not reveal the circuit’s configuration and hence significantly enhance the security of hardware chips against unauthorized recycling or reverse engineering.  (4) Several design methodologies such as low voltage statistical timing analysis, aging induced reconfigurability were created to help combat the manufacturing variability and enhance configuration of modern computer chips.  (5) Techniques in hardware security with logic encryption were developed to improve the security of modern CMOS chips against unauthorized usage.    This work has created important broader impacts. It delivered a practical cross-layer design methodology integrating developments across device, circuit, design automation and system.  Such a design methodology led to unprecedented hardware performance as well as shortened development cycles.   The scheme proposed from this work can help guide the development of emerging semiconductor technology.  The multi-disciplinary nature of this project has provided a unique training opportunity to the graduate students who have worked on this project.  More than half a dozen of graduate students got trained and obtained a broad knowledge base as well as out-of-box thinking capability.  The research outcome has been disseminated into the course materials taught by the PI and Co-PI of this project.  As a result, the significant learning from this project will be transferred to the STEM college students through classrooms.
