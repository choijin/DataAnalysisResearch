<AbstractNarration>Plants, as well as humans and animals, are constantly under attack by pathogens, pests, and parasites, resulting in severe consequences on global food production and human health. Cell-to-cell communication between hosts and pathogens plays an essential role in regulating host defense and pathogen virulence and involves transport and exchange of regulatory molecules across the cellular boundaries. Recent findings from the PI's lab of fungal sRNAs that translocate into plant host cells to suppress host immunity provided the first example of sRNAs trafficking between pathogens and their hosts. This project will use the fungal pathogen B. cinerea, which causes grey mold diseases on almost all vegetables, fruits and many flowers, and its plant hosts to understand the mechanism of cross-kingdom small RNA trafficking and regulation, and to develop an effective RNA-based practical strategy for controlling B. cinerea and other aggressive pathogens. This project will provide excellent training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Efforts are in place to recruit students from underrepresented minorities to work on this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small RNA (sRNA)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) plays an essential role in both host immunity and pathogen virulence. The PI's lab has discovered that sRNAs from some eukaryotic pathogens regulate pathogen virulence. Some sRNAs from an aggressive fungal pathogen, Botrytis cinerea, are translocated into host plant cells and hijack the host RNAi machinery to silence important host immunity genes. Recent studies from animal systems also suggest that mobile sRNAs are capable of trafficking between mammals and their interacting organisms. However, how these mobile sRNAs are transported between the interacting organisms, and whether plant endogenous sRNAs are secreted and translocated into pathogen cells are still largely unknown. It is also not clear what these mobile sRNAs regulate in the interacting organisms. This project aims to address these questions by determining pathways and components required for sRNA trafficking between fungal cells and plant cells; identifying and functionally characterizing these sRNAs; and developing  sRNA-based effective means to control aggressive eukaryotic pathogens. The results of these studies will advance our knowledge of sRNA trafficking in the cross-kingdom RNAi between plant hosts and eukaryotic pathogens. Understanding how sRNAs communicate between organisms will facilitate utilization and manipulation of sRNAs for disease control and host immunity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome Report:     Fungal pathogens cause severe crop losses worldwide, threatening global food security and ecosystems. The PI’s lab previously discovered that aggressive fungal pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea, which can cause grey mold disease on over 1000 plant species, send small RNA (sRNA) effectors into plants to silence host immunity genes, through a mechanism named "cross-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi)". These fungal sRNAs play critical roles in fungal virulence.     During this funding period, the PI’s lab discovered that sRNA trafficking between plants and fungal pathogens is bidirectional. The key significant findings are:     The PI’s      lab found that plant endogenous small RNA, including both microRNAs and small      interfering RNAs, are transported into interacting fungal pathogens, such      as Botrytis cinerea. They further      demonstrated that plants utilize extracellular vesicles to send host sRNAs      into fungal cells. They      discovered that tetraspanin-labeled extracellular vesicles are derived      from multivesicular body, can be considered as plant exosomes. Using cell      biology, genetics and biochemistry approaches, the PI’s lab confirmed that      plant exosomes are the major extracellular vesicles that transport host      small RNAs. Furthermore,      these transferred host small RNAs can target fungal genes involved in pathogen      virulence. Deletion mutant strains that knocked out host small RNA target      genes were generated, and these mutated strains largely reduced their      virulence on plant hosts. Study of      the host sRNA target genes in eukaryotic pathogens can help identify new      virulence-related genes, which can help design effective antifungal      reagents for plant protection. We found      that many fungal pathogens can take up environmental RNAs, which has made      it possible to develop RNA based new generation of fungicides, which can      inhibit fungal diseases in a sequence dependent manner.       During this funding period, the PI’s lab has published total of six research articles in highly respected journals, including Science, Nature Communications, RNA Biology, New Phytologist, Plant Journal, Plant Sginaling &amp; Behavior. The PI was also invited to write six review articles in prestigious journals, such as Cell-Host &amp; Microbe, Current Opinion for Plant Biology (2017, 2019), PloS Pathogens, Current Opinion in Microbiology, mBio. Furthermore, The PI also filed one patent and one provisional patent on developing antifungal RNAs to control fungal diseases for plant protection.     This project also provided excellent training opportunities to PhD students, postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate students. Two PhD students in the PI’s lab graduated during this funding period. One postdoc launched his own independent position and became a Professor. Five undergraduate students were trained during this period of time, and three of them have made contributions to the projects and earned a co-authorship in the publications.
