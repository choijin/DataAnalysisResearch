<AbstractNarration>As 3D printing technology becomes mainstream and starts to revolutionize our daily lives as well as the manufacturing industries, a critical problem is about to emerge: how can we effectively divide an object into multiple printable components, when the design of this object does not provide such a partitioning?  We might need such a partitioning because the object is too large to fit into the printer, or we want to reduce the printing time, or the object needs to be packed more tightly, or we just want to make part of the object replaceable or reusable.  In this project, the PI will investigate object partitioning from six aspects: printability, stress load, surface details, packing, assembly, and consistency among multiple objects.  The computational tools developed from this research will broaden the use of 3D printing technology in a wide range of areas.  the PI's existing collaborations with industrial partners such as Adobe and NVIDIA will enable project outcomes to have broad impact, while the PI will publish demo applications and make source code available online to further accelerate dissemination.  The PI will also collaborate with his institution's University Center for the Advancement of Teaching (UCAT) on incorporating the results of this research into both undergraduate and graduate graphics courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal is to develop an automatic partitioning system that quickly converts the mesh of one object into a series of meshes, each of which represents an object component.  Preliminary results indicate that the level set framework is a promising approach.  The project encompasses a comprehensive research agenda focused on three fundamental subproblems: how to analyze the quality of a partitioning according to a variety of printing, packing, and assembly criteria; based on the previous analysis, how to improve the quality of a partitioning using level set methods; and how to facilitate the practical use of a partitioning by constructing auxiliary structures.  Many of the subproblems central to this research are new and have not been systematically studied before.  The development of this technology will require both theoretical and practical studies of system integration, computational efficiency, and time-stepping.  Finding solutions to such issues within the level set framework will allow the PI to formulate his system as a localized iterative partitioning optimization process, whose result can meet the requirement of different 3D printing applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Though this project, the research team has studied the analysis, simulation and modeling of 3D printable models from both theoretical and practical perspectives, by leveraging the state-of-the-art physics-based simulation, level set modeling and machine learning techniques.  Our research has successfully yielded novel techniques that allow 3D printable models to be efficiently and accurately modeled in a cost effective way and it encourages us to further explore its applications with researchers and developers for various engineering and artistic purposes.  Our research will be serving as an algorithmic foundation in the computer graphics community for people interested in solving relevant analysis, simulation and modeling problems in the future.   To facilitate the dissemination of this work, the team has released most of our source code for public access.  Some of the source code libraries and demos can be found in our released GitHub repository named "PrintX".  The research team has published technical research outcomes as nine conference/journal papers at top graphics conference/journal venues, including SIGGRAPH, SIGGRAPH Asia and Pacific Graphics.  The PI has integrated the research into a technical course and presented it to general audience at SIGGRAPH Asia 2018 in Tokyo.  The PI has also incorporated the research into undergraduate and graduate courses taught at Ohio State.  Students taking these courses will have opportunities to meet real research problems and build their interested in scientific and engineering research.  The project enabled the establishment of the first 3D printing lab in the Computer Science and Engineering department at OSU.  Complementary to other 3D printing labs at OSU, this lab is focused on computational problems related to 3D printing.  This project has funded five PhD students and one underrepresented undergraduate student at OSU.  Three PhD students have successfully graduated and they are actively serving as research scientists in related simulation and design fields.
