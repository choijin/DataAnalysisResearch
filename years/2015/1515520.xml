<AbstractNarration>As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. This media and research project will inform adult audiences about the discoveries of NSF funded Social, Behavioral, and Economic (SBE) scientists that are dramatically re-shaping fields as diverse as economics, marketing, medicine and government. Four primetime PBS specials hosted by science reporter, Miles O'Brien, will be produced featuring leading SBE scientists and vetted for inclusion by a panel of expert advisors including Baruch Fischhoff of Carnegie Mellon and Robert Kurzban of the University of Pennsylvania. A key innovation in the project is a participatory research strategy that will enable the public to take part directly in scientific behavioral research and discover what their participation has revealed about their own lives. Built around YouTube features, Facebook, and online games it will build on the public's interest in learning about themselves and others via social media supported by scientific research. The project collaborators include the media company, Oregon Public Broadcasting, and researchers at Carnegie Mellon, University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, and Chapman University. This project is unique in its strategy for combining broadcast television programs focusing on Social, Behavioral, and Economics research with a participatory research component that engages audiences in scientific studies that are personally relevant. It will fill an important niche in the informal learning research literature and has the potential to impact media practice that continues to evolve incorporating new online social media tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RMC will conduct formative evaluation to help inform the project deliverables, a summative evaluation of the project, and an experimental research study in Year 3 of the project. The research study is based on the hypothesis that those participants assigned to watch the entire television series and engage in all participatory research activities will experience the greatest gains in STEM interest and engagement as compared to those who only have limited exposure. Research participants will be randomly assigned to the control group (no services) or one of the three treatment conditions: view TV only; engage in participatory website only; or both. Pre-tests and posttests and statistical tools will be used to compare changes. Sub-studies will examine dosage levels and effectiveness in engaging those who have not previously been interested in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     "Hacking Your Mind:  The Science of Personal Relevance" resulted in a ground-breaking four-hour PBS television series that takes you from the farthest corners of the globe to the inside of your mind.  The series explores ground-breaking research on how the brain affects human decision making, and how that knowledge can be used to "hack our minds".   Viewers travel with host Jacob Ward to Tanzania, to visit the last hunter gatherers on earth, in an effort to understand how the human brain evolved 10,000 years ago.  They drive with Jake on the wrong side of the road in London demonstrating "slow"and "fast" thinking, and they visit the residents of "Monkey Island" off the coast of Puerto Rico, where we see the parallels between monkey behavior and our own.    As the journey unfolds, we discover we are not who we think we are.  Though we imagine our conscious mind makes most of our decisions, the reality is that we go through much of our lives on "auto-pilot" with an array of emotions and habits determining our choices before we're even consciously aware that a decsion has been made.        With the help of on-camera personalities like Michael Lewis, author of "Moneyball" and fictional characters like Homer Simpson and Mr. Spock, we learn that our auto pilot system can make predictable errors without our being aware of it.  Corporate marketers, governments, social media companies and politicians are experts at using these predictable errors to affect our behavior.  The series explains what's going on behind the headlines we read every day -how social media works, how governments and others can sow dis-information, and how politicians get us to vote for them.  Finally, you discover how you can protect yourself from the hackers and make the world a better place, because if we make fewer decisions based on our biases and easily manipulated emotions, we will all be better off.    The series premiered nationally on PBS on Wednesday, September 9th 2020 at 10pm and aired on successive Wednesdays through September.   In that month, PBS reports that 6.5 million people watched the programs.  All four episodes are now streaming on the companion PBS web site at https://www.pbs.org/show/hacking-your-mind/.  Episode descriptions:  Episode 1: Living on Auto-Pilot explores the startlingly new discovery that we make many of our decisions on "auto-pilot" and why, though this has been essential to our survival, it can lead us to make predictable mistakes, including being biased toward people of a different race, age, or gender.     Episode 2: Weapons of Influence explores why it's so incredibly easy for others to "hack" our auto-pilot decisions. Everyone from marketers to politicians to governments does it, and what you need to know to protect yourself.  Episode 3: Us vs. Them explores how the divisiveness in America today has its roots in the way our auto-pilot biases distort how we see both "us" and "them" and how some use this to enrich themselves or control us.  Episode 4: The Wings of Angels explores how the auto pilot decisions we make are literally contagious to others, and how, we, as citizens of a democracy, can use this knowledge to build a better world.      PBS broadcast rights for the TV series extend through September 2024.  The project also included other elements:     A companion web site on PBS.org  (https://www.pbs.org/show/hacking-your-mind/), where the four TV programs and the other project content are streaming.      Nine 5-minute video clips, created for social media and on-line platforms. These clips were posted on the PBS and OPB YouTube channels, on the PBS and OPB Facebook pages, and on the PBS and OPB web sites.  These clips are also streaming on the PBS web site.      A series of five five-minute audio podcasts, highlighting key concepts from the television series, now streaming via Spreaker (a podcast streaming platform), and on the PBS web site.      As of January 1st, 2021, in addition to the viewers who watched the four one hour television programs, PBS reports the on-line content has been streamed by over 343,000 people.   The goal of the project was to reach different audiences with content designed for different distribution platforms, wih a particular focus on content of shorter lengths that would reach audiences unlikely to watch PBS.  What different audiences learned is summarized in the final evaluation report submitted by RMC, the project evaluator.  RMC focus group testing determined that audiences of all ages and backgrounds learned more about how the brain affects human decision making.  The shorter video clips encouraged viewers to want to find out more about these subjects by watching the longer television programs and to consider ways to avoid making bad choices or being manipulated.  Focus group participants indicated the content made them more interested in science in general.                Last Modified: 02/01/2021       Submitted by: David Davis]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
