<AbstractNarration>Most nuclei are unstable and have limited lifetimes.  Understanding the structure of nuclei far from stability and defining the limits of the heaviest elements has been an exciting challenge and has led to the production of nuclei with as many as 118 protons using both hot and cold fusion techniques as well as radioactive beams.  This award will use the multi-nucleon transfer technique to synthesize new actinide nuclei.  The investigators will also measure the properties and production mechanisms of the heaviest nuclei to understand the nature and behavior of these nuclei, and to assist theoretical predictions for the stability, structure and production of super-heavy elements.  The project will contribute to the education of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.  The training of scientists in nuclear and radiochemistry fulfills a well-articulated, frequently stated national need, the re-vitalization of nuclear and radiochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three phases of the research: (a) to investigate the use of multi-nucleon transfer (MNT) reactions in the region near 208Pb to test models of these reactions and to make new nuclei. These investigations are to be done with thick target experiments at Gammasphere (136Xe + 208Pb and 136Xe, 238U + 198Pt). In the former experiment, one is making a unique rigorous test of the Zagrebaev and Greiner formalism for treating MNT reactions while the latter reactions deal with the best way to make N=126 nuclei (b) to study the production of lower Z actinide nuclei testing current models of MNT. This will involve the identification of 15-30 alpha-emitting nuclear products from the 132Xe + 233U reaction by in-beam spectroscopy and off-line analysis and a study of similar products from the 192Os + 197Au reaction and (c) to study the production of exotic neutron-rich actinide nuclei at the limits of stability using transfer reactions such as 136Xe+ 248Cm and 232Th + 248Cm. Several new n-rich isotopes of Fm, Cm, and Cf will be produced.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  Project Title: Synthesis of New Heavy Nuclei using Multi-Nucleon transfer Reactions  PI: Walter Loveland  Awardee: Oregon State University  Award Number: 1505043  Project Duration:  7/15/2015-12/31/2018  Summary of Accomplishments  We have developed and distributed a new computer program GRAZING-F, that adds fission de-excitation to the semi-classical GRAZING code of Winther and Pollarolo, allowing estimates of the yields of fissionable nuclei in peripheral multi-nucleon transfer(MNT) reactions. The yields of over 200 projectile-like fragments (PLFs) and target-like fragments (TLFs) were measured for the reaction of Ec.m. = 450 MeV 136Xe +208Pb. This large data set was used to test modern models of MNT reactions. The models consistently underestimate the yields of MNT products by as much as two orders of magnitude. A comprehensive review of the use of MNT reactions to form heavy nuclei was published. The yields of several PLFs and TLFs were measured for the symmetric reaction of 1360 MeV 204Hg + 198Pt. Current models (GRAZING, DNS, ImQMD) of MNT reactions significantly underestimated the yields of the transfer products, even for small transfers. We initiated work on MNT reactions to study the formation of nuclei near the N=126 shell using the reactions of 860 and 1088 MeV 136Xe with 198Pt. We initiated work on the formation of new heavy nuclei using MNT reactions, such as 64Ni + 208Pb, 132Xe + 233U and 232Th + 248Cm. Twenty papers were published in the open refereed literature with 2 additional papers being submitted for publication. Three students received the Ph.D. degree in chemistry and one student received the M.S. degree as a result of this work, thus contributing to the workforce in the critical areas of nuclear and radiochemistry.
