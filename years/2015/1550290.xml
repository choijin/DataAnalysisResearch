<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Submarine melting of Greenland's glaciers has emerged as a key term in the ice sheet?s mass balance and as a plausible trigger for their recent acceleration, which contributed to doubling Greenland's contribution to sea-level rise. Notwithstanding its importance, our understanding of submarine melting is limited and it is presently absent or crudely parameterized in glacier, ice sheet and climate models. Greenland's tidewater glaciers end in about 600 to 800 m deep, long fjords that connect the margins of the ice sheet to the shelf. The glaciers termini are typically grounded several hundreds of meters below sea-level and, as such, are exposed to a thick portion of the fjord's water column. Unique data, recently collected by two of the investigators, from two large glacial fjords in south-east Greenland show that these are filled year-round with cold, fresh waters of Arctic origin and warm, salty waters of subtropical origin whose different properties influence the circulation at the ice-edge. Furthermore, ship-based and moored velocity measurements show that the fjords are characterized by fast, highly variable, sheared flows and a vigorous fjord/shelf exchange which, likely, play a role in transporting heat to the glaciers termini. The implication is that submarine melt rates depend on a suite of oceanic processes including externally forced fjord circulations, fjord/shelf exchange and the distribution of properties on the shelf. Yet, the details of how these processes may contribute to the submarine melt rate or affect its variability are presently unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will fill this gap by combining the analysis of ship-based and moored data from the two fjords with a hierarchy of models (laboratory and numerical) to identify the parameters and mechanisms which control the properties and circulation in the fjords and the rate of submarine melting at the ocean/glacier interface. Having identified the controls on the submarine melt rate, the project investigators will then use historical oceanographic and atmospheric data to determine fjord conditions and submarine melt rates for the period preceding the acceleration of the glaciers when no fjord data are available. Climate model predictions will be used to estimate the potential impact of future oceanic variability on submarine melting of Greenland?s glaciers. Collaborations with experts in outlet glacier dynamics, the physics of the ice-ocean boundary and fjord circulations will provide expertise in related disciplines and a two-way exchange of information for this intrinsically multidisciplinary problem. The work proposed is aimed at understanding a newly discovered wiring of the climate system: that ocean variability can have a rapid and direct impact on the Greenland's ice sheet mass balance. It is timely because of the large and unpredicted changes that are occurring in Greenland and relevant because ice sheet/ocean interactions are presently absent from climate and ice sheet/glacier models. It is complementary to the study of ice sheet/ocean interactions around Antarctica (the more studied of the two) since both the large-scale ocean circulation and the presence of narrow, long fjords in Greenland contribute a unique set of relevant dynamical mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This work seeks to increase our understanding of a previously overlooked, important connection in our climate system which has profound implications for our ability to accurately predict sea-level rise - an issue of grave and immediate societal concern. It is expected that results from this work will contribute to the inclusion of the relevant dynamics (even if in parameterized form) in future models and, as such, lead to the improvement of future sea level predictions. The work plan involves several international experts from complementary fields and, as such, will contribute to fostering interactions between the multiple disciplines involved and beyond national boundaries. It involves two graduate students and one post-doc who will be exposed to a cutting-edge problem and multidisciplinary team of researchers. Results from this project will be widely disseminated to scientists across disciplines, as demonstrated by the PIs long-track of organizing summer schools and working groups, and to the public through different media outlets, as shown by the recent coverage of the investigators' Greenland work in venues that include the Museum of Science in Boston, the New York Times, the Weather Channel and Italian National Television.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled from 1992-2001 to 2001-2011, resulting in a net contribution to sea-level rise of approximately 7.5 mm over the 1992-2011 period, roughly twice the Antarctic contribution. Half of this loss is associated with the increased melt and run-off associated with rising air-temperatures over the ice sheet.

Oceanic forcing has emerged as a leading, plausible mechanism that triggered the initial glacier retreat.        The bulk of the glaciers that accelerated during the last decade are located at the margins of the North AtlanticÆs subpolar gyre and its extension into in southeastern and western Greenland.

If glacier retreat was due to oceanic warming, then we may expect the changes to continue, since climate models predict that the ocean region around southern Greenland will experience a pronounced ocean warming.     Recent surveys have shown that both water masses are present in the fjords and that the warmest Atlantic waters (~2&deg;&ndash;5&deg;C) are found in fjords in southeastern and western Greenland at the margins of the North AtlanticÆs subpolar gyre. The bulk of the glaciers that accelerated during the last decade are located at the margins of the North AtlanticÆs subpolar gyre and its extension into Baffin Bay in southeastern and western Greenland. The waters in the subpolar gyre began to warm roughly at the same time as the glaciers started to retreat, leading scientist to suggest that the glacier retreat was driven by local oceanic warming possibly due to changes in ocean circulation pathways. If glacier retreat was due to oceanic warming, then we may expect the changes to continue, since climate models predict that the ocean region around southern Greenland will experi- ence a pronounced ocean warming.      Ocean waters at temperatures above freezing that come in contact with the ice front can drive submarine melting. This melting contributes to the overall glacier mass balance, but it can also affect glacier stability by modifying the ice front. Thus, it is possible for increased rates of submarine melting, as a result of oceanic warming, to lead to increased calving and/ or terminus retreat. In Greenland, recent surveys have shown that sub-marine melting is primarily driven by Atlantic waters. These surveys have also shown that the fjords contain enough heat to melt significant amounts of ice, and that melting is limited not by the avail- able heat but by the rate of "heat delivery" to the ice. This heat delivery, in turn, depends on a range of glaciological, oceanic, and atmospheric processes and parameters that are poorly understood.   The purpose of this project was to improve our understanding of glacier-fjord interactions through the use of computational geophysical fluid dynamics. The model used, the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm), has been developed to simulate both the basin- to global-scale (10-10,000km) ocean circulation, as well as small-scale oceanic processes (1m-10km). We developed an idealized configuration of the code that represents salient properties of Sermilik fjord for the purpose of elucidating the dominant controls on submarine melt rates.  Simulated submarine melt rates are strongly sensitive to the amount of subglacial discharge, to changes in water temperature, and to the height of the stratified fjord layers (cold fresh Polar-origin above warm saline Atlantic-origin waters). They are also consistent with those inferred from simplified one-dimensional models based on the theory of buoyant plumes. Furthermore, consistent with observations, the numerical results suggest that the circulation that is governed by water variability at the fjord's exit...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
