<AbstractNarration>This award supports a Future Internet Architecture--Next Phase (FIA-NP) investigator meeting in November, 2014. This meeting is structured around a set of four use cases or scenarios that have been developed by the Values in Design Council, with the objective of learning more about the implications of the various network designs that are part of the Future Internet Architecture, Next Phase program. The discussions of use cases or scenarios is intended to bring out implications of the design decisions within each of the funded network designs. The use cases have been formulated by the Values in Design Council, a group of social scientists, lawyers, and other experts whose travel to the meetings is supported by NSF to bring a broader set of perspectives on the design process. The results of this exercise should serve to better understand the implications of the technical designs, and to improve communication and understanding between the design teams and the members of the ViD council.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader goal of the NSF FIA-NP effort is enhancing the relevance and impact of the NSF program of network research, intellectual enrichment of the network research community, and the contribution of new concepts and thought leadership to the future of the Internet. The program, and the workshops in particular, are a means to train a cohort of academic network researchers in the practice of long-range architectural thinking. The program has the potential to contribute to a future Internet that is materially more secure, robust, economically viable, and fit for the needs of society than the Internet of today. The results of this workshop, which will be posted on the FIA-NP website www.nets-fia.net for public dissemination, will be a contribution to this broader goal.</AbstractNarration>
