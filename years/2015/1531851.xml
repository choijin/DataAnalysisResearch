<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Ball State University will acquire a liquid chromatography-mass ppectrometry (LC-MS) system. The system is used to determine the composition of mixtures of materials obtained from various sources including samples obtained from chemical syntheses, environmental or biological sources. In this instrument the liquid chromatograph (LC) separates the complex mixture into its individual components, then mass spectrometer (MS) is used to determine the mass of the components by measuring the mass to charge ratio (m/z) of ions produced from the components. LC-MS is a powerful analytical tool for finding out what the components are in a complex sample. The instrument will be used by students in their research, training them for its usage in their careers. It will also be used in outreach to disabled students and underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument will be used in research especially in areas such as (a) characterizating nitrogen heterocycles for materials and medicine; (b) designing RNA nanovehicles for drug delivery in phototherapy; (c) studying photochemistry of organic pollutants at air-water interface; (d) determining the role of mammalian CDC42 in cell signaling pathways with implications in bacterial infections; (e) understanding of the mechanism of apolipoprotein beta degradation with relevance to cholesterol related pathologies; (f) studying nanoparticle catalyzed photodegradation of organic compounds for environmental remediation; and (g) enabling the elucidating chemistry emanating from highly reactive aryl nitrenes and oxypyridinium salts to access synthetically useful motifs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A ThermoFisher bench top Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) system was purchased and successfully installed in the Department of Chemistry in the Cooper Physical Science Building (CP) at Ball State University in spring 2016.  The acquisition of this instrument has strengthened and enhanced the research capabilities at our institute.  In last three years, existing and new Ball State faculty have been able to expand their research programs, and plan experiments previously not possible.  New interdisciplinary research collaborations have also been initiated that will actively employ the LC-MS.  Briefly, this instrumentation is being employed for the identification of unique synthetic chemicals of medicinal importance, to study the degradation of environmental pollutants, and to determine the traces of toxic compounds e.g. hormones, antibiotics and per- or polyfluoroalkyl substances in drinking water, landfill leachates and soils.         The availability of LC-MS in our department has enabled training of graduate and undergraduate students in a routine analytical tool.  Through the incorporation of LC-MS based exercises in our curriculum (e.g. Advanced Organic Chemistry and Advanced Analytical Chemistry courses), at least seven undergraduate and seventeen graduate students have been directly impacted. Additionally, several students have contributed to mentored research which incorporated the LC-MS, with one undergraduate and three graduate students serving as presenters or co-presenters of their research at regional and national conferences. Since LC-MS is widely employed in chemical, pharmaceutical and biotech industries with capabilities ranging from small molecule analysis to protein characterization, research training with the LC-MS is indispensable for students interested in pursuing a career in these fields.     The acquisition of LC-MS instrument has further allowed the Ball State Department of Chemistry to provide professional development opportunities to high school teachers, as well as offer an enhanced educational experience to high school students in the region through the organization of annual Cool Tools Hot Science workshop. In a survey, high school students who attended this workshop felt more excited to pursue college degree in the STEM fields.
