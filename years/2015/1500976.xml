<AbstractNarration>Logic is the study of formal reasoning rules that rely on the grammatical structure of the statements rather than their content.   Revived in the beginning of the twentieth century to deal with some foundational issues, mathematical logic turned out to also be useful for obtaining new results in mathematics. The recent applications of the model theory of difference and differential algebra to algebraic number theory are some of the most exciting examples of this. Difference equations, like differential equations, model real-world processes that change over time. Differential equations describe quantities that vary continuously with time, such as the positions of planets in space, while difference equations describe quantities that are only measured at discrete time intervals, such as the annual GDP of a country. Difference algebra is the abstract setting for studying difference equations; it also has applications to the kind of algebraic number theory that underpins modern cryptography and internet security.  Medvedev proposes to study the fine structure of solution sets of difference equations: to find algorithms for computing their dimensions and for identifying the very special cases where it is possible to define some kind of addition and/or multiplication on these sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A difference field is a field with a distinguished automorphism. The theory of difference closed fields is supersimple, meaning that Lascar rank is a good notion of dimension for complete types. Furthermore, the complete types of Lascar rank 1 satisfy the Zilber Trichotomy: each is nonorthogonal to a definable field, or nonorthogonal to a definable one-based group, or is disintegrated. While the fieldlike case of the trichotomy is relatively easy to identify in explicit examples, the dividing line between the grouplike and the disintegrated cases is much less clear. Similarly, even in the relatively nice case of groups, it is not always easy to determine the Lascar rank of a particular type. Beginning with her PhD thesis, Medvedev has worked on these sorts of problems, and on applications to algebraic dynamics. She is confident that she can generalize the main theorem of her PhD thesis from curves to higher-dimensional algebraic varieties. She has already accomplished the first part of this in far greater generality; the last part of the original proof should generalize easily; and the middle piece is supplied by an observation in a paper by Chatzidakis and Hrushovski. She expects to also obtain concrete results on the Lascar rank of certain groups G defined by systems of polynomial difference equations. This question can be translated to the language of linear algebra over the quasiendomorphism ring of the underlying algebraic group. For example, when G is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field in characteristic zero, this question reduces to linear algebra over the field of rational numbers. In addition, Medvedev proposes to continue expanding her foundational notes about difference schemes defined by Hrushovski in his work on the model theory of Frobenius automorphisms, filling in many missing detail, adding enlightening examples, and reorganizing the presentation to make it (more) understandable. Medvedev expects to continue involving students in this work, encouraging logicians and algebraic geometers to learn each other's languages when they are still young.</AbstractNarration>
