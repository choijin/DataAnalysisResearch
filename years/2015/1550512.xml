<AbstractNarration>Principal Investigator:  George J Nelson&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No:  1550512&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy storage is emerging as a major challenge for enabling renewable energy production from intermittent grid sources such as wind and solar, and for enabling the next generation of electric vehicles.  This award will provide partial support to host a mini-symposium on Multiphysics Coupling in Energy Storage at the 2015 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE). The IMECE is the premier conference for the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) that typically attracts around 4000 attendees from more than 75 countries.  The 2015 IMECE will be held at the Hilton Americas and the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston, Texas from November 13, 2015 to November 19, 2015.  The proposed mini-symposium will assemble a diverse group of engineers and scientists with the objective of identifying recent advances and critical needs for comprehensive models that find ways to improve the performance of devices for storage of renewable energy, including batteries.  The speakers will come from academia, industry, national laboratories, and science and engineering research centers. Special efforts will be made to recruit speakers from under-represented minorities and women in engineering.  This environment will foster interdisciplinary collaboration between mechanical engineers, materials scientists, computational scientists, and electrochemists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improving electrochemical energy storage devices for vehicle electrification, renewable energy integration and grid storage depends on understanding complex reaction and transport processes spanning multiple length and time scales.  The mini-symposium on Multiphysics Coupling in Energy Storage at the 2015 IMECE will build interdisciplinary collaborations to around this theme will advance development of a more sustainable energy infrastructure.  The mini-symposium will consist of 19 invited presentations organized in 4 technical sessions.  The invited presentations will address key issues related to multiphysics behavior of energy storage devices. These issues include, but are not limited to: (1) Opportunities and challenges in Li-ion chemistry and other battery chemistries; (2) Coupled electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical physics; (3) Modeling and characterization of physical processes across length scales; (4) Mesoscale physics of microstructure-transport-chemistry interactions; (5) Degradation processes controlling safety and lifetime; (6) Origin and evolution of safety events such as thermal runaway.</AbstractNarration>
