<AbstractNarration>A non-technical description of the project, which explains the project's significance and importance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atmospheric dust is generated in lowlands through a variety of natural and human-induced processes. Once delivered to high mountain environments, wind-borne dust is responsible for a multitude of effects including altering the pH and chemistry of surface water, contributing to soil formation, and decreasing the reflective properties of snow. In the Rocky Mountains, recent study of lake sediment records suggests that rates of dust deposition have increased in the past few centuries, linking human land use in lowland basins with dust deposition in the mountains. This project will analyze the amount and distribution of dust accumulating in the Uinta Mountains to determine the regional and inter-annual variability in dust deposition rates and properties. Cores from alpine lakes will also be investigated to ascertain the changes in wind-borne deposits over the last several thousand years as continental glaciers receded and human habitation increased.  Given the growing evidence that dust deposition plays an important role in the ecology of alpine systems, this project will provide useful information for management of mountain ecosystems and the surrounding basins. This project will be conducted at a primarily undergraduate institution and will train the next generation of research scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A technical description of the project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use an extensive set of existing lake-sediment cores and soils data, along with new collections of dust and soil, to test three complementary hypotheses: 1) Dust flux and geochemical properties are primarily controlled by aridity within regional source areas in the western United States; 2) Post-glacial sedimentary records from high-elevation lakes in the Uintas will record synchronous changes in physical properties that reflect variations in the regional dust system driven by paleoclimate variability; 3) Long-term (~106 - 107yrs) weathering on the unglaciated Uinta summit upland has resulted in the formation of pedogenic clays from elemental building blocks delivered by atmospheric dust. Six undergraduate students will receive training in research techniques and each will complete independent research along with the opportunity to present at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Prevailing winds transport fine grained mineral dust from the deserts of the southwestern US into the Rocky Mountains.  Redeposition of this dust on the ground has a variety of effects on surface ecosystems.  For instance, dust delivers nutrients and exotic minerals to mountain soils and exerts a control on the chemistry of stream and lake water.  Dust also darkens the snow, changing the timing and rate of snowpack melting in the spring.  This study focused specifically on the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah and investigated the consequences of dust deposition over time on soils at high elevations.  An array of dust samplers was deployed at remote locations in these mountains, with permission of the US Forest Service.  The collectors were emptied frequently, and the dust they contained was analyzed to determine its geochemical composition and mineralogy.  Results reveal that dust is accumulating fairly uniformly across the Uintas, at rates averaging 3.5 grams per square meter.  This corresponds to approximately 10 tons of dust landing on each square mile each year.  This dust is rich in calcium and other nutrients important for plant growth.  Because these nutrients are rare in the Uinta bedrock, the delivery of dust is positively influencing the fertility of these soils.  The geochemistry of the dust also serves as a fingerprint that aids in determining where the dust is coming from.  This fingerprint is similar to that of soils in parts of southern Nevada, western Utah, and northern Arizona, suggesting that these areas are major sources for dust that is transported to the Uinta Mountains.  Finally, because the geochemistry of the dust is distinct from the local Uinta bedrock, it was possible to use long records of sediment accumulation in mountain lakes to reconstruct dust deposition over the past 10,000 years.  This effort revealed that the rate of dust deposition has varied over time, and that it was particularly high between 5,000 and 8,000 years ago.  This result corresponds with other evidence of warmer and/or drier climatic conditions in the southwestern US at this time, illustrating a connection between climate and the amount of dust emitted from the desert and transported to the mountains.
