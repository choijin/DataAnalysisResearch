<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Irina Panyushkina and Claudia Chang will conduct research to examine how climate, landscapes and prehistoric societies have interacted in Central Asia. This project involves expert collaborators and partnerships in the fields of archaeology, dendrochronology, paleoclimatology, palynology, ecology and hydrogeology in order to examine past climate changes and social transformations throughout a 2000-year prehistory of southern Kazakhstan. The research will generate new field-based datasets for modeling population dynamics, land use patterns in the grassland plains and forested mountains. The goal is to determine human response to climatic and environmental changes beginning at the transition from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1600 to 900 BC) and through the Iron Age (ca. 800 BC to AD 500). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is important because it will test the direct impact of climate change on ancient societies and cultures of the Eurasian Steppe. It will broaden perspectives on the nature of climate-human interactions which influenced the social evolution of the subsequent civilizations and led to the development of the modern world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archaeological data from Semirechye (the mountain zone of the Aral Basin) suggest that during the Late Bronze Age, small, dispersed populations of mobile pastoralists occupied the upland valleys and mountains near critical pasture and water resources. Later, in the first millennia BC, these marginal upland regions led to the formation of two distinct types of settlement: larger, aggregated populations of agro-pastoralists who utilized the fertile, arable land of alluvial fans and smaller, dispersed populations of transhumant pastoralists who relocated to high elevations. By ca. 100 AD, population density and storage capacity at villages was comparable to that of early sedentary farming villages in other world regions. A marked reduction in the number of Iron Age sites took place after AD 200 probably a result of out-migration or conflict. The research will interrelate the archaeological datasets with sophisticated reconstructions of climate variability. These integrated data shall provide key insights into the adaptive responses of ancient populations to climate and environmental changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multi-disciplinary project includes: (1) archaeological survey and site testing; (2) geophysical settlement surveys using a magnetometer; (3) C14 wiggle-match and tree-ring dating; (4) multi-scale climate and environment reconstructions from tree-ring and pollen proxies, and corresponding ice-cores. The assembled lines of evidence will be used to estimate the impact of climate change on population size and landscape productivity in this region. Furthermore, it will document the social and economic factors within Iron Age society that led to possible environmental stress such as the depletion of water sources, wood fuel and soil fertility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include 1) graduate students' field and state-of-art training in the management and interpretation of large and complex data sets, and 2) strong international collaborations between the archaeological and environmental science communities of US, UK, Kazakhstan, Germany, Hungary and Russia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit of the archaeological research at Talgar in Southeast Kazakhstan are two-fold: (1) the development of a reliable chronological framework for documenting the rise of agro-pastoralism among ancient nomadic confederacies from the mid- Bronze Age period through the Iron Age (ca. 1500 BC - AD 100: and (2) the examination of the relationship between cycles of climatic change during the Late Holocene Period from cold and wet to warm and dry (ca. 500 BC) and its impact on the development of the cultivation of wheat, barley, and foxtail and broomcorn millets along with the herding of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses and the slow increase of population reaching its apex between BC 400 and AD 1).   In order to investigate the socionatural systems of Bronze and Iron Age agro-pastoral adaptations on the Talgar we focused on the survey of the Talgar alluvial fan at the foot of the Tian Shan Mountain Range.  This survey area consists of 550 sq km of which we were able to conduct pedestrian surveys in addition to reconnaissance and surveys done in 1997-99, 2000-2004, increasing the total count to about 1000 sites (burial mounds and settlement sites).    Our excavations focused on the settlement site of Tuzusai (8-10 ha) in size.  In addition magnetometer surveys were conducted in a 4 to 5 ha area to the west and north of our excavations, revealing pit houses, post holes, a channel or ditch, and fire pits.  The settlement of this area was rich and dispersed over a large area.    In addition graduate students conducted studies in the materials' analyses of ceramic production (including sourcing the clay and inclusions), zooarchaeological studies on animal bone remains (identifications of wild and domesticated species, studies of bone pathologies, and seasonality study of cementum growth on teeth rings of sheep), paleoethnobotanical studies of ancient plant remains of wheats, barley, millets, and grapes, as well as phytolith studies of ancient plant use (reeds used in matting, plant materials found in mud brick) as well as indicators of local environmental conditions.    A recent Ph.D. archaeologist mapped the hydrology of the alluvial fan using an open-sourced GIS program and conducted geoarchaeological studies of important soil profiles documenting the in-filling and erosional cycles of Mid to Late Holocene terraces on this alluvial fan.  This was augmented by geomorphological research conducted by a soils' scientist, and a specialist of fluvial geology who dated using OSL methods sections along the Talgar River.  These fluvial reconstructions were correlated with water levels at Lake Balkhash and used to reconstruct moisture and temperature cycles during the relatively stable Holocene period of soil deposition and climatic conditions.  The river downcutting sequences and alluviation patterns demonstrated that by 400 BC or earlier, prehistoric inhabitants practiced both rainfed and irrigation agriculture.    The next step in our project is to design an agent-based model (simulation using computational methods) for predicting how humans impacted the environment and climate in feedback loops.  This represents a future stage in the development of our future research plans.  A book-length manuscript has been prepared by Chang that is currently under review at an academic press.  Five major peer-review articles were published during this period, and two peer-reviewed book chapters.  Four to five conference papers were given by the Co-Principal Investigator  as well as a number of papers presented at international and national conferences presented by graduate student researchers.  The broader social impacts of our project include the training of both local Kazakh graduate and undergraduate students as well as American graduate and undergraduate students.  The information and technology tranfer between US, British, German, Hungarian, and Kazakhstani archaeologists and scientists is important for fostering a comprehensive appr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
