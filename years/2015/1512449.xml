<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1512449&lt;br/&gt;PI: Webb III, Edmund&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deposition of nanoparticles onto a solid surface is an important operation in the assembly of nanoparticles to form new materials for a variety of technological applications.  This project will carry out atomic scale simulations of the spreading of water droplets on both pure and chemically modified silicon surfaces when the droplets contain nanoparticles of gallium nitride. Simulations will be conducted for sessile drops and for drops that impact the silicon surface. Patterning of gallium nitride nanoparticles on the silicon surface will be examined.  Understanding the forces that determine the spreading of the drop and the deposition of the nanoparticles is essential to design a bottom up approach to manufacturing new materials for optoelectronic applications.  The project will also engage undergraduate and masters students in research projects that will make connections between the atomic scale simulations and larger scale descriptions of droplet and nanoparticle dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simulations will be conducted to discover how wetting kinetics and capillary forces depend on the interactions between particle and solvent, between particle and solid surface, and between solvent and solid surface.  Forces acting on suspended nanoparticles will be directly computed from simulations and correlated with drop morphology and the environment near a given particles, such as proximity to an advancing contact line or proximity to other particles.  Additional simulations will explore effects of particle size and concentration on particle patterning and forces computed during wetting and spreading.  Force data extracted from the simulations will help validate and optimize analytical descriptions of the driving forces in nano-suspension wetting.  The project will provide new insights into non-equilibrium thermodynamics and its manifestations in nanoscale systems by connecting interaction affinity to suspension wetting kinetics and particle behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Suspensions are fluids wherein solid particles have been dispersed; the fluid mechanics of suspensions and suspension droplets is a topic of interest to myriad technologies.  Examples include inks and paints, oil recovery materials, advanced surface fabrication techniques, and targeted drug therapy.  If the particles suspended are of nano-scale size, then nano-suspension can be used to refer to the resulting fluid.  A technological goal that is germane to nano-suspensions is to fabricate devices that have many nano-scale particles uniformly ordered on an underlying solid surface.  Such structures can enable new optical, electrical, and/or magnetic capability in, for example, the semiconductor and photovoltaic industries.  This drives interest in understanding the spreading of nano-suspension droplets on surfaces, as well as the subsequent particle distribution after spreading is complete.  If suspended particles can be distributed in desired ways, processes akin to ink jet printing may enable inexpensive synthesis of useful nano-particle surface arrays.     To control particle behavior, it is necessary to understand forces acting on particles during nano-suspension droplet wetting and spreading. During droplet spreading, a contact line at which three-phases meet (vapor, solid, liquid) advances across the substrate; the contact line can become pinned in place by suspended particles. Contact line pinning and de-pinning are processes critical to determining the final distribution of particles; pinning is responsible for ring-shaped coffee stains, rather than disks (see Image 1).  To enable advanced fabrication techniques for nano-island surface arrays, it is necessary to understand forces that act on suspended particles during spreading.       We have utilized atomic scale molecular dynamics simulations to determine the following.  1)    Is it possible to reliably compute forces on suspended particles and, if so, what are the best practices for doing so in a computationally efficient way?  2)    What are forces associated with contact line pinning and de-pinning?  3)    How do such forces (and associated particle behavior) depend upon particle-substrate, particle-particle, and particle-fluid interactions?  4)    What influence on force is had by particle size and loading in the fluid?  We compared our findings to analytical expressions for forces on suspended particles that have been advanced based on experimental observations on macroscale particles and drops.  Work described here studied varying materials systems, including metals and semiconductors.      Our group elucidated techniques for obtaining reliable force calculations at a fundamental, atomistic, scale of analysis.  For forces computed at such a scale to gain meaning, spatial and temporal averaging is required.  This refers to what is typically called ensemble averaging; however, there is additional meaning here.  For example, to compute force on a particle due to a liquid front during a de-pinning event, the need for temporal averaging must be balanced against a desired temporal resolution at which one wishes to observe the variation of force. If a de-pinning event occurs in ttime, then it may be desirable to view how force varies on the particle with t/100 resolution.  However, a compromise may be required to permit sufficient temporal averaging to reduce statistical error.  Articles we are advancing describe best practices in establishing an acceptable balance and efficiently extracting reliable force calculations.     Using these methods, we have explored the transition, with increasing particle size, from de-pinning to contact line pinning (see Images 2 and 3) and computed how pinning force varies with particle size.  Force at small particle size, when the pinned liquid front fully wets the particle, exhibits behavior similar to what has been predicted for macroscale particles and drops.  However, a nano-scale de-wetting transition emerges with increasing particle size. This disrupts the size dependence of pinning force initially observed with a transition to a regime where force shows decreased dependence on particle size.      We have also demonstrated how particle-substrate interaction strength can be used to control the final position on the substrate of a particle that has been entrained to the advancing contact line (see Image 4). Particle-particle interaction strength affects particle aggregation and work here showed how increased particle-particle repulsion from, e.g., surface functionalization leads to more dispersed particle distribution.  Particle loading effects were explored (see Images 5 and 6), where higher loading led to less spread before pinning and non-trivial influence on the final particle distribution on the surface.     While work under this project has demonstrated that continuum constitutive relations for capillary force extend robustly down to nanometer scale particles, it was also shown that nanometer scale particles are inherently more affected by interfacial behavior.  Such effects can be captured in existing analytical expressions via size dependent terms and manuscripts advanced under this work illustrate ways this can be achieved.     Collectively, this work supported by NSF has revealed information that will enable more deterministic engineering of nano-suspension droplet and particle behavior, furthering us along the path to advanced fabrication techniques for nano-particle surface arrays.
