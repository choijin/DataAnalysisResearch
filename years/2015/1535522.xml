<AbstractNarration>Recent developments and availability of commoditized White Box (WB)  and Bare Metal switch designs along with open network operating systems have opened the door for new and open source approaches to network software development. Interest is growing in the research community in these devices and the extraordinary development possibilities these devices enable, which may have long term implications for greatly expanding the national infrastructure at lower cost and with increased programming flexibility. Potential advantages of this emerging movement to the research and education networking community include; lower cost of ownership for commercial off the shelf hardware; development on widely available Linux-based network operating system; easier integration of network provisioning into available cloud orchestration tools; reduced time in deployment and provisioning; and increased intelligence throughout the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory project at Indiana University investigates the scalability, functionality, and performance of WB platforms in combination with network operating systems and software defined networking technologies including OpenFlow implementations.  The project includes creation of a testbed that is shared with network researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Whitebox Switching is a technology paradigm which promises disaggregation of network device hardware from network operating system software, designed to allow more flexibility in deployment, more customization by users, and potential cost reductions afforded by disaggregated competition.    Our work in this project involved testing these ideas in practice, with a focus on applications typically used by the research and education networking community.  The major goals of this project were: to establish a lab to evaluate whitebox switching, to publish results of evaluations undertaken by the project, and to allow other members of the Research and Education (R&amp;E) community to use the resources and knowledge created by the effort.   As a first step, Indiana University established the lab space required and stocked it with a range of whitebox devices representing a multitude of vendors and chipsets. Relationships were established with chipset vendors, device manufacturers, Network Operating System (NOS) providers and standardization organizations like the Open Compute Project (OCP). Through these efforts, IU was able to provide a variety of Network Operating Systems on a variety of hardware platforms in our lab environment.  The first phase in our evaluation was validating that the NOS and hardware provide traditional protocol and forwarding implementations, and confirming the platform and software combinations fulfill the requirements of researchers and R&amp;E network engineers.  We found the equipment we evaluated to generally function as advertised, passing most standard switching and routing tests we performed.  Most hardware lacked some number of features desired in a R&amp;E WAN context (large interface buffers, as an example).    The second phase focused on the now-exposed Linux OS layer, and how this can be used in R&amp;E environments. This includes installing standard Linux networking tools on the device (iPerf, nuttcp), specific tools developed for our environments (perfSONAR), and the use of Linux management tools for device management (Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Salt).  We encountered some challenges during this work but were able to prove these use cases succesfully by the end of the project.  Phase three looked at the openly available APIs to control the chipsets, and how these can be leveraged for new functionality (SAI, OpenNSL, OF-DPA). A topic of specific interest was the new monitoring capabilities that give insight into the internal performance parameters of the chipset, such as Broadcom?s Broadview stack.  Immediate impact to the R&amp;E community of these technologies is less evident, but we believe that solutions built on top of these technologies may have future applicibility to the community.  In phase four, Proof of Concepts for R&amp;E specific solutions were implemented, one example of a successful outcome was with the SciPass project, an IDS load balancer / science DMZ application developed at Indiana.
