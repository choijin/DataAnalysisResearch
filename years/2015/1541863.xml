<AbstractNarration>This proposal addresses a multidisciplinary workshop with academic researchers, corporate technology providers, and agricultural producers to define research challenges and a research road-map to address the following major FEWS challenges:&lt;br/&gt;1)Developing novel targeted remote sensing and in-situ sensing technology that can be practically fielded and used in food and water system management.&lt;br/&gt;2)Developing novel integrated hydrology, soil, microclimate, and plant/agricultural production models that interact accurately and across traditional scales for understanding local, regional, and national impacts.&lt;br/&gt;3)Turning this developing and pending FEWS data deluge into usable, actionable information for agricultural producers, local and regional decision makers, and citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop addresses the emerging issues in the food/water/energy system throughout the diverse geography of United States and over various crops and environmental conditions to better understand and model, and ultimate devise a solution for the changes to the FEWS system. The solution must be multifaceted, multidisciplinary in order to incorporate sensing, hydrology, visual analytics, and the potential for increased climate change. The workshop will generate a report and other artifacts that will lead to research into solving these challenges and have an impact on scientific fields including, sensing technology, hydrology, soil science, climate, data fusion, analysis, visualization, and data driven decision making, as well as agricultural production, local and regional economies, sustainability and planning.</AbstractNarration>
