<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to reduce the carbon footprint of industrial activity through more energy efficient air and gas compression.   The global market for air and gas compressors is estimated to exceed $30 billion.  It is estimated that approximately $50 billion in energy costs is spent globally on air and gas compression each year.  Isothermal compression has been thought to be unachievable due to the requirement of rapidly capturing the heat of compression.  By creating a fundamentally new method for compression, this technology has the potential to dramatically reduce both operating costs for compression and greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy usage for compression. The proposed technology also has the potential to change the way thermodynamics and compression methods are taught in mechanical engineering classes.  Engineering students will now be taught that rapid isothermal compression is possible, and will be challenged to find ways to apply the concepts to a broad range of applications.  Further study and exploitation of isothermal compression may lead to an ever evolving field of application, potentially creating additional areas of research and learning.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the energy efficiencies of a novel method for compressing air and gas in an isothermal compression process.   Heat generated during air and gas compression leads to high energy consumption.  The technology proposed utilizes a liquid/gas emulsion to compress gas in a spinning disc.  The compression method has been proven with bench-top prototypes.  This Phase 1 project will validate total system efficiencies through the design, manufacturing, and testing of a commercial scale system capable of generating test data for comparison against current commercial air compressors.  It is anticipated that the first commercial test unit will generate energy efficiencies on par or above current commercial products.  The test unit will provide comprehensive data on total system efficiencies and system component efficiencies, which will provide a basis for addressing system design issues necessary to enhance overall efficiencies for commercialization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:  The objectives at the beginning of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project were to validate the energy efficiencies of a novel method for compressing air and gas in an isothermal compression process. Heat generated during air and gas compression leads to high energy consumption. According to a Working Paper by Waide &amp; Brunner, on a global basis, compressors driven by electric motors were estimated to consume 32% of the electricity consumption from electric motor driven systems, or 2,267 Terrawatt Hours Per Year in 2006.   Carnot Compression LLC has developed a proprietary technology that utilizes a liquid/gas emulsion to compress gas in a spinning disc. The compression method has been proven with bench-top prototypes. The objectives of the Phase 1 project were to validate total system efficiencies through the design, manufacturing, and testing of a commercial scale system capable of generating test data for comparison against current commercial air compressors. The test unit is the first systems-level prototype for the Carnot technology, with the objectives of providing comprehensive data on total system efficiencies and system component efficiencies, to form a basis for advancing the technology to commercial readiness.  The specific objective of this project was to build and test a full scale prototype model of an isothermal air compressor capable of achieving 25 cubic feet per minute of air flow at 150 psi, using less than 10 HP of electrical power.    The project was divided into several steps.  First, benchtop testing of the initial theory was conducted using a small, "Rotaylor" type compressor unit to confirm ejector and compression tube layout and sizing.    The next step was to design a systems-level, commercial scale, 800 tube version of the Rotaylor type compressor with complete balance of system components integrated into a single machine, including a, compressor system, energy recovery turbine, water and air seals, pressure recovery pitot/volute system, and a heat exchange system to dissipate the heat of compression absorbed by the working liquid.  This design was completed and confirmed via CFD and FEA structural analysis to confirm and optimize device performance.  The next step was to design the water recirculation system.  This system was modeled as a thermodynamic, closed loop cycle where parametric calculations could be performed enabling the optimization of water flow and energy consumption.  The next step was to build a full-scale prototype of the compressor system for testing and performance verification.  Key outcomes or Other achievements:  Significant accomplishments from the project include:  A detailed combined thermodynamic model of the compressor system was developed indicating modelled overall power consumption of 6.4 horsepower, resulting in an isothermal efficiency of over 73%. All engineering design and analysis of the compressor system was completed, and a full prototype was fabricated and assembled..   A computerized data acquisition and control system was developed, enabling thorough testing and optimization of all current and future compressor configurations.     This prototype is not only capable of testing the specific data point selected at the project initiation, but provides a highly flexible test bed for optimization of performance and testing of various compressor configurations.  Start-up testing has indicated that the prototype is mechanically sound.  Component and systems level testing is in process as of the date of this report.  Continued testing with this device will provide the systems-level results necessary to accelerate our technology to commercial readiness.
