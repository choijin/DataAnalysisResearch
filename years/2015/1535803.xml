<AbstractNarration>Owing to concerns over the depletion of fossil fuels and environmental devastation, there is growing interest in reducing and replacing petroleum feedstock for the production of commodity chemicals and materials. In particular, the production of plastics from renewable resources (bioplastics) is one of the fastest-growing materials sectors in recent years. Nylons 11 and 12 are extensively used in automotive and solar industries, and these two rapidly growing markets are expected to experience an annual growth rate that exceeds 33% through 2016. In 2012, safety-related closures of petroleum-based precursor manufacturing plants led to a serious shortage of precursor material for these two markets. Consequently, auto suppliers had to actively seek other sustainable options; including new synthetic pathways from renewable feedstock or new alternative materials. Nylon 13 is a promising, yet unexploited, material that has been reported to have properties similar to that of Nylon 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology enables oleic acid to be used as an economical bio-sourced feedstock for the production of Nylons 11, 12, and 13. Currently, Nylon 12 is produced from petroleum feedstock and Nylon 11 is produced from ricinoleic acid that is only available from castor beans.Over the past two years, this team has developed a new approach for the conversion of oleic acid (or oleic acid methyl ester) to Nylons 11, 12 and 13 that uses a ring-closing metathesis (RCM) step. Precursors of nylons (fatty amino acids) are currently manufactured via lengthy multi-step syntheses that produce the desired products from either a petroleum resource (Nylon 12) or from ricinoleic acid (Nylon 11) available only from castor beans. In addition, this synthetic process requires energy intensive steps involving high temperatures and pressures. In contrast, the proposed RCM method uses readily available oleic acid, and it requires fewer steps, all of which involve mild reaction conditions. Finally, the proposed approach forms fewer undesirable side-products such as isomers and oligomers (due to its mild conditions) or by-products (since all of the reagents are stoichiometric) thereby simplifying the isolation and purification of the final material.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of our research project was to assess the commercial viability of our previously developed technology, the conversion of bio-sourced lipids to value-added products.  More specifically, we focused on conversion of microalgae-derived lipids to polymer  (polyamide, PA) precursors and surfactants (alkanolamides, secondary surfactant for detergents).  With the funding from I-Corps and help from instructors, we have interviewed over 60 individuals in PA or surfactant business, including PA/surfactant producers, compounders/formulators, distributors, users, and end-product users (retail customers). Since we were expecting to see economical benefit of using algal lipids, we have interviewed "microalgae producers", i.e., water/air cleaning industries that produce microalgae as waste products.     The value propositions of our technologies for PA precursor / surfactant production were the following: 1. Reduction of carbon footprint of their products. 2. Production of products with unique properties to open new markets and revenue streams. 3. Alternative bio-source and supply of existing raw materials.  .....for microalgae producers: 4. Production of high value products (from their waste product) for sale that create additional revenue.  The following summarizes our learning from each customer segment.  PA industries: At the beginning, we assumed that impact from explosion of one of the major facilities of PA12 production occurred in 2012 still remained, and to see a shortage of PA12 and that its safer production methods are being sought.  However, we found that the impact of the incident no longer existed and various alternative materials for PA12 had emerged and replaced its use.  In terms of their current needs and interest in bio-sourced materials, although they showed modest interest in new bio-sourced materials with potentially unique properties, the price should be competitive or lower than currently available products.  "Microalgae producers": Microalgae producers were also interested in new technologies that could gain value products. However, given the processing cost of the technology including harvesting/drying/processing of microalgae, PA precursors or surfactants would not be cost efficient enough to compete in current market.    Surfactant industries: Interviewing with surfactant producers and compounders indicated that they were interested in new technologies and products if the cost is equal to or lower than the existing products. Unlike in the case with PA, our analysis showed that production cost of surfactants using our technology would be slightly higher (if algal lipid is used) or similar to (if vegetable oil is used) that of comparable surfactants made from coconut oil.  Interestingly, we learned that the typical cost of surfactants depends on end products. House-hold products tends to tolerate higher price for their components, because of their higher unit price (because of lower unit volume). In addition to the higher resistance to new material for personal care products (the products directly applied to humanÆs skin), we think producers of household liquid laundry detergent would be the most fitting customer segment.     Overall, we learned that in each industry, it is difficult to replace the existing raw material unless we offer either lower price or unique properties that add additional value to their products, and "green" aspect of our products are not sufficient to tolerate large premium added to their price (&lt;5%). We concluded that our technology is pre-mature to pursue commercialization. However, since overall cost of production should drop when in future the technology of harvesting and drying of microalgae develops, it was decided that this technology would still be protected by patent filing.  On development of the technical side, we have been working with a local detergent company, Spartan Chemical Company, Inc. in an effort to demonstrate applicability of our microalgae-based s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
