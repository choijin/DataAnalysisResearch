<AbstractNarration>Future computing systems will be dominated by enormous amount of data processing. These systems will have to compute over exponentially growing user focused data from ubiquitous network and internet of things (e.g., sensors, self-driving cars, mobile devices, social media). At the same time, the forward progress of scientific innovations will greatly depend on the fast and efficient computation on high volume datasets generated from scientific experiments (analyzing gravitational waves, colliding particles in the particle accelerators, etc.). However, the current computing systems are bottlenecked by memory, but high capacity, scalable memory is essential for fast and efficient data processing in the future. Unfortunately, DRAM, the predominant underlying technology for memory is facing major scaling challenge. As DRAM scales down to smaller technology nodes, cells become more vulnerable, resulting in DRAM failures. Enabling a higher capacity memory system without sacrificing reliability is a major research challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on developing fundamental breakthrough that can enable scalable memory system for the future systems. This proposal provides research plan and ideas to solve the DRAM scaling challenge in a completely new approach by separating the responsibility of providing reliable DRAM operation from designing memory cells with smaller feature size. The central vision of this proposal is to develop system-level detection and mitigation techniques for DRAM failures such that cells can be manufactured to be smaller without providing any reliability guarantee.  It is expected that ideas developed in this research will bridge the gap between circuits and systems and will enable a holistic approach to solve the DRAM scaling challenge. The cross-cutting nature of the work will influence circuit-level testing, computer architecture, and OS and systems design and can potentially enable collaboration between different communities (testing and systems/architecture). The ideas developed in this research will not only impact innovation in computing, but will also help numerous scientific fields to take a leap towards new innovations. The results of this research will be integrated to existing and new courses to impact student training and education, designed focusing on attracting the minority groups towards hardware and systems design to enhance diversity in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research enables scalable and high capacity main memory at a low cost. Traditionally, denser memory has been enabled by new circuit-level optimizations that ensured reliable memory operation with smaller feature size, without any change in the upper layers of the system stack. However, scaling to smaller nodes with circuit-level changes became difficult and resulting in higher cost and reliability issues. In this work, we take a completely new approach to enable high capacity memory. We separate the responsibility of providing reliable operation from designing memory cells with smaller feature size. Traditionally, DRAM chips have a reliability guarantee that every cell in the memory will operate correctly in the system. In order to provide this guarantee, DRAM chips are extensively tested to detect failures and faulty cells are repaired or discarded during the manufacture-time testing. Increasing number of failures with smaller feature size lowers the production yield and increases the cost. In this work, we present a new and radical approach, where manufacturers need not to provide a strict guarantee for correct operation, and thus can scale to smaller size without considering the reliabilty problem. We envision a new separation of responsibilities between production and system. In this design, the manufacturers can ship DRAM chips without fully testing them and can avoid discarding all faulty cells during the manufacture-time testing. However, it becomes the responsibility of the system to provide reliable DRAM operation, using system-level detection and mitigation of DRAM failures while the system is running in the field.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1.
