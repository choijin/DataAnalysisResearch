<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports computational research and education to develop computational tools to advance computer simulation of atoms that obey Newton's laws. Atomistic simulation is a very important and widely applied approach for understanding the behavior of solids and liquids, organic and inorganic materials, and living and inanimate systems. With the rapid advance of modern computation, it is possible to track the motion of over a trillion atoms in such simulations. A key challenge to scientists is determining how to extract meaning from such rich data. One widely applicable approach is to characterize the local arrangement of atoms.  This is notoriously difficult to do in a meaningful way. Consider the example of cooling a liquid through the crystallization temperature. How do the atoms in the disordered liquid organize to form a crystal?  Automating this type of structure analysis in an efficient and meaningful manner challenges the rapid growth of computational modeling of physical, chemical and biological systems. A useful solution would have wide ranging impact from designing materials with desired properties to understanding how they fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will develop a novel approach to identify structural arrangements around every atom in a simulation.  Building on mathematical ideas from topology, they will develop practical software tools for local structure determination that is robust, accurate and sufficiently computationally efficient to analyze even the largest simulations.  In contrast to others, the PIs' approach can be applied without cooling the structure to absolute zero as is usually done in dynamic simulation. This procedure can be computationally very costly and obscure the signatures of interesting or sought phenomena. The software will be made open source to allow free access to all scientists, and compatible with visualization codes that are already widely used in the field. This project will train the next generation in developing algorithms and software infrastructure that will enable scientific discovery and advance the frontiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports computational research and education to develop software for the analysis of local structure in atomic environments that arise in atomistic simulation in support of theoretical and computational studies of defects, phase transitions, and deformation in condensed matter.  Traditionally, continuous "order parameters" are used to characterize and identify structure in large systems of point-like objects; data sets of this kind include particle coordinates as obtained through, for example, molecular dynamics simulations and discrete particle experiments.  Continuous order parameters are routinely used to identify defects in crystal structures or to measure disorder in liquids and glasses.  The PIs will develop a novel mathematical framework centered on Voronoi cell topology.  This will allow researchers to study atomic mechanisms at high-temperature without quenching. This provides both computational and scientific advantages over currently available methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will focus attention on three research goals.  First, the development of a mathematical framework suitable for analyzing local structure in large point sets.  In particular, Voronoi topology provides a coarse-grain subdivision of the configuration space of possible particle arrangements.  The geometry and topology of this configuration space will provide insight into possible arrangements of neighbors that is especially valuable in imperfect systems.  Particular attention will be paid to finite-temperature structure of defects in crystal structures.  Second, open source software will be developed and distributed to allow other researchers to apply this automated approach for their own studies and further method development.  The software will be designed to work with other software packages that are widely used in computational materials science and applied physics.  The basic algorithms are efficient on parallel computers enabling their use in studying large-scale systems.  Finally, applications in computational materials science and applied physics will be investigated using the theoretical and computational tools developed.  In particular, the PIs will focus on the dynamics of high-temperature phase transformations, the migration and evolution of defects in crystalline environments and to the understanding of "disorder" in liquids and glasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports training the next generation in developing algorithms and software infrastructure that will enable scientific discovery and advance the frontiers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project addressed a common issue faced by computational materials scientists, chemists, and physicists; namely, the automation of the characterization, visualization, and analysis of structure in atomistic data sets, such as those generated by molecular dynamic simulations involving very large numbers of atoms over many time steps without the need for time-averaging or cooling to zero temperature to remove thermal noise. More specifically, the project addressed:  new mathematical descriptions of local atomic structure based on graph theory, applied topology, probability, and statistics; the development of open-source software for automated data analysis; and the application of the new methods to fundamental problems in materials science, chemistry, and physics.   Our structure analysis method takes a set of atomic coordinates, divides space into Voronoi cells associated with each atom and characterizes each cell, and hence atom, in terms of a topological description of the edge-graph of the Voronoi cell.  Since topology is robust against small deformations, this description of local structure is robust against atomic vibrations and small deformations of the physical system.  In particular, while previous methods tend to fail in crystalline systems heated to above 50% of their melting temperatures, the method developed here can accurately visualize defects in systems heated to 99% of their melting temperature, enabling the study of high-temperature systems in a manner not previously possible.  The method and algorithms developed under this proposal have been implemented in an open-source software packaged called VoroTop (derived from the phrase Voronoi topology) and is now publicly available for download along with an overview of the underlying theory, examples, and extensive documentation. The software has also been implemented in the widely used, freely available scientific visualization and analysis software OVITO.  Our applications of topological methods to the analysis of local structure include high temperature crystals, superheated crystals, supercritical liquids, melting, polycrystalline (grain) structure, grain boundaries and point defect dynamics. Work resulting from this research has been published in the materials science, physics, chemistry, and broader scientific literature.
