<AbstractNarration>Technological advances allow for the collection of massive data in the study of complex phenomena over time and/or space in various fields. Many of these data involve sequences of high dimensional or non-Euclidean measurements, where change-point analysis is a crucial early step in understanding the data: Segmentation or offline change-point analysis divides data into homogeneous temporal or spatial segments, making subsequent analysis easier; its online counterpart detects changes in sequentially observed data, allowing for real-time anomaly detection. Traditional change-point analyses primarily focus on univariate measurements. There is some literature on multivariate data, but very little on object data.  This project considers both offline and online change-point analysis for multivariate and object data, for instance, for temporal analysis of multiple sensor systems, images, and social networks. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed methods and corresponding theory build on previous work of the PI, which adapts nonparametric graph-based two-sample tests to the segmentation problem. The PI has shown that the graph-based approach scales flexibly to high dimensional and object data, and allows for a universal analytic permutation p-value approximation that is decoupled from application-specific modeling. Despite this recent development, many challenges remain. This project identifies these challenges, formulates them into approachable frameworks, and develops appropriate methods and theoretical treatments.  In particular, this project will (1) study more sensitive distance-based tests for testing equality of distributions in high dimensional or in non-Euclidean spaces, which will be adapted to the change-point testing and estimation problem, resulting in a more sensitive and accurate detection of general changes; (2) address methodological and theoretical issues in extending the nonparametric graph-based framework on the offline case to the online scenario; and (3) extend graph-based segmentation and online detection to a circular block permutation framework, enabling them to work for multivariate and object data with weak local dependence.</AbstractNarration>

These sequences are collected in various fields in studying complex phenomena over time and/or space, including but not limited to neuroscience, epidemiology, social science, computer vision, and astronomy.  Insights of such data often come from segmentation or offline change-point analysis, which divides a completely observed sequence into homogeneous temporal or spatial segments, or its online counterpart, which detects changes in sequentially observed data.  Change-point analysis has been extensively studied for univariate data.  However, modern applications require effective and robust change-point analysis for multivariate and non-Euclidean data.  The outcomes of this project are summarized below.  (1) A systematic study was conducted on the two-sample comparison for multivariate and non-Euclidean data.  Six testing procedures were proposed and studied to accommodate different scenarios in real applications. All these testing procedures are non-parametric and have very mild conditions on the distribution of the observations. In addition, accurate analytic formulas were derived to approximate the permutation p-values of the tests.  These tests are the building blocks of the new change-point methods mentioned below.  (2) The segmentation problem for sequences of multivariate and non-Euclidean observations was extensively studied. Three new non-parametric tests were adapted to the scan statistic framework. These methods utilize similarity information among observations and can be applied to data sequences as long as a reasonable similarity measure can be defined. All these three new procedures are asymptotically distribution-free with the critical values explicitly provided, allowing researchers in other fields to apply these procedures easily.   (3) A new online anomaly detection method was proposed. This approach utilizes nearest neighbor information among observations and can be applied to sequences of multivariate observations or non-Euclidean data objects. A particular stopping rule was recommended and theoretical properties of the stopping rule were studied, which lead to an analytic formula for computing the critical value to call a stop.  (4) A new permutation framework, circular block permutation with a random starting point, was adapted to the newly developed change-point detection methods mentioned above to deal with data with local dependence.  Analytic formulas were derived to approximate the p-value under the circular block permutation framework, making the methods easy-off-the-shelf tools to a broader range of applications.  The statistical methods developed in this project were released to researchers in academia and industry through public accessible R packages: gTests, gSeg, and gStream.
