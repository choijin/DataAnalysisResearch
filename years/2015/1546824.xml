<AbstractNarration>Science policy is concerned with the need to allocate resources, both monetary and human, in an effective way to foster innovation. Advances in computational power combined with the availability of big data on science and technology developments create ideal conditions for the advancement of computational modeling approaches that can be empirically validated and used to understand and predict future developments in science, technology, and innovation. The conference will apply a systems-science approach to review mathematical, statistical, and computational models and discuss the creation of an up-to-date inventory of methods and tools available to model the future direction of STI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together leading experts from economics, social science, scientometrics and bibliometrics, information science, physics, and science policy that focus on developing mathematical, statistical, and computational models of different types (stochastic, agent-based, epidemics, game-theoretic, network. etc.) to increase our understanding of the structure and dynamics of science, technology, and innovation. The conference will invite participation from federal funding, university administrators and other science policy makers, to help identify potential grand challenges.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
