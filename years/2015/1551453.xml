<AbstractNarration>Internet routing---particularly inter-domain routing---suffers from a long list of well-known problems that makes it difficult to innovate new types of end-to-end services and applications. Routing decisions are made locally by routers based on policies that users and their applications have little control over, resulting in routing decisions that are not optimized for users or their applications. Moreover, the "money flow," from customers through a sequence of providers that handle their packets, is determined by business relationships (service-level agreements (SLAs)) among providers---which change very slowly. One consequence is that it is virtually impossible in today's Internet to offer an end-to-end service with any real predictability of quality, let alone a guarantee. Moreover, concerns about network providers discriminating against some providers? content (see the net neutrality debate) add another dimension of complexity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging networking paradigm in which data traffic is routed at the granularity of individual flows by a programmable controller. The ability to route flows at a finer granularity than destination prefixes, and the potential for various stakeholders to express and enforce routing policies for their traffic have made SDN appealing also for inter-domain routing. At the same time, an increasing number of inter-provider connections are being realized at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). In this context, Software-Defined Internet Exchange Points (SDX) have been proposed as a way for multiple providers to collectively control the routing decisions at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). Most SDX research has focused on the problems associated with composed and possibly conflicting policies specified by providers or with scalability issues implementing flow-level policies at major IXPs with large numbers of flow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: While SDXs hold great potential, they also exhibit considerable challenges: SDXs offer mechanisms to enforce (certain types of) policies, but they do not define policies. The frameworks needed to define policies are an open area of research. Policies are typically derived from economic relationships established between providers, or between providers and their customers. Moreover, access to, and use of, resources at an SDX itself (e.g., network capacity, processing, and storage) requires that an economic relationship be established between a provider and the SDX. In other words, SDXs act as marketplaces, marketing their resources to providers (e.g., the right to use link bandwidth, processing cycles, and storage), and SDXs provide a way for providers to market their (transit) services to other providers on behalf of their customers. Current SDX designs do not consider these economic relationships and thus omit a critical aspect of Internet operation. This project includes fundamental research aimed at the design of controllers for Software-Defined Internet Exchange Points that can be programmed to implement end-to-end (i.e., inter-domain) routing policies that are tied to explicit economic relationships between network entities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The results from this research have the potential for a transformative impact on how inter-domain routing---which is at the core of economic interactions between network providers in the Internet---is implemented and used to provide novel services in networks. The interdisciplinary nature of this work---crossing the boundaries of engineering and economics---presents particular challenges in developing solutions that are technically sound and can be adopted in practice. The work involves an education component. Results from our work will be disseminated in the form of open-source toolsets and publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Business relationships in the Internet are defined in large part by Service Level Agreements (SLAs) among providers that change slowly and have limited ability to admit new services -- particularly new innovative services designed to evolve and change quickly.  Emerging Software Defined Networking (SDN) techniques create the opportunity to support new user/application-defined services in the network -- services that can be deployed and changed rapidly to meet the needs of emerging and future applications.  Although SDN creates the potential for fine-grained application-specific processing in the network, there is a need for associated payment mechanisms to compensate providers for such services.  This project explored ways to support fine-grained short-term economic agreements (business contracts) that can be used to pay providers for the advanced innovative SDN services they offer.  Because, providers often connect to one another at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) where such services can be deployed, we developed a programmable version of an IXP called an Economic Software Defined Exchange (ESDX) that can be used to implement advanced SDN services, enforce provider agreements, and assist with the money flow (payment) among providers.  We developed an SDN controller called a Coin-Operated (Coin-Op) ESDX that is used to interconnect network providers and allow dynamically created business relationships to be communicated to the ESDX for the purposes of payment, instantiation of fine-grained SDN services, and enforcement of short-term contracts.  Coin-Op ESDXs require both parties to independently express their desire to enter into a relationship by each providing payment along with the requested service.  The Coin-Op ESDX only allows network traffic to be processed and flow through the ESDX if the two parties agree and have paid for the service.  In that sense, the ESDX acts as a neutral third party with no policies of its own, relying, instead, on providers to agree on and dynamically instantiate the forwarding services and policies to be used by the network.  The ability to create short-term contracts enables providers to assign prices dynamically and thus compete for traffic. For example by selling otherwise unused network capacity at a discount, providers can increase profits, while customers benefit from less expensive bandwidth and more path options.  Our ESDX approach enables development of new services at various price points and provides customers with a range of cost/benefit trade-offs.  To support an available capacity spot-market sales approach, we developed two ways to associate network routing/forwarding service with customer payments -- the first extending conventional routing advertisements to include pricing information, and the second using a system of brokers to collect availability and pricing information and then determine end-to-end routes/pricing.  To understand the feasibility of using IXPs to offer new routing services, we developed network topology models based on Internet AS and IXP databases and found that there is ample IXP coverage to support effective ESDX services in the Internet.  We also explored ways to handle conflicting policies from providers, manage short-term contracts using rules with limited lifetimes, and associate short-term contracts with authorized providers and their traffic.  The ability to easily set up an ESDX offering short-term contracts and lightweight dynamic service instantiation creates new opportunities for a variety of applications.  For example, to support emerging smart-city applications that require low-latency response times such as Internet of Things (IoT) applications or mobile applications, a smart city may set up a low-latency edge-cloud ESDX service to locally connect and dynamically define policies among providers, thereby avoiding the long latencies that would otherwise occur when going between providers peering at a distant location.  Project findings and results were disseminated in papers and presentations at various conferences and workshops.  The project also provided a valuable learning experience to all team members involved with the project, providing new insights into both the potential of SDN-based exchange point services and the economic considerations that need to be address to make such services possible.
