<AbstractNarration>This award to Tuskegee University supports the acquisition of a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope which will strengthen the university's research capabilities in the emerging field of nanotechnology. This state of art equipment will support the research of not only Tuskegee's faculty and their collaborators from other institutions but also the local industry. With the capabilities of this instrument Tuskegee researchers will develop a deeper understanding of synthesis of various nanoparticles, including those derived from natural sources and their dispersion in host polymers and biological cells. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in cutting-edge research in nanomaterials science and engineering. This instrument along with other state-of-the-art facilities which exist at Tuskegee University will boost the university's efforts to recruit and train a large number of minority graduates, undergraduate through Ph.D. These graduates will help bring much-needed diversity to the nation's advanced technological workforce. The proposed research and instrumentation will have significant impact in education and human resources development through: (1) integration of nanotechnology research with education in all graduate programs program in Science and Engineering at Tuskegee University; (2)development of nanomaterials research at a Historically Black University; and (3) develop microscopy teaching modules for K-12 students and teachers. The minority students who graduate with an exposure to the analytical techniques using this equipment will enhance the much needed diversity in the technological workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this instrument include: a) Force Spinning Synthesis of Nanofiber Mats for Tissue Engineering Applications, b) Alignment of metal, metal oxide coated carbon nanotubes in Nylon-6 polymer single fibers and study antimicrobial/antifungal applications, c) Study the effect of alkali treatment of natural fibers for developing biodegradable composites, d) Synthesis of silica from natural sources such as rice husk and sugar cane bagasse for polymer fillers, e) Use of FE-SEM in Cancer research, and f) Study of the pharmaceutical applications of nanoparticles: Improvement of oral absorption of calcium using nanoparticles. The acquisition of the FE-SEM will also allow faculty and students involved in materials research to develop a better understanding of the material behavior at the nanometer level. The equipment will also be useful in the development of new courses in nanomaterials and various outreach activities sponsored by the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

At Tuskegee University, significant efforts and resources have been invested in synthesizing a verity of nanoparticles for biological, pharmaceutical, and polymer filler applications. For example, amorphous to crystalline carbon, calcium silicates, hydroxyapatite, and calcium carbonate nanoparticles were synthesized in-house wherein the shape and size and growth patterns was precisely controlled. In addition, efforts are ongoing in developing multiferroic materials and advanced green nanocomposites from natural, renewable resources that are as strong as currently used glass-fiber reinforced composites under currently funded NSF-CREST, NSF-RISE, and NSF-PREM grants. Investigations are also underway in collaboration with other departments at Tuskegee and other universities to study the natural, renewable nanoparticles (such as calcium carbonate from eggshells, silica from rice husk, etc.) for biological and pharmaceutical applications other than polymer fillers. Addition of nanoparticles will help in improving the properties only when there is good dispersion and excellent interaction between the nanoparticles and host materials such as polymers and biological cells.
