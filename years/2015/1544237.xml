<AbstractNarration>In our increasingly data-centric world, statistical reasoning--in particular, reasoning about data in the context of uncertainty--has become central to the skills our nation needs for students to develop, especially for their future careers in the workforce.  An undergraduate student's first formal experience with statistical reasoning frequently occurs in classrooms dominated by lectures rather than active learning experiences. In addition, the classroom instructors often are relatively untrained in statistics.  This is especially true at two-year colleges where adjunct instructors can find it difficult to take part in professional development opportunities, often perceive reform-based pedagogies as taking 'extra work' when they already have an unreasonable workload, perceive new resources as being difficult to integrate into their current mode of instruction, and recognize the frequent severe 'statistics anxiety' in their students.  SMILES (Student-Made Interactive Learning with Educational Songs) for Introductory Statistics--a collaborative project from Pennsylvania State University - University Park, the University of Texas at El Paso, and Georgia Perimeter College--will develop and field-test an innovation in online learning in introductory statistics, where students create a song by filling in key words associated with a learning objective. These interactive songs will challenge students to make conceptual connections and construct examples or context, thereby fostering statistical literacy and reasoning skills.  Through a reduction in statistics anxiety (a key impediment to student success) and an accompanying enhancement of student learning, the potential impact is striking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The underlying goal of the project is to develop resources that require little instructor time or expertise, but have a high impact on developing statistical literacy and reasoning and on reducing statistics anxiety. In connection with this, interactive songs will provide a novel learning resource that holds great potential for teaching literacy and reasoning skills in statistics and other STEM disciplines. The web-based, machine-run, and auto-graded characteristic of this resource will provide easy access to students anywhere anytime, and will address instructor hesitations regarding in-class use. For instructors, interactive songs will be readily adoptable regardless of pedagogy (e.g., as easily incorporated in a flipped class as in an online class, or a lecture/lab course), and will provide a simple bridge to the statistics education reform movement for groups like two-year college adjunct faculty members who might remain otherwise disconnected. Most importantly, these professional-quality interactive songs will be designed to engage students, lessen anxiety, and foster active learning, thereby leading to improved statistical reasoning skills. To enhance their value, the interactive songs developed by the SMILES project will involve a unique artist/scientist collaborative to create original high-quality musical resources. To evaluate their efficacy and assess the value of interactive songs in enhancing student learning and reducing student anxiety, the project team will conduct a randomized controlled field test involving twenty (20) college level introductory statistics instructors for which fifteen (15) will be from two-year colleges. Response variables will include student answers to multiple-choice assessment items and levels of anxiety as measured by a pre-Statistics Anxiety Measure (SAM) and post-SAM measurement. Since students from the two-year colleges consist predominately of African American and Hispanic student populations, the research findings of the project will expand knowledge of best practices for addressing the national need to broaden participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) discipline areas.</AbstractNarration>

What if songs could also help you learn a difficult subject like statistics? In a recent randomized experiment, we found students learned better when songs were inserted into online readings on statistical topics. Students who could hear the song and see the lyrics scored an average of about 7% higher on related exam questions compared to students who saw only readings on the topic.&nbsp; That study inspired us to make the songs even more interactive by having students give parts of the song in response to prompts, not unlike the word template game Mad Libs. This effort became Project SMILES (SMILES = <strong>S</strong>tudent-<strong>M</strong>ade <strong>I</strong>nteractive <strong>L</strong>earning with <strong>E</strong>ducational <strong>S</strong>ongs in introductory statistics; <strong>https://www.CAUSEweb.org/smiles/</strong>; see Figure 6 for logo).</p> <p>A SMILES activity works like this: Students respond to prompts on the statistical topic at hand (Figure 1).&nbsp; Those prompts might involve drag-and-drop matching, multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blank prompts, or even open-ended responses with related built-in hints and feedback that challenge students to connect context to the statistical concept. When all prompts have been appropriately answered, the interface moves to play back the song's lyrics that are displayed and sung by a trained singer. The student's responses are visually highlighted and generally sung with a synthetic voice.</p> <p>Our songs have been tested and piloted with diverse student populations at two- and four-year colleges. Students self-reported that SMILES songs helped reduce anxiety, increase engagement with the material, was relevant to their learning, and had a user-friendly interface (Figure 2). Also, students using three SMILES songs in a classroom activity performed much better on a post-lab quiz than they did on similar pre-song questions (Figure 3)</p> <p>The SMILES library of 28 short songs is also user-friendly for instructors. It's portable to any class delivery format. Students can readily enjoy SMILES songs at home as an engaging online experience with no class time needed.&nbsp; The SMILES approach also would work for other STEM disciplines, as we shared at a recent VOICES conference about teaching with song in STEM.

Released in May 2018, the SMILES songs were constructed to align with discipline-recommended specific learning objectives that span virtually all major topics in an introductory statistics course at a four- or two-year college.  The songs were recorded in a state-of-the-art studio and written by songwriters who had both statistics content expertise (e.g., a CPA, an actuary, graduate statistics degree holders, and former or present college statistics instructors) and songwriting expertise (including a graduate music degree, album cuts, and ASCAP and other music awards).  The songs can be used as either finished songs to hear, interactive songs to be completed by students, performed with sheet music or karaoke tracks, paired with readings, or sequenced with other activities in a lesson progression.  Thus, we turn STEM into STEAM without students or instructors needing special musical talent. Instructors on at least 5 continents have broken into SMILES!  Finally, to maximize impact and dissemination, project resources are freely online for statistics teachers.  Project leaders also produced peer-reviewed papers and talks, conducted workshops, and archived varied online presentations and activities not only for fellow researchers, but also for the general public at events such as the National Math Festival and the NSF STEM for All Video Showcase.  Two supplemental grants from NSF allowed us (1) to evaluate and improve the SMILES innovation through log file analysis and (2) to extend the impact beyond statistics via the VOICES collaborative), and we now describe these two efforts:   The log files help us understand student interaction with software so we can see where students struggle and where they succeed; they show us usage patterns that reveal how students' experiences are affected by hints and feedback and thus inform our tweaking of the intervention accordingly.  Finally, they can be used as an endpoint in studies on what improves learning (Figures 3 and 4).  To broaden the impact of the SMILES project and building off of prior efforts in producing, collecting, and disseminating educational songs in STEM, VOICES (= Virtual Online Interdisciplinary Collaborations on Educating with Song) was formed to promote the effective use of song in STEM teaching and learning.  VOICES collaborators include secondary school teachers, college instructors and administrators working in education from the middle school to college levels. This is a collaboration across multiple domains, including discipline-based educators (STEM and/or the arts), experienced songwriters and musicians, specialists in technology (including music technologies), science communication experts, education researchers, and leaders in arts integration.
