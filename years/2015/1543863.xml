<AbstractNarration>This grant provides travel support for U.S. based graduate student participants to attend the 2015 International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2015), which will be held in Atlantic City, NJ, USA on November 14-17, 2015. ICDM has established itself as the world's premier research conference in data mining. It provides an international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative, practical development experiences. The conference covers all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software and systems, and applications, as well as related areas such as data management, machine learning and bioinformatics. The conference proceedings are published by IEEE. The conference seeks to continuously advance the state-of-the-art in data mining. With the growth of the Web, the Internet, and data intensive technologies such as Sensor Networks, and Bioinformatics, Data Mining is an extremely important area in Information Technology. Besides the technical program, the conference features workshops, tutorials, panels, data mining contest, and since this year, the Ph.D. forum.  A strong representation of U.S. researchers at the Conference is useful in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this important area. The total number of ICDM participants in the past has been in excess of 500, with a majority of the participants from the U.S., then Europe and Asia. It is expected to provide scholarships to 16 U.S. based graduate student participants. This grant will partially support the travel costs for the U.S. based graduate student participants.  This project will promote students? exposure to research and enhance the integration of research and education. This project will greatly broaden the dissemination of research results to more graduate students. Particularly, the committee will consider candidates who are under-representative in the past meetings, and thus enhance the diversity in the field. The award results will be announced at the ICDM 2015 conference website (http://icdm2015.stonybrook.edu).</AbstractNarration>
