<AbstractNarration>Embryonic lung development is a poorly understood process involving the coordination of cellular growth and organization to give rise to functional airways that are critical for survival. Recently, contractions of the smooth muscle that surrounds the developing airways was discovered to have a critical role in the branching of new airways during embryonic development. Two types of smooth muscle contractions - fast and slow - occur in the developing lung.  This research will determine the connection between fast and slow airway smooth muscle contractions, their role in airway branching, and the cellular activity underlying these processes. Deeper understanding of the mechanisms that cause the growth of the airways is of importance for understanding lung development in general and also for predicting, preventing, and repairing structural birth defects. The methods created in this research to study lung development could have application to development of other organs where muscular contractions change development.  This project will offer a basis for undergraduate and graduate training in the mechanics of development and serve to engage and inspire students in the STEM fields with the creation of modules and lesson plans for dissemination to secondary schools about microfluidic approaches to treat disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spatially uncoordinated, fast peristaltic contractions and newly identified, coordinated slow contractions of the airway smooth muscle are both active in the lung and regulated by the fluid pressure within the airways. This work focuses on documenting the kinetics of airway smooth muscle contractions across multiple time and length scales and developing an understanding of its molecular regulators. To explore these events and the underlying molecular mechanisms, the objectives of this project are: (1) use video microscopy to characterize the multi-timescale contraction kinetics; (2) determine the role of contractile proteins ex vivo, utilizing immunohistochemical and adenoviral techniques; and, (3) determine the role of mechanics on inducing contraction events, utilizing a newly developed microfluidic smooth muscle in vitro platform. By understanding these developmental mechanisms, we can use them as tools to guide de novo production of tissue for regenerative medicine and enable future studies interrogating the role of specific genetic and/or structural factors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overall, several findings and research accomplishments have been achieved in this project.  We have developed automated computer algorithms which can automatically identify and quantify the shape and number of airways in developing lungs. This is needed so that we can process movies of the lung developing and growing over time by processing each movie frame (1 fame per second) in movies that last 2-3 days.  With these tools we can determine when airway smooth muscle contractions occur and how those contractions are coupled to the generation of new airways. Importantly, these methods have also been used in other research projects.  Scientifically, we have been able to map airway contractions across the developing lung and have determined a few new findings.  First, we found that an ion channel, TRPV4, is found in lung airway cells and that the activity of the ion channel controls airway smooth muscle contractions and the creation of new airways.  Secondly, in other cell studies we found the expression of some cell-surface receptors and the secretion of some soluble molecules was related to the amount and frequency of cyclic stretch applied to the cells.  This is a relevant mechanical load as the embryonic lung is fluid-filled and when airway smooth muscle contracts, it behaves as if you were squeezing a water balloon; cyclic stretch is applied to the balloon like it is applied to the airways.   Lastly, to understand how these contractions we observe in whole lung explants couple to cell-level biology, we developed a 3D microfluidic smooth muscle lined epithelial airway model embedded in a collagen gel. In creating this model to study molecular signaling, we identified a well-known fibroblast cell type that could be de-differentiated in smooth muscle.  This new finding has implications for being able to study airway smooth muscle and contractility in the lab to enable the study of clinical diseases such as asthma in the future.  The products from this grant include 11 peer-reviewed papers, 1 book chapter, and 21 conference talks and posters.  In addition to contributions to the scientific field, this grant has helped train 1 postdoc, 3 graduate students, 6 undergraduate students, and 2 high school researchers.  The PI gave a lecture entitled: "Using teeny tiny technologies for regenerative medicine: understanding how our cells build tissues and organs," to the State of Delaware Governor?s School. The Governor?s school selects ~100 high achieving students in grade 10 and 11 across the state for a month-long program exposing them to various fields and research in STEAM. The project also enabled the integration of the STEM outreach modules into the undergraduate curriculum of ?Microscale Biofluid Mechanics? taught by the PI.  As part of outreach, undergraduate student groups developed demos and teacher curriculum materials (lesson plans, electronic resources, assessment materials, and homework examples) for a 7th grade and 10th grade student classrooms.  These finalized K12 outreach modules that are now part of the College of Engineering K12 lending library where teachers from across the State of Delaware can access the lesson plans.
