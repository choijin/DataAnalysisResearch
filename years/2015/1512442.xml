<AbstractNarration>Auerbach (1512442) - The study involves theoretical calculations aimed at understanding the complex catalysis involved in converting biomass-derived organic compounds to liquid fuel precursors in the confined spaces of zeolites while avoiding deactivation due to coke formation.  A novel theoretical approach will be employed that will be benchmarked against experimental data.  The PI will also incorporate aspects of his research into educational and outreach programs including an immersive summer science experience for middle- and high-school girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal builds on recognition that selective conversion of biomass-derived organic species to longer-chain liquid fuel precursors and the undesired reaction to form coke, are both examples of carbon-carbon bond forming reactions, and thus amenable to theoretical methods that provide insight into fundamental mechanisms of carbon chain growth as affected by zeolite structure and chemical properties.  Thus, the proposed work addresses both phenomena, but through a unique theoretical approach - "metadynamics in reverse" - by examining the more-straightforward carbon-carbon bond breaking process and appealing to microscopic reversibility to gain insight into the carbon addition reactions.  To this end, the PI will employ and extend several aspects of computational catalysis developed in his lab (in collaboration with the software firm SCHROEDINGER) to obtain accurate energetics of carbon bond forming and breaking while incorporating effects of framework dynamics and long-range forces, all while keeping simulation times manageable.  Specifically, the work will address how confinement effects in the zeolite cage influence the balance between the activation and condensation steps in aldol condensation.  The theoretical predictions will be benchmarked against related experimental studies carried out by his collaborator, Paul Dauenhauer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the research is in the general insight it will provide on organic reactions in zeolite structures, especially the factors that control selectivity between condensation reactions to produce desired specific carbon-number products and unchecked carbon condensation to form coke.  In addition to the direct insight into the aldol condensation process, the theoretical techniques that will be developed and refined should have broad applicability to reaction processes in the confined environment of zeolite cages.  The PI has developed a strong education and outreach plan that incorporates aspects of his research while addressing studies showing that interest in science and math dwindles amongst girls during their middle-school years.  He also directs an inter-disciplinary program for undergraduate students at U Mass Amherst that forms teams of students to address real-world scientific issues, especially those dealing with biomedicine and renewable energy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The production of cellulosic biofuels -- liquid transportation fuels such as gasoline and jet fuel obtained from the cellulose in plant biomass -- provides a promising route to a domestic, renewable and (in principle) carbon-neutral source of automotive and jet fuels. Biofuels are renewable just like food: a new crop is grown each year, harvested, and converted into a useful energy source -- liquid fuels. And they are carbon-neutral because the process of growing a fuel crop removes the same amount of carbon-dioxide from the air as is emitted during the burning of the fuel inside a motor vehicle's engine as shown in Fig. 1</p> <p>Figure 1: Biomass cycle.</p> <p>Efficient conversion of feedstocks like plant-based materials to liquid fuels requires special chemical "chaperones" called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">catalysts</span>, which help to steer the reactions towards desired products under mild, inexpensive conditions. Zeolites are nanoporous crystals that have shown great promise for converting plant-based materials into biofuels (see Fig. 2). For over 60 years, zeolites have been used as catalysts in the conversion of petroleum products to high-octane fuels, and as a result, enjoy the exalted status of being the most used synthetic catalysts on planet earth. We and many other investigators are fascinated by the challenge of figuring out how to use zeolites for making carbon-neutral biofuels.</p> <p>Figure 2: A zeolite nanoporous catalyst containing a guest molecule in its channel.</p> <p>However, cellulosic biofuels have remained too expensive for broad adoption because the process of converting materials derived from plants into biofuels also produces byproducts, and worse, these byproducts (often called "coke") can clog the pores of zeolites rendering them useless as catalysts (see Fig. 3). As such, there is a double loss: loss of precious carbon that could be converted to biofuels, and loss of catalyst material. These losses combine to make cellulosic biofuels more expensive and less widely adopted, thus extending the use of fossil fuels and their very high carbon emissions (more than 1900 million metric tons in 2018 in the USA; https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/commodities/carbon).</p> <p>Figure 3: Intermediate acyclic and cyclic molecules leading to biofuels and coke.</p> <p>There is thus a national imperative to understand more thoroughly the reaction mechanisms leading to biofuels and coke in zeolite nanopores, to maximize biofuels and minimize coke formation. To address this need, we have engaged in a computational study along with experimental collaborators to investigate the fingerprints of key molecular intermediates (so-called "guests") that can lead to either biofuels or coke in zeolite nanopores. We have focused on fingerprinting molecular intermediates using the way these molecules vibrate as their characteristic signatures, which can be probed using so-called infrared (IR) spectroscopy. We have computed IR spectra for several combinations of zeolite-guests using the most state-of-the-art approach: called "periodic density functional theory" (DFT) to yield accurate predictions. The combination of precise experiments and accurate DFT calculations leads to the most powerful chemical microscope: able to see molecular species and their vibrations with atomic-level detail.</p> <p>We have studied by acyclic and cyclic molecules in zeolites (see Fig. 3) to determine how their IR spectra vary with molecular shape for acyclic compounds, and molecular connectivity for cyclic molecules. These structural properties are important because they represent different points along the pathway from initial feedstock to either final biofuels or coke molecules. And determining relationships between IR spectra and molecular structures can make IR a way to measure progress along the reaction pathway.</p> <p>We have found specifically that IR can distinguish acyclic shapes called "s-cis" and "trans," where the s-cis is bent and the trans is straight in shape. This is a very subtle distinction, so identifying the IR signature is an important advance. Also, trans-shaped molecules are normally more stable because they have more "elbow room," suggesting we'd expect there to be more trans molecules than s-cis. In contrast, we found s-cis to be more common because it allows a better sharing of electrons that lowers the energy and makes this molecular shape more common.</p> <p>We have also found for cyclic (ring-like) molecules with a positive charge in zeolites that having a carbon-carbon bond at the center of the positive charge is more likely in large pore zeolites, while having a carbon-hydrogen bond is more likely in small pore zeolites. This kind of trend is called "shape selectivity" because the size of the pore controls the structure of the molecule that can form in the pore. By combining experiments and theories we have found a precise way to see shape selectivity in action, opening the door to using this concept to design new ways to make biofuels.</p> <p>Although the result of our study is not immediate adoption of biofuels, we have shed new and unprecedented light on structures of molecules in zeolites that lead to biofuels and coke.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/12/2021<br>      Modified by: Scott&nbsp;M&nbsp;Auerbach</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1512442/1512442_10396985_1615579713237_Fig1--BiomassCycle--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1512442/1512442_10396985_1615579713237_Fig1--BiomassCycle--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Biomass Cycle"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1512442/1512442_10396985_1615579713237_Fig1--BiomassCycle--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Biomass Cycle"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: Cycle of biomass growth, refinement, and use as a fuel, showing the "carbon neutral" nature of biofuels.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Neha Rani</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Scott&nbsp;M&nbsp;Auerbach</div> <div class="imageTitle">Biomass Cycle</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1512442/1512442_10396985_1615579859229_Fig2--ZeoliteCatalyst--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1512442/1512442_10396985_1615579859229_Fig2--ZeoliteCatalyst--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Zeolite Catalys"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1512442/1512442_10396985_1615579859229_Fig2--ZeoliteCatalyst--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Zeolite Catalys"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2: A zeolite nanoporous catalyst containing a guest molecule in its channel.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Scott M Auerbach</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Scott&nbsp;M&nbsp;Auerbach</div> <div class="imageTitle">Zeolite Catalys</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1512442/1512442_10396985_1615579933253_Fig3--BiofuelsandCokeMolecules--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1512442/1512442_10396985_1615579933253_Fig3--BiofuelsandCokeMolecules--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Biofuels and Coke Molecules"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1512442/1512442_10396985_1615579933253_Fig3--BiofuelsandCokeMolecules--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Biofuels and Coke Molecules"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3: Intermediate acyclic and cyclic molecules leading to biofuels and coke.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Babgen Manookian</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Scott&nbsp;M&nbsp;Auerbach</div> <div class="imageTitle">Biofuels and Coke Molecules</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
