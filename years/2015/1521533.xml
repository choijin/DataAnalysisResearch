<AbstractNarration>The project funds travel support to enable students to defray the costs of traveling to and attending ASPLOS-2015. The conference is being held in Istanbul, Turkey. ASPLOS is the premier forum for multidisciplinary systems research spanning computer architecture and hardware, programming languages and compilers, operating systems and networking, as well as applications and user interfaces. The research may target diverse goals such as performance, energy and thermal efficiency, resiliency, security, and sustainability. The importance of such cross-cutting research continues to grow as we grapple with the end of Dennard scaling, the explosion of big data, scales ranging from ultra-low power wearable devices to exascale parallel and cloud computers, the need for sustainability, and increasingly human-centered applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funding provided to students will enable much broader participation by students, especially by those are US citizens and permanent residents of US and may otherwise not have adequate support at their educational institution. Underrepresented minorities will be encouraged to apply. Students will be able to attend all events associated with the conference and a rich set of workshops and tutorials. Student interactions and mentoring are vital for the growth of the computer systems research community.</AbstractNarration>
