<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical:&lt;br/&gt;This project will offer a ten-week summer program focused on computational models in engineering for ten undergraduate students in each year of the project. Computer-based models or computational models are used to understand and analyze natural and engineered systems, and are indispensable in modern science and engineering. Computational models are now widely-accepted, along with theory and experiment, as a crucial third mode of scientific research and engineering design. The undergraduate research experience outlined in this project provides the participants a skill set in contemporary engineering research that is sought after. A significant part of the skills acquired will be applicable to interdisciplinary research in academic, corporate, and federal laboratories. This skills-transferability, along with the opportunity for the participants to observe disparate research among their cohort will be a unique aspect of this REU. A large proportion of the students will be drawn from universities without graduate programs in engineering. Due to the broad applicability of computational modeling, the research experience gained, computing skills developed, and professional development provided during this research experience will prepare the students for a variety of paths to graduate education. This project will serve the mission of the National Science Foundation by training a diverse scientific workforce in the vital area of computational modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;The College of Engineering at North Carolina A&amp;T State University houses a Department of Computation Science and Engineering that offers only graduate programs and has affiliate faculty from several departments in the campus including engineering, math, and sciences. The department has extensive computational facilities that will be available to this REU program. This summer REU program will begin with a comprehensive exposure in engineering modeling methods, MATLAB computing software, and computational environments including visualization tools. Following the introductory short course, students will work on a chosen project with one of seven mentors. The research experience will involve modeling and computational tools and techniques applied to architectural, bio-, civil, industrial, and mechanical engineering problem domains. Examples of research topics are: shock motion in supersonic vehicles, hydrologic simulation, biomechanics, humanitarian logistics, analysis of soft gels, energy efficiency of buildings, and non-destructive testing. The program will offer career development workshops, visits to corporate and federal computational laboratories, and humanitarian outreach events that will provide key enriching experiences to the participants. The key broader impact of the project will be the mentored training of students in regional institutions without graduate programs in computational modeling.</AbstractNarration>

The program offered career development workshops, visits to corporate and federal computational laboratories, and humanitarian outreach events that provided key enriching experiences to the participants. The project provided mentored training of students in regional institutions without graduate programs in computational modeling.</p> <p>The REU site engaged a diverse cohort (~32 students) of high-potential undergraduates from across the country. Specific objectives achieved by the program included: (1) focus on participants' technical, interpersonal, and communication skills, (2) impact participants' beliefs in their abilities to conduct research, (3) ignite participants' interest and improve their capacity to engage in interdisciplinary research, and (4)&nbsp; development of a supportive, cohesive, and engaged community of students through group activities and colocation in a shared laboratory.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cohort 1 consisted of four females and six males, of which seven of were African-American, one Caucasian, one African, and one Asian. Institutional profiles consisted of three HBCUs (1 public land-grant, 2 private), three PWIs (1 private, 1 land-grant, and 1 public), and one community college. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the program, student came from seven majors: bioengineering, information technology, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer engineering, and mathematics.</p> <p>In cohort 2, the following disciplines were represented: four computer science majors (one double majoring in mathematics, and one minoring in Business Administration), one computer engineering major, four biomedical/bioengineering majors, and one environmental science and one mathematics major (minoring in computer science). Institutional profiles included four HBCUs (2 public, 2 private), and two PWIs (1 land-grant, 1 private). In terms of gender and race, participants included four females and six males. Seven were African-American, two Caucasian, and one was Asian.</p> <p>As in years 1 and 2 of the project, a cohort of 10 students were selected; however, through a collaboration with a DHS summer REU on campus, two additional students were added, yielding a total of 12 students for this cohort. Six were male and six were female. Seven were African-American, and five were Caucasian representing nine institutions. Institutional profiles included four public HBCU, one PWI land-grant institution, and one private PWI. Disciplines represented were three computer science majors, two computer engineering majors, two applied mathematics/engineering math majors, two mechanical engineering majors, one kinesiology major, and one information technology major.</p> <p>The project had one internal and one external evaluator. The evaluation results reflect a successful program. Participants and mentors consistently reported finding significant value in the REU site. Participants were able to articulate specific learning outcomes that were achieved due to their participation. Many of these were directly related to the content of their projects (e.g., learning how to code in a new programming language, producing materials or data through novel processes, acquiring new strategies to solve particular problems). Other learning outcomes centered on transferrable skills' valuable in academe or in the workplace (e.g., working as part of a team, time management, self-advocacy). Faculty mentors felt that their research programs benefitted from REU participation; they saw increases in productivity and enjoyed a sense of community that developed among mentors and mentees. Some mentors expressed that their work with mentees created an opportunity for them to take a step back from their own research activity to reflect on the "how's" and "why's" of their research programs. Most exciting of all, most participants expressed that they understood more about research and the process of exploring and applying to graduate school because of the activities and workshops that were held throughout the program.</p> <p>Fourteen conference publications with the student as the first author, resulted from the 32 participants. Of the 32 students who participated in the EMCoR REU at NCA&amp;T, seven are employed, 16 are continuing their undergraduate education, and four are enrolled in graduate school.
