<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Prior NSF support resulted in a technique to measure, and even to image, distortion of microwave frequency electrical signals in superconducting devices.  This project refines the technique, uses it to understand the origin of electrical distortion, and explores opportunities to apply controlled distortion to future technologies.  Electrical distortion also provides insight into the underlying physics of superconductors, and the Hope College undergraduate microwave research laboratory has discovered some key distinctions in the physics of the two broad categories of distortion: even and odd distortion.  In-depth experiments with this NSF supported discovery are a key component of this project.  Domestic and international collaborations, involving experts in distortion as well as materials fabrication and modification, ensure that this research fits into the larger framework of superconductivity, while also exposing undergraduates to the international and collaborative nature of science.  Finally, conclusions about superconductivity can only be drawn if the materials are thoroughly characterized.  Therefore, undergraduates are also gaining experience in highly marketable electron and ion beam analysis methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The scientific objectives of this project include the spatially resolved raster imaging of microwave nonlinearity in superconducting structures, and the role of magnetic flux vortices in the generation of the even and odd orders of this nonlinearity.  Superconducting thin film nonlinearity is being studied with a new technique to locally measure intermodulation distortion, which also permits synchronous determination of each order's current.  When combined with laser scanning microscopy, the resistive and inductive components of the nonlinearity are also distinguished.  With these methods developed with prior support, the physical mechanisms behind these even and odd order spurious signals, which appear to depend differently on induced vortex matter, are being investigated.  This research depends on the availability of a large number of industrially manufactured microstrip devices, of which the PI possesses hundreds.  Undergraduates are gaining work experience in transferable skills such as microwave test and measurement, electronic design and analysis, high frequency signal analysis, device fabrication, vacuum and cryogenics, electron microscopy, and ion beam analysis.  The program at Hope College, which is also open to students from a nearby regional state university, is one of only a handful of US undergraduate superconductivity research programs with demonstrated longevity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broader impact: This work is conducted by undergraduate students in direct collaboration with the principal investigator.  Hope College provides a space for undergraduates to engage in the research field of superconductivity and actually take the lead on portions of the project while receiving direct mentorship from the PI and without interference from graduate students.  This approach recognizes the two-pronged reality that nearly half of all physics students enter the STEM workforce directly after their undergraduate studies while at the same time gives a high quality of experience to those who are preparing for graduate school.  Most of the results from this project came from the eight undergraduate individuals who worked on it, including one from nearby Grand Valley State University who likely would not have had this kind of research opportunity.  The summer program in this project includes a three-hour workshop on physics careers, which was presented each summer to about 15 physics majors.  The workshop was substantive, without the ambiguities of many career workshops, and the students came away from it with a measurably stronger vision for their own futures in physics.  Finally, pre-college in-coming students are able to have research experiences in this project, which bolsters their enthusiasm for pursuing STEM careers.   Intellectual merit:  High frequency electronics can benefit from the low signal loss and the low noise that results from making components out of superconductors. They have been used in both commercial and military wireless applications to clean up interfering radio signals and to reduce radio noise.  Superconducting components turn much less of the electric signal into waste heat and, because they operate at low temperature with low loss, contribute less noise to the high frequency signals that they pass.   A limitation arises when the high frequency signal is of sufficient strength that it becomes distorted by the superconductor.  Communication systems are extremely sensitive to distortion and this project focuses on the distortion that arises inside of passive high frequency superconducting components.  Signal distortion is identified by picking up spurious signals at frequencies other than the frequency of the input signal.  During the previous award, our group developed a technique to scan inside of a passive superconducting circuit, find the location inside the circuit where the spurious frequencies are being generated, and investigate the nature of the distortion that produces the spurious frequencies.  During this recent three year award, the technique was advanced to the point that 2-dimensional images of the nonlinearity produced inside superconducting circuits could be produced.  A two-dimensional color map of the local sources of distortion in 1 GHz folded-hairpin-shaped microwave resonator is shown in the figure (center).  A color map from an identical device, but with an engineered scratch, is also shown (right).  The role that bends and defects in the transmission line play in signal distortion is clear displayed by the bright area in the map which indicates the local origin of the distortion.  Perhaps the most burning scientific question concerning distortion is its root cause(s). By positioning the probe at a location of high distortion in the passive superconducting circuit, the role of trapped magnetic field in producing distortion was investigated.  This NSF award continued an experiment to examine how static magnetic fields influence the distortion.  A magnetic field enters a superconductor in discrete vortex-like quantities called fluxons.  We found that as a magnetic field stuffs more fluxons into a superconductor, the signal distortion changes.  We also developed a model for this transience.  Most excitingly, we found that the signal distortion follows the decay of fluxon population after removal of an applied magnetic field. These include rapid remanent demagnetization, followed more slowly by the age-old Bean-Livingston model, which was evident in the logarithmic decay of distortion after removal of an applied magnetic field.  This RUI project resulted in (1) nine conference presentations with undergraduate co-presenters, (2) an undergraduate coauthored journal publication on transient flux phenomena in distortion where the 2-dimensional imaging was used to guide the probe placement, and (3) a peer-reviewed, undergraduate coauthored conference proceeding publication on 2-dimensional mapping of distortion.  The most significant outcome is the achievement of whole-device 2-dimensional scans, and the scientific investigation into our recent observation that magnetic fields play a role only in the even order spurious frequencies, something that could reveal new insights into the origin of spurious signals in superconducting devices.
