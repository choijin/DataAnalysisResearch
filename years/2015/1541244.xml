<AbstractNarration>Synthetic Biology is an emerging discipline that distinguishes itself by drawing on engineering principles and computational methods to help find the answers to vital biological questions, and to inspire sustainable biomanufacturing solutions for many societal needs. This project combines cutting-edge expertise to create programmable, high-performance, nucleic acid-based regulatory devices that can be optimized for specific applications through work on a bacterium's metabolism (the chemical reactions of life). This research contributes to the groundwork underlying the ability to program living organisms, and is anticipated to produce transformative changes in science and technology encompassing nanotechnology, green technology, and the bioeconomy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nucleic-acid-based regulatory elements offer a solution to a critical bottleneck problem in synthetic biology by taking advantage of predictable Watson-Crick base pairing to control cell behavior, and by harnessing sophisticated software tools used to predict molecular structures and their interactions. New developments in directed protein evolution prompted this investigation of the broader applicability of these techniques to perform "Unified Nucleic-Acid based Computation" (UNACS) in living organisms. In this proposal, the team proposes to identify the fundamental principles of riboregulator-based computation in living organisms and to demonstrate the application of complex nucleic-acid based circuits for metabolite control in prokaryotes and higher organisms. These tools and approaches will represent a precise recipe for rational design of circuit elements that function in living organisms as steps towards transformation of biotechnology. UNACS lends itself to standardization, abstraction, and scaling. These are all important pre-requisites for genuine "engineering" and "reprogramming" of biological systems, which are essential for synthetic biology to realize its full potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded through a transnational funding mechanism between the United States National Science Foundation and European Funding Agencies that are part of the European Commission endorsed Research Area Network in Synthetic Biology. The United States component of this project was co-funded by programs in Systems and Synthetic Biology (Directorate for Biological Sciences) and Biotechnology and Biochemical Bioengineering (Directorate for Engineering).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of the project was to establish a unified nucleic acid based computing system  (UNACS) inside living cells. In collaboration with the Yin (Harvard) and Simmel (Technical University Munich) labs we have made significant strides towards thie goal by developing generalizable tools for predictable, host-independent gene regulation.  Throughout the period of this award, the Ellington lab has developed tools for orthogonal control of gene expression based on a common ?engine,? T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP).  In particular, we have engineered a so-called homeostasis circuit that decouples synthetic circuits from the host while still providing a robust regulatory framework.  Ultimately, we have found that this enables predictive cross-species expression of the circuits.  In parallel, we have also developed a directed evolution platform to engineer a suite of novel transcriptional repressors that serve as biosensors or ?inputs? for UNACS.  Finally, by incorporating the novel nucleic acid regulators developed by the Yin and Simmel labs into the homeostasis circuit we have demonstrated that we can rationally and modularly integrate the different components of the project into a unified framework.  To build upon these successes, we have most recently engineered a retro-element based gene editing platform that can be driven by UNACS, and thereby allow for self-programmed changes of the genome itself.  Taken together, these advances provide a springboard for organisms that can be programmed to not only sense and manipulate their environments in a rational way (allowing much more efficient bioprocessing of industrially useful compounds, for example), but also for organisms that can respond to their environment by controlling their own evolution.  With the help of this award, students and members of the lab have regularly traveled and presented their work in premier synthetic biology and DNA nanotechnology conferences such as SEED, DNA and FNANO, facilitating interactions with a variety of leaders in these fields and greatly expanding both educational and career opportunities.  The UNACS group has proven to be extremely cohesive, and the various collaborators (Ellington, Simmel, and Yin labs) have regularly assembled at meetings to discuss progress and plan further thrusts.  In particular, the international conference ?DNA23? was held in Austin, Texas in 2017 with Dr. Ellington as one of the chief organizers, following up on previous venues in Boston and Munich, and overall providing the field as a whole with a bird?s eye view of the extraordinary impacts of the EraSynBio funding.  The influence of the group was most apparent in showing melding the intellectual arcs of the otherwise largely disparate fields of DNA nanotechnology and synthetic biology, and showing the interdisciplinary impact of thinking and working together          Last Modified: 11/02/2019       Submitted by: Andrew D Ellington]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
