<AbstractNarration>This award supports a study on a laser-based fabrication process to fabricate metal nanocomposites onto flexible substrates. The research objective is to fundamentally understand laser-material interactions and materials' responses during the laser-based metal nanocomposite fabrication process, and mechanical and electrical properties of the fabricated metal nanocomposites. The goal is to establish the metal nanocomposite (fabricated through the laser-based process) processing-structure-property relations. Research work to be performed includes time-resolved measurements on the metal nanocomposite fabrication process, physics-based modeling, characterization of fabricated metal nanocomposite structures through scanning electron microscopy and other techniques, and measurements of the metal nanocomposites' mechanical and electrical properties.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research is expected to provide an improved understanding of laser-material interactions and materials' responses during the laser-based metal nanocomposite fabrication process onto flexible substrates, and the metal nanocomposites' mechanical and electrical properties. It is expected that with suitable manufacturing process conditions, the nanocomposites may potentially enhance the durability and reliability of metallic components of flexible electronics, which may potentially have a broad impact on many applications of flexible electronics. This research on laser-based fabrication of metal nanocomposites provides a good opportunity for graduate student training, and some materials relevant to this research will be included in a graduate-level class taught by the principal investigator.  It is expected that research results will be disseminated through approaches such as research papers.</AbstractNarration>
