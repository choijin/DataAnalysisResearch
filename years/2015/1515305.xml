<AbstractNarration>Diatoms are a diverse group of microalgae responsible for approximately one-third of atmospheric oxygen and are an important source of essential fatty acids for both aquatic organisms and for humans. They are abundant in oceans, lakes and rivers and live either suspended in the water column or attached to other aquatic substrates; some groups also have developed motility. Recent research with diatoms has focused on their use for both food supplements and for biofuels because of both the favorable fatty acid and lipid content, and their fast growth rate. As this research is relatively new, attempts have been made to identify commercially useful taxa based on their evolutionary relationship to other useful species. This study aims to understand the origin and evolution of the first group of motile diatoms and will be conducted with Dr. Shigeki Mayama at Tokyo Gakugei University, Japan, who is the world?s expert in this group of diatoms, and also an expert in diatom growth techniques that are essential to the study. While significant effort has been made conducting DNA and evolutionary studies of other diatom lineages, very little effort has been made to sequence the DNA and understand the evolution of the first motile group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The origin and evolution of the diatom raphe, which is responsible for motility, will be investigated by constructing morphological and molecular phylogenies of early raphid and pre-raphid diatoms. Diatoms within the subclass Eunotiophycidae are accepted as the first raphid diatoms, however the first raphid genus is still a point of contention. Lineages that led to the raphid diatoms have also not yet been identified. The researcher will conduct field studies in Japan to gather taxa to include in analyses. Collaboration with Dr. Mayama, who is the world?s expert in Eunotia morphology and culturing techniques, will be an essential component of the project. This expansion of molecular and morphological knowledge will be essential to the study, as there is molecular sequence data in GenBank for less than 1% of the described Eunotia species, and no data at all for any other genera within the subclass. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project aimed to identify the evolutionary history of the early raphid (motile) diatoms, subclass Eunotiophycidae, and their relationship to araphid (non-motile) diatoms and more recently derived forms of raphid diatoms (subclass Bacillariophycidae). Work was carried out with Prof. S. Mayama, the world&rsquo;s expert on Eunotioid diatoms, at Tokyo Gakugei University, Japan. During the fellowship period in Japan, the researcher learned culturing techniques for both the observation of sexual reproduction, and for the establishment of monocultures for DNA extraction. Additionally, the PI had the opportunity to learn specific preparation and observation techniques for high resolution observation of diatoms under a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), and to identify and differentiate minute morphological variations important for the classification of Eunotioid and closely related diatoms. Additionally, several field collecting opportunities in Tokyo and Gunma Prefectures provided materials that were used in a morphological analysis of Eunotioid and other diatoms. This analysis disproved one of the three prevailing theories of the evolution of the motility structure (raphe) in diatoms: that <em>Peronia</em> is the first, basal, genus of raphe-bearing diatoms. Analyses conducted using this large morphological data set also identified strengths and weaknesses in reweighting methods for the parsimony method of phylogenetic analysis, which is often used for morphological data sets. Taxa collected from Japan that were imaged for the analysis are being prepared for a inclusion in a large, publicly available, morphological data repository, <a href="http://www.morphobank.org/">www.morphobank.org</a>. Additionally, this fellowship expanded on the existing collaboration between the labs of the PI as St. Cloud State University, MN, and the host researcher and graduate students in the lab at Tokyo Gakugei University, Japan. The PI facilitated expanded collaborations between Prof. Mayama and researchers at the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, USA, and from the Czech Republic, to expand the scope and reach of the freely available educational program SimRiver. Since the conclusion of the fellowship in Tokyo, collaborations have expanded to new labs in Japan with the aid of Prof. Mayama&rsquo;s graduate students, as well as with contact at research conferences in the months following the fellowship period.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/04/2016<br>      Modified by: Jennifer&nbsp;M&nbsp;Beals</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
