<AbstractNarration>Common core standards across the United States have elevated educational requirements and demands of teachers. The new curriculum, particularly in science, includes the engineering design process as a core idea spanning problem definition, solution generation, and design optimization. Discovery of scientific principles via ?technology? experiments and the importance of hands-on, real world projects are stressed. Teachers are struggling to incorporate engineering design challenges into their classroom as it has been completely lacking in teacher training programs offered by colleges of education across the nation and there is a dearth of options being created to fill this gap. This proposal is partially motivated from multiple requests from school districts outside of the Cincinnati Engineering Enhanced Math and Science (CEEMS) targeted partnership to provide their math and science teachers with training in challenge-based learning (CBL) and engineering design process (EDP). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cincinnati Engineering Enhanced Math and Science Program has developed and implemented a successful professional development model to train secondary teachers to integrate challenge-based learning and the engineering design process into the teaching of math and science content. The training was developed in response to new state and national standards. Key components include: 1) providing teachers multiple opportunities to experience engineering design challenges, 2) empowering teachers through ongoing coaching support, and 3) engaging students through hands-on activities and allowing choices to project selection and design. CEEMS is firmly rooted in current research in the fields of science, mathematics, and engineering education and is based on studies on how students learn mathematics and science if engineering is used as the context.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involves training and coaching science and math teachers to integrate engineering design challenges into their classrooms.  CEEMS (Cincinnati Engineering Enhanced Math and Science Program), an extensive, two year training and coaching project for teachers in 14 school districts, had already been tried and tested through an NSF funded project.  The challenge was to identify the key elements from CEEMS that prepare teachers to use engineering as a context for learning and package them into a much shorter professional development experience teachers and districts would find worthwhile and be willing and able to fund.  Based on CEEMS evaluation results and over 115 customer interviews, in order for teacher professional development to be successful, teachers need to practice what they learn during or immediately after the professional development and they need the opportunity to collaborate with coaches throughout the entire process.   Keeping these principles in mind, the team envisions an online workshop that aids teachers in the development and implementation of engineering design challenges into the teaching of academic content.  Virtual coaches would individually guide teachers each step as they create and implement the engineering challenges in their classrooms and then reflect on the experience post-implementation.     For example, teachers would sign up for the online workshop, STEMucation Academy, and be assigned individual virtual coaches, who would consist of experienced educators and engineers.  Prior to meeting with their assigned coaches, the teachers would complete interactive, online modules that introduce them to the principles of engineering design and provide examples of how other teachers taught science and math content standards using engineering design as a vehicle.  Next, teachers would schedule six individual, virtual meetings with their respective coaches.  Four meetings would focus on the development of a unit that re-enforced or applied science or math content, such as NewtonÆs laws or slope, through an engineering design challenge.  Unit documents will be shared virtually, in order for the coaches to provide feedback to the teachers.  A fifth coaching meeting will be scheduled after the engineering challenge is introduced to the secondary students, in order to troubleshoot any unexpected roadblocks.  The final coaching meeting will be reserved for after the unit is completely taught, so the teachers and their individual coaches could reflect on the implementation experience and brainstorm ways to improve the process in the future.
