<AbstractNarration>A large field campaign is being planned for the Southern Hemisphere summer of 2016 to improve understanding of air-sea exchange processes and the uptake of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the vast Southern Ocean. This project includes the measurement of many trace gases to characterize and examine the relationships between biological activity in the ocean, trace gas fluxes, and carbon and oxygen exchanges. The results will be used to test a suite of ocean biogeochemistry models to improve the understanding of key processes and feedbacks in this under sampled yet climatically important region of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The O2/N2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean (ORCAS) field campaign will include the measurement of a range of short-lived (i.e. reactive) halocarbons and other gases that can have both a regional and even global impact on atmospheric chemistry. For example, emissions of short-lived bromine compounds such as bromoform contribute to the global burden of reactive bromine, which is important in the chemistry of ozone loss in the stratosphere. Other reactive gases, including dimethyl sulfide and various organic iodine gases, are related to aerosol formation processes and heterogeneous chemical processing. Organic nitrate emissions from the surface ocean represent a major fraction of reactive oxidized nitrogen in the Southern Ocean atmosphere. Present knowledge of the atmospheric distributions and fluxes of these reactive species in the region of the Southern Ocean is limited. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help to link reactive trace gas exchanges to the basic biogeochemical cycles of carbon and oxygen as well as to detailed remotely sensed ocean properties. The results will help advance the ability to predict reactive trace gas fluxes and improve the understanding of their role in biogeochemical cycles and climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica plays an important part in influencing the chemical composition of the atmosphere.  The strong influence of the Southern Ocean is related to the air-sea exchanges of gases implicated in climate forcing (e.g. carbon dioxide) and to ozone depletion (e.g., reactive halogen containing gases such as bromoform).  The ORCAS project was designed to advance our understanding of the physical and biological controls on air-sea exchanges of these environmentally significant gases. The research mission conducted intensive airborne surveys of atmospheric O2, CO2, related gases, and ocean surface properties over diverse biogeochemical regions adjacent to the southern tip of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula. ORCAS utilized the NSF/NCAR HIAPER Gulfstream V (GV) aircraft on 14 flights over a period of 6 weeks in austral mid-summer (January/February) of 2016. See Figure 1.  All data from the mission are available in a public archive at https://data.eol.ucar.edu/master_list/?project=ORCAS.  The project supported under this grant focused on the measurement and interpretation of reactive organic gases in the Southern Ocean atmosphere.  We found that two major transport paths influenced the chemical composition of the Southern Ocean atmosphere.  In the upper altitudes (&gt;8 km), transport from the Northern Hemisphere (NH) brought elevated concentrations of NH emissions to the Southern Hemisphere.   This transport was identified by gases such as ethane and dichloromethane (Figure 2).  These enhancements in NH emissions was also noted in elevated levels of CO2.  In contrast, emissions from the surface ocean controlled the distribution of natural marine emissions in the lower atmosphere (&lt;4 km).  This is illustrated by the distributions of bromoform and methyl nitrate in Figure 2.  Previous studies from ship-based sampling identified strong regions of reactive halocarbon emissions from the ocean, but also areas of net uptake of these compounds from the atmosphere back into the surface ocean.  The ORCAS measurements demonstrated that the study region was a net source of bromoform and other reactive gases to the Southern Ocean atmosphere.   The magnitude of the source was estimated from the close correlation between halocarbon gases and carbon dioxide and oxygen data obtained during ORCAS.  Trace gas measurements were also used to test current chemical models of atmospheric chemistry.  Reasonable agreement was found for some of gases, but some reactive gases (e.g. methyl iodide) had more variable distributions that were not well simulated with current models.  One example of the comparison between measurements and models is illustrated in Figure 3.       Last Modified: 10/04/2019       Submitted by: Elliot Atlas]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
