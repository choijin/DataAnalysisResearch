<AbstractNarration>This award supports the development and implementation of searches for continuous gravitational waves from the youngest neutron stars. It also supports related work on astrophysical guidance and interpretation of continuous-wave searches as they relate to neutron-star microphysics and gravitational-wave emission mechanisms. These searches will be among the few to reach astrophysically interesting sensitivities even with current LIGO data, and will help propel the transformation of LIGO from a prototype into a tool for exploring physics and astrophysics in the era of advanced detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detection of any gravitational wave signal will be a transformative breakthrough in fundamental physics and open up a new era of astronomy and astrophysics. A continuous-wave signal in particular will give a direct view into the otherwise inaccessible interior of a neutron star and the behavior of matter at supernuclear densities. This award supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students on the interfaces between gravitational physics, data analysis, astrophysics, and astronomy; and it supports public outreach through the www.ligo.org web site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) is an NSF-funded project to search for gravitational waves, sometimes called "Einstein's messengers" for their ability to carry information to us through ripples in spacetime itself from the most violent and extreme conditions in the universe.  These ripples are very small, so searching for gravitational waves presents great challenges in data analysis, mathematical techniques, and computation on top of the technical challenges of building and operating the instruments.  A theoretical understanding of the sources of gravitational waves, such as neutron stars and black holes, can also help guide searches as well as learn about these objects from the results of the searches.  This award supported the most sensitive searches yet of LIGO data for long-lived gravitational waves from the youngest neutron stars in the galaxy and the brightest (in X-rays) neutron star in the sky.  It also supported the first time LIGO sent real-time alerts to traditional astronomical observatories (telescopes), letting them search other galaxies for possible violent events in the midst of unfolding.  None of these searches detected astrophysical signals, which were known to be unlikely to detect with "Initial LIGO" data since the instrument was in a long buildup from a prototype phase toward the full sensitivity of "Advanced LIGO." The searches achieved their main goals of setting up and testing complicated data analysis techniques and demonstrating improved sensitivity enough to detect signals when the Advanced LIGO upgrade is finished.  This award also supported theoretical work on techniques for efficient data analysis, on possible strengths of gravitational waves from neutron stars, and on how to use LIGO to learn about the properties of superdense matter inside neutron stars.  This work helped improve Initial LIGO data and analysis methods to set the stage for Advanced LIGO, which will be an instrument for transformative scientific discovery when it finally verifies Einstein's predictions of a century ago and opens up a new window on the universe.  This award supported the training of several postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, from New York, Georgia, China, and New Zealand, who went on to jobs in academia and industry in Pennsylvania, Texas, Maryland, Germany, and India.  The work, chiefly carried out in Pennsylvania and Texas, was part of an international collaboration of almost a thousand people dedicated to improving the LIGO experiment and analyzing its data.  Students and postdocs were trained in harnessing the power of supercomputing to analyze "big data" and in smaller-scale analytical and numerical methods of data analysis, which have many applications in other areas of science and engineering such as oil exploration.  This award also funded public outreach contributions such as helping build and maintain www.ligo.org and helping run the first exhibit on gravitational waves at Astronomy Night on the National Mall in Washington, DC.
