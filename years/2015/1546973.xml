<AbstractNarration>Through this award, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program, Prof. Daniel Romo from Texas A&amp;M University is turning to bioinspired organocascade or domino processes that generate multiple bonds and stereocenters in a single operation, significantly increasing the efficiency of bioactive natural product and pharmaceutical synthesis. Organocatalysis involves the use of small, chiral organic molecules to activate substrates and initiate various bond constructions. Generic substrate activation modes, and their implementation in reaction design, have led to an explosion in covalent organocatalysts over the past decade, using judicious combinations of catalytic activation modes. However, there is a paucity of general substrate activation modes, with only limited types revealing multiple reactive sites in a single catalytic cycle. This research will explore a new activation mode that could prove broadly useful for the development of novel organocascade reactions.  Undergraduates, working in the Texas A&amp;M Undergraduate MiniPharma Program, will study certain aspects of the proposed methods gaining teamwork and leadership experience, a taste of various aspects of pharmaceutical research, new research skills, and experience with state-of-the-art equipment ultimately contributing to publishable research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research pursues a novel and broad design principle based on readily generated chiral unsaturated acylammonium salts, significantly impacting the growing field of scaleable, asymmetric organocatalysis.  The organocascade processes focus on cycloadditions, enabling highly practical, enantioselective synthetic routes to carbocycles and heterocycles commonly found in bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals. In addition, the synthesis of recyclable, supported-isothiourea catalysts and mechanistic studies of unsaturated acylammonium intermediates, given their established and increasing importance for organocascade catalysis, are undertaken in collaboration with Prof. Dean Tantillo (UC Davis).  The utility of the developed synthetic methods is demonstrated by targeting the synthesis of natural products with compelling bioactivities enabling further fundamental studies at the chemistry/biology interface with Prof. Stephan Sieber (Tech Univ of Munich, Germany).  Hypothesis-driven, novel reaction development and empirical laboratory synthetic methods for reaction discovery are employed to reach these objectives.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The development of synthetic methods to prepare organic compounds remains as one of the most enabling sciences to provide novel drugs to treat disease, cellular probes to understand basic cell biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology and the synthesis of novel materials for numerous applications including LED screens, energy storage, and circuits to name a few.     In particular, this project targeted the development of novel methods for organic synthesis that will have great utility for the synthesis of drug candidates, pharmaceuticals, and cellular probes for answering basic questions in biology. We developed a number of catalytic, asymmetric, organocascade processes that provide rapid, single-pot, access to complex gamma- and delta-lactams, complex bi- and tricyclic gamma-lactones, and complex bi- and tricyclic beta-lactones.  Thus, these methods involving the use of unsaturated acylammonium salts are economical and practical (see image). These methods make use of commodity and readily available starting materials.  Furthermore, these synthetic methods will enable access to bioactive natural products, compounds isolated from nature which have led to numerous pharmaceutical agents which paves the way for structure-activity relationship studies and mode of action studies.  Synthetic methods developed through this research can and have been utilized to prepare beta-lactones, 4-membered oxygen-containing rings, which are useful intermediates for organic synthesis and also useful cellular probes for studying various proteomes.  In terms of broader impacts, the ability to prepare a variety of complex beta-lactones including the natural product spongiolactone enabled studies to determine the cellular targets of this natural product which in turn can provide insights for drug development impacting cell biology and medicinal chemistry.  Furthermore, the synthesis of novel gracillin A derivatives which displayed potent immunosuppressive activity (for transplant rejection therapy) and neuroprotective activity (potential anti-Alzheimer?s agents).     The skills developed through the practice of organic synthesis in this project by undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral students has enabled students working on these projects to contribute to science and technology in such diverse companies and institutions as MD Anderson (drug discovery), Chevron (fuels research), Hewlett-Packard (ink technologies) and academia (teaching the next generation of synthetic chemists; Scripps).
