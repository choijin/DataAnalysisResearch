<AbstractNarration>This SBIR phase I project offers a unique approach to teaching the difficult content of operating with fractions through estimation. Extensive cognitive science research shows the importance of estimating on children's sense-making, especially within the often counter-intuitive topic of fractions operations. Research also shows that estimating fractional numbers is highly predictive of future success in mathematics, and early intervention in this area improves long-term outcomes. This project aims to improve children's understanding of arithmetic by focusing on estimation. Unlike other apps, which typically end with just a score, this project will provide rich, actionable insight to help teachers screen and monitor students' progress over time, thereby improving teachers' instruction as well as student learning. Closely aligning with NSF?s mission of improving mathematics education for all children, this project fills an essential need in the marketplace for research-based, engaging software that correlates highly with long-term academic outcomes. This software will be designed especially for children with special needs and will meet the criteria for RTI screening and interventions, further increasing its commercial value for the school market and its potential to generate income. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to develop a prototype of a game focused on the addition and subtraction of fractions through estimation, which will encourage sense-making and bolster conceptual understanding. The app will also provide data reporting to teachers to help them tailor instruction and target interventions. Extracting actionable insight from children's gameplay rather than from standardized assessments, is a novel innovation that has the potential to dramatically change how kids learn. The development process will include wire-framing the gameplay and developing app components and features. The initial data architecture will involve a concept map of student learning behaviors mapped onto teacher actions for classroom intervention. The corresponding data structure will collect and store data during Phase I in preparation for further analysis and reporting during Phase II. The project will involve front-end component testing and follow an iterative design process, observing student interactions with the software, making revisions and debugging where appropriate. This project's research will include both informal design research and components testing as well as a small learning study, a close observation of 15-20 students with mathematics learning difficulties, exploring the effects of using the fractions software on 5th graders' procedural and conceptual knowledge of adding fractions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   With this Phase I grant, we developed a fractions game for iPad tablets, Teachley Fractions, that encourages conceptual understanding of rational numbers and rational numbers operations (+, &ndash;). for students in grades 3-6. The game uses a driving game mechanism that prompts students to estimate single fractions as well as their sums and differences on a number line. Extensive cognitive science research shows the importance of estimating on childrenÆs sense-making, especially within the often counter-intuitive topic of fractions operations. Research also shows that understanding fractional numbers is highly predictive of future success in mathematics, and early intervention in this area improves long-term outcomes. Current curricula commonly use the part-whole (e.g. pieces of a pie) or part-of-a-group (e.g. 3 out of 5 students) representations because they are familiar to students, despite research showing that the magnitude representation (i.e. the number line) is more effective (Fuchs et al., 2013). The aim of this project was to improve childrenÆs use of efficient strategies in estimating fractions and fractions arithmetic through visual models, such as the number line.  In our game prototype, students race around a track and encounter number line checkpoints, which require that they pass through a specific point representing the magnitude of a fraction, sum, or difference. If successful, students speed ahead, but if not, they receive helpful hints based upon the denominator, numerator, or concatenation of the addendsÆ lengths.  We tested the prototype with seventeen 3rd through 5th grade students and conducted a learning study over the course of five weeks. We found that students became significantly more precise when estimating single fractions on a number line. We also found that within the game students needed fewer scaffolded hints as they progressed, despite the levels becoming more difficult. Because most students were not yet ready for the addition/subtraction component, we were not able to measure growth in this area. To prepare for the Phase II backend development, we began deconstructing the fractions standards from the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) into teachable/assessable sub-skills and mapped them onto problem characteristics and key student game behaviors that demonstrate learning. We used this mapping to design the data architecture, which will be used in Phase II to build out an adaptive backend.   Our game prototype directly addresses the market need for fractions software that is aligned with CCSS and is based on effective methods for teaching fractions, such as the number line. Current research and the Common Core both emphasize using a number line to teach fractions, which is a novel approach that teachers are not fully prepared to teach. Teachley Fractions makes this challenging content approachable and engaging as well as easy to implement in schools.
