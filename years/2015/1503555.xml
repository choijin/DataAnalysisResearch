<AbstractNarration>Representation theory is a branch of mathematics that studies abstract algebraic structures by representing their elements as matrices.  For example, a representation of a group is a concrete realization of the elements of the group as invertible matrices, with the group operation corresponding to matrix multiplication. Representation theory has a pervasive influence throughout mathematics.  It also plays an important role in physics, chemistry, and other sciences as it provides the correct language to study the effects of symmetry in a physical system.  This project is part of the the geometric Langlands program, a major component of modern representation theory.  The Langlands program is a network of far-reaching and influential conjectures connecting seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics.  In their original formulation the conjectures linked number theory and the representation theory of algebraic groups.  More recent reformulations of the Langlands program have moved into the realm of geometry.  The simplest case asserts a relationship between first-order matrix differential equations and representations of a group of invertible matrices with Laurent series as entries.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has developed a new approach to the study of irregular singular flat G-bundles for reductive groups G: a geometric version of Moy and Prasad's theory of fundamental strata (or minimal K-types) for p-adic groups.  In the geometric theory, one associates a fundamental stratum -- data involving an appropriate filtration on the loop algebra -- to a formal flat G-bundle. Intuitively, this stratum plays the role of the "leading term" of the flat G-bundle and allows one to define its slope. The PI will use this approach to answer various questions related to irregular flat G-bundles and the geometric Langlands correspondence.  The PI will construct moduli spaces of flat G-bundles on the projective line with toral singularities -- singularities associated to a certain special class of strata called regular strata.  He will also investigate the geometry of the irregular monodromy map in this setting. The PI will study the Deligne-Simpson and rigidity problems for flat G-bundles with toral singularities.  He will construct de Rham analogues of Yun's generalized Kloosterman sheaves and show that they are rigid. Furthermore, the PI will show that fundamental strata may be associated to objects on the representation-theoretic side of the geometric Langlands correspondence and will study the induced Langlands duality on strata.  In particular, he aims to prove that local geometric Langlands preserves depth.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Langlands program is a network of conjectures connecting seemingly unrelated fields of mathematics.  Indeed, they have been called a grand unified theory of mathematics.  The original program links number theory and representation theory, but more recent reformulations have moved into the realm of geometry. In particular, the geometric Langlands correspondence involves a relationship between systems of ordinary differential equations with meromorphic coefficients and representation theory.  More generally, if G is an appropriate complex algebraic group, one studies flat G-bundles, which can be viewed as systems of differential equations with an additional G-structure.  The PI together with C. Bremer has developed a novel tool for studying the local behavior of flat G-bundles called fundamental strata.  Intuitively, the naive local leading term of a flat G-bundle does not always provide useful data while fundamental stratum are the correct version of the leading term.  The PI has used fundamental strata to make significant progress in understanding invariants, combinatorial properties, and moduli spaces of flat G-bundles.  For example, he has introduced the notion of a toral singularity?a certain kind of well-behaved singularity for a flat G-bundle.  Using this, he and N. Livesay have given an explicit description of the space of flat G-bundles with specified toral singularities at given singular points on the projective line.  Rigid flat G-bundles?flat G-bundles which are completely determined by their local behavior?are especially important in the Langlands program, and the PI  and M. Kamgarpour have found many explicit new classes of rigid flat G-bundles.  In another direction, the PI and his collaborators  P. Koroteev and A. Zeitlin have shown that in certain circumstances, it is possible to deform the geometric Langlands correspondence to a setting where differential equations are replaced with multiplicative and additive difference equations.  In particular, the PI and his collaborators have developed a multiplicative difference equation version of a well-known example of the correspondence which relates differential equations with additional structure to data from statistical mechanics, namely the spectra of the Gaudin model.  Here, multiplicative difference equations correspond to the spectra of the XXZ spin chain.  Upon taking appropriate classical limits of this q-Langlands correspondence, one obtains a similar relationship involving additive difference equations and the XXZ spin chain and also recovers known results about the Gaudin model.  This work has already had applications to enumerative geometry, and the PI expects that it will inspire a significant amount of future research.
