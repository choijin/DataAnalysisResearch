<AbstractNarration>The Weddell seal is the southern-most mammal in the world, having a circumpolar distribution around Antarctica; the McMurdo Sound population in Antarctica is one of the best-studied mammal populations on earth.  However, despite this, an understanding of how populations around the continent will fare under climate change is poorly understood. A complicating matter is the potential effects of a commercial enterprise in the Antarctic: a fishery targeting toothfish, which are important prey for Weddell seals. Although the species is easily detected and counted during the breeding season, no reliable estimates of continent-wide Weddell seal numbers exist, due to the logistic difficulties of surveying vast regions of Antarctica. Large-scale estimates are needed to understand how seal populations are responding to the fishery and climate change, because these drivers of change operate at scales larger than any single population, and may affect seals differently in different regions of the continent. We will take advantage of the ease of detectability of darkly colored seals when they the on ice to develop estimates of abundance from satellite images. This project will generate baseline data on the global distribution and abundance of Weddell seals around the Antarctic and will link environmental variables to population changes to better understand how the species will fare as their sea ice habitat continues to change. These results will help disentangle the effects of climate change and fishery operations, results that are necessary for appropriate international policy regarding fishery catch limits, impacts on the environment, and the value of marine protected areas. The project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. It will engage "arm-chair" scientists of all ages through connections with several non-governmental organizations and the general public. Anyone with access to the internet, including people who are physically unable to participate in field research directly, can participate in this project while simultaneously learning about multiple aspects of polar ecology through the project's interactive website.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this research project will: 1) Quantify the distribution of Weddell seals around Antarctica and 2) Determine the impact of environmental variables (such as fast ice extent, ocean productivity, bathymetry) on habitat suitability and occupancy. To do this, the project will crowd-source counting of seals on high-resolution satellite images via a commercial citizen science platform. Variation in seal around the continent will then be related to habitat variables through generalized linear models. Specific variables, such as fast ice extent will be tested to determine their influence on population variability through both space and time. The project includes a rigorous plan for ensuring quality control in the dataset including ground truth data from other, localized projects concurrently funded by the National Science Foundation's Antarctic Science Program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Weddell seals are large pinnipeds (weighing upwards of 500 kg) distributed around the Antarctic coastline during austral spring and summer in &ldquo;fast ice&rdquo; habitat, which is sea ice attached to the continent. As such, Weddell seals are considered ice-obligates, which means the fast ice habitat is required for their survival, as a platform to raise pups and avoid predators (like orca). However, this poses a problem because fast ice is difficult for researchers to access, even by foot, so studying populations of these seals can be fairly difficult. The good news, though, is that we can see them from space, using high-resolution satellite imagery (like you might see if you use Google Earth). This means that we have the ability to understand where all the Weddell seals live around Antarctica, why they live in those places, and how many of them there are. But, why is that important? Well, Weddell seals can be considered &ldquo;indicator species&rdquo;, which means their populations can give us us hints about the health of the Southern Ocean. Because they rely on ice to survive, they could be negatively impacted by climate change, which could reduce their fast ice habitat; and because they rely on Antarctic toothfish (sold commercially as Chilean seabass) as prey, fishing practices might have an impact on their populations as well. Now through this project, we have been able to study their global population size and environmental factors that influence where they live by searching for them by crowd-sourcing a search of the high-resolution satellite imagery. More importantly, we have developed the means by which to keep track of their presence and abundance, helping us understand not only how the seals are doing, but giving us clues about the ecosystem in which they live.</p> <p>We first learned about where seals live around Antarctica, by asking thousands of volunteers to look at images and answer a simple question: Do you see seals on the image, or not? With results of that search, we found that even though there was &gt;260,000 square kilometers (about the size of New Zealand) of fast ice around Antarctica during November 2011, we only found seals on ~0.55% of the ice available. Wow, it had been thought that they are pretty much everywhere where there is fast ice. We also learned that the Ross Sea, which is now home to the largest marine protected area (MPA) in the world, is home to the highest density of these seals in the world. Since we found where all the Weddell seals were located, we were then interested in the Ross Sea in particular: what aspects of that region were best for seals? We conducted some statistical modelling (generalized linear models) with the presence and absence data and learned that seals largely were found to be near deep water, close to the coastline, nearby large cracks in the fast ice (so they can get into and out of the ocean), and interestingly, they seemed to prefer to be near small emperor penguin colonies. The seals also preferred to remain distant from Ad&eacute;lie penguins in the Ross Sea, which we interpreted to mean that perhaps there was some form of either competition or partitioning of their habitat given the seals and penguins prey on some of the same fish.</p> <p>After we had learned where seals live, we then asked for assistance one more time by asking thousands of volunteers to look at high-resolution images and actually count seals in the places where we had already registered their presence. Using all the counting data from this online, crowd-sourcing campaign, we then transformed those seal &ldquo;tags&rdquo; on the images into population estimates for the entirety of Antarctica using new statistical models that took into account a few factors: 1. That volunteers tend to over-count; 2. The time of day and day of year of the images; and 3. A comparison with a seal expert. We found approximately 200,000 sub-adult and adult female Weddell seals around the Antarctic coast, as of November 2011. We also learned that at the continent-wide scale, seals tend to be found closer to small emperor penguin colonies, nearby shore and deep waters (at least 300m deep), the latter of which being a measure of habitat volume was a proxy for prey availability.</p> <p>Our work involved &gt;320,000 volunteers over ~18 months, resulted in four peer-reviewed publications, dozens of science and public presentations, and a greater understanding of the ecology of a critical indicator species in the Southern Ocean. This work can now be used to assess population change at various spatial scales wherever the seals occur, and to inform international conservation and management actions.
