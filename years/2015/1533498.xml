<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Fort Valley State University (FVSU) seeks to diversify the Biology and Chemistry curriculum by establishing two new toxicology undergraduate courses and increasing summer undergraduate research training opportunities at FVSU. This project will: 1) promote student interest in toxicology to address the global need for qualified toxicologists; 2) foster critical thinking and enhance problem solving skills to better prepare students for future careers in toxicology; 3) increase the number of intellectually and technically equipped students applying to graduate programs in toxicology or related STEM fields; and 4) enhance diversity in toxicology and related STEM disciplines. FVSU grants over 40% of its baccalaureate degrees to underrepresented minorities in STEM disciplines; thus this project will have a direct effect on broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities in Toxicology careers and broaden the pool of qualified students applying to graduate and professional schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed project is to improve and update the Biology and Chemistry curriculum through the infusion of toxicology instruction and undergraduate research. Activities proposed to achieve this goal include: 1) establishing curriculum for Principles of Toxicology (3 credit hours, Lecture Course) and Investigations of toxicology (2 credit hours, Laboratory Course); 2) establishing a core toxicology teaching laboratory suitable for implementing inquiry-based course instruction; 3) establishing undergraduate research opportunities in toxicology through institutional collaboration; and 4) enhancing FVSU faculty knowledge and research expertise in toxicology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project was designed to enhance the curriculum, improve the laboratory facilities, and better prepare underrepresented minority students for careers in STEM by infusing both toxicology curriculum and research into the Biology and Chemistry programs at Fort Valley State University (FVSU).   Toxicology is the study of the effects caused by chemical and biological substances on living systems. In broader terms toxicologists ensure the safety of human and animal populations from potentially harmful chemicals.  A toxicologist develops methods for determining the safety of a chemical which leads to regulations on the use of these chemicals in consumer products such as medications, food,  and cosmetics. They also evaluate the methods and disposal practices used in industrial processing including for example plastics, steel, and pesticide manufacturing. A major concern for scientists and citizens alike is where might many of these industrial chemicals end up if they do not break down and are not disposed of properly. This can lead to unwanted exposures by humans, plants, and animals living in local ecosystems.  Studies have shown that economically disadvantaged and/or minority populations disproportionately live in areas linked to chemical contamination from industrial processes and improper waste disposal. This unfairly increases the likelihood of negative health consequences in these populations leading to significant increases in health care costs.  Fort Valley State University is a Historically Black, College and University (HBCU) located in rural Georgia with a student population of approximately 90% African-American.  Many of our students are first-generation college students with little exposure to science education.  This project implemented courses in toxicology, created a toxicology teaching laboratory with updated equipment, provided opportunities for career exploration, offered summer research experiences, and allowed for scientific communication through travel to regional and national conferences.    The principles of toxicology course presented students with the basic concepts and practical applications of the science of toxicology. Students also learned to interpret data from experimental studies in order to make conclusions about the safety of chemicals. The investigations of toxicology course was a laboratory course in which students learned how to design and perform toxicological studies. The objective of the course was to reinforce understanding of the basic principles of the science of toxicology through laboratory methods. Students generated data from guided experimental studies and used this data to make conclusions about the safety of chemicals.     Equipment that was purchased for use in the toxicology teaching laboratory replicated equipment used in many government and industrial laboratories. This allowed students to be trained in laboratory techniques relevant to a future career in toxicology.     Students gained research and career mentoring from scientific professionals through their participation in seminars and career panels. Students heard from career toxicologists from government, industry, and academia at FVSU research day, in the classroom, and at regional and national meetings.      Students that participated in undergraduate summer research at FVSU, and collaborative institutions including the University of Georgia, the Savannah River Ecology Lab, and the USDA ARS Fruit and Tree nut research facility gained real world laboratory experience. Furthermore, these students were able to communicate the knowledge gained from their summer research projects at regional and national scientific meetings including the Society of Toxicology, Emerging Researchers National Conference, and the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students.   Altogether, student participants gained valuable skills and knowledge that will allow them to proceed to the next step in their education. Overall, this project has supported 121 students through course instruction and research opportunities. Many more students were introduced to the field of toxicology through professional speakers invited to FVSU. Follow up surveys given to all student participants suggest that the likelihood of their pursuit of a career in STEM related to toxicology increased following participation in the course and/or research internship.  In five years, 24 students have completed summer toxicology research internships. Of these 24 students, 11 have been accepted to graduate or professional school in STEM.    This project ultimately had the broader impact of increasing the number of African-Americans seeking careers in a STEM discipline critical to the protection of ecosystems, humans, and natural resources. Building a strong awareness of social injustices related to toxicology also served the broader impact of mobilizing the effort to rectify increased exposures to industrial pollution and chemical waste dumping sites in low income and/or minority communities. Providing students at FVSU with a future in toxicology related careers also assisted in meeting the demand for toxicologists in order to ensure human safety and environmental protection across the globe.
