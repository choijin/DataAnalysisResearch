<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM faculty at HBCUs including junior faculty who are starting to build a research program and mid-career faculty returning to the faculty ranks after holding an administrative post or who need to redirect and rebuild a research program. Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Fisk University will conduct neuroscience research using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans).  This research project will help sustain the professional growth and productivity of the faculty involved, expand Fisk University's research capabilities, and enhance the educational and research experiences of the students at this small liberal arts college. This project has the potential to be a model for increasing the number of African American students pursuing STEM degree programs and careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the proposed research is to reveal structural features of the C. elegans dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT-1) that dictate transporter function and that integrate regulatory signals to achieve appropriate motor-sensory activity in vivo. These studies will exploit recently established nematode strains derived from the Million Mutation Project (MMP) that carry single nucleotide variants at the dat-1 genomic locus which alter transporter coding sequences. The objectives of this project are to: 1) determine the impact of dat-1 missense alleles on in vivo DAT function and localization and 2) utilize reverse genetics to refine understanding of the structural bases for in vivo effects of MMP mutations on DAT-1 function and localization. Findings from this work will deepen our understanding of DAT structure/function relationships and demonstrate functionality from the trafficking of transporter proteins to the behaviors of living animals. The infusion of the project research in the Genetics and Molecular Cell Biology undergraduate courses at Fisk University will help foster increased interest in STEM research and careers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Fisk University has embarked upon a pedagogical paradigm shift designed to enhance programmatic outcomes through the introduction of authentic research into the undergraduate curriculum of biology majors via course specific implementation strategies. Through extensive curricular re-mapping and external funding, the nematode <em>Caenorhabditis&nbsp;elegan was</em> introduce and optimized by the Million Mutation Project (MMP,&nbsp;<a href="http://genome.sfu.ca/mmp/">http://genome.sfu.ca/mmp/</a>) for the study of dopamine signaling. The library of ~2,000 mutagenized worm strains was sequenced at a depth of 15X genome coverage. To date, we have confirmed the behavior of four of these lines consistent with DAT-1 loss of function assessed by the presence of Swimming-induced paralysis (SWIP).</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) is a polytrophic, membrane protein that utilizes the co-transport of&nbsp;Na<sup>+</sup> and&nbsp;Cl<sup>-</sup>&nbsp;ions to energize the rapid re-uptake of DA from the synapse in order to terminate extracellular DA signaling and facilitate re-release. As worm synaptic structure in general, and the expression of DAT in particular are conserved across phyla, studies with the orthologous&nbsp;<em>Caenorhabditis&nbsp;elegans</em>&nbsp;protein model provide an ideal opportunity to probe fundamental questions of transporter structure and function&nbsp;<em>in vivo. </em></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of experimental strategies have revealed functional sequence regions within DAT. Thus, the identification of mutant strains within the MMP library that harbor single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within regions of interest in DAT provides a platform for an analysis of the phenotypic consequences of DAT structure<em> </em>perturbations expressed in single copy in DA neurons <em>in vivo</em> that will increase our understanding of the topology, function, and dynamic underpinnings of the dopamine transporter and its<em> </em>molecular networks. The overall goal of the proposed research was to reveal structural elements of the DAT-1 protein important for transporter function and trafficking and the integration of regulatory signals to achieve appropriate motor-sensory activity <em>in vivo </em>via the genetic, behavioral, imaging and pharmacological analyses of uncharacterized non-synonymous, single nucleotide variants in the <em>dat-1</em> gene in <em>C. elegans.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A major accomplishment achieved was the embedding of authentic research into the undergraduate molecular cell biology and genetics courses.

Wormlab3 (Roussel et al., 2014; MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT) is a robust automatic high throughput model-based shape registration algorithm used to detect, track and quantify of <em>C. elegans wild type and </em>variants<em> movement </em>in a fluid environment without bias.&nbsp; The model provides also a 2-dimentional surface analysis defined around the worm?s centerline curve.

Significant Results:              The studies mandated an understanding of the molecular underpinning of dopamine signaling in nematodes, expertise in C. elegans genetic, and expansion of repertoires for manual and automated (Wormlab 3) behavioral analyses.

Time-lapsed video sequencing, thrashing frequencies, curvature maps, locomotive rates and histograms show enhanced paralysis in BY1151 (D8N), as compared to the dat-1 (ok157) deletion mutant.  We hypothesize that the robust change in swim frequency may be due to reduced surface expression and/or conformational change in dopamine transporter favoring an open-inward conformation that would influence DA binding and transport kinetics leading to a rapid efflux of DA into the synapse and the inhibition of movement. Verification of the DA dependence using pharmacological (reserpine) and genetic (cat-2 cross) rescue approaches are expected to confirm the impact of dat-1 missense alleles on DAT function and in DA neurons.              An unexpected outcome has been the invitations extended to non-STEM majors to view the fluorescently labeled neurons of the worm for C. elegans is transparent. The immunofluorescent images obtained from the Nikon inverted fluorescent microscope and assessment of data generated from the automated high throughput tracking of worm movement in a fluid environment using Wormlab 3 have led to increased enrollment in bioinformatics, molecular methods, and independent research courses at the university, and application to a sundry of summer programs.
