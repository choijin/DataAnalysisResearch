<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Organic semiconductors are a novel class of electronic materials currently receiving attention for next generation information display, highly efficient solid-state lighting, and low-cost solar energy conversion applications. These materials are of interest for their high performance and also for their compatibility with high throughput, roll-to-roll processing techniques that could ultimately enable low-cost device and system fabrication.  In all of these applications, a critical component to enhanced device design and overall high performance is the ability to engineer the confinement and motion of molecular excited states created under electrical (as in a light-emitting device, LED) or optical excitation (as in a solar cell).  Unlike the more familiar case of charge carriers (electrons or holes), it has to date proved difficult to affect the motion of charge-neutral molecular excited states through the application of an external voltage.  The proposed work will develop novel, specially designed interfaces capable of acting as gates, permitting the funneling of molecular excited states to specific locations in a device.  In an LED, this could permit an enhanced efficiency of luminescence, while in a solar cell this could permit a more efficient conversion of molecular excited states into useable electric current using simple device architectures.  Overall, the proposed work will lead to the design of advanced optoelectronic devices for light-emission and photoconversion, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design of many organic optoelectronic devices including photovoltaic cells (OPVs) and light-emitting devices (OLEDs) is heavily impacted by the excitonic character of these materials. Excitation of an organic semiconductor leads to the formation of tightly bound excitons that resist dissociation by both thermal and electric means. In OPVs, the exciton must be dissociated into its component charge carriers in order to generate a photocurrent. Dissociation is typically realized at an electron donor-acceptor interface, necessitating efficient exciton diffusion from the point of photogeneration to the point of dissociation. A similar challenge in exciton management exists in OLEDs, where it is critical to confine excitons to the device emissive-layer, and avoid spatial overlap between the exciton and polaron densities to reduce non-radiative quenching processes. In state-of-the-art devices, problems related to exciton management are often dealt with by affecting large-scale changes in device architecture, which while effective, avoid addressing the actual processes responsible for transport. For instance, in OPVs, exciton harvesting is maximized through the use of blended donor-acceptor structures known as a bulk heterojunctions. In OLEDs, confinement is often realized through the use of wide-energy gap blocking layers. This proposal forges an alternate and more direct approach to the challenge of exciton management. Work is centered on the use of architectures that directly impact the rates of excitonic energy transfer responsible for diffusion. Preliminary results suggest that it is possible to construct one-way excitonic gates, which overcome the limitations of normal diffusion and permit direct exciton transport. The novelty in this approach is in the use of device design concepts that directly address deficiencies in exciton migration.  The ability to direct exciton transport has broad implications for the design of OPVs and OLEDs in terms of addressing the fundamental excitonic challenges inherent in device operation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organic semiconductor thin films consist of molecules bound together in films that are tens of nanometers (one billionth of a meter) thick.  These materials form the basis for displays in several mobile phones and are also a promising technology platform for flexible and lightweight solar cells.  In both of these applications, device operation relies on the spatial manipulation of energy.  Energy moves from molecule to molecule as a particle termed an exciton.  The ability to accurately probe and manipulate the lengthscale for exciton transport is essential for the realization of high performance devices.  For example, in an organic solar cell, the realization of usable electrical power output requires the exciton to migrate to specially designed interfaces where charge carriers can be generated.  This work has led to several advances in manipulating interfaces between films to engineer exciton transport in organic solar cells and overcome losses that reduce efficiency.  The insight gained from initial studies permitted the demonstration of two techniques to accurately probe the migration of excitons in working devices.  These techniques are general, and are broadly of use for the probing of excitonic materials, not simply those built using organic molecules.  Here, these techniques have been applied to better understand the factors that can impact, and ultimately increase exciton migration in molecular systems.  Specifically, new insight has been gained into how migration is impacted by changes in molecular structure and exciton spin, as well as into the ability of excitons confined to interfaces to effectively move.  The technical aspects of this work offer insight into the design of molecules and devices for improved control over energy transport.  Technical efforts have been complemented by activities with the broader community including an annual hands-on, STEM outreach program for elementary school students, as well as effective dissemination of results to researchers working in industry.  The latter has been especially effective in offering graduate student researchers working on this project a different and valuable dimension of feedback on their research.
