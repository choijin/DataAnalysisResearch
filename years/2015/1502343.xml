<AbstractNarration>This award partially supports the Santa Fe Alliance For Science (SFAFS), an organization that utilizes the very large population of STEM professionals in New Mexico (third per capita among all states) to help improve K-14 math and science education in the Santa Fe area, and to raise the profile of math and science.  SFAFS volunteers have created a program that brings greatly enriched math and science content to a large number of students, parents and teachers in Santa Fe. In 2013-14, these activities, involving over 5,000 student interactions, utilized over 4,300 volunteer hours. This project will solidify the very substantial gains that have been made and to add improvements that will make the program even stronger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research questions underlying this work include (1) How this resource of STEM professionals can be utilized to make effective change happen; (2) How this group of highly-trained math and science experts can be molded into an effective pedagogical entity; (3) How existing educational modalities can be modified, or reshaped, to take advantage of this talent pool; (4) How these specially skilled individuals can help create greater student and public interest in the beauty, power and value of math and science, and bring these ideas to all segments of the community; and (5) How the social and political issues that will certainly arise can be dealt with most effectively.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes 2017-2018   This report concerns the third year of NSF award 1502343.  The purpose of the 3-year award is to continue the work of our previous proposal, NSF 1161005.  Thus the intellectual and programmatic content continues along lines very similar to the earlier years of the current award, as well as the 3 years covered by award NSF 1161005.  The Santa Fe Alliance for Science, created in May, 2005, comprises a large group of volunteer engineers and scientists working in partnership with the Santa Fe Public Schools (SFPS), the Santa Fe Community College (SFCC) and the Santa Fe Indian School (SFIS).  Our goal is to help improve K-14 math and science education in the greater Santa Fe area.  Since its inception, well over 200 individuals have volunteered to participate in our programs.  At present, the active list includes 111 persons.  New Mexico?s K-12 students have for decades ranked very poorly nationwide in math and science achievement. This denies them access to rewarding careers in the "knowledge economy."  In turn, New Mexico lacks a strong technically-trained workforce and is less attractive to new business and industry. The problem we face is systemic and long-standing and so will be difficult to solve.  On the other hand, New Mexico possesses an exceptional resource of mathematically and scientifically trained people who potentially could be an important factor in achieving meaningful, positive change in our dismal educational status.  The essential questions are: (1) Can this resource be utilized to make effective change happen?  (2) Can this group of highly-trained content experts in math and science be molded into an effective pedagogical entity?  (3) Can existing educational modalities be modified, or reshaped, to take advantage of this talent pool?  (4) Can these specially skilled individuals help create greater student and public interest in the beauty, power and value of math and science, and bring these ideas to all segments of our community?  (5) Can the social and political issues that will certainly arise be dealt with effectively?  The answers to these questions form the "intellectual merit" of this proposal (NSF Proposal Criterion 1).  We believe that the answers to each of these questions is a resounding "yes."  SFAFS?s broad goal is to help students succeed in math and science so that they have the skills necessary to choose from a great variety of careers.  As it has sought to design a program that satisfactorily addresses the issues mentioned under NSF Criterion 1, SFAFS has built an effort that in many ways brings greatly enriched math and science content to a large number of students, parents and teachers in Santa Fe.  We do this by utilizing the enormous math and science content knowledge accumulated by SFAFS volunteers during their careers.  Their training and accomplishments thus have a rewarding "second life" as a knowledge base and inspiration for our widely diverse demographic of students.    We believe that our experience in Santa Fe has demonstrated that this is indeed the case. These are the "broader impacts" of this proposal (NSF Proposal Criterion 2).  It is certainly true that similar programs elsewhere have also shown some success.  However, the SFAFS program has developed into a significantly broader effort than the others of which we are aware.  1. Our primary effort once again this year was with the SFPS/SFAFS science fair program.  This year, 2,084 students participated at 23 schools and at the annual district-wide Science Expo.  Sixty-six volunteers judged 1,730 science projects, and 553 high school students received one-on-one coaching in creating their projects.  This year, 3,342 students in 166 classrooms at 21 schools took part in an elementary/middle school science experiment, and 110 science teachers received a copy of our Science Fair Resource Guide.  2. SFAFS also co-hosted eight interactive science presentations at Teen Science Cafes that were attended by their families, science teachers and school administrators.  The co-hosts were the Santa Fe Indian School and other community partners interested in improving math and science education in Santa Fe.  3. This year, 12 teachers were equipped and trained to engage about 1,065 students in DNA sequencing labs.  4. SFAFS partnered with the LANL Foundation to host STEM Family Night events at 20 schools, involving 2,300 students and their families.  5. A pilot science literacy project was conducted at the Salazar Elementary  School to provide science fair coaching for K-4 teachers.  6. The SFAFS tutoring effort continued this year at three high schools (Capital HS, Santa Fe HS and the New Mexico School for the arts) and also at the Santa Fe Community College.  About 1,200 students were involved.  7.  SFAFS has joined the local Math Amigos Collaborative workgroup for improving K-12 math education.  8.  The SFAFS network has become more diverse by including more women and STEM professionals in our network.       Last Modified: 09/13/2018       Submitted by: Robert A Eisenstein]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
