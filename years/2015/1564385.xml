<AbstractNarration>Recently, new ideas in pure mathematics have had a strong impact on theoretical physics, and vice versa. In particular, the ideas of one of the most sophisticated areas of mathematics, the so-called theory of motives, which is part of algebraic geometry, found application in the calculation of scattering amplitudes from the data observed in experiments. On the other hand, the general notion of quantization that originated in theoretical physics has found concrete realizations in many of areas of pure mathematics. Using these new insights, this project will investigate several concrete questions in number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project involves research in several related topics. In one direction, the project will study scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory by using theory of mixed motives and theory of cluster varieties. In a second direction, the project will further develop the on-shell approach to scattering amplitudes, with the goal of finding effective ways to calculate scattering amplitudes. In a third direction, the project will study a quantum field theory approach to mixed Hodge theory and develop quantum Hodge field theory. In a fourth direction, the project will study Donaldson-Thomas invariants of three-dimensional Calabi-Yau categories relevant to representation theory and geometry. In a fifth direction the investigator will continue work on moduli spaces of local systems on two-dimensional surfaces and its quantization, and on the relationship with representation theory and mirror symmetry. In particular, the investigator will study the hyperk√§hler structure of the moduli spaces of local systems on topological surfaces, and moduli spaces of non-commutative local systems on surfaces. In a final direction, the theory of hyperbolic three-dimensional manifolds can be viewed as the study of certain local systems on three-dimensional manifolds with values in one of the simplest complex Lie groups. The project aims to develop a similar theory for all complex reductive Lie groups, as well as its quantum analog.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Studying systems of polynomilal equations with integral coefficients is one of the oldest and most fundametal problems of the Number Theory and Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry. Zeta functions are the deepest invariants of a such a system. It encapsulates, in a very mysterious way, the most fundamental properties of solutions.   The first main outcome of the project is a proof, jointly with Daniil Rudenko, of the new case of the long standing conjecture of Zagier about zeta functions    related to a single polynomial in one variable with integral coefficients. These zeta functions are known under the name   the zeta functions of number fields. Namely, we proved that the special value of the zeta function of a number field at s=4 can be expressed in a very precise way via the classical tetralogarithms. Furthermore, similar results were obtained about the special values of the zeta functions elliptic curves defined by equations with integral coefficients. These are the invariants of a single cubic polynomial in two variables with integral coefficients. The obtained results are the first progress in this direction of research over the last 30 years. To achieve it we developed a new approach to the problem. It is  based on the deep connection between polylogarithm functions and the newly emerging theory of cluster varieties.It relates two entirely different areas of mathematics.We expect that this approach can be used to get a complete solution of the problem. These results were reported at a number of conferences and seminars.   The second main outcome of the project was a construction, jointly with Linhui Shen,  of an infinite  collection of special coordinate systems on the moduli space of flat connections on a topological surface, with values in an arbitrary split group. The very existence of such a structure was conjectured by Vladimir Fock and myself 15 years ago.   This result has multitude of applications in Mathematical Physics, Lie groups Representation Theory, Geometry, and Algebraic Geometry, including quantization of the Higher Teichmuller spaces, construction of principal series of representations of quantum groups, and so on.   The results and their applications were discussed at the series of four two hour lectures at IHES, which were recorded and available online.   The third main outcome of the project was establishing of a mysterious connection between the geometry of modular manifolds and Galois theory problems arising in the study of the arithmetic of topological invariants, such as the fundamental groups of curves. One of my PhD students works on developing this theory further on.              Last Modified: 12/10/2019       Submitted by: Alexander Goncharov]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
