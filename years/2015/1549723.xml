<AbstractNarration>This EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award is an interdisciplinary project that brings together an expert in adaptive control with an expert in the cognitive basis of anomaly response. The focus is on providers of highly automated, business critical, smart digital services in which human supervisors normally monitor automatic controllers, but must take over control if anomalous events occur that the automation is not designed to handle. The objective is to ensure that such transitions occur safely, smoothly, and reliably. An industrial research partner will provide a set of cases of anomaly response from actual business critical software services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smart services increasingly rely on autonomous computational mechanisms to quickly handle extremely large numbers of transactions extremely. Given the scale and dependence on automation, even small disrupting events can cascade quickly, and human supervision may lead to late and erroneous responses when anomalies occur that challenge automated capabilities. This project promises to re-engage human supervisors in the developing anomaly (a) smoothly, by providing anomaly visualizations that anticipate when the automated activity is at risk of saturating control, and (b) quickly, so that supervisors can intervene to block cascading problems. Performance testing will be based on actual cases of anomaly response and will estimate how re-engagement following anomalies is smooth or bumpy, the increase in responsiveness to anomalies, and the range of autonomous activities that can be supervised effectively with the new form of shared control.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As machines and computerized systems become more autonomous, they also become more complex and interdependent. These systems exhibit a puzzling characteristic:  they work increasingly efficiently and well until surprising anomalies occur that challenge boundary conditions.  When anomalies challenge boundaries, events can cascade exceeding the capabilities of the partially autonomous system. In other words, these systems are very brittle at their edges.   The current solution is to transfer control to a human when external demands imposed on the machine exceed the automation's capabilities to handle the situation. This standard architecture for shared control virtually guarantees bumpy and late transfers of control to the person. These late transfers increase the risk of losing control&mdash;inability of a human-machine system to keep pace with growing or cascading demands. In real cases, these bumpy and late transfers of control have contributed to actual fatal accidents.  Regardless of the technology for automation, anomalies occur which require engagement of human supervisors from other activities to re-assess the situation and intervene quickly and decisively to forestall failures. These human roles are an essential source of resilience for increasingly autonomous systems. Shared control architectures specify how human supervisors collaborate with partially autonomous systems when the latter encounter situations that challenge its performance envelope. The human supervisor has to smoothly and effectively re-engage with the automation as the anomalous situation develops. Since the current standard architecture has a critical weakness, the question is what are alternative architectures that are more resilient?  This project used ideas from a new theory about what makes human plus machine control systems brittle or resilient to develop a new kind of shared control architecture. In this architecture, the machine handles variations and disturbances to keep a system under control. But as anomalies occur that challenge the machine?s ability to stay in-control, a human supervisor helps extend the machine?s capabilities in two ways. First, the human supervisor can recognize that some thing anomalous is going on and, second, can instruct the machine to adapt how it handles anomalous situations.    The architecture was implemented and tested for a simulated aircraft control problem. The new shared control system was compared to different traditional control system designs for a scenario where two anomalies arise in quick succession. The combination degrades the performance of the machine by itself &mdash; in  other words, aircraft control is poor.  The test comparisons showed the new shared control design improved resilient performance for handling anomalous conditions. As a result, the test provides a potential standard for quantitative analysis of resilient performance.   As a shared control design, the architecture provides a novel approach for coordinating human and automated roles. The results also demonstrate that the latest theoretical advances in Resilience Engineering have practical value for specific control problems. The end result is a new path forward for the design of shared human and machine systems that can reliably produce resilient performance in the face of disturbances, anomalies, and cascades that exceed the machine?s capability alone.
