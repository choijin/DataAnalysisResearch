<AbstractNarration>The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) software package has served marine scientists for almost 25 years. Thousands of federally funded US scientists have been trained to use GMT and count on GMT for their day-to-day research productivity. GMT?s power to process data and produce publication-quality graphics has made it a de facto standard for a large segment of geoscientists, often in combination with other opensource (e.g., Python) or commercial (e.g., MATLAB®) tools. GMT is a UNIX command-line tool set but developers can now design new tools using the GMT5 C/C++ Application Program Interface (API). Two such prototypes are the GMT/MATLAB API and an in-development GMT/Python API. The intertwined use of GMT, MATLAB® and Python encapsulates the working environment of a large group of marine geoscientists.  The broader impacts of GMT software are extraordinary. GMT has a proven track record of being a fundamental part of US/NSF geoscience research infrastructure and benefits a wide range of scientists and the public on a global scale. The software promotes and enables science across the board in earth and ocean science on a truly international scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present project will undertake a transition of GMT from a PI-driven effort to a community-driven effort with the establishment of a GMT Steering Committee.  Upgrades to version 5 of the software encompass assembling a Maintainers handbook, finalizing MGG tools, code hardening and creation of a Postscript Light plotting library for easier maintenance. Additional goals that are only partially covered by this effort include integration of externally supported geographic projection (PROJ4) library, an input/output library (OGR bridge) and the coastline database (using OpenStreetMap).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is an incredibly flexible scientific software package for the ocean and Earth sciences.  Conceived back in the late 1980s it has expanded and improved greatly, and now has tens of thousands of users worldwide.  At home, thousands of US scientists and students in the geosciences rely on GMT to get their research done.  Armed with both generic and specialized data processing algorithms and a wide variety of mapping functions, GMT is used in many steps along a scientist's workflow.  This grant strenghtend and expanded the basic capability, but also helped transition GMT to be a platform upon which more user-friendly front-ends can be built.  Our C API can be called from external environments to perform some of the heavy lifting that GMT is known for.  During this project we developed a prototype of such a front-end: the GMT/MEX Toolbox for Matlab and Octave.  Because numerous quantitative scientsts do their work in those enviroments, our toolbox makes it easy to mix Matlab and GMT calls in the same script.  This grant also gave rise to the prototype PyGMT project which is the first native Python front-end calling the GMT API directly.  Advantages of PyGMT lie in the ability to take advantage of the expanding scientific and numerical infrastructure offered in Python while still having access to GMT in the same environment.  Likewise, we have opened up a connection to the Julia computational language by building a Julia front end to GMT.  All three approaches demonstrate the strength of GMT and why it remains a go-to tool for data processing and imaging.  New improvements, such as GMT "modern mode", better interoperability, and new modules to simplify animations, means GMT will hopefully continue to serve scientists in the foreseeable future. This grant also allowed us to transition our code base from subversion to git, take advantage of continuous integration in the cloud, redesign a more functional website, acquire the generic-mapping-tools.org domain name, implement a new and more flexible Discourse forum, and set up a YouTube channel to highlight more involved GMT animations.  During the grant period we have participated in numerous short courses hosted by UNAVCO, the last two years with specific courses in GMT for geodesy.
