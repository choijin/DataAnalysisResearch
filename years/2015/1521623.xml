<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to support travel awards for student/fellows and young independent investigators (Rising Stars) for the 2015 Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES)-Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE) conference. Mechanobiology studies the role that touch, stretch, compression and shear has on the development of biological systems.  These fundamental responses affect the development of embryos, the healing of wounds, the basic function of heart, skin and other organs of the body and also fundamental responses of non-human organisms from bacterial to mammal to the mechanical stresses of life.  This support will aid in the training of new students and rising stars in this area who will do research in this area in years to come.  Developing an understanding of the effects of mechanical loading on biological systems is of direct interest to the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology program: Supporting the development of young investigators in this area is of fundamental importance to succesful future research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the 2015 conference is 'From Womb to Tomb: Mechanobiology of Generation, Regeneration and Degeneration.'  This is directly related to the mission of the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology program and also is in line with the mission of Biomedical Engineering which is partially supporting this request.  Sixteen graduate students/postdoctoral fellows will be selected by the organizing committee to receive Student/Fellow Awards and present short talks, which will be integrated into the sessions.  In addition, six junior independent investigators will be selected for a special Rising Star session, which will take place on the first day of the meeting in order to showcase their work.  Support from the NSF will be used to provide partial support to students, post-doctoral fellows, young investigators (Rising Stars), and under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary  The goal of this application was to seek funding for travel awards for students/fellows and young independent investigators (Rising Stars) for the 2015 Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES)-Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE) Conference.  Overall, the conference was a great success.  The conference drew nearly 150 attendees (up from 120 in 2014, and the highest attendance to date), including 12 funded Student Fellows and 6 Rising Stars, 5 Keynote Speakers and 15 Invited Speakers.  Among those at the meeting, 85% were BMES members, demonstrating the important role that BMES is playing supporting attendance at this conference.  The awarded NSF funds were used to support travel awards for the 5 Rising Star investigators and 6 students and trainees. The funds also supported 1 partial Invited Speaker and 1 partial Keynote Speaker. This funding in large part covered their travel, accommodations, and registration for the meeting.   Intellectual Merit  The specific theme of the 2015 conference was æFrom Womb to Tomb: Mechanobiology of Generation, Regeneration, and DegenerationÆ. Our expanding understanding of the role that mechanical perturbations play in every aspect of life, from birth through development, aging, and progression of disease, motivated the mission of this conference. Moreover, cell and molecular bioengineering technologies that allow us to probe and even control cell activity and the microenvironment at the molecular level enable new fundamental studies in cell biology, drug discovery, tissue regeneration, and pathology. We planned a conference integrating both engineers and biologists to encourage sharing of ideas toward these common goals, and the conference addressed the key problem of understanding how unique and shared biophysical cues govern cell behavior affecting: tissue formation; regeneration and remodeling; and degeneration.  Broader Impacts  The specific objectives of this application were two-fold. The first was to provide support to junior investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students whose submitted papers were selected for podium presentation on the basis of scientific merit, and to promote underrepresented groups and women in the field. The meeting provided a platform for the development of long-term interdisciplinary interactions, and exposed researchers in bioengineering, biology, and medicine to the latest ideas and opportunities at the confluence of CMBE. The second objective of this application was to foster the emergence and growth of the burgeoning sub-field of CMBE.   Graduate students/postdoctoral fellows who were selected by the organizing committee to receive Student Fellow Awards presented short talks that were integrated into the general sessions. In addition, the junior independent investigators who were selected as æRising StarsÆ presented their work during a special session that took place on the first day of the meeting in order to showcase their work. The Rising Star session was followed by a æLunches with LeadersÆ where recipients of the Rising Star awards had an informal lunch with the Keynote speakers.   This conference fulfilled its mission of executing the third ever BMES-CMBE Conference, and presented a 4-day conference with sessions focused on the theme of Mechanobiology of Generation, Regeneration, and Degeneration.  This meeting brought together the best thinkers in the field of CMBE to discuss these topics, and fostered much discussion and debate.  This funding also allowed for 38 trainees, young investigators, keynote and invited speakers to attend the meeting through travel awards, rising star designations, and speaker invitations.
