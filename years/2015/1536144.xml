<AbstractNarration>A conference, "Invariants in Low Dimensional Geometry," will be held on August 10-14, 2015, at Gazi University in Ankara, Turkey. Geometric structures on 3-manifolds have been a central focus of topology since the seminal work of Thurston in the 1970s. Significant advances, such as Perelman's proof of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture and the recent proof of the Virtual Fibering Conjecture, have generated enormous interest in geometric topology. Separately, a new research area called quantum topology was ushered in by discoveries in the 1980s of many new quantum topological invariants. The major aims of this conference, like the major research aims of geometric and quantum topology, are to advance our understanding of how geometric structures on surfaces and 3-manifolds, and the geometric, topological and quantum invariants are related to each other. Conference speakers from institutions from the United States, Turkey and other countries will describe the leading current developments and trends in the active mathematical fields surrounding geometric and quantum topology. Another important goal is to provide graduate students and young researchers with a coherent view of this wide-ranging and active research area. The week before the conference will be dedicated to introductory seminars and workshops for graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s and researchers who are new to this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on various topics in geometric topology, geometry of surfaces and quantum topology has proceeded at a remarkable pace, in a multitude of directions, and using diverse methods of study and application. This conference will gather a group of the world's leading researchers in these fields, many of whom have pioneered these approaches. Topics will include: Quantum hyperbolic geometry, triangulations and angle structures on 3-manifolds, geometry of surfaces and mapping class groups, character varieties and arithmetic invariants, colored Jones polynomials and quantum invariants of 3-manifolds. Many important open problems in these fields relate these different points of view, and require techniques from distinct research areas. This conference will focus on new developments that highlight connections between these fields, and help create new avenues for collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website: http://www.math.csi.cuny.edu/abhijit/turkey2015</AbstractNarration>

It was a very successful and well-attended international conference, reflecting wide international interest in the areas of low-dimensional topology, geometry and knot theory.  The speakers included well-known, established mathematicians as well as postdocs from many different countries, including the United States, Turkey, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.  Many participants were students, recent Ph.D.'s and researchers new to these areas, who benefited not only from five full days of research presentations, but also from the preceding week-long ``Workshop on Invariants of Knots, Surfaces and 3-manifolds,'' held at Gazi University on August 3-7, 2015, with excellent introductory talks by six of the conference speakers.  The conference research talks were roundly praised for their high quality and accessibility.  Most of the talks were followed by extensive questions and comments by experts in the audience. These talks provided an unusual variety of points of view, which are required to makes advances in such multi-disciplinary topics. Additionally, students and post-doctoral researchers gained a rare comprehensive view of this wide-ranging and active research area.  In short, in terms of subject matter, presentation and attendance, the caliber of this conference was extraordinary.  The conference featured 28 speakers and had 106 registered participants, including 12 graduate students and post-doctoral researchers who were supported by conference funds.  All of the student participants were provided accommodation by Gazi University in the Gazi University dormitory. All speakers and organizers were provided accommodation by Gazi University in the Gazi University guest house. In addition, during the conference Gazi University provided coffee and refreshments twice a day, daily lunch in the cafeteria, and a sumptuous banquet dinner on Wednesday, August 8, 2015.  These considerable arrangements created a very warm and collegial environment for participants to get to know each other, and to collaborate on common research interests.
