<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. This project investigates how to provide customized instructional scaffolding to young kids to learn science in unstructured, out-of-school environments. The innovation is in using 'virtual STEM buddies' (VSBs), a computerized character that functions as both a mentor and a peer, and interacts with a child across exhibits within a children's museum to help them learn about Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Research will examine how to design and build such technologies, and how the 'virtual buddy' fits into other learning interactions (such as those between parent and child, or between museum guide and child). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The VSB, an intelligent embodied agent, will be built and pilot tested at the Children's Museum of Atlanta, with engineering research focusing on how to ensure the agent can align with the learner's knowledge and passions in what Crowley and Jacobs term 'islands of expertise'. Key features will include assessment of and alignment to the youth's prior knowledge; an interaction tailored to social construction of knowledge and continuity over time (so that the agent evolves with the child); and opportunistic instruction based on teachable moments both within and outside the museum. Engineering research will explore, in conjunction with participatory design, technologies for visitor identification (barcode, RFID, biometrics), user experience design to explore input methods in the noisy environment of a children's museum, and mechanisms to handle 'bottlenecking' of visitors (i.e., to allow an acceptable multi-user experience if multiple children want to access the VSB technology at an exhibit). The learning research will focus on discourse of youth in the museum with adults and peers, and will be augmented with a brief post exhibit attitudinal survey based on the "Changes in Attitudes about the Relevance of Science" instrument.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project designed, implemented, and studied an exhibit-based STEM teaching and learning product called the Virtual STEM Buddy (VSB).  The goal of the project was to better understand how children might learn STEM concepts by being paired with a virtual agent that could guide them through conceptual learning while playing STEM games.   Our initial design studies and focus groups found that young children preferred non-human buddy designs and interest areas (e.g. dinosaurs, fantasy, trains) over human-oriented ones (e.g. a virtual peer) and that parents were highly willing to use technology within a museum setting as long as it did not interfere with their ability to interact with and monitor their children.  They also did not want the experience to be more "screen time", where children were inactive at the exhibit.   These studies yielded a professionally-installed exhibit at the Children's Museum of Atlanta.  Children configure their own VSB, which can be recalled at a later date through a texted passcode) and then can choose to play one of two highly-active, motion-based video games that discuss and reinforce the STEM concepts of balance and trajectories.  The STEM Buddy provides spoken and text messages to children in parents, and cheers on children as they play.   Throughout the project period, there have been over 35,000 games played at the museum (about 1,500 per month).  The kiosk continues to be maintained by museum staff and is currently accessible to support the learning of all visitors of the museum.  The data collected from these interactions has supported continuous improvement of the STEM games and our understanding of motion-based gaming in informal learning settings.
