<AbstractNarration>General Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to improve our understanding of state repression, human rights violation and the circumstances involved with their use. For nearly 50 years, research in political science and sociology has attempted to understand why governments repress their citizens. Despite these efforts little is known about the relationship between those who order repressive acts ("principals") and the individuals committing such activities ("agents"). The research draws together different approaches in the literature to develop an encompassing theory of repressive organizations. The PIs generate new data on human rights violations, using Northern Ireland as the case of interest. The PIs test theoretical predictions regarding when and where repression can be expected as well as how it may be contained. This study has implications for understanding and ultimately preventing human rights violations within the United States and around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To account for variation in the use of repression across time and space, the PIs develop a theory focusing on three factors: how principals and agents interpret challenger threats; how event reporting determines the information available to principals and their agents; and how the repressive apparatus is organized. They examine highly disaggregated data on threat, reporting, organization, and repression across space, time, and organizational unit. In particular, the PIs collect new micro-level event data on the repressive activity of the United Kingdom and Northern Irish governments that took place from 1968 through 1998. This dataset uses British Army files from the Brigade, Battalion and British Cabinet levels to determine the degree of knowledge and reporting across these levels and to assess the role of principals and agents in this conflict across time (by day), space (by neighborhood) and actor (by battalion).</AbstractNarration>

Guided by previous work, we develop an organizational approach to understanding political repression in a theory that is at once a synthesis of earlier research, but also a significant extension. In line with the extant literature, we believe that it is essential to consider a principal as well as their agents in understanding repressive action. Differing from this work, however, we believe it is vital to understand the nature and the scale of the challenger threat as perceived by both principals and agents, the relationship between ‘actual’ compared with reportedevents, and the organization of the repressive apparatus.   Since the beginning of the conflagration commonly known as the Troubles/Conflict, there has been a great deal written about who has done what to whom. As a result, there have been a series of studies designed to explicitly catalog the behavior that took place. Drawing upon but extending this work, NIRI employs a broad and diverse set of high quality data sources available in the United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland) both quantitative and qualitative in nature.  By collecting data across the various organizational levels of the military, our project is able to document (1) what orders were being transmitted down the chain of command to direct military agents towards engaging in specific behaviors towards particular points or times, (2) what types of coercive behaviors were occurring, as well as when and where they were ongoing, and (3) which behaviors as well as which relevant contextual information was being reported upward to the principals in command.  In addition to documentation originating from state security forces, NIRI has collected and coded independent data measuring the behaviors of both challengers and government forces. To gather additional data on political activity pre- and post-military deployment, the project has collected a set of events records from a comprehensive media survey cataloging all politically relevant behavior identified in the Irish and British news media beginning in 1968.  The British military and media data are complemented by a set of event data drawn from victims’ statements taken by a human rights organization that was active during the relevant period. Because these statements were taken directly from the victims of repression, they are able to capture a broad set of hidden forms of activities not frequently reported in military documents or published by the media.  To date there have been numerous insights emerging from our effort.  For example, after 50 years, we still know very little about how state repression influences political dissent. In fact, to date, every single influence, including no influence, has been found.

When dissent has been increasing, however, repression has the opposite effect, decreasing challenging activity. This research is now being explored across levels of analysis and diverse state agents.  Additional insights are forthcomingin a series of articles and a book which are all underway.   Over the course of the project, we have developed unique databases, unearthed previously unobserved records, conducted interviews and put forward a webpage where all material could be accessed.
