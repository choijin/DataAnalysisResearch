<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines:  African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion.  In order to maintain the United States of America's global leadership in STEM, it needs to develop the untapped pool of creative and talented students historically underrepresented, who earn Ph.Ds in STEM .  Jackson State University (JSU), a Historically Black University (HBCU) and lead institution for the Mississippi LSAMP (LSMAMP), will serve as the host site for the 2015-2017 cohort of BD Fellows. JSU will execute a BD program that is based upon challenging research and academic experiences. This program contributes to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, namely to "integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities."  JSU's BD Program will contribute significantly to increasing the diversity of scientists, mathematicians and engineers in academia and the STEM workforce, thereby helping the nation to remain globally competitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jackson State University's Bridges to the Doctorate Program has four objectives, which are focused on (i) research and academic preparation, (ii) enrichment activities, (iii) national and international partnerships, and (iv) evaluation and student tracking. JSU has a strong track record for preparing primarily African American graduate students in biology, chemistry, mathematics, environmental science, computer science, and engineering doctoral degrees. To date, 97 out of the 117 BD Fellows from previous cohorts have been admitted into STEM doctoral programs; 27 out of the 97 have earned their Ph.D.s and 54 are progressing well towards earning their doctorate. JSU's two-pronged approach of rigorous research training and compassionate and committed mentoring will enable their BD program to continue to prepare and increase the quality and quantity of students historically underrepresented in STEM entering the Ph.D. pathway.</AbstractNarration>
