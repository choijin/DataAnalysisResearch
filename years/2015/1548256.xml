<AbstractNarration>Through the unique global partnership that is the Antarctic Treaty system, the entire continent is formally designated as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science. To visit, and operate in, an environment like this comes with a responsibility to do so carefully and with as minimal an impact as possible. It is thus imperative that scientists, tour operators, contractors and managers operating in Antarctica convene regularly to assess the state of the environment and delineate requirements for the future that will maintain the pristine nature of the continent. A region of Antarctica that is particularly vulnerable to human impact is the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV). This area is the largest ice-free expanse on the continent (ice free area = 4,500 km2) and encompasses a total area of 22,700 km2. The landscape is a mosaic of glaciers, mountain ranges, permanently ice covered lakes, ephemeral streams and novel soil ecosystems. The global uniqueness of this environment has led to increased levels of scientific research and tourism over the past decade. Given the increase in human presence, it is important to assess routinely the impact of these activities for both ethical and scientific reasons. It has been 17 years since environmental stewardship of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) has been formally addressed. During these 17 years, research activities in the valleys have increased exponentially and major research campaigns have been established in the Taylor, Wright, Miers, Garwood, Beacon and Victoria Valleys. This 17-year period has seen the implementation of a Dry Valleys Specially Managed Area (ASMA) and several new Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) in the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the relatively long hiatus since the last environmental assessment of the MDV, in concert with exponential increases in research activity, this award will partially fund a fourth workshop to assess the environmental integrity of the region, discuss the success of present management strategies, and develop an international plan with which to move forward. The workshop will include more than 40 scientists, contractors and environmental mangers to discuss environmental stewardship and scientific site integrity of the MDV. Workshop participants have been carefully chosen to ensure gender balance and representation from all career levels. The early career scientists will have a chance to change the way they will work in Antarctica, allowing them to conduct research in an environment that they have had a hand in shaping. Individuals from five countries will participate, providing a global balance to the workshop. A report will be produced by this workshop that will set the stage for environmental stewardship in the MDV for the next decade.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through the unique global partnership that is the Antarctic Treaty system, the entire continent is formally designated as a 'natural reserve, devoted to peace and science?.

The overarching objectives of the workshop were to: (i) outline documented and potential human impacts (including level of severity) from various research activities in the area; (ii) determine the efficacy of the present management strategies in the dry valleys and discuss potential changes with respect to environmental protection and implementation; (iii) develop recommendations for management of future research and tourist activities in the region with an emphasis on the logistical requirements needed to implement these recommendations.   Workshop participants agreed that the specific aims of this workshop could not be met explicitly without a clearer definition of the McMurdo Dry Valleys ASMA?s management activities that would cover the state of the current environment, the pressures on that state from direct human activities and from global change, and more detailed management responses to those pressures.
