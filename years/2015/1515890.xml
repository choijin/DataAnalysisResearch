<AbstractNarration>This NSF Rapid response Research (RAPID) project will support a computational approaches to understand the structure of Ebola virus proteins important in fusing to cells and causing infection.  Currently there are no effective treatment method against Ebola outbreaks. If the investigators are successful, results of this proposal would provide a target for a drug design. Once the structure of the target protein is determined, then computational drug screening approaches can be used to examine large databases of compounds that are already available, that could be used to prevent the action of the virus on infected individuals.  In this way, new inhibitors to treat the virus can be identified.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will use computational approaches to identify the conformation of the segment of the envelope glycoprotein of Ebola virus that inserts into host membrane and facilitates fusion of the viral membrane with the host membrane enabling the entry of virus into the host cell. This segment of the envelope glycoprotein forms a loop to anchor the virus to host cell membrane. This project is aimed to determine the conformation of this loop in the prehairpin intermediate state, which can be target for designing small molecule and peptide inhibitors as means of preventing the membrane fusion between the virus and the host cell.  The work should lead to new targets for drug discovery associated with the treatment and/or prevention of Ebola infection.</AbstractNarration>
