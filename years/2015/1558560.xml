<AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ralph Bunche Summer Institute is designed to expand opportunities for students-of-color by preparing black, Latino, and American Indian undergraduates to enroll in doctoral programs and become political science college and university professors and/or researchers in the field and related fields. The RBSI immerses undergraduates in the summer of their junior year in a five-week intensive program that includes graduate level course work, and the design, analysis, writing, and presentation of original research papers.  The program simulates the graduate school experience and focuses on scientific analysis by introducing the students to research methods and statistics, and the research enterprise that is the lifeline of professional political scientists. Results show that the RBSI is succeeding in increasing the numbers of students-of-color in political science graduate programs, and the numbers of blacks and Latinos with doctorates in political science, as well as several cognate social science fields.  The majority of these individuals are now faculty at universities across the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ralph Bunche Summer Institute is designed to expand opportunities for students-of-color by preparing black, Latino, and American Indian undergraduates to enroll in doctoral programs and become political science college and university professors and/or researchers in the field and related fields.

Those students whose empirical papers are judged to be of high quality are invited to present their papers in a poster session at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals are to provide an intensive environment that mirrors the  political science graduate school experience to: 1) introduce 15  high-achieving underrepresented students to the possibiities of  political science and cognent social science disciplines are a  profession; 2) to introduce these students to the research enterprise of  political science by having them produce an empirical research paper;  3) take two graduate level courses as part of the program with the  credits being transferred back to their undergraduate institution; 4)  introduce them to scholars in the discipline working on aspects of race  and politics and other subfields of the discipline.  Of the 15 students in the 2016  class, seven are currently in Ph.D. programs in political science and  two completed master's programs.  Of the 14 students in the 2017 class,  seven are currently in Ph.D. programs in political science, and one is  in a master's program.  Of the 15 students in the 2018 class, eight are  in Ph.D. programs in political science, and two are in master's  programs.  Of the three classes together, 22 of the 44 are in Ph.D.  programs and five are either in or completed master's programs.  Fifty percent of the class now in Ph.D. programs in political science is an achievement of the major goal of the program.
