<AbstractNarration>Despite centuries of scanning the skies, it is only now that humans are able to begin to really search for and identify many of the most distant objects in our own Solar System, those that orbit well beyond Neptune.  These objects are becoming accessible through ongoing surveys using telescopes on the Earth that scan large parts of the sky repeatedly.  These surveys allow detection of very faint objects, as well as their motion and any changes in brightness.  The objects are important to understand because they are the remnants of the early Solar System and can help us understand how our Solar System formed and evolved into what we see today.  This project will capitalize on an ongoing survey in the southern hemisphere by developing new data processing tools to carry out an extensive search for transient and slow-moving objects in the survey images in order to characterize the most distant visible members of the Solar System.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal team will augment their successful outreach program to Philadelphia-area middle school teachers and community-based organizations through their partnership with the Franklin Institute to produce presentations and middle-school curricular materials on the outer solar system. A key component of the program will be a contest to suggest names for minor planets that are discovered in the data used in this project. The PIs will also mentor two graduate students and undergraduate students working in a large international team of astronomers and particle physicists from a myriad of cultural backgrounds through participation in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative proposal that seeks to expand the use of data being obtained as a part of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Cerro-Tololo 4m telescope.  In particular, they will extend the standard DES data processing in order to carry out an extensive search for transient and slow-moving objects in the DES images in order to characterize the most distant visible members of the Solar System, which orbit well beyond Neptune and are relics of major disturbances to the nascent Solar System.  This will enable them to increase by a factor of ~10 the number of known Inner Oort Cloud bodies and other minor planets with perihelia beyond about 50 AU, which have dynamical and physical states that are largely unperturbed by interactions with the (known) planets over the age of the Solar System.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In collaborative research with colleagues at the University of Michigan, coI's Bernstein and Sako, and PhD student Pedro Bernardinelli, searched 60,000 images of the sky taken over the first 4 years of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to find members of our solar system orbiting beyond Neptune.  These "trans-Neptunian objects" (TNOs) are remnants from the formation of the solar system and their orbits, colors, sizes, and structure hold clues about major events such as rearrangements of the giant planets, possible close approaches by passing stars, or even as-yet-undetected giant planets lurking in distant orbits.  Techniques to search such large surveys for TNOs were developed, and 316 objects were detected (most of them previously unknown), including the 2nd-most distant known member of the solar system.  The attached figure shows where these TNOs were found, clearly showing that TNOs are concentrated around the same ecliptic plane in which the major planets orbit.  This catalog - and a successor catalog that will be produced from the entire six years of DES data - will be used by these investigators and others to test models of the current state and evolution of the TNOs.  The investigators also developed new techniques for higher-precision measurements of the sky positions of TNOs and stars, which will enable more accurate measurements of orbits of TNOs around the Sun and of stars around the Milky Way for DES and for future surveys.  Twelve different undergraduates from the University of Pennsylvania participated in research related to this project, as well as graduate student Bernardinelli.  Those who have already graduated are now engaged either in PhD studies or in data-intensive employment, using skills developed in their TNO research.  The investigators have engaged the public in numerous talks to community and student groups around Philadelphia.       Last Modified: 11/11/2019       Submitted by: Gary M Bernstein]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
