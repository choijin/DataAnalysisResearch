<AbstractNarration>This project will provide support for students attending US universities to attend and present at the IEEE Conference on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN) in Stockholm, Sweden from September 29 - October 2, 2015.  IEEE DySPAN is the premier conference to discuss, publish and present recent advancements regarding technical and policy challenges in the spectrum domain. Conference participation is a crucial part of training students to be researchers but the cost can be prohibitive for many students.  Given the scarcity of spectrum and importance to the US economy, it is essential to develop this pool of researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to 16 students from US universities will have the opportunity to attend and present their work in this international forum through travel grants. Students from underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged to apply for the grants.  Attending students will get feedback on their own research, learn about the state of the art and interact with a variety of senior researchers and peers.</AbstractNarration>
