<AbstractNarration>Why are some school districts able to sustain school desegregation while others are not? Although social scientists have been active in studying the effects of school racial composition on student achievement, relatively neglected is the inclusion of variation among districts in the social factors that lead to school district segregation itself. Using five case studies and public opinion polls, the research team will study the relationship between citizen characteristics and their attitudes and values supporting (or failing to support) school desegregation. This study increases the value of five strategically chosen case studies including those of Wake County, NC (Raleigh); Davidson County, TN (Nashville); Jefferson County, KY (Louisville); Charlotte-Mecklenburg, NC and Rock Hill, SC by fielding an opinion poll in each location, where the polls contain mostly common questions across sites. These polls will reveal similarities and differences in adult attitudes that track to differences in how long these districts have sustained desegregated schools. Study findings have implications for other school districts beyond the five studied here in terms of formulating policy that will better support socioeconomic mixing of students, which enhances diversity by promoting educational attainment and upward mobility in society, especially for at-risk students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some school districts sustain desegregation over many years while others do not.  Existing research is largely based on case studies.  Case studies have limited external validity and are often heterogeneous in approach because researchers frame questions and invoke theory differently. The data obtained from in-depth interviews, participant observation, and document analyses are rarely triangulated with data from theoretically-driven surveys of the school district's adult population. These attitudes and values play an important part in explaining districts' current school assignment policies and inform future policies as well. This study addresses gaps in existing social science literature on desegregation by using a common theoretical perspective and fielding a largely common questionnaire via Interactive Voice Response, supplemented by cell phone samples, across five school districts. The research will produce poll data on a minimum of 5000 adult respondents. Analysis will (1) embed each poll within the existing qualitative data on each case; and (2) use the poll data to analyze both commonalities and differences in values and attitudes across sites.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of our project was to study adult attitudes towards school desegregation and resegregation in five southern locales: Wake County (Raleigh), NC&#894; Charlotte, NC&#894; Rock Hill, SC: Louisville, KY, and Nashville, TN. Ours is an interdisciplinary project based in sociology and political science, and it builds upon our prior research in three of the locations, Raleigh, Charlotte and Rock Hill, as well as upon case studies by others for both Nashville and Louisville.  A key objective of the project was to attempt to replicate findings from Parcel and Taylor's 2015 book, The End of Consensus: Diversity, Neighborhoods, and the Politics of Public School Assignments, both over time for Raleigh, NC and for the four other southern school districts.   We have found that the same attitudes that captured key sentiments regarding school assignment policies in Raleigh in 2011, the time of original data production, replicate for Raleigh in 2015, the time of the follow-up, and also replicate in each of the four additional southern locales.  Specifically, these sentiments are captured along five dimensions:  attitudes towards neighborhood schools; attitudes toward diverse schools; worries that student reassignments hamper child learning and child friendships; concerns with the challenge of managing these reassignments for parents; and concerns with uncertainty regarding the process involved in having children reassigned.  These findings make cross-time and cross-site comparisons possible.  We also found that predictors of these sentiments are very similar both across time in Raleigh and across the five sites in 2015.  We did find more change in the prediction of neighborhood school support between 2011 and 2015 in Raleigh, and across the five sites, compared to predictors of other attitudes.  These findings suggest that support for neighborhood schools may be more volatile than other dimensions we studied.  Taken together, however, these findings suggest that the original findings from one locale substantially replicate both temporally and cross-sectionally.    We have also studied attitudes towards magnet and charter schools because these forms of schooling are of growing importance in many communities and their presence has been linked to school re-segregation.  We have found that support for magnet schools is widespread across race, sex, social class and political groupings, but that support for charter schools is more likely among Republicans and those who favor conservative ideologies.  Parents of school-aged children and other adults hold similar attitudes towards charters and magnets.  Respondents who have heightened concerns about the challenges of public school reassignments, the dangers to children from being reassigned to different schools, and the uncertainty that such reassignments entail are more likely to favor both magnet and charter schools&mdash;educational venues where families are not going to be involuntarily reassigned.   Those who see public schools as beneficial to all community children are likely to favor magnets.           Last Modified: 09/27/2019       Submitted by: William R Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
