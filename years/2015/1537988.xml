<AbstractNarration>Resonant micro- and nano-electromechanical systems provide unique opportunities in application spaces ranging from chemical sensing to signal processing due to their superior sensitivity and selectivity metrics in relation to more conventional systems. Unfortunately, despite three decades of research efforts, these devices still suffer from significant limitations on throughput, or on the amount of information they can sense/process. One attractive solution to this constraint is to design large arrays of small-scale, coupled resonators, and subsequently exploit the inherently complex behavior that can arise within such systems. However, this technical solution presents difficulties in terms of both analysis and predictive design, especially with an increasing number of individual resonators. Classical engineering approaches tend to break down when applied to many-degree-of-freedom systems, particularly in the presence of noise and device-to-device variations. This project will provide a new framework for understanding various collective and emergent behaviors exhibited by these resonant micro/nano systems, which could lead to new functionalities that inspire the development of new sensors, such as artificial "noses" (multi-analyte chemical sensors), filters, mechanically operating signal processing units as well as artificial memory devices based on mechanical operation. The project leverages modeling, analysis, and predictive design within a framework that will be validated through microscale experimentation. In addition, the project will integrate its research into the core undergraduate curriculum, using engineering applications to motivate beginning students, with a goal of increasing retention in engineering programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of a new modeling, analysis, and design framework for coupled, resonant micro/nanosystems will enable efficient analysis strategies capable of characterizing the linear and nonlinear dynamics of large, coupled micro/nanoresonator arrays (comprising of hundreds, thousands, and millions of constituent resonators) operating in the presence of noise, parametric uncertainty, and accompanying electronics. The research team will validate these analytical techniques through targeted microscale experimentation with locally- (mechanically) and globally- (electromagnetically) coupled arrays and determine the influence of unintentional parameter variations, noise, and the random failure of constituent elements on observed dynamics. The analysis will be based on integro-differential models for the many-degree-of-freedom systems that will allow for arbitrarily large numbers of constitutive resonators, together with accompanying perturbative analysis methods, leading to a predictive description of the coupled, global dynamics. The award will also support the development of new topical modules emphasizing the relationship between foundational mathematical topics and engineering analysis and design, as well as the deployment of these within the core mathematics curriculum at The University of Akron, which is guided by the desire to enhance retention and matriculation rates within engineering programs. Finally, new course materials and streaming video lectures associated with coupled micro/nanoresonator arrays will be developed and distributed (via open access channels).  These materials will explore the systems' use in practical application.</AbstractNarration>
