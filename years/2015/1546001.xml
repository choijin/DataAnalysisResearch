<AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awareness of ethical issues in experimental political science is growing. This workshop brings together political science scholars and research integrity scholars to address critical needs in the ethical design, review, and implementation of experimental research. Unlike past discussions within political science, this workshop includes both political scientists engaged in experimental research and experts in the ethics of human-subjects research to develop best practice recommendations that will protect human subjects, researchers, the field of political science, institutions of higher learning, and the public's investment in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awareness of ethical issues in experimental political science is growing. This workshop brings together political science scholars and research integrity scholars to address critical needs in the ethical design, review, and implementation of experimental research. Unlike past discussions within political science, this workshop includes both political scientists engaged in experimental research and experts in the ethics of human-subjects research. Invited speakers and discussants will address in both panel and round table form the following issue areas: (1) special issues in consent and deceptive research; (2) managing incidental findings and collateral and community harms; (3) working with community and industry partners to conduct responsible research; (4) enhancing community capacity for review and consent in internationally sponsored research; (5) identifying descriptive and normative baselines when assessing risk, harm, and exploitation; (6) quantifying psychological harms; and (7) special concerns when using pre-existing data sets.</AbstractNarration>
