<AbstractNarration>Infectious diseases place an enormous toll on public health, societies, and economies across the world.   Effective control of an infectious disease is made challenging by complex disease dynamics, limited resources, and the need to continually adapt interventions to the evolving status of an epidemic.  Driven by widespread recognition of the potential of big data, recent technological advances have made it possible to collect, curate, and access heterogeneous data on the evolution of an infectious disease in real-time.  In light of recent and anticipated advances in big data, this project envisions that future management of infectious diseases will rely on knowledge-transfer systems that map real-time, heterogeneous data streams to recommendations for policy-makers managing an infectious disease.  These recommendations might identify subgroups in the population that should be given highest priority for interventions or other resource allocations.  However, science is years away from creating such a system as its implementation will require significant innovations in disease modeling, data-driven decision making, computing, and optimization. This award supports initiation of a collaborative research project that takes critical first steps toward these innovations by creating a blueprint for using big data and precision medicine to inform management of an infectious disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will develop a novel class of dynamical systems models that identifies subgroups in the population with homogeneous disease dynamics.  Parameters indexing these models are estimated using maximum likelihood; then, by computing draws from the sampling distribution of these parameters, we apply Thompson sampling and model-based policy-search algorithms from precision medicine to identify optimal resource allocations to manage the spread of an epidemic.  The proposed research bridges dynamical systems models with subgroup identification and data-driven resource allocation.  This will create new knowledge and new lines of research in applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science.  This award is supported by the National Institutes of Health Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative in partnership with the National Science Foundation Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The purpose of this QuBBD pilot grant was to explore the application of  precision medicine methodologies to the domain of public health.  During  the one year project period we: (R1) developed new methodologies for  managing the spread of an infectious disease in a large population  including a framework for combining differential equation based disease  models with estimating equations for an optimal treatment rule; (R2)  created new infectious disease models that can be used to inform  data-driven treatment allocation; (R3) identified new public health  domains where data-driven decision has the potential to make a large and  immediate positive impact.  Below we discuss (R1)-(R3) and their  respective contributions to science.  (R1) New precision medicine methodologies for improving public health.   Our vision for this project was to improve public health by delivering  treatment if, when, and to whom it is most needed.  While precision  medicine seeks to use individual patient characteristics to inform  treatment choice, direct application of precision medicine to public  health is complicated as: (i) limited resources impose constraints on  the set of possible treatment allocations; (ii) spillover effects induce  dependence that prevents application of standard methods for precision  medicine which are designed for independent replications; (iii) the  aforementioned dependence makes the number of treatment allocations  scale exponentially in population size which may number in the hundreds  of thousands; and (iv) communication of optimal treatment sequences to  policy-makers requires interactive visualizations of  potentially high-dimensional data.  During this project period we have developed  methodologies that take important first steps toward addressing these  challenges.  We developed an estimator of an optimal treatment  allocation strategy that combines difference-equation based disease  dynamics with a variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search.  Unlike traditional  Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms, our method builds a tree in which  the splits are allocation rules within a pre-specified class.  This form  of the algorithm is extremely computationally efficient and we were able  to scale it to populations with a one million individuals.  We also developed a variant of Q-learning that shrinks the  fitted Q-function toward the optimal Q-function under a postulated  equation-based disease dynamics model; thus, the  model-free Q-learning estimator is shrunk toward the equation-based solution.   (R2) New disease models to inform adaptive treatment allocation.   Effective data-driven treatment allocation in a public health context  requires the integration of efficient statistical techniques with  existing domain knowledge and theories.  Our methodological developments  sought to augment semi-parametric estimators of an optimal treatment  allocation strategy with theory-based equation-based disease models.  To  this end, we developed new models for the spread of Cholera and  influenza; we also obtained funding to build a model for  the spread of Malaria.  We have also started new  collaborations, based on this work, to model the spread of HIV on networks among men who have sex with men.   (R3) New public health domains for application of precision health methodologies.   As this was an exploratory grant, one of our objectives was to identify  new domains of application.  We have identified, and are now actively  conducting research in, three new application areas: (i) adaptive  control of pest species; (ii)  modeling the flow of assets in illegal trafficking networks to inform  countermeasures; and (iii) optimal dissemination of  public health messaging over social networks, e.g., encouraging cancer  screenings in at-risk populations, spreading  public awareness of available community mental health services, and  to using social media to gauge and influence public sentiment toward stigmatized groups.
