<AbstractNarration>Over 99% of the visible matter in the Universe is a plasma, that is a dilute gas of ions, electrons, and neutral particles. Despite their ubiquity, many fundamental and important physical processes which control the dynamics of plasmas remain poorly understood. In turn, this limits our ability to intepret diverse phenomena in space such as accretion onto black holes at the centers of galaxies or the interaction of the solar wind with the upper layers of the Earth?s atmosphere, and it also impacts our ability to engineer and operate experiments on Earth such as magnetically confined fusion devices. The Max-Panck/Princeton Center for Plasma Physics (MPPC) was established as a joint venture of the Max Planck Society (MPS) in Germany and Princeton University in order to forge new collaborations between Universities, the national plasma labs, and international partners in order to tackle some of the most pressing problems in plasma dynamics. The center fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between the plasma and astrophysics communities, as well as international collaboration between these communities in the US, Germany, and elsewhere. It serves to train the next generation of plasma scientists in experimental science, computation, and theory, and its international scope provides unique training for early career scientists, particularly valuable as plasma and fusion science become increasingly international. Finally, the center provides opportunities for the public, as well as students and teachers at public schools, local, and regional institutions to engage in scientific inquiry in ways that enhance their understanding of science concepts and scientific ways of thinking through a well established outreach program at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MPPC focuses its effort studying four key topics: magnetic reconnection, acceleration and propagation of non-thermal particles, the properties of plasma turbulence, and magnetohydrodynamic processes in astrophysical plasmas such as the magneto-rotational instability. Uniquely, it leverages international expertise and resources such as experimental facilities and computational methods to lead new studies in theoretical, experimental, and computational plasma physics. The US program concentrates strongly on postdoctoral researchers, who work with senior researchers supported by existing funds. While the postdoc program is the engine that drives research in the center, there are a number of ways in which each participating organization has fused together as a center, for example (1) joint mentoring of postdocs, (2) exchange visits of senior members, (3) joint experiments, (4) joint code development and validation, (5) fostering collaborations across the entire US and German plasma and astrophysics communities, and (6) annual meetings of the center as a whole, and more frequent topical workshops for the community. For example, the MPPC will host a summer school in computational plasma physics at Princeton University within the current period of funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by NSF's Divisions of Physics and Astronomy (Mathematical &amp; Physicsal Sciences Directorate), and the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Max-Panck / Princeton Center for Plasma Physics (MPPC) was established in March 2012 as a joint venture of the Max Planck  Society (MPS) in Germany and Princeton University (PU) with the  goal of promoting closer collaborations between laboratory plasma physics (including fusion science) and space and astrophysics.  For the past six years, support for Center activities in the US has been provided by the DOE, NASA, the NSF and PU. This Outcomes Report summarizes the activities at the MPPC funded by the NSF over the last threee years.  Close to one hundred senior scientists, junior researchers and postdocs, and both graduate and undergraduate students are involved in dozens of research projects spanning the four main research focus areas of the MPPC: (1) plasma turbulence, (2) magnetic reconnection, (3) energetic particles, and (4) astrophysical plasma dynamics, including generation of magnetic field via dynamos.  Over the past three years, research across all five institutions resulted in hundreds of published papers.  One of the research highlights of the MPPC resulting from this funding include a much better understanding of how magnetic fields in the Universe are generated through the dynamo process, as a result of combined theoretical, computational, and experimental  studies at Princeton University and PPPL.  The ability to combine such diverse approaches to solving fundamental problems is one of the unique aspects of the Center.  The activities of the MPPC extend far beyond the partner institutions.   New collaborations with scientists from around the world have been started, catalyzed in part by a series of annual workshops and summer schools that attract 60-80 participants,  roughly 1/3 of whom are from outside the MPPC.  A major summer school in computational plasma astrophysics was held at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 2016 and was supported in part by this funding.  It attracted over 100 students and junior scientists from around the world.  The center has served to train the next generation of plasma physicists in computation, and theory, and experiment and its international scope has provided unique training for graduate students and postdocs. Results produced by the research supported by this funding was disseminated to the wider public via a number of avenues.  For example, in partnership with PPPL and Princeton University the MPPC vigorously engaged women and under-represented minorities in plasma and astrophysics through the Young Women's Conferences (an annual event which facilitates exposure to career scientists for approximately 250 young women in grades 7 through 10), and the PSURE program (a summer undergraduate research program at Princeton aimed at underrepresented minorities).
