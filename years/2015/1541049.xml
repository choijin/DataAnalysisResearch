<AbstractNarration>EarthCube is supporting the creation of interoperable tools and services for Earth science research, but no environment currently exists for integration and testing of these components.  The EarthCube Integration and Test Environment (ECITE), an outgrowth of activities of the EarthCube Testbed Working Group. The ECITE approach focuses on integrating existing effective technologies and resources as well as capabilities being built by the EarthCube community to provide a federated and interoperable test environment. ECITE?s nationwide cyberinfrastructure for the geosciences will also advance the understanding of regional cyberinfrastructure and collaborative geosciences across geographic locations and disciplines by contributing relevant scheduling tools and a working integration and testing environment. A hallmark of the ECITE effort will be engagement of scientists and technologists from multiple disciplines and geographic regions across the geosciences community to develop requirements, prototype, design, build, and test an integration test-bed that will support cross-disciplinary research.  The multi-disciplinary ECITE team is led by Sara Graves of the University of Huntsville in Alabama (UAH) and includes participants from all areas of the United States. ECITE activities will enable EarthCube to further support other members and contribute leadership to the broader scientific community. The ECITE federated Integration and Test (I&amp;T) environment has the potential to scale and extend to an NSF wide integration and test capability that can serve as a model and example for other agencies. The proposed ECITE functionality is vital to ensure that the broader goals of the EarthCube are achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ECITE team will actively engage EarthCube and the wider geosciences community in definition of requirements, design, and testing of the system. ECITE will consist of a seamless federated system of scalable and location independent distributed computational resources (nodes) across the US.  The hybrid federated system will provide a robust set of distributed resources to include both public and private cloud capabilities.  The nodes will provide compute and storage resources requiring minimal system administration.ECITE is an important step in ensuring that EarthCube components will be able to work together to provide a successful framework that can continue to evolve to meet the needs of the geosciences community.  This research addresses timely issues of integration, test and evaluation methodologies and best practices with a strong interoperability theme to advance disciplinary research through the integration of diverse and heterogeneous data, algorithms, systems and sciences. The results and findings will provide guidance for EarthCube evolution and future integration efforts. The ECITE team aims to make the Integration and Test (I&amp;T) environment easy to use and readily available to the EarthCube community. Access to the resulting platform will enable and encourage the EarthCube community to develop prototypes, try out new technologies, and to share ideas, concepts and experiments</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goals of the EarthCube project are to achieve a better understanding of our planet and the processes that shape it, the climate, etc.  Such understanding is of a critical importance when dealing with the impacts of the global climate change.  To that effect, EarthCube uses the power of modern computing technology and Big Data.  As a part of the overall effort, the EarthCube Integration and Test Environment (ECITE) project prototyped, designed, developed and deployed a robust, sustainable environment for integration and testing of EarthCube products.  ECITE is a cross-discipline project that will help impact science and technology needs by defining and exercising use cases that target EarthCube technologies to address stated science problems.   This project benefits all disciplines of the EarthCube community. It meets the need of EarthCube to support integration and interoperability of EarthCube contributors from all disciplines. It will also support usability and applicability and foster stronger collaboration and engagement of the community.  To this effect, ECITE explored and leveraged a variety of tools and technologies, including cloud computing, to create a science-driven EarthCube Workbench.  This was done in a close collaboration with other EarthCube stakeholders, in order to respond optimally to their needs and requirements.  The progress on the project was presented at the EarthCube team meetings, a variety of professional conferences, and in technical publication.  The feedback from the potential user community was used to refine the design and its implementation.  The ECITE was prototyped through a number of use case scenarios and examples, and validated by integrating other EarthCube components, as well as computational and storage resources across federated hybrid systems.  The ECITE hybrid cloud computing environment was utilized for deployment and testing of technologies from several EarthCube-funded projects.   The Open Science Framework (osf.io) was adopted for use as the EarthCube Technology Assessment Framework.         As a contribution to the development of human resources, two graduate students received their MA degrees, and two other students received their PhD degrees through their thesis work on this project.  They have embarked on to successful professional careers since.  We believe that ECITE will continue to evolve, and to facilitate and enable research by many groups is the Earth Science community.
