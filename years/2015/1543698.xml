<AbstractNarration>In July 2011, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) issued an influential report on sustaining environmental capital (PCAST 2011) recommending a series of actions, including the development of an Ecoinformatics-based Open Resources and Machine Accessibility (EcoINFORMA) initiative. The Federal response has been to design and implement the first phase of a major effort to mobilize and integrate Federal data (see: ecosystems.data.gov). Currently released products include a universal geospatial viewer and an integrated metadata resource, as well as three thematic hubs. These are Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (bison.usgs.ornl.gov) for biodiversity, EnviroAtlas (enviroatlas.epa.gov) for ecosystem services, and the Multi-resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (www.mrlc.gov) for landcover dynamics. In their report, the PCAST stated: "EcoINFORMA should interact with international biodiversity and ecosystem information systems in the development of globally accepted biodiversity and ecosystem information standards, and should seek out and encourage partnerships with the private and academic sectors to develop innovative tools for data integration, analysis, visualization, and decision-making." Recent mobilization of very large data sets in the Federal system as a part of EcoINFORMA has produced unprecedented opportunities for academic and commercial innovation, and the time is ripe for members of the Federal, academic, and commercial sectors to come together and examine the possibilities.  A workshop and follow-up activities to bring together Federal environmental data providers and consumers with non-Federal environmental data providers and consumers to foster synergistic projects aimed at sustaining the country?s environmental capital and advancing science as a whole will take place in Washington, DC, in September 2015.  The team will convene a broad representation of federal and nonfederal members of the biodiversity informatics and ecoinformatics communities, including academics and NGOs from a diverse group of organizations. The workshop will lead to much broader understanding and utilization of the existing EcoInforma hubs, as well as important feedback to the curators of those hubs about user community needs and interests.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From December 2-4, 2015, NatureServe and the United States Geological Survey organized and hosted a biodiversity and ecological informatics workshop at the Department of the Interior in Washington, DC.  The workshop objective was to identify user-driven future directions and areas of collaboration in advanced applications of environmental data applied to forecasting and decision-making for the sustainability of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

The workshop was structured to encourage interactivity. Typically 80-90% of attendees provided direct feedback using clicker devices for specific questions related to biodiversity and ecological data uses and needs, and ten breakout session leaders shared the highlights of their group discussions during the final workshop plenary sessions. Participants were encouraged to use the Twitter hashtag #ShareUrData.  Over lunch on day two there were 20 simultaneous presentations of tools and apps during a special Tools Caf&eacute; session.  The 10 participant-defined breakout session themes were:  Dynamic biogeographic map of the nation Inventory and Monitoring Climate change Pollinators Citizen Science Invasive Species Drivers of Agricultural change  Ecological Indicators Ecosystem Services Hydrology and watersheds   Numerous common themes that emerged from the workshop include:   The vital importance of completing foundational environmental datasets that are nationally consistent and are essential to multiple sectors, such as the SSURGO high resolution soils data, a minimum 5-meter resolution digital elevation model, national hydrographic data, high resolution land cover data, time series high resolution spatial climate data from historical to future time steps, and a national wetland inventory.      While improved nationally consistent environmental datasets integrated with targeted observations will dramatically advance forecasting capacity and support early warning systems (ie, drought, forest disease), multi-agency coordination should focus on decision support tools that convey what appropriate actions and responses should be to adapt to and mitigate potential negative consequences.      The value of digitized historical data is greater than ever before. Modern computational techniques and the ever-increasing flow of environmental data from both ground and remote observations can support improved understanding of environmental change. Success of understanding patterns of change for decision making requires establishing baselines from which change can be measured. Digitizing and providing access to the vast stores of under-utilized historical data that can be leveraged for this purpose is of national importance.       Recognition of the multifaceted potential of citizen science to engaging the public in resource stewardship, to create the next generation of STEM and environmental leaders, and to have sufficient eyes and boots on the ground to monitor environmental trends, including early detection of alien invasive species, phenological shifts, shifting distribution and abundance of indicator species, and species inventories. The federal government has an essential role in creating the infrastructure for dramatically improved mobilization of citizen science data, such as fostering the creation of data standards, nationally consistent framework datasets, vertical integration of observation data, visualization and dissemination of aggregated datasets, and calculation and communication of derived trends.       Current and near future trends in the availability of remotely sensed data (rapid expansion of satellite fleets, drones) is revolutionizing access to near real-time ecological data.  Targeted integration with ground based observations and instrumentation has an extremely valuable role in validating remotely sensed data, filling data gaps, improving data quality, and fully realizing the potential of the near real time monitoring of environmental indicator trends.      Integrated management at the landscape scale is required even as specific actions on the ground are largely local in nature.  While numerous success stories were highlighted, almost every breakout group pointed out the still-too-fragmented nature of the current data landscape.        Management and delivery of the necessary data, tools and analyses to sustain our nation?s environmental capital must be a collaborative effort between Federal, state and local governments, academia, non-profits, and the commercial sector, even while the responsibilities of each sector are different.   Participants reported numerous new collaborations and de-duplication of effort as a result of the workshop. At least five papers are in preparation as a result of the workshop (a formal peer-reviewed workshop report, a paper on the importance of national species distribution modelling, and several papers from the winning student projects).
