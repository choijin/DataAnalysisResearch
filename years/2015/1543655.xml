<AbstractNarration>Agencies like the National Science Foundation have made significant investments in the national computational infrastructure by creating campus and national computation centers throughout the United States.  The financial investments are not limited to computer hardware and extend to investments in networks, software, and support personnel to assist campus-level researchers to effectively use these resources to answer challenging scientific questions.  &lt;br/&gt;A diverse set of organizations has emerged to support access to the national computational infrastructure.  Many of the organizations specialize whereas others provide a range of services. Some of these organizations are self-sustaining while others rely on continued agency support.  Organizations that provide similar services are likely to communicate with one another more regularly.&lt;br/&gt;The Improving Access Workshop, supported by this award, will bring together for the first time representatives from campus, state, regional, and other organizations with a vested interest in furthering access to and supporting computational resources by campus researchers.  Participants will develop a set of recommendations to assist the community to expand researcher engagement to under-represented communities, to engage in timely and relevant education and outreach efforts to computational researchers over the long term, to coordinate efforts across the diverse set of organizations described above, and to leverage resources across campus, state, and regional boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to develop a coherent set of recommendations to the National Science Foundation and to the community, at large, which provide answers to a set of strategic questions. A Conference Organizing Committee composed of experts in campus, regional, and national infrastructure has been formed. To accelerate the process of developing a useful set of recommendations, white papers will be solicited in advance of the conference that are relevant to the strategic questions.  Based on a review of papers submitted, invitations to participate in the conference will be extended to up to 60 organizations. The one and a half day conference will be held in Kansas City, MO, and facilitated by members of the organizing committee. A final report will be issued in late 2015. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed meeting promises to coordinate efforts that lead to significant improvements in meeting the needs of academic researchers.  The meeting will bring the needs of the computational research community to the forefront of organizations that are uniquely positioned to assist in meeting those needs. In situations where a small or medium-sized campus does not have the resources to assist a small number of researchers with advanced computational needs, the next level up - the state or other regional organization - will be in an excellent position to reach out to those researchers. In the long-term, the output from this conference promises to re-focus the efforts of regional organizations and align them with the capacities of the national infrastructure and the needs of campus researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Role of Regional Organizations in Improving Access to the National Computational Infrastructure conference was held in Kansas City, Missouri, on October 22 and 23, 2015.

The expressed conference goal was to develop a set of recommendations to the National Science Foundation and to the vested community, at large, to assist regional organizations to leverage their work for the benefit of the research community. The implicit goal was to understand what actions, if any, are needed to achieve a radical shift across a diverse set of organizations that will result in improved coordination of, access to and utilization of the national computational infrastructure.  A final report was written to detail the findings and recommendations.     White Papers         We believed that soliciting white papers on the topics of interest prior to the meeting would prime the community to think about the project goals in advance of the meeting and would help to assure adequate representation from many sectors of the cyberinfrastructure community.      Papers were submitted from universities, both small and large, scientific research collaborations, regional organizations, both state and multi-state, and national organizations. In all, 36 white papers were received representing at least 98 authors and 80 organizations.   In many cases an author represented more than one organization.

Conference   White paper authors or their representatives were invited to a conference in Kansas City on October 22 and 23, 2015.  The overall format for the conference was (1) an introduction, (2) panel presentations, (3) working session discussion groups, (4) end of day and end of conference wrap-ups.

Final Report      Contributions to the discussion by white paper authors and conference attendees were grouped into key thematic areas and presented. Two sets of recommendations were made, core recommendations and recommendations for actions within specific communities.   Core recommendations are a set of recommendations that cut across communities, agencies and projects and are consistent with a vision to effect cultural change and make computational and data resources pervasive, connected, shared, distributed and dynamic.   Community recommendations are directed towards specific slices of the research and education community, including funding agencies. These recommendations include 1) the adoption of specific practices among existing and emerging communities of expertise that will result in improved coordination, cross- communication and expanded use of all available resources and 2) the identification of priorities for funding agencies that are likely to influence future dynamics for cyberinfrastructure uptake.   The final report is available for download at   https://drive.google.com/a/greatplains.net/file/d/0B9RBtxud9RbBSEVnc3dxdlpvZXc/view     Conclusions     There are many cyberinfrastructure based and related organizations from campus to national that enable the use of advanced cyberinfrastructure in research. Now is an excellent time to harness their collective energies and focus them on moving computational and data-intensive science in the United States from an early Internet level to a more ubiquitous level.   By carefully considering and choosing to implement the recommendations from the report, it may be possible to accomplish broad scale change across the cyberinfrastructure landscape in support of future computational and data- intensive science in the United States and beyond.   A draft of the Final Report is being prepared for publication.           Last Modified: 08/03/2016       Submitted by: Gregory E Monaco]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
