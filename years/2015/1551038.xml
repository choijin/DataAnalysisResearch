<AbstractNarration>Studies of teaching and learning of mathematics and science at the undergraduate level have been rapidly increasing over the past several decades. Much of this work is being conducted by faculty members within departments of physics, biology, chemistry and mathematics, and is the basis for funded research proposals and peer-reviewed publications. This research can be particularly impactful when researchers across these mathematics and sciences disciplines collaborate. However, partnerships between education researchers from different science and mathematics disciplines have only recently emerged. This Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE:EHR) project will organize, implement, and assess the success of the Transforming Research in Undergraduate STEM Education (TRUSE) Conference for bringing together discipline-based education researchers (DBERs) to share knowledge and build collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through presentations from outstanding plenary speakers and contributed posters, as well as working group sessions, the TRUSE conference will provide a venue for researchers to gain exposure to new ways of investigating teaching and learning that would not be readily available to them within a conference that is specific to only one discipline. In addition to bringing DBERs together to share theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and findings, the TRUSE conference will create collaborative research programs and build capacity for such integrative work by involving a significant number of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in mathematics and science education. This project will fund conference travel for speakers and organizers, as well as some graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and will include a competition for mini-grant funding to seed a new, cross-disciplinary research project developed by conference participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2017 Transforming Research in Undergraduate STEM Education (TRUSE) conference brought together researchers on undergraduate teaching and learning from mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology.  The presentations and subsequent discussions allowed researchers to share perspectives from their own disciplines, highlight areas of overlap across the disciplines, develop emerging areas of inquiry that are more interdisciplinary in nature, and foster networking across the disciplines.  This allowed researchers to consider methods of strengthening the outcomes of their research and practices.  Also, the inclusion of senior level graduate students and post-doctoral researchers built capacity across fields for collaborative research.  Additionally, we solicited ideas for interdisciplinary grants and awarded three grants that would serve as seed money to start collaborations across the disciplines.     Outcomes from one interdisciplinary grant will be described to serve as an example.  Dr. Alena Moon from University of Nebraska Lincoln has expertise in chemistry and research on students? abilities to develop arguments based upon evidence (which is part of the Next Generation Science Standards science practices).  Luanna Prevost from University of South Florida has expertise in biology and the use of machine learning to assess student writing.  Their project aimed to provide students with opportunities to engage in argument from empirical evidence in chemistry and biology and to apply machine-learning techniques to automate analysis of students? arguments.  The outcomes were the development of prompts in both chemistry and biology that would allow students to construct arguments based upon evidence.  They used these prompts to collect data in large lecture courses that could be used to develop an algorithm to analyze and evaluate student argument using machine learning.  They are using this spring data set as preliminary data for a future NSF grant to be submitted in summer 2019.      Two other grants resulted in multiple interdisciplinary presentations and publications that fostered and encouraged building community across researchers in discipline based education research.      Across the life of the grant the result of holding TRUSE 2017 and supporting interdisciplinary activities through seed grants has been to drive forward the building of a discipline based education research community that includes perspectives and voices across the STEM disciplines.  There is an emerging call to hold more TRUSE conferences for the purpose of supporting and growing this community of researchers.  Given their productivity in terms of research publications and submitted grants, also in creating a space for interdisciplinary research to occur, it is clear that educational materials and teaching strategies are impacting educational practices in STEM.
