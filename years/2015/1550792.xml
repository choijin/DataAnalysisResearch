<AbstractNarration>Sustainability has become a very important topic in engineering education. According to Outcome H of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) engineers need to have "the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context."  Therefore in order for engineers to fulfill their responsibility to find sustainable solutions to worldwide challenges new graduates must have the necessary knowledge, skills, and awareness to discover viable, desirable, and feasible solutions that include sustainability concepts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are convening a "Summit on Global Sustainability in Engineering Education" to: (a) gather a select group of researchers to explore pedagogical models that incorporate sustainability awareness and principles in engineering education; (b) formulate action plans for developing and deploying said learning modules; and (c) introduce global sustainability awareness at different universities in the Americas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All participants are required to disseminate Summit and post-Summit results through conference publications.  The PIs will target dissemination through the Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Intuitions and the ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition.  In addition all materials developed based on the Summit will be posted and available online.</AbstractNarration>

At the Summit, industry representatives and academics shared their perspectives on sustainability. Furthermore, participants engaged in presentations, discussions, and activities centered around the how, what, and where of sustainability with an emphasis on the dimensions of sustainability, including geographical and cultural parameters.  The three-day event culminated in the creation of an action plan for developing a sustainability themed learning activity that promotes sustainability education in the participants? geographical domain.  The broader impacts of the Summit include the broadening of perspectives on sustainability, identification of collaborators, and networking.  Exposure to how others view sustainability and to different teaching and learning models assisted in developing the necessary awareness of faculty members that positively influenced the creation and implementation of sustainability themed learning activities as well as student learning at home institutions. Following the Summit, participants have developed courses and course modules, workshops, and outreach activities related to sustainability for students ranging from high school to graduate level. The broader impact on sustainability education is through the development and dissemination of these teaching resources, practices, and collaborations, and enhanced curricular integration.  It is expected that the impacts of the Summit will continue to be felt through the education of students and educational research activities carried out by Summit participants.
