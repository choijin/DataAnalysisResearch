<AbstractNarration>This project will support a workshop for Principal Investigators (PI's) in the Condensed Matter Physics Program within the NSF Division of Materials Research. The workshop will be held in Arlington, VA on January 26th and 27th, 2015 and will provide PI's with a venue to interact with each other and program officers and to gain valuable information on best practices for broader impacts which are an important component of the grant evaluation criteria for NSF awards.  Broader Impacts cover the societal benefits of NSF funded research and a foundation wide conference recently focused on the various activities that comprise the broader impacts of an NSF award.  These include the development of a trained STEM workforce, impact on other fields, education of students at all levels and outreach to the public.  This workshop will focus on the development of effective broader impacts for grants, best practices in these areas and methods to develop effective communication among PI's and with the general public.  This workshop will help to create a more knowledgeable, sophisticated and successful CMP community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Proposals to the National Science Foundation must demonstrate strength in two areas: intellectual merit and broader impacts. These two criteria carry equal weight in the NSF merit review process.  Most scientists can address the intellectual merit of their proposed research but many have great difficulty conveying their contributions to broader impacts even though the criteria have been in place for several years.  Broader impacts, as defined by the NSF, are the potential for a proposed study to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.  They highlight the relevance of our work to our sponsors &ndash; the general public &ndash; and can take many different forms. Broader Impacts of a proposal include:  The discovery of new knowledge development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. enhancing the full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and under-represented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). improved STEM education and educator development at any level. Innovating for the future. increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology. improved well-being of individuals in society increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others. improved national security increased economic competitiveness of the United States enhanced infrastructure for research and education.
