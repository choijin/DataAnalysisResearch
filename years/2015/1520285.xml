<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the reduction of deaths and long-term disabilities in people suffering from bleeding in the brain caused by hemorrhagic stroke or traumatic brain injury. The presence of blood outside of the brain?s vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by the device.  Currently, physicians are alerted to worsening bleeding only when a patient fails to respond appropriately to a clinical exam that consists of a series of questions and commands.  The problem this presents is that by the time the exam uncovers the additional bleeding, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred.  A large proportion of patients suffering either hemorrhagic stroke or TBI die or are left severely disabled.  Each year over 70,000 people suffer hemorrhagic stroke, with over half of them dying.  TBI is responsible for over 1 million emergency department visits, 225,000 hospital admissions and 50,000 deaths. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will reduce the time it takes to start treatment, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and result in significant savings to the health care system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will test the ability of the SENSE device to detect small amounts of blood (as little as 2 ml) in both a gelatin model that mimics the electrical properties of the human brain and in a well-established porcine intracranial hemorrhage model.  The gelatin experiments will place blood at various locations throughout the model.  The prototype device will scan both before and after blood insertion and the results will be compared to the known location and volume of blood to determine the ability of the device to accurately detect the blood.  Once confirmed in gelatin models, the device will be tested in a porcine ICH model using an institution IACUC approved protocol to ensure humane treatment of the test animals.  Under general anesthesia, a small volume of the pig?s own blood will be surgically infused into the brain.  The device will scan the pig?s brain both before and after insertion of the blood.  After the scans are complete,the animals will be euthanized.  The brain will be frozen in liquid nitrogen and sectioned.  The scan results will be compared to the sectioned brain to determine the device?s ability to accurately detect the location and volume of blood.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Impact of this technology:  A large percentage of patients who suffer a hemorrhagic stroke or a traumatic brain injury (TBI) either die or are left severely disabled. Each year over 70,000 people suffer hemorrhagic stroke, with over half of them dying. TBI is responsible for over 1 million emergency department visits, 225,000 hospital admissions and 50,000 deaths. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will reduce the time it takes to start treatment, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and result in significant savings to the health care system.     Currently, physicians are alerted to new or expanded bleeding only when a patient fails to respond appropriately to a clinical exam that consists of a series of questions and commands. The problem this presents is that by the time the exam uncovers the additional bleeding, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred.     The brain injury monitor studied in this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project can potentially save lives and reduce long-term disabilities in severely brain-injured patients. When a patientÆs brain is bleeding, the presence of the blood outside of the brainÆs vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by our device.   By periodically scanning the patientÆs brain to see if additional bleeding has occurred, the monitor we studied will decrease the time it takes to identify a bleed, allowing physicians to start treatment sooner and reduce brain damage.     Project Goals and Outcomes:  The goals of the project were to (1) determine the ideal electromagnetic parameters for the SENSE brain injury monitor and (2) verify its operation in an animal model of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).     We built two prototypes: one for laboratory based testing of a brain mimicking gel and another for testing in a pig model for ICH.     For our lab testing, we created "gel phantoms" that mimic the electromagnetic (EM) characteristics of average human brain and skull tissues.  Our lab based experimentation provided a basis for developing an antenna array designed to detect blood.  The antenna array was mounted into a headpiece and fitted around the skull phantom. We then injected blood into various locations within the brain gel and analyzed changes to radio signals transmitted between the antennas. We used the data collected in these experiments to enhance our algorithm for locating bleeds in the brain.     Using the results of the brain gel experiments, we developed a new prototype that was used for animal testing in a well-established pig ICH model. The animal experimentation provided insight into the complex changes in the brain as a hemorrhage occurs and how these changes affect the antennae signals. For these experiments, we tested multiple blood volumes and locations. We observed changes in signal following infusion of 1, 2, or 3 mL of blood in 2 different brain locations. Using the algorithm developed from our brain gel experiments, we were able to detect hemorrhages as small as 1 mL of blood. Data collected from these experiments also offered Insight into how the signal changes over time as the hemorrhage expands, a major concern for patients suffering from an ICH.     The data collected from our Phase I experiments support the potential of the SENSE monitor to help patients suffering from a brain hemorrhage. These results have given a clear path toward commercializing our product, and in our Phase II proposal, we have identified the next steps to improve the SENSE technology making it a viable monitor for improving patient care while minimizing hospital costs.
