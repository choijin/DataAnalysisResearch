<AbstractNarration>Integrated circuits for power-conscious electronics commonly found in mobile and portable devices typically operate in several operational modes in order to deliver adequate performance while maintaining energy efficiency.  These circuits also have to operate robustly even under uncertainties injected by the manufacturing process and operating environments.  The operation of such a complex circuit or system is synchronized by a network that delivers a clocking signal to various components of the circuit or system.  Success in this research will lead to highly scalable synthesis tools that can competently design robust clock networks to synchronize large-scale high-complexity integrated circuits for mobile applications. Summer camp activities and community outreach activities that embed essential concepts related to circuits, systems and computing will be developed, benefiting K-12 students and broadening the participation of underrepresented students in computer engineering.  With the integration of research results into the undergraduate and graduate curricula, students will be trained with a broad range of skills, in areas such as circuits, numerical linear algebra, and fundamental algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existing approaches of synthesizing a robust clocking system involve the application of iterations of legalization steps to correct the timing violations of an initial clock network in different operating scenarios. In contrast to such a lengthy iterative process that has no guarantee of convergence to a feasible solution, a correct-by-construction approach will be developed in this project. The proposed research activities are driven by a reconfigurable circuit structure that could robustly deliver the clocking signal for different modes of operation, while accounting for different corners of manufacturing process and operating environments. The fundamental problems of scheduling the arrival times of clocking signals at different components of a circuit under various operating scenarios will be explored. Various techniques of inserting safety margins into the reconfigurable circuit structure will be developed. For some critical components, redundant paths will be inserted such that the synchronizing signal could be delivered to them robustly should a failure occur in one of the redundant paths.  A new suite of circuits for various benchmarking purposes will also be made available to promote research in this important area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Driven by the need to provide power-conscious electronics for mobile and portable devices, today's integrated circuits rely on a multitude of low-power design techniques for power management. These techniques include multiple voltage domains, clock gating, and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling. It is common for a circuit to have a few operational modes in order to deliver high performance when needed while maintaining energy efficiency. In addition to handling the increased complexity introduced by these advanced design techniques, a clock network in a modern day circuit also has to operate robustly in multiple process corners, tolerating the effects of on-chip variations in the form of process, voltage, and temperature variations. This project deals with the synthesis of robust clock networks for multiple-corner-multiple-mode (MCMM) designs.  There are four main outcomes of this project:  1.  Based on graph and mathematical formulations, the research activities seek to develop scalable algorithms for the construction of clock networks that are robust in delivering clock signals for MCMM designs even under variations in the process and in the operating conditions.  The research activities have focused on two important aspects of clock tree synthesis.  First, in the development of clock schedulers, two types of clock schedulers are considered. The first type is a fast dynamic clock scheduler that is based on a sparse-graph formulation, which reduces the cubic time complexity and the quadratic space complexity of an earlier scheduler significantly. The second type is a clock scheduler that determines static arrival time constraints.  The static arrival time constraints can be obtained using a linear program formulation.  By solving the minimum cycle mean problem in a graph formulation, static lower and upper bounds on arrival time constraints can be obtained more efficiently.  Second, in the development of clock tree construction algorithms, the generic skew constraint graphs are extended to handle latency bounds, safety margins, and reconfigurability of clock trees.  In particular, multiple skew constraint graphs for multiple corners of each mode are compressed into one skew constraint graph, effectively transforming an MCMM problem into an equivalent single-corner multiple-mode (SCMM) problem.  This facilitates the construction of a robust mode-reconfigurable clock tree, where compatible modes can share common subtrees in order to achieve area efficiency for MCMM designs.  Similar compression technique has also been developed to remove timing violations in constructed clock trees.  2. This project also aims to broaden the participation of underrepresented K-12 students in computing and engineering. The PI has collaborated with the Purdue Minority Engineering Program (MEP) in organizing hands-on engineering activities for summer camps targeting high school students in 2015, 2017, and 2019.

They also learned about resistors and basics of circuits in the assembly of logic gates on a bread board.  3. Three graduate students have been involved with the project.

A MS student graduated in May 2017 and joined Cadence in June 2017. A PhD student is scheduled to defend his work in July 2020.  4. To facilitate the research in the area of clock network synthesis, the project develops and maintains benchmark circuits for clock scheduling and synthesis at the Purdue University Research Repository.
