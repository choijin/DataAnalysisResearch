<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of Colorado Boulder to support a workshop series to convene U.S. researchers who are already engaged in, or interested in developing research partnerships in Lower Mekong Basin (LMB), a region that includes parts of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. The objective of this workshop series is to facilitate mechanisms and networking strategies for research partnerships between U.S. scientists and LMB scientists that advance U.S. and global scientific knowledge, improve data sharing and accessibility, and identify best practices.  For these workshops, priority topics include documenting biodiversity through scientific collections, leveraging engineering and computing applications for improved data accessibility, and promoting opportunities for training and education exchange.  Due to rapid human population growth, habitat conversion related to rapid economic growth, planned damming of the Mekong and other rivers in this area; and of regional and global environmental change, scientists and resource managers are concerned that the biodiversity of this area is threatened.  In addition, environmental changes affecting the health of this biodiversity are also creating a series of challenges for local human populations that relate directly to issues of environment, water quality, and food security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. researchers have already been developing fruitful research partnerships with LMB scientists. Recognizing the value of these collaborations, these workshops are designed to engage the U.S. and international research community to stimulate further collaboration, share insights, results, and recommendations for developing new scientific infrastructure, including a possible new natural history collection that will support physical and digital documentation of biodiversity for the research community, educators, policy makers, and the public.  The Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) is part of the Indo-Burma hotspot, an area of extraordinary diversity of plant and animal life.  Its complex topography and major river systems have yielded intriguing biogeographic patterns, ongoing discovery over the past two decades of many new species, and even a number of new and distinctive mammalian species.  These workshops will provide a forum to discuss issues related to research and education network management, organization, sustainability, and data and knowledge sharing and dissemination.  The planning committee will issue an open call for participation, and the selection process will ensure diverse participation of women and other under-represented groups in science.  In particular, these face-to-face meeting are important to current and future projects in order to sustain successful components of existing projects, initiate and cultivate networks of international collaborators, and how to promote maximum participation from a diversity of scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Project "Workshops on Research in the Lower Mekong Basin; Sept. 25-26, 2015 USGS, Laurel, MD and November, 2015 &ndash; Can Tho, Vietnam" included two successful workshops and generated a significant amount of post-workshop activities.   We were pleased with the range of research programs represented by the participants and also by their diversity.  The first workshop, at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Laurel, MD on September 25th -26th, and had more than 60 participants.  The second workshop, at the University of Can Tho, in Can Tho, Vietnam on November 30th - December 1st, had more than 50 participants. This workshop series convened US researchers who are engaged in, or interested in developing, research partnerships in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) region (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar) to explore common research topics of interest.  The long-term objective is to facilitate mechanisms for research partnerships between US and LMB scientists for the purpose of advancing US and global scientific knowledge, disseminate data and best practices for environmental stewardship, and promote opportunities for training and education exchanges.  Critical research areas include agriculture/aquaculture and food security, environment and water quality, documenting biodiversity and establishing conservation strategies, climate change, energy security, engineering and computing, and education.  In addition to US researchers, the Maryland workshop also had participants from Lao PDR, Thailand, Myanmar, and Vietnam.  These countries were also represented in the Vietnam workshop as were Cambodia and Malaysia.     Topics covered at the Maryland workshop ranged from applied engineering approaches to deal with changing water flows in the Mekong, to hydrologists studying how impending dam construction and climate change might affect the Mekong, to biologists studying how such changes on the Mekong might affect biodiversity, to biologists working on combatting illegal animal trade in the greater Mekong region and working on documenting biodiversity, to social scientists studying the impacts on conservation actions and changes to the Mekong flow on local human communities.  There were also presentations by the National Geographic Society, National Science Foundation officers, and a visiting scientist at the Center for Science Diplomacy at the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  This last presentation by Dr. William Colglazier focused on "Science as Diplomacy" providing an interesting uniting theme for participants.     Topics covered at the Vietnam workshop overlapped with those in Maryland and also included overviews of research in the Mekong Delta by Vietnamese researchers, environmental activities by international NGOs in the lower Mekong Basin region, ways to establish a standard database system for the lower Mekong Basin, and plans for establishing a network of natural history museums in collaboration with the Wetland University Network.  Moreover, this workshop included substantial participation from the US State Department and Vietnam?s Ministry of Science and Technology focusing on the US-Vietnam bilateral science and technology relationship.  The workshop in Vietnam was scheduled to coincide with the U.S.-Vietnam Science &amp;Technology Joint Committee Meeting that took place in Ho Chi Minh City December 2nd &ndash; 4th at which a number of the US and Vietnamese researchers from the workshop also participated.      The information exchanged in both workshops are directly related to the "Intellectual Merit" of this project in fostering new collaborations relevant to the documentation of biodiversity and adaptation, threats to biodiversity by human development, the history of climate change in the area and the potential impacts of anticipated sea-level rise in the coming decades, the relationships between development and environment quality, and a range of health and education programs.     The participation of US researchers at the U.S. &ndash; Vietnam Science &amp; Technology Joint Committee Meeting was an immediate outcome of this Project in that these researchers made direct contributions to the discussions and planning for actions for 2016-2018 in Conservation Science; Climate, Hydrology, and Meteorology; and STEM Education and Research Exchange.  In addition, led by R.M. Ceballos a number of participants are collaborating on NSF Research Collaboration Network projects to bring students representing underrepresented groups in sciences to Lower Mekong Basin region research opportunities.  Also, a number of participants were involved in drafting a Letter of Intent (LOI) between Can Tho University and the US State Department signed on May 23, 2016 providing intellectual support for the Lower Mekong Research Collaboration Initiative; relevant to this project in that it creates a mechanism for long-term cooperation between US and Mekong region researchers in areas that include natural history collections, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable utilization of natural resources.  Other outcomes include numerous new intellectual connections that should also foster additional long-term cooperation and collaborations. The contributions to the U.S. &ndash; Vietnam Science &amp; Technology Joint Committee Meeting are relevant to "Broader Impacts" in providing informed opinion to ongoing areas of collaboration between these two countries.  Likewise, contributions to the Lower Mekong Research Collaboration Initiative supports outreach that includes public education on critically important topics for the region.
