<AbstractNarration>Crisis often creates opportunity. The ongoing US educational crisis has spawned a rapidly growing industry for out-of-school student "enrichment" programs. Parents across all economic strata want to invest in their children.  While traditional tutoring programs are highly valued by parents, they are rarely considered fun and engaging by the students. This I-Corps team proposes to evaluate the feasibility of launching a national chain of retail 'Tinkering Lab" locations where girls and boys are challenged to invent exciting science and ?Maker? projects (e.g. planes, robots, catapults, automatic pet feeders, musical synthesizers, etc.) while learning to use 21st century fabrication tools such as 3D printers, and laser cutters, and incorporating electronics and servo actuators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Tinkering Labs, young people will learn by doing, inventing, and being challenged. They will learn STEM concepts compelled by curiosity while having fun. It reinforces a new paradigm of STEM learning by fostering 21st century skills such as design thinking, authentic problem solving, creativity, collaboration, and communication. The Tinkering experience, guided by skilled mentors, fosters STEM learning, and generates interest in pursuing STEM careers.  The project will test the commercial potential of the Tinkering Labs concept, as an after-school and weekend destination for children and teens, ages 8 to 18. Tinkering Labs has the potential to increase the number of students enthusiastic about STEM careers, improve their understanding of STEM concepts and contribute to the transformation of the traditional STEM education process. Over the next decade Tinkering Labs has the potential to reach hundreds of thousands of children and to provide a much more engaging way for them to explore STEM while they develop critical thinking skills.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the project was to test the viability of creating a "makerspace" where children from elementary school to high school get hands-on experience creating things, manufacturing their creations, and learning the scientific, engineering, and mathematical principles that make them work.  The goal was to design a strategy that would make it a self-sustaining, for profit, educational enterprise.   Key outcomes:  1. Product (intellectual property) - Wehave successfully designed and developed a small set of projects which DO meet all of the go-to-market requirements (market interest, feasibility, educational effectiveness). This includes a range of projects that are age appropriate and span a range of grades from 3 to 8. For more information visit: http://www.makerresearchlabs.com/flight-lab/  2. Process &ndash; By conducting several test workshops sessions, we have gained valuable experience on how to deliver the project experience including how to incorporate STEM concepts, tool usage, and safety.  3. New Educational Paradigm &ndash; We developed a simple educational paradigm which we believe will determine the success of both in-school and for-profit maker spaces.  4. Investor Feedback &ndash; We have pitched the commercial concept to several potential investors, and although none were interested in making an investment, we gathered critical information about investor preferences, which has clarified a path leading to potential investment in the future.  In addition, the project involved several undergraduate students who served as product designers, testers, and educational facilitators. Two students won second place in a NASA sponsored contest to license their drone control technology for education.
