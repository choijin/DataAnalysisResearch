<AbstractNarration>1541807&lt;br/&gt;Lowry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With ever increasing global demands for food, water, and energy, there is a critical need in the U.S. to identify sustainable solutions for simultaneously achieving energy, water, and food security. Agriculture accounts for approximately 70 % of all freshwater use, and 10 % of energy consumption, globally. Therefore, the agroecosystem lies at the heart of the energy-water-food nexus, and systems-level improvements in performance offers one of the greatest opportunities towards energy, water, and food security. Recent advances in nanoscale science and engineering offer unprecedented opportunity to reduce the energy and water inputs for food production, and to provide cost-effective, water and energy conservative technologies for reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to convene a multidisciplinary group of faculty, students, and researchers from the USDA and the nanotechnology and agrochemical industries in a 2-day workshop in Pittsburgh, PA to identify the most promising groundbreaking opportunities for nanotechnology to increase sustainability at the food-water-energy nexus, and to identify the most pressing scientific, engineering, and social challenges that must be overcome to realize those benefits. Nanotechnology now offers unprecedented capabilities to clean and recycle water and wastewater, harness solar energy, create novel miniaturized chemical sensors and integrated sensor networks, improve food preservation, and provide targeted delivery of pesticides and nutrients. These advances can provide the tools needed for data-driven precision agriculture, can substantially improve resource utilization, and can lower the environmental footprint of food production. However, realizing this goal will require improved understanding of the complex relationships between food, water, energy, and society. This pioneering workshop will bring together leading scientists and engineers from a range of research fields comprising the food-energy-water nexus to identify the most promising opportunities for nanotechnologies to improve overall agroecosystem performance, and to identify the scientific and engineering challenges currently inhibiting widespread applications of nanotechnology in food production. The PIs will apply the pseudo-nominal group technique during the workshop to develop a prioritized list of the most promising emerging opportunities for nanotechnology at the food-energy-water nexus, and to elaborate on how these opportunities should direct research efforts toward the most critical research needs, and potential impacts, in the next five to ten years. This workshop experience will foster dialogue among diverse participants around the most pressing scientific obstacles to implementing nanotechnology for sustainable solutions at the food-energy-water nexus, while also drawing on understanding of the myriad economic, infrastructural, and social constraints that also define the boundaries of both challenges and potential opportunities for within the food-energy-water nexus</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Nanotechnology offers unprecedented capabilities to improve sustainability at the Food-Energy-Water (FEW) nexus, but the potential applications of nanotechnology in agriculture and food safety has not been fully explored.  An interdisciplinary workshop conducted at Carnegie Mellon University October 19-20, 2015 gathered ~50 experts from the U.S. and the EU in the areas of nanotechnology, energy, water, agriculture, systems engineering, data integration and analysis, and social science to identify the greatest systems-level opportunities for minimizing resource inputs and waste, and for maximizing crop productivity and food utilization.  The scientific, engineering, and social and regulatory challenges to realizing the full potential of nanotechnology at the FEW nexus were discussed. Intellectual Merit: Workshop participants identified seven key areas where nanomaterial applications can be used to provide system-wide optimization opportunities at the FEW nexus including 1) Nano-enabled sensors and analytics; 2) Treating and recycling agricultural wastes; 3) Nanomaterials for improved efficiency and performance of water systems; 4) Detection and intervention approaches to minimize food loss and waste; 5)  Detection and intervention approaches to improve food; 6) Nanomaterials for efficient fertilizers and pesticides; 7) Plant and animal health protection and intervention. Applications of nanomaterials in each of these areas can lead to lower overall water and energy inputs for food production. The use of multifunctional nanomaterials and nano-enabled sensors in agriculture can increase the spatial and temporal granularity of monitoring crop and livestock health, and revolutionize the delivery of pesticides, vaccines, and nutrients to improve yields while lowering overall inputs and environmental impacts of agriculture. Nanotechnology also offers opportunities to recover energy, water, and nutrients from agricultural waste streams. These opportunities come primarily from the ability to provide more controllable membrane geometries for separations, greater selectivity and reactivity of the nanomaterials for target analytes, and the ability to produce multifunctional materials. While there are significant opportunities for nanomaterials and nanotechnology to improve sustainability at the FEW nexus, manufacturing these nanomaterials cheaply and safely, and designing them as selective, sensitive and durable for use in highly complex matrices (e.g. soil or food) is a significant challenge. Performing a technoeconomic gap analysis on proposed nano-enabled solutions will be critical to identify the highest value opportunities for nanotechnologies at the FEW nexus. Managing risk perception by consumers and manufacturers, and overcoming the regulatory challenges to implementing these new technologies is also essential to having them adopted. All stakeholders should be brought into the process early on to maximize public benefit of this new technology while minimizing undue hardship on agricultural producers. Broader Impacts:   The broader impacts of the proposed nano-enabled technologies for the FEW nexus are vast given the potential for nanotechnology to revolutionize food production and distribution, and to lower the overall environmental footprint of agriculture by reducing energy and water requirements.  The workshop outcomes provides a foundation for the academic communityÆs involvement in supporting and furthering CBETÆs vision, mission, and goals for research programs at the FEW nexus, and for collaboration in research and education programs, projects, workforce development, and related activities.
