<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Capacity-building (CAP) projects increase the ability of researchers to understand how such technology should be designed and used in the future and supports new capacity in allowing researchers to answer questions about how people learn, how to foster or assess learning, and/or how to design for learning. One challenge in designing and studying technology-based learning environments is incorporating state of the art knowledge about how technology can support (or hinder) those with disabilities. This project will help researchers in the cyberlearning community do research that takes into account what is known about technology and disability by conducting training for cyberlearning researchers both face to face and online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AccessCyberlearning project will increase the capacity of current and future Cyberlearning and similar projects to inform their research with what is known about student differences/disabilities; to design innovative learning technologies and teaching strategies that are welcoming to, accessible to, and usable by everyone, including people with disabilities; and ensure that project materials (e.g., project websites, videos) and activities (training, meetings) are welcoming to, accessible to, and usable by all participants. The intellectual merit of the project lies in bringing together the expertise of the DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) Center at the University of Washington together with Cyberlearning researchers to help shape future research agendas in the field and to inform those researchers with limited experience in the area to the research literature on, and design best-practices for, equal access. This will take place through a set of face-to-face institutes coordinated with the CIRCL (Center for Innovative Research in CyberLearning) and through development of web-based training materials for use by the field more broadly.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking and Technology (DO-IT) Center at the University of Washington received funding for AccessCyberlearning as a Capacity Building Project (CAP) within the Cyberlearning and Future Technologies program at NSF. NSF-funded AccessCyberlearning activities engaged Cyberlearning projects and projects with similar goals to explore how what is known about the online engagement of individuals with disabilities can inform cyberlearning research, learning technology development, and teaching strategies. The goal was to contribute to making online learning opportunities welcoming to, accessible to, and usable by the broadest audience, including students and instructors with disabilities.  Project outputs and outcomes revealed that AccessCyberlearning was successful in meeting its objectives to increase the capacity of current and future cyberlearning researchers, technology developers, and instructors to  inform their research with what is known about student differences/disabilities; design innovative learning technologies and teaching strategies that are welcoming to, accessible to, and usable by everyone, including people with disabilities; and ensure that project materials (e.g., project websites, videos) and activities (training, meetings) are welcoming to, accessible to, and usable by all participants.   AccessCyberlearning activities and products included the following:  Community of Practice (CoP). 142 stakeholders engaged within the AccessCyberlearning online CoP.  Capacity Building Institute (CBI). A CBI was conducted with 28 participants.  Webinars. AccessCyberlearning engaged 1,366 participants in 15 webinars.  Other Professional Development. Twelve presentations, posters, and exhibits reached more than 700 people at conferences and meetings.  Project Products. Two peer-reviewed articles and one book chapter were published. Twenty new articles were written and 191 were updated within DO-IT?s searchable online resource of questions and answers, case studies, and promising practices. Proceedings from the CBI, tips for online instructors, and guidelines for making cyberlearning projects inclusive were created and are shared along with other resources through the project website at www.uw.edu/doit/programs/accesscyberlearning.  CIRCL Engagement and Website Enhancements. AccessCyberlearning project staff worked with staff from the Center for Innovative Research in CyberLearning (CIRCL) to conduct an accessibility review of their site and assist them in making improvements, to create the Accessibility Resources page for CIRCL. These resources help cyberlearning projects make their project activities and products accessible to all students, instructors, and other stakeholders with disabilities.  By addressing disability-related issues, AccessCyberlearning helped cyberlearning researchers, technology developers, and instructors work toward the ultimate goal of making the learning experiences of all students more effective and online teaching opportunities available to more potential instructors. Participants in AccessCyberlearning are better prepared to make technological advances that foster deep understanding of content and masterful skill development; draw in and encourage learning among populations not well served by current educational practices; and provide new ways of assessing capabilities, engagement, and learning of all students.  Reaching project objectives supported the Cyberlearning and Future Technologies program goals to  invent, explore, and learn to effectively use the new technologies that will address society's educational goals by ensuring that these technologies are effective for the broadest audience, including those with a wide variety of disabilities; and advance understanding of how people learn and how to better foster learning in the context of the new kinds of learning experiences that technology makes possible by informing research and practice with knowledge about online access issues and experiences of individuals with disabilities.   AccessCyberlearning also supported the NSF program?s interconnected thrusts to assist participants in  innovating, by using technology for fostering and assessing learning that is welcoming to, accessible to, and usable by people with a broad range of characteristics that include a wide range of disabilities; advancing understanding of how people learn in technology-rich learning environments by enhancing their understanding of how inaccessible technology limits the participation of people with disabilities and strategies for reducing barriers to this population that also increases access to other underserved populations; and promoting broad use and transferability of new genres by incorporating accessible design features into existing and new technology designs so that they reach the broadest audience and comply with accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and related legislation.   BROADER IMPACTS   AccessCyberlearning outcomes benefit society by  Increasing the participation of people with disabilities in online learning, Incorporating universal design principles into online curricula to make it effective to the broadest audience, and Building on existing associations and networks and creating durable relationships among stakeholders that enhance the infrastructure for research and education.   Because of its employment of evidence-based practices, focus on systemic change, effective participant training and support, development of strategic project products, innovative dissemination efforts, and significant engagement with the CIRCL, project impacts will be felt long after the expiration of NSF funding. Resources will be shared through conferences that project staff and participants routinely attend and will continue to be updated by the DO-IT Center. DO-IT staff will also continue to engage with members of the AccessCyberlearning CoP.          Last Modified: 01/07/2019       Submitted by: Sheryl Burgstahler]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
