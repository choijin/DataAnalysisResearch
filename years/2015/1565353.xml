<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the "Conference on Analysis and Geometry," to be held at Princeton University  from January  26 to 29, 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in analysis, especially in the fields of harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and geometric analysis.  A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.  More information will be made available at:&lt;br/&gt;http://web.math.princeton.edu/conference/Klainerman2016/</AbstractNarration>
