<AbstractNarration>Microgrid technology (an emerging technology to enhance power system reliability) is essential to manage the transition to tomorrow's energy supply model. The United States power grid is evolving into a network of new technologies with increased reliance on a diversity of energy resources - resources that are sustainable, renewable and abundant to power homes, businesses, military installations and industry. Yet, the resources are at the same time fluctuating and inconsistent.  The proposed technology aims to reduce dependence on the utility grid, and the possibility of major blackouts reduces to infinitesimal for customers. The successful implementation of the proposed technology will pave way for more advanced research and development in this field and contribute to transforming the current energy infrastructure to becoming more resilient. The benefits of the proposed technology can and will be felt throughout the spectrum of generators and consumers: generators will deliver their energy in an optimal and efficient way; and consumers will receive uninterruptible power supply. With lesser wastage of power, higher power quality, good storage management at reasonable costs, the proposed technology resonates with the current demands of the energy market target customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology is based on novel control strategies for various elements of the microgrid system (such as different energy resources, energy storage systems, and customer loads, etc.).  This I-Corps team has developed a unique smart microgrid controller that will enable resource optimization as well as increase stability of renewable microgrid. With the advent of this technology, the microgrid will become more robust and efficient. In addition, the goal is to minimize the total operation cost so that microgrids can be widely adopted in the energy market. The controller has the ability to effectively synchronize among different energy resources such as diesel, solar, wind, hydro, etc. under different operating conditions. The possibility of major blackouts is thereby reduced to infinitesimal. Thus, the proposed controller equips the microgrid with higher stability, efficiency, better power quality, reliability and resiliency. Some distinct features of this smart microgrid controller include: user-friendliness; increased penetration of renewable energy sources; better co-ordination and optimal utilization of different energy sources such as wind, solar, diesel, hydro, etc.; enhanced stability and power quality; effective battery storage management. The controller works as an intelligent unit and supports the entire microgrid system thereby enabling customers to save energy and money.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF I-Corps project has resulted in insights regarding the technical feasibility and financial aspects for the commercialization of our technology. These results will help us in designing a more efficient and marketable microgrid controller. Specific results are listed below about our technology:  Cost plays an important role in decision making; Our technology is location specific. It has more application in areas prone to frequent natural disasters (areas that require reliability and resiliency) and areas with higher electricity rate; Traditional and conservative utilities still oppose our technology since it requires more initial investment; At present it is difficult to analyze the total cost of our microgrid integrator; Our technology needs to be customized for each customer segment because they have different value propositions based on their locality. Not all Customer Segments are interested in our technology and microgrids in general. Every customer has different Value Proposition priorities.   Key outcomes of this project are described below:  Based on our learning and findings, we obtained our final week business model canvas as a key outcome. With our interaction with our customers, we were able to conclude that university campuses and rural distribution and transmission companies should be our technology?s major target. Through the project activities, our team become familiarized with the process of commercializing our research discovery.  Based on the business canvas model, we decided for a go decision after we have conducted more technical and market research.  We set up a start-up company "Microgrid Integrator, Inc.," registered in the state of Colorado in September 2015, which is still active. We filed an invention disclosure to Office of Technology Transfer, University of Denver.  Another outcome of this project is a prototype design of the microgrid integrator. In the prototype, both the hardware and software of the microgrid prototype have been developed.
