<AbstractNarration>This project, "CC*DNI Networking Infrastructure: Campus Network Enhancement to Support Data Intensive Research at the University of Alabama in Huntsville", establishes a high-performance campus network dedicated to the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) scientific research community. Implementation of this project enables UAH researchers to perform leading edge research impacting the entire nation, particularly in the areas of big data management and analysis, space exploration and space science, cybersecurity, earth and atmospheric science, optical engineering, aerospace, and propulsion. Scientific research is not only vital to scientific discovery and UAH's expansion of undergraduate and graduate STEM education programs, the research done at UAH contributes to local, state, and national economic development and job creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the research initiatives at UAH involve the collection, analysis, visualization and sharing of large amounts of data, and include use of sensors and other real-time data sources. To better support data-intensive science, this project enables a fast, highly secure, and highly flexible network environment called a Science DMZ. The Science DMZ is comprised of both 100GE and 40GE connections between major research facilities on the UAH campus. By using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and OpenFlow, the network intelligently selects the Science DMZ exclusively for secure, protected research data flows. An expanded PerfSONAR implementation is utilized to monitor and continuously tune the Science DMZ network performance.  Scientists and researchers experience a secure, friction-free network through the use of the UAH Science DMZ, further enabling future data-intensive research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) received a NSF grant to implement a Science DMZ on campus. The purpose of the Science DMZ on campus is to remove potential roadblocks and bottlenecks from research and science data flows both on campus as well as to external entities.   UAH implemented 100Gbps network communications between its VBH and OKT campus locations and 40Gbps between VBH and ENG, VBH and CRH, and CRH to SWIRLL. These NSF funded enhancements have reduced the need for researchers to hand carry data between buildings, instead being able to utilize the network infrastructure to complete timely data transfers. Additionally, the UAH network infrastructure was improved to both SST and JRC, which improves additional science and researchers capabilities.   Additionally, UAH implemented performance monitoring via perfSONAR appliances which assist in the day to day monitoring of network performance as well as providing the necessary tools to troubleshoot tricky network problems.   The overall network infrastructure improvements at UAH have increased the capacity of both internal and external communications as well as improving the overall availability of the infrastructure.   Through coordination with the Cyberinfrastructure Engineer, requirements and timelines are communicated between the researchers and network engineers, and solutions are developed, tested, and implemented to ensure that the network can perform at the necessary levels before, during, and after experiments.   UAH has benefited tremendously through both the CC*IIE and CC*DNI grants, as the network infrastructure has increased significantly and OIT is working hand-in-hand with the research and science communities.
