<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the ability to simplify treatment of infertility due to PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). PCOS affects 1 in 6 women of childbearing age, and it impacts the ability to ovulate naturally. The most common 2nd-line treatment is injectable hormones that cost $15,000-$20,000 for a 6-month course and require 5-6 clinical visits each month to avoid serious side-effects. Clinical guidelines also recommend an infrequently used laparoscopic surgery that normalizes ovulation and leads to a similar pregnancy rate to hormone injections. This funding will foster work enabling the same tissue effects as the surgery but via a minimally-invasive needle-based route of access, similar to what is commonly used in other fertility procedures. This will be significantly advantageous to patients and physicians for the following reasons: costs half as much as hormone injections, enables natural ovulation via a 1-time procedure, requires few clinical visits, and reduces rates of twins/triplets to 1-2% (as compared to 20-25% for hormones) so pregnancies will be less complicated. In the US, 75% of fertility expenses are paid out-of-pocket by patients, so drastically reducing costs will allow greater access to these treatments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project specifically seeks to fund work to characterize the feasibility of replicating the surgical effects using a minimally-invasive, needle-based approach performed under ultrasound guidance. Metrics for success for this work will be sufficient and predictable volumes of tissue affected using devices with parameters consistent with a commercially acceptable device (needle-based access, ultrasound visualization, acceptable energy delivery times and powers, and techniques falling within the skill-set of fertility physicians).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work done under this grant was important in developing a technology to better treat PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome), the most common endocrine disorder of younger women affecting approximately 15% of women of reproductive age. Approximately half of all women with PCOS experience difficulty getting pregnant due to the lack of ovulation. The technology supported by this grant will help these women ovulate again.   There is a well-established laparoscopic surgery known as ovarian diathermy that restores ovulation to these women.   By developing a technology that allows for ovarian diathermy to be performed less invasively (via a transvaginal, needle-based procedure), many more women will have access to this treatment.  The work done under this Phase I NSF SBIR grant was intended to demonstrate that an optimized and commercially-acceptable product design could provide effective treatments using a less invasive approach.  Based on existing clinical literature characterizing the predicate surgery known as ovarian diathermy, treatments delivered using the tested product and therapy should replicate the effects of ovarian diathermy and therefore restore ovulation and treat infertility due to PCOS.  Additional development will further optimize the product configuration and treatment algorithm.   The work under this grant supports the continued development of the technology for human use.
