<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project can lead to a revolution in thin film measurement, which is an integral part of quality control and verification of component and device production.  This can impact a broad range of industries, including semiconductors, transportation (such as airplane coatings and insulation), and polymer coatings in construction and building materials. The proposed technology will result in broader adoption of non-destructive measurement, cost reductions via reduced material usage, increased in-line measurement techniques.  The technology and system will offer flexible and mobile test solutions in comparison to the current immobile, expensive systems that have a high degree of operational constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop an optical measurement system designed to perform film thickness determination on layers that are constructed with turbid media and surface conditions that are far from optically smooth. The film thickness will be measured in a non-contact, non-destructive manner, with potential for real-time assessment. The material properties of the films are the primary reason for the constraints on film thickness measurement by the currently available measurement devices. The accurate film-thickness and conformal coating thickness measurement are made possible by a proprietary novel noise reduction technique which enables the system to make accurate measurement from interference images with significant speckle and scattering noise. The goal of this research program is to augment this technology into a portable system that can provide quality control without requirements for steady state conditions and can be applied in a variety of manufacturing processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Introduction  Non-contact, real-time, and in-process measurement of film?s thickness has been a major challenge for a broad range of industry for decades that has remained unresolved. In many industries, despite the higher cost, the films are applied in thicker than required format in order to make sure that the films at least reach the required minimum thickness, which other than cost may result in compromising the performance, increasing the waste of materials and increasing environmental footprints.     Optoniks? patented noise reduction technique enables a novel optical measurement system to perform film thickness determination on layers that are constructed with scattering material, and refractive boundaries. Due to the optically distortive nature of the majority of these films, the current thickness measurement techniques either fail to make reliable measurements or they are very expensive and slow instruments. The specific target market is the semiconductor manufacturing industry, specifically pertaining to design verification and quality control diagnostics. Semiconductor manufacturing has several tools available for layer measurement, most of which are destructive, and several require contact and preparation. For instance, the e-beam, electron-microscopy and ion-beam imaging techniques are supposedly non-contact, but all are destructive in nature for semiconductor metrology due to the ionizing character of the probing mechanisms. In addition, these techniques are time consuming as a result of required preparation of the sample prior to measurement and inspection.    Results  The Phase I Research Plan with respect to the individual objectives provided the following results:  An optical measurement system designed and implemented to perform film thickness determination on layers that are constructed with scattering material and surface conditions that are far from optically smooth. The film thickness measurement system prototype measures in a non-contact, non-destructive manner, with potential for real-time assessment. The material properties of the films are the primary reason for the constraints on film thickness measurement by the currently available measurement devices. The accurate film-thickness and conformal coating thickness measurement are made possible by Optoniks? proprietary novel noise reduction technique which enables this system to make accurate measurement from images with significant speckle and scattering noise.    Based on the thickness information obtained for the film-thickness on real manufacturing samples, Optoniks has proven feasibility to provide a new metrology tool to the semiconductor industry. This effort is supported by the overwhelmingly positive response from representatives of the Optoniks primary market.   The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in thin film measurement, which is an integral part of quality control and verification of component and device production in a broad range of industries, including but not limited to semiconductor industry and transportation industry such as airplane coatings and insulation as well as polymer coatings in construction and building materials.
