<AbstractNarration>This award will be a collaborative effort to investigate a possible regulatory role of vitamin B2 (riboflavin and its derivatives) in the metabolism of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The research will be conducted under the direction and expertise of Dr. Miyako Kusano, a noted expert in the field, at RIKEN in Yokohama, Japan, and at University of Tsukuba, also in Japan. Finding that flavins can modulate metabolic pathways in plants as they do in bacteria will be useful for engineering plants which are more resistant to environmental stresses in the field, such as drought, salt, and heat, or for aiding in the production of plants which produce desired compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flavins are essential cofactors for hundreds of enzymes involved in diverse metabolic pathways, and are a promising metabolic regulator. Profiling of the small molecule products of primary metabolism through metabolomics and comparison of these profiles between plants producing different levels of flavins will allow insight into which pathways are affected by flavins. Integration of this data with information on all of the genes being transcribed in the plant, gained from a transcriptomics analysis, will allow a more global understanding of how flavins affect a wide variety of metabolic pathways. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This EAPSI project was a collaborative effort to investigate the role of vitamin B2 and related compounds in plant metabolism. We chose to investigate this because these molecules are essential in all organisms and understanding how this pathway functions in plants will aid in our understanding of other organisms as well. Experimental set up, sampling, and sample preparation of plants with altered levels of vitamin B2 was completed. Due to shipping delays of biological materials, data collection and analysis has not yet been completed at this time. This project provided unparalleled professional development opportunities by allowing for research experience in a different culture, establishment of an early career collaboration, and extensive networking with researchers from many fields of study and locales. This project also strengthened existing ties between Washington State University and the RIKEN research center in Yokohama, Japan, and we look forward to future collaborations. Research into the role of vitamin B2 and its related compounds in plant metabolism will continue as part of a PhD thesis project, and hopefully the data analysis from this EAPSI project will be completed and incorporated into this ongoing body of work. The long term goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of the role of vitamin B2 in metabolism and abiotic stress responses, with the hopes of producing crop plants that are better able to adapt to stressful field conditions.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/16/2016<br>      Modified by: Skylar&nbsp;A&nbsp;Johnson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
