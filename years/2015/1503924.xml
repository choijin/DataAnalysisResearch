<AbstractNarration>Understanding the loss of ice from glaciers and ice sheets, and the resulting sea-level rise, is of critical importance. Both the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, as well as mountain glaciers, discharge primarily though rivers of ice; understanding what controls the type of flow that occurs in these rivers of ice is therefore central to understanding and predicting sea-level rise. Among the least-understood factors that are thought to be important in affecting ice flow is internal strength of the ice near the sides of a flowing glacier. This viscous strength, in turn, may be affected by the micro-scale structure of the ice crystals in the glacier. The investigators propose to examine these relationships in detail on Jarvis Glacier, in the eastern Alaska Range, with the ultimate goal of being able to represent the effects of microstructure in numerical models of glacial flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this, the investigators will first use surface velocity measurements, knowledge of the glacier geometry derived from ground penetrating radar, and numerical modeling to identify a site for drilling. They will then collect surface-to-bed cores across lateral and vertical flow gradients. Velocity and temperature measurements derived from the boreholes will complement the surface measurements and allow the investigators to produce a more sophisticated three-dimensional numerical model to test the sensitivity of flow patterns to the mechanical structure within the study area. They will compare the microstructure (e.g., grain size distribution, crystallographic fabric) in the ice cores to the in-situ and modeled velocities and temperatures. Although experiments suggest that variations in the intensity and orientation of the crystallographic fabric can result in up to a ten-fold difference in flow strength, there are very few in-situ observational studies of the microstructural architecture of streaming ice; most studies of ice microstructure come from ice divides, where flow rates are slowest. At the end of this project, the investigators aim to have determined (1) the degree to which fabrics formed in the study area are predictable based on ice kinematics, and (2) the relationship among measured crystallographic orientation fabric intensity, grain size, temperature, and ice viscosity as calculated through numerical models. A correlation between fabric and viscous strength would suggest that remote sensing techniques such as radar and seismic anisotropy could become an even more powerful method for identifying the rheological structure of ice. Alternatively, the lack of a strong link between viscous strength and fabric indicates that other factors exert significant control on the rheological properties. Therefore, the results of the proposed project, whatever the correlation between microstructure and viscous strength, should improve quantitative understanding of the physical laws governing streaming ice and improve future predictions of ice mass balance. The project would support and involve both graduate and undergraduate students. The project's numerical models will be developed into a publicly available web-based graphical user interface for use by other researchers and in the classroom.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Globally, we have only medium confidence in predicting glacier flow rates, in part because of uncertainty in ice viscosity. Although we recognize how temperature, water content, and microscale structures affect ice flow, we do not have a robust understanding of how these factors are distributed in natural settings. To address this shortcoming and help improve our quantitative understanding of how ice flows, we collected and examined ice cores from the edge of a glacier in Alaska. We chose the location, on the glacier that feeds Jarvis Creek south of Delta Junction, so we could collect cores that reached the glacier bed at multiple locations near the lateral margin. In the end, we described in detail the crystallographic structure of two cores that reached bed, one 80m long and one 18m long, located 100m and 25m from the edge of the glacier.

Grain size and shape depend on a number of factors, including temperature, deformation rate and amount, water content, and impurity content.

However, our main focus was to measure the orientation of the ice crystals that make up the core. We focused on that parameter because ice crystals are highly mechanically anisotropic: they deform much more easily in one direction than another, similar to a deck of cards, and this can exert significant control on how fast glaciers flow. The orientation of ice crystals also depends on a number of factors, but is principally controlled by deformation magnitude, as long as that deformation has occurred in a consistent geometry.
