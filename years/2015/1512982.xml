<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation by students and junior researchers in the 9th International Conference on Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, June 15-19, 2015.  The EVA conferences are the flagship events for the international statistics community doing research on the theory and applications of extreme values.  These conferences take place every two years around the world.  The 9th EVA conference will gather the majority of the internationally recognized experts in the field as well as a large group of students and junior researchers.  The 9th conference will feature recent developments in extreme value theory and its applications.  This is the area of statistics that provides tools for modeling, estimation, and prediction of the probabilities and magnitudes of events involving very large  (extreme) values.  Extreme value theory is widely used to model and quantify risk of extreme losses in insurance and finance, in many engineering and environmental applications, as well as in quantifying and predicting weather and climate extremes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program of the forthcoming EVA conference features four themes from the general area of Extreme Value Theory: (i) statistical theory; (ii) probability theory; (iii) applications; (iv) emerging theory and applications. Theme (i) involves advances on the inference for multivariate extremes, regression, robustness, quantile regression, and spatial and spatio-temporal extremes.  Theme (ii) covers max-stable processes, geometry and extremes, large deviations, extremes for Gaussian processes, time series, and random fields.  Theme (iii) features applications to precipitation and environmental extremes, finance, insurance, and detection and attribution of climate extremes.  Theme (iv) explores new topics such as extremes in random networks, high-dimensional data, and algebraic topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/eva2015/</AbstractNarration>

In particular, the satellite workshop on statistical computing and the poster sessions encouraged the participation of a broad group of students and junior researchers.  The exposure to world-class research and the developed professional connections with senior as well as peer junior colleagues around the world, will likely have a long-term positive impact on the career development of the next generation domestic statisticians working in the field of Extremes and their applications. The PI as the local organizer of the event has also made a concerted effort to broaden the connections to applications by reaching out to experts on climate modeling, meteorology and hydrology, which complemented the traditionally strong represenatio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
