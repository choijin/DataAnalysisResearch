<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site at New York University (NYU) seeks to strengthen K-12 education in the STEM disciplines by involving middle and high school science and mathematics teachers from the New York City School District in mechatronics and robotics research, entrepreneurship, and industry experiences through 6-week summer workshops.  The RET participants will gain first-hand multidisciplinary experiences to foster their development of the necessary pedagogical content knowledge to engage their own K-12 students in authentic experiences in science and engineering. The program will impact two areas that are of direct interest to the United States and the world: increasing access for K-12 teachers and their students to a deeper understanding of the STEM disciplines, research, and career opportunities; and inspiring teachers and students to pursue engineering careers. The decreasing cost of electronics and hardware components along with technological advances in additive manufacturing promise to significantly lower the cost of robot hardware, making the use of robots economical in diverse industries. Mechatronics and robotics designs will provide participants with a comprehensive experience in systems integration and product development through which they can practice and hone their skills in creativity, inventiveness, and entrepreneurship and gain an appreciation of the pathway from STEM education to careers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a three-year period this RET Site will offer an intensive summer research program for a total of 30 middle and high school STEM teachers from schools in underserved New York City neighborhoods with socially, economically, racially, and ethnically diverse student bodies. Planned research projects include: marine robotics, microfluidic biosensing, wearable robotics, mechatronics device for liquid projectile visualization, and robots for disabilities. Project plans include: conduct guided training under the supervision of the Principal Investigator; collaborate with management experts to allow teachers to learn entrepreneurship, conduct innovation case-studies, and shadow entrepreneurs; offer research and industry experiences to teachers, in 2-teacher teams collaborating with faculty/industry mentors and research students; conduct events such as Open House, RET Day@Poly, and research seminars; conduct an Inno/Vention student idea contest and develop a business-philanthropy partnership to offer summer internships to students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit: From 2017-2019, 30 teachers received training, research, entrepreneurship, and industry experiences through summer workshops of six-week duration. Each year, the workshop was conducted in a collaborative environment with 8+ researchers and five faculty. In the first two-weeks of workshop, teachers received an introduction to sensors, actuators, electronics, microcontrollers, robotics, and entrepreneurship. In the remaining four weeks of workshop, teachers collaborated with and contributed to ongoing projects involving researchers and faculty. By modeling and reflecting an authentic research setting, teachers engaged in self-directed learning and collaboration. During one summer, teachers participated in a three-day lesson plan development session to explore the 5E instructional model and the three-dimensional (3D) model of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The goal of this three-day session was for teachers to create lessons that used their engineering laboratory experiences and grounded them in the NGSS framework. During each year's workshop, observing and performing engineering research allowed teachers to understand the process of approaching research questions, dissecting the core scientific principles, and role of science and engineering practices in answering these questions. Talks from industry professionals, including workshops by industry partners, along with visits to startup and industry sites provided ample industry exposure to teachers.</p> <p>To develop on-going partnership with teachers, follow-up activities were conducted each academic year. An annual half-day event allowed teachers to present their summer research experience to their peers and engineering researchers presented their progress on summer research projects. Graduate researchers visited their partner teachers' schools, where they discussed their STEM research experiences. Teachers utilized their newly acquired learning to integrate technology in their classrooms, labs, or after school activities. They mentored and advised their students to participate in a mechatronics/robotics-based student idea competition at NYU Tandon.</p> <p>A 35-item survey assessed teachers' familiarity with mechatronics skills, concepts, and devices introduced during the training. Teachers' self-perception with project topics improved from 1.40/4.0 average (pre) to 2.91/4.0 average (post). A 7-item survey assessed teachers' understanding of entrepreneurship concepts, yielding 1.78/4.0 average (pre) and 3.14/4.0 average (post). On project technical quizzes, teachers' average was: 49.08% (pre) and 61.03% (post); yielding 31.93% improvement.</p> <p>The project teachers contributed to research on augmented reality for robotics, legged locomotion, marine robotics, mechatronics and robotics for rehabilitation, microfluidic biosensing, swarm robotics, wearable sensors, etc. They designed educational lessons and activities, such as: microfluidic device prototyping, studying evolution using fishbots, building and analyzing workings of an accelerometer, using augmented reality for coding and geometric modeling, autonomous navigation, etc.</p> <p>Broader Impact: A significant proportion of RET Site project participants are from groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines (among the 30 teachers were 8 underrepresented minorities and 14 women). Each year (2018, 2019) in late spring, students of RET Site participants from prior summer competed in NYU SoE's Inno/Vention contest.</p> <p>The graduate researcher's school visits assisted teachers in organizing robotics activities and teams and enabled students interested in robotics to consult with researchers about expectations, commitments, and technical aspects to be successful in such activities. Collectively, these educators impacted over 500 students, with approximately 50% being women and a large proportion from underrepresented minority groups. These educators acted as mentors to the robotics clubs and they developed and implemented lessons and activities based on the guided-training curriculum of the program. They used the mechatronics kits provided through the RET Site and procured additional kits through their schools. The activities of student clubs were organized once or twice every week. The students actively worked on designing, programming, and testing robots.</p> <p>Several illustrative examples of academic year activities follow. (1) Mr. Rose of Trinity School was helped by his RET experience to mentor a 12-member student team, a third of them girls, for the RoboCup Jr. contest. (2) Mr. Mensah and Mr. Moore of Kappa International HS launched a robotics club with 17 boys and 23 girls who worked with: BoeBot, ActivityBot, and ActivityBots 360. (3) Ms. Mente of HS for Leadership and Public Service worked with 42 boys and 39 girls on robotics. She received 12 additional ActivityBots from her school's support, allowing her students to learn and explore how to physically build robots, code, and control the robot motion. (4) Ms. McGrath of Salk School of Science co-taught a robotics elective to 20 middle schoolers who learned to program Cyber:bot with Micro:Bit.</p> <p>The PI disseminated mechatronics and robotics educational activities through workshops and seminars. Over a dozen researchers engaged in education and research activities with project teachers. These activities broadened the training and education of research assistants, sensitizing them to the needs of K-12 constituencies and enabling them to develop a deeper understanding of the relevance of their research to K-12 STEM concepts.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/03/2021<br>      Modified by: Vikram&nbsp;Kapila</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div
