<AbstractNarration>New-World leaf-nosed bats are one of the most successful and diverse lineages of mammals. They have evolved many distinct faces and each head shape serves a different purpose. For example, bats with flat, primate-like faces eat fruit and disperse seeds. Bats with long and narrow faces consume nectar and pollinate flowers. The New-World leaf-nosed bats are an ideal group with which to test an important aspect of mammal evolution: how their heads and faces changed in appearance over time. The researchers will examine the evolution and development of uniquely shaped bat faces that allow for distinct feeding strategies in natural populations of bats by integrating museum collections, fieldwork, gene expression studies, and experiments in the laboratory. The nature of this project will foster collaborations, networking, and training among scientists from different fields of biology across several institutions plus involvement and mentoring of undergraduates. Phyllostomid bats are fascinating and charismatic animals and this combined with a close tie to the museums and their collections and exhibits will likely help the outreach efforts for providing the broader impact of this study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morphological diversity can be explained by examining evolutionary patterns in related species and characterizing developmental gene expression leading to the appearance of fundamental species-specific features. This project will: 1) quantify morphological transformations in the evolution of unique feeding strategies among phyllostomid bats, 2) compare embryonic gene expression between bats that differ in easily quantifiable characteristics, such as shortening and elongation of the cranium; and 3) evaluate mechanisms for diversification by connecting developmental change to evolutionary change. Anticipated significant developmental gene expression differences among bats will provide the foundation for testing hypotheses about the link between ontogeny and phylogeny. Specifically, gene expression changes may be experimentally replicated in bat and/or mouse embryos and the subsequent phenotypes will be examined by quantitative morphometrics to evaluate if evolutionary patterns are mimicked. This will indicate a causative connection between morphological and molecular evolutionary changes. The results of this research allow for a general understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying major diversity patterns among mammals</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Overview:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Phyllostomids are a lineage of neotropical bats unified by a leaf-shaped nose that aides in echolocation. The extreme craniofacial diversity in phyllostomid allow them to perform a variety of ecologically important functions. Bats with flat, primate-like faces eat fruit and help propagate tropical fruit trees, like peppers and figs. Bats with elongated faces drink nectar and pollinate the flowers of cocoa, mango, and banana. Both adaptations are essential for the health and stability of tropical forests. By combining quantitative morphological and molecular developmental techniques, we have identified key developmental, cellular and molecular processes that generate facial diversity.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The overall aim of this dissertation research project is to understand the adaptation process at the developmental, cellular and genetic level. To this end, we developed a field research program to study the bats in Trinidad and Tobago (TT). The 70 species of bats from TT include representatives from all nine bat families found throughout Central and South America. The high percentage of bat species (~20% of the 345 neotropical species) are contained to a geographically small area, which allow for detailed studies on bat evolution and diversity.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On the developmental side (Aim 1), we document and quantify changes occurring from an embryo to an adult by imaging the head of various species with micro-computed tomography (CT) and performed shape analysis on the 3D images. This is the first study to use both phylogeny and ontogeny to examine the directional evolutionary and developmental patterns of adaptation in&#8232; bats. The well resolved molecular phylogeny of phyllostomids greatly improves Aim 1. Our findings suggest&nbsp;cranial evolution in phyllostomid bats proceeds by peramorphosis, a phylogenetic change in development leading to a species maturing past adulthood and taking on different traits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On the cellular side, we quantify behaviors of tissue growth (proliferation, death, and differentiation) between species (Aim 2). A subset of phyllostomid species, each of which have a different head shape, were obtained from the wild. Embryos across a range of ages were obtained in May 2015-2017.These bats were used for comparative gene expression&nbsp;between embryos of different species&nbsp;using two routine laboratory techniques: histology and&nbsp;<em>in situ&nbsp;</em>hybridization.&nbsp;<em>Carollia perspicillata</em>, a fruit bat, has an &ldquo;average&rdquo; bat head;&nbsp;<em>Artibeus jamaicensis</em>, a fruit bat, has a shortened and wide head; and&nbsp;<em>Glossophaga soricina</em>, which is a nectar bat, has an elongated and narrow head. Aim 2 is the first study to investigate the underlying cellular mechanism associated with patterns of craniofacial evolution in bats. Aim 2 benefits from the phylogenetically mapped morphological differences among species in&#8232; Aim 1. Our findings suggest cartilage growth differences contribute to species-specific facial length differences.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On the genetic side, since every cell has DNA, we characterize how genes behave in cells and relate that back to differences observed between species (Aim 3).&nbsp;This aim investigates the genotype-phenotype pattern of morphological evolution by examining gene expression through functional experiments. Genetic data of pSMAD 1/5/8(9) from bats suggest BMPs may explain differences between facial length morphology &nbsp;(Aim 2). When BMP is manipulated in mouse to mimic&nbsp;<em>Glossophaga&nbsp;</em>expression, a longer-snout is produced and when BMP is manipulated in mouse to mimic&nbsp;<em>Artibeus</em>, a shorter-snout is produced.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts :&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Field sites were established through collaborations with researchers at the University of West Indies (UWI) to ensure bats are collected from large and varied populations across the entire island. Dr. Janine Seetahal (PhD Researcher), Dr. Luke Rostant (Coordinator of Biodiversity MSc), Dr. Mike G. Rutherford (Zoology Curator), and Darshan S. Narang (Biodiversity Research Consultant) have trained undergraduate, graduate and veterinary students as field assistants for this dissertation project and ensure bats are handled and sampled appropriately. Our combined efforts are important to the understanding of Trinidadian bats, their population sizes and their reproductive health. Further, embryos across a range of ages from these species were obtained in collaboration with Prof. Richard Behringer (University of Texas), Prof. John J. Rasweiler (SUNY), Prof. Veronica Martinez Cerdeno (University of California-Davis). Similarly,&nbsp;embryos from different species with different shaped heads and faces were obtained over three months of field work in Spring 2016 and 2017 (March-May). These tissues were prepared for advanced RNA-sequencing to allow for unbiased comparisons of gene expression during facial development. RNA-sequencing enhances the impact of these field studies and provides the foundation for generating informative genomic tools as part of the 1000 Bat Genome Project (Bat1K).Tissues obtained also contribute to research projects led by Dr. Karen Sears (University of California, Los Angeles), Dr. Gary Kwiecinski (University of Scranton), and Dr. ChangHee Lee (Harvard Medical School).&nbsp;All field-collected specimens will contribute to Harvard&rsquo;s physical museum collections and all micro-CT data will contribute to Harvard&rsquo;s digital museum collection.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/26/2018<br>      Modified by: Jasmin&nbsp;Camacho</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1501690/1501690_10358296_1543261270592_ScreenShot2018-11-26at2.35.58PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1501690/1501690_10358296_1543261270592_ScreenShot2018-11-26at2.35.58PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Comparative gene expression"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1501690/1501690_10358296_1543261270592_ScreenShot2018-11-26at2.35.58PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Comparative gene expression"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">BMP signaling between three species of bat that differ in facial morphology:  Artibeus (short and wide face), Carollia (average face), Glossophaga (long and narrow face).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jasmin Camacho</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jasmin&nbsp;Camacho</div> <div class="imageTitle">Comparative gene expression</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1501690/1501690_10358296_1535659529905_Trinidad_sampling_map--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1501690/1501690_10358296_1535659529905_Trinidad_sampling_map--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Productive sampling sites"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1501690/1501690_10358296_1535659529905_Trinidad_sampling_map--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Productive sampling sites"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Distribution of sampling sites throughout Trinidad from 2015-2018.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jasmin Camacho</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jasmin&nbsp;Camacho</div> <div class="imageTitle">Productive sampling sites</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1501690/1501690_10358296_1535660153926_LCM_progress_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1501690/1501690_10358296_1535660153926_LCM_progress_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="RNA isolation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1501690/1501690_10358296_1535660153926_LCM_progress_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="RNA isolation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Laser capture microdissection to capture chondrocytes.
