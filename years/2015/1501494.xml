<AbstractNarration>A 2014 report from Manpower projected that energy jobs will double by 2020, yet a "double squeeze" of an aging workforce and lack of qualified candidates contribute to talent shortages for the industry. A large majority of energy executives agreed that today's energy workforce requires a more complex skill set than it did five years ago and many indicated that today's workers require higher levels of technical competency. Richmond Community College (RCC) will expand its technician education offerings for the electric utility industry to include additional degree programs and will offer dual enrollment pathways to begin to meet industry needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a growing body of research demonstrating that dual enrollment is correlated with higher graduation rates, higher college enrollment and higher levels of persistence. This project is based on the premise that by increasing enrollment of high school students in dual enrollment pathways, RCC can increase enrollment in engineering technologies programs, increase the percentage of students entering those programs academically prepared, increase persistence rates in those programs, and thereby better meet industry demand for qualified technicians. RCC will create dual enrollment opportunities for area high school students to accelerate completion of college certificates, diplomas, and associate degrees that provide entry-level job skills. The program will strengthen pathways for secondary school students by providing faculty development and instructional resources to ensure that education and training focuses on industry-defined competencies and the latest technology. Project activities include creating two career and technical pathways focused on the electric utility industry, equipping classrooms at an area high school with up-to-date equipment, providing training for RCC faculty who teach relevant career and technical classes at the high school, and enhancing marketing and recruiting efforts by targeting high school students and those individuals likely to influence their career choice including parents, teachers, and counselors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the project, Creating Pathways to Electric Utility Careers, was to prepare students for success in an academic program focused on training highly skilled technicians for the electric power and related industries.  Specific objectives of the project included increasing the number of students in dual enrollment engineering technologies pathways; increasing the number of dual enrollment students who enroll in an engineering technologies degree program upon graduation from high school; increasing the number of students entering engineering technologies degree programs adequately prepared in math; and increasing awareness of career opportunities in the electric utility field.  The major activities of the project were to: 1) create engineering technologies dual enrollment pathways; 2) expand professional development opportunities for faculty in the Electric Utility and Substation Relay Technology (EUSRT) program; and 3) enhance career awareness activities including summer and Saturday STEM camps.  Measureable outcomes of the project include increases, from 2014 to 2018, in enrollment in dual enrollment technical pathways (93%); increases in the number of students entering an engineering technologies degree program from a dual enrollment pathway (40%); increases in the percentage of students entering the EUSRT program adequately prepared in math (22%); and increases in the number of middle and high school students participating in summer and Saturday STEM camps (257% from 2016 to 2018).   Students are entering the EUSRT program better prepared academically and that is reflected in increased retention rates.  Prior to 2018, retention (Fall to Fall) averaged 50%.  In Fall 2018, 91% of students returned for their second year.  Enhanced marketing activities that included campus tours, social media, and career fairs resulted in increased awareness of the high wage job opportunities in the electric utility industry.  STEM-focused campus tours for all 8th graders in the service area reach approximately 800 students per year.  The STEM camps provide opportunities to introduce middle and high school students, particularly underrepresented groups including women and minorities, to career opportunities in a broad range of STEM fields. In 2018, 125 students participated in the camps with half of those enrolling in more than one camp.  Project partner, Duke Energy, continues to provide curriculum input, donated equipment, and internships for students.  Additional partners were added through the course of the project including American Electrical Testing, Doble Engineering, Dominion Power, PowerGrid Engineering, Schweitzer Engineering, and TRC Solutions.  One example of the benefits of these partnerships was training and equipment related to digital protective relay systems donated by Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories.  As a result of this training, Schweitzer will give applicants from this program the highest priority for employment with the company.  Through this project we learned that attracting well-prepared students to career and technical (CTE) programs is challenging in the current public education environment in the state. Structural challenges exist to creating CTE dual enrollment pathways in engineering technology programs including scheduling, transportation, and weighted grades.  In North Carolina, CTE dual enrollment course grades are weighted less than college transfer dual enrollment course grades.  Higher performing students concerned about their overall GPA and class rank avoid CTE courses.  In addition, area high school career and technical programs are focused more on trades and less on higher skill engineering technology fields.  We found that the most effective strategies to attract adequately prepared students involved working with the high schools to increase the number of students taking college level pre-calculus algebra, targeting the marketing of engineering technology programs to students in the college transfer dual enrollment pathway, and secruing and strengthening industry partnerships that provide program support, internships, and high wage job opportunities.
