<AbstractNarration>Critical breakthroughs in science (e.g., Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, and Watson &amp; Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA), originated with those scientists' ability to think spatially, and research has shown that spatial ability correlates strongly with likelihood of entering a career in STEM.  This project will develop and study three week-long middle school lab units designed to teach spatial abilities using a blend of physical and virtual (computer-based) models. "ThinkSpace" labs will help students explore 3-dimensional astronomical phenomena (moon phases and eclipses; planetary systems around stars other than the Sun; and celestial motions within the broader universe) in ways that will support both understanding of these topics and a more general spatial ability. Students will learn both through direct work with the lab unit interface and through succeeding discussions with their peers. The research program will determine which elements in the labs best promote both spatial skills and understanding of core ideas in astronomy; and how then to optimize interactive dynamic visualizations toward these ends.  Virtual models of the sky and universe will be created using WorldWide Telescope, a free visualization tool that runs on desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices.  The ThinkSpace lab materials will be available at no cost on popular curriculum-sharing sites, including PBS Learning Media and BetterLesson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ThinkSpace team will address two main research questions: 1) How can spatial tasks that blend physical and virtual models be embedded into a STEM curriculum in ways that lead to significant improvements in spatial thinking? and 2) How can practitioners optimize design of interactive, dynamic visualizations for teaching spatially complex concepts?  The first year of the study will examine two of the lab units with four teachers and about 320 students. The second year of the study will be similar. The third year of the study will test all three lab units in 10 classrooms. Over this study, each week-long ThinkSpace Lab will be formatively tested, using pre/post written assessments of astronomy content and spatial thinking; pre/post interviews with students; and in-class video of students using the lab activities.  Scaffolded learning designs will support students in making connections between different spatial views of the phenomena, and will guide them to construct explanations and argue from evidence about how various phenomena (e.g. moon phases) arise in the real Universe, as Next Generation Science Standards demand. The impact of the ThinkSpace labs will be felt far beyond astronomy because the learning models being tested can transfer to other fields where spatial models are critical, and findings on optimization of dynamic visualizations can help to inform instructional design in the age of online learning. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.</AbstractNarration>

The curricula were designed using the following principles, which can be adopted by educators in other spatially-rich STEM disciplines:  1.  We identified the most relevant spatial skill used by experts when they reason about a topic and built in opportunities for students to practice that spatial skill, with specific examples of how to apply it. For seasons and lunar phases, we identified ?perspective taking,? the ability to imagine a scenario from multiple perspectives, as a key spatial skill needed to truly understand these astronomical concepts.  2.

This practice can help students connect those perspectives more readily in other circumstances.  3.  We had students work with both hands-on models and dynamic computer visualizations. These representations help to reduce the information students have to hold in their minds when considering the different ways a complex dynamic system behaves, which in turn allows students to undertake more complex spatial reasoning and problem-solving than without these environmental supports.  4.  We have students sketch and draw different aspects of the phenomena being studied, for example, how rays move away from the Sun and light up different parts of the Earth and Moon. This is another concrete way to help students process and make sense of spatial information.  Given its connection to STEM success, a greater emphasis on spatial thinking in K-12 science curricula can be an important component in helping young people to reach their potential and to achieve the goals set in policy documents for science literacy.
