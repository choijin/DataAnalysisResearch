<AbstractNarration>The project examines the structure and function of dynamic networks  by formulating and analyzing probabilistic models for temporally evolving networks and processes occurring on them. In addition, the project seeks practical and efficient statistical methods for network inference. The project is primarily motivated by national security concerns surrounding counter-terrorism and cybersecurity, but outcomes should be directly relevant in biological, social, and physical science applications as well as mathematical areas of probability theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cybersecurity and counter-terrorism efforts motivate three main technical objectives: (I) to establish a mathematical theory that explains both structural phenomena and temporal dependence in real world networks, (II) to develop efficient computational techniques for inferring networks from data, and (III) to analyze how structural changes affect processes that occur on networks, such as spread of disease, epidemic thresholds, and dissemination of information.  Achievement of these outcomes will rely on computational tools as well as mathematical techniques from combinatorics, algebra, percolation theory, probability, and statistics</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposed project sought to better understand networks and complex data that arise in a number of statistical and scientific application.  Toward this objective, there are three main findings from this project:  1. A better understanding of mathematical models for dynamic networks, in particular the interaction between empirical network properties and theoretical assumptions on their dynamics.  Such processes are relevant for the understanding of social networks, disease spread on networks, and other applied domains.  2. A framework for network analysis that coordinates empirical observations of sparse, complex network structures with basic statistical concepts that are necessary for scientific inference.  This framework gave rise to the PI's framework of edge exchangeability, which was introduced by the PI and coauthor in a series of articles as part of this project.  3. The initialization of follow up work in which the PI proposes a new mathematical paradigm for complex network analysis which overcomes a number of the shortcomings identified in the project.  The above accomplishments have been communicated to the scientific community and general public through published journal articles, seminars and conferences, and the PI's new book on the topic.  The PI will continue refining the ideas from this project in collaboration with researchers in other relevant substantive domains.
