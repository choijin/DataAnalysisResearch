<AbstractNarration>1511425 &lt;br/&gt;Cirino, Patrick C.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to take advantage of recent advances in genome engineering, gene sequencing, and high-throughput screening of genetic variants to isolate improved, genetically modified microorganisms. Unique combinations of genome modifications will be identified that allow engineered Escherichia coli to more efficiently convert abundant and renewable sugars derived from biomass into precursor metabolites and higher value chemical products, such as biofuels and building blocks for producing natural products. In addition to advancing understanding in sustainable biochemicals production, these research activities will yield new insights into metabolism and microbial physiology, thereby contributing broadly to many biology-related disciplines. Outreach and educational activities are also incorporated into the research plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overcoming many coordinated metabolic constraints that limit microbial biochemical production requires a large number of genetic and epistatic modifications. This research plan aims to use customized, endogenous biosensors or molecular reporters to find strains from large combinatorial genome libraries with improved production of compounds not coupled to cell growth. The focus is on screening expression level libraries of many genes at once, to enhance production through pathways that consume acetyl-CoA and NADPH (mevalonate synthesis/mevalonate sensor), malonyl-CoA (triacetic acid lactone synthesis/TAL sensor), and NADPH (xylitol production/ NADPH sensor). The same recombineered strain libraries will be combined with uniquely designed genetic backgrounds to enable the use of selections to identify new combinations of genetic modifications that show relaxed redox-based regulation and enhanced flux through non-fermentative pathways.  The targeted product molecules are directly linked to key branch points in central metabolism and precursor metabolites associated with a broad range of biochemicals. The wide variety of genomic libraries synthesized through this research will be made available to the scientific community, to be applied in selections/screens for other biosynthetic pathways of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The overarching goal of this research project was to develop and implement new &ldquo;biosensor/reporter&rdquo; tools that enable the high-throughput search for rare gene mutations that result in enhanced production of target biochemicals, using engineered <em>E. coli</em> as the host microorganism. We specifically addressed the challenge of overproducing chemicals whose biosynthesis pathways directly compete for cellular resources (carbon building blocks) needed for growth, such that one cannot anticipate that enhanced growth will correlate with enhanced chemical production. Prior to this work we had repurposed a variant of the bacterial regulatory protein AraC as a genetically-encoded sensor and reporter of the compound triacetic acid lactone (TAL). Here, we further developed our AraC-based system to serve as a sensor/reporter of several other related compounds (e.g. salicylic acid and orsellinic acid), and our novel sensor/reporter systems allowed for the identification of rare and unpredictable genetic &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; that conferred the host microorganism with an ability to produce elevated titers of the compound of interest. Gene libraries that were constructed and screened included chromosomal gene deletions and over-expressions, combinatorial enzyme-encoded gene mutations, and combinatorial libraries of ribosome binding site (RBS) sequences, for up to six genes within a single biosynthesis pathway (these screened simultaneously). Some of these accomplishments are summarized in the accompanying images.</p> <p>Intellectual Merit: Research supported by this grant has resulted in publication of three peer-reviewed research manuscripts and one peer-reviewed scientific review, with one additional research manuscript currently in preparation. Three Ph.D. theses additionally describe research supported by this grant. These publications describe the design of novel, small molecule-inducible regulatory proteins, useful not only for our own described purposes (essentially, advancing metabolic engineering), but also in the construction of new genetic circuits (synthetic biology tools), and as probes to study the biosynthesis of various natural products (enzymology tools). Given that the biosynthesis of the compounds we targeted involves precursor metabolites and metabolic bottlenecks common to a vast array of secondary metabolites, the methods demonstrated and genetic solutions identified in our work may inform and facilitate similar metabolic engineering pursuits.</p> <p>Broader Impacts: Four graduate students were trained and supported in part through this award. Two of these students have since graduated with doctorate degrees and are now productive research scientists in the U.S. biotechnology industry; their unique skillsets are a direct result of this award. Research activities enabled by this award additionally provided six undergraduate students (several from underrepresented groups in STEM) with the opportunity to receive invaluable, hands-on laboratory training in aspects of molecular biology, and to work alongside/assist graduate students in various capacities (e.g. as volunteers, research fellowship recipients, or through Federal work-study positions). &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Patrick&nbsp;C&nbsp;Cirino</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511425/1511425_10378302_1567025805470_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511425/1511425_10378302_1567025805470_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Endogenous sensor/reporters were designed for a variety of compounds"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511425/1511425_10378302_1567025805470_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Endogenous sensor/reporters were designed for a variety of compounds"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Overview of compounds for which AraC-based biosensors were generated and used in this project</div> <div class="imageCredit">PC Cirino</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Patrick&nbsp;C&nbsp;Cirino</div> <div class="imageTitle">Endogenous sensor/reporters were designed for a variety of compounds</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511425/1511425_10378302_1567026169247_Slide2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511425/1511425_10378302_1567026169247_Slide2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Further biosensor optimization undertaken for this project"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511425/1511425_10378302_1567026169247_Slide2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Further biosensor optimization undertaken for this project"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Improved biosensors with enhanced sensitivity and altered inducer/inhibitor specificity were sought and created, using directed evolution and rational protein design</div> <div class="imageCredit">PC Cirino, Z Wang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Patrick&nbsp;C&nbsp;Cirino</div> <div class="imageTitle">Further biosensor optimization undertaken for this project</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511425/1511425_10378302_1567026349898_Slide3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511425/1511425_10378302_1567026349898_Slide3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Example of how a customized biosensor was used for strain engineering, to improve production of a target chemical"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511425/1511425_10378302_1567026349898_Slide3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Example of how a customized biosensor was used for strain engineering, to improve production of a target chemical"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Using a TAL sensor/reporter, E. coli genome fragment overexpression and transposon insertion libraries were screened to identify improved TAL producers</div> <div class="imageCredit">PC Cirino, Y Li</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Patrick&nbsp;C&nbsp;Cirino</div> <div class="imageTitle">Example of how a customized biosensor was used for strain engineering, to improve production of a target chemical</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511425/1511425_10378302_1567026688191_Slide4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511425/1511425_10378302_1567026688191_Slide4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Another example in which an engineered biosensor enabled library screening for enhanced chemical biosynthesis in E. coli"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511425/1511425_10378302_1567026688191_Slide4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Another example in which an engineered biosensor enabled library screening for enhanced chemical biosynthesis in E. coli"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Using a salicylic acid (SA) sensor/reporter, RBS libraries were screened to identify improved SA producers.
