<AbstractNarration>1515671&lt;br/&gt;Bullerjahn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop: Global Solutions to Regional Problems: Collecting Global Expertise to the Problem of Harmful Algal Blooms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the Workshop is to identify the major knowledge gaps toward understanding bloom formation, detection and mitigation, along with discussion of case studies that highlight current bloom remediation efforts. Since bloom events are an increasingly global phenomena, bringing together cyanobacteria, harmful algal bloom researchers from China, Europe and Australia will provide a broad perspective on current research and mitigation strategies employed around the world. The outcome of the Workshop will be a manuscript submitted to a peer-reviewed journal that summarizes future research goals and challenges, along with current best practices for CHAB control. Overall, the Workshop will set priorities for both future research and implementation of remediation protocols. This project will not fund any international participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site of the Workshop is located in the watershed in which a cyanobacteria, harmful algal bloom event shut down the municipal water supply to 500,000 residents in August 2014. This phenomenon was widely reported in the popular press, thereby informing the general public to HAB threats. The Workshop is ideally positioned to educate the public through news media on the causes, prevention and event response to CHABs so that residents in affected areas are adequately informed. Published findings of the Workshop will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community through the peer-reviewed literature, and drafts of the Workshop manuscript will be made available to NOAA staff to help inform their strategic actions through the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act. Lastly, undergraduate students at BGSU will participate in a seminar in which Workshop findings drive the formation of a list of recommendations for regional and national cyanobacteria, harmful algal bloom control.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF Workshop on cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs), entitled "Global Solutions for Regional Problems was held on April 13-14, 2015 at Bowling Green State University.  The event brought together over 100 scientists from six countries and fifteen states to discuss current best practices used worldwide for the prevention, detection and mitigation of cyanobacterial blooms.  Additionally, knowledge gaps were identified that will set future research priorities in the field. The conference presenters and discussion leaders summarized their findings in a review paper currently in press in the journal Harmful Algae (Bullerjahn et al. 2016).  The contributions of the participants yielded a consensus that is summarized below:  1)    Long term solutions for mitigating CHABs will involve integration of multiple approaches into models &ndash; from genes to ecosystems.  To fully understand CHAB events and to predict where, when, and how intense and toxic blooms will be, integration of all areas of research from the cellular level to large spatial scales is necessary.  There is a large and growing set of approaches that is providing these new data sources, ranging from monitoring cyanobacterial gene expression by transcriptomics to high resolution remote sensing.  These emerging data sets must be integrated with more traditional data streams to create both mechanistic and quantitative models to better understand factors promoting the intensity and toxicity of CHABs.   2)    Dual nutrient management is warranted in controlling CHAB events. Whereas management strategies in freshwaters to date have traditionally focused on controlling P inputs, emerging research from across the globe has provided a wealth of data demonstrating the role N loadings can play in controlling the growth and toxicity of CHABs.  As such, N loads should be controlled to mitigate the intensity and toxicity of these events.  3)    Treatment strategies exist for acute bloom control in smaller lakes, but they can be limited by scale and by regulatory barriers.  For smaller lakes, multiple methods exist to mitigate bloom events.  As an example, the Netherlands validated the performance of dilute hydrogen peroxide as an effective algaecide specific for cyanobacteria. Similar approaches may or may not be suitable in the Great Lakes basin due to individual state regulatory guidelines.  4)    Land management decisions are central in preventing CHAB events.  CHABs are strongly controlled by nutrient loading and within large lake ecosystems, the delivery of nutrients must be restricted to control these events.  With respect to the Lake Erie watershed, the use of cover crops, buffer strips and construction of artificial wetlands divert nutrients away from lakes by supporting terrestrial biomass instead of algal biomass.  In all cases, mitigating the largest nutrient sources will always be most important for lessening CHAB intensity.  5)    Land use decisions can be incentivized.  If the costs of mitigating CHAB events are understood, economic incentives can be established to encourage agricultural practices that reduce nutrient loadings from farms.  Social scientists will play critical roles toward implementing practices and policies for CHAB prevention and mitigation.  An immediate broader impact of the workshop was the presentation of these points to the general public at a NOAA-sponsored forum immediately following the event.  Regional and national stakeholders were joined by concerned local citizens in round-table discussions (led by workshop participants) on the prevention and control of CHABs.  Second, the planning and execution of the workshop proved to be an effective educational experience for Bowling Green State University undergraduate and graduate students.  In the weeks prior to the workshop, students were enrolled in a seminar class in which the research activities of the workshop presenters and discussion leaders were discussed.  These discussions in tur...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
