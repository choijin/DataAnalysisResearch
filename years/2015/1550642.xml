<AbstractNarration>This workshop, to be held at The German University in Cairo (GUC), will be co-organized by the University of New Mexico (UNM) and the GUC to discuss a roadmap to ensure resilient infrastructure development with favorable social and environmental impacts of the anticipated mega-scale projects to take place at the new Suez Canal in Egypt. The Suez Canal region is a multi-hazard region with considerable seismic activity, an arid environment and offshore durability challenges. The workshop will be held in December 18-20, 2015, a few months after the opening the new Suez Canal in Egypt (anticipated in August 2015). The two and half-day workshop will include an organized visit by all workshop attendees to the new Suez Canal followed by workshop activities to take place at the GUC. The workshop selection committee, led by the PI, will select 15 distinguished members from US academia and industry to participate with Egyptian counterparts to deliver presentations and engage in discussion panels. The PIs will emphasize participation of experts from underrepresented groups in science and engineering specifically women, minorities,and people with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned mega-scale infrastructure development of the new Suez Canal region represents a unique opportunity for the scientific community to participate positively in economic development and global economic growth. This workshop represents an unique opportunity for US researchers to test and validate research concepts and methods on realistic field conditions for a case study with significant challenge. The challenge is manifested by the multi-hazards necessary to consider in design including significant seismic activity, poor soil conditions, offshore construction durability and potentially rising water in the Canal due to climate change. In addition, successful development is challenged by the need to carefully mitigate potential negative environmental impacts. Finally, careful planning is necessary to cultivate positive socio-economic impacts. Discussing these challenges and developing a roadmap for successful development of such strategic international facility will be of immense value to Egypt and the international community. Involvement of US academia and industrial experts in such challenging development through discussions, observations and potential involvement in collaborative research opportunities, offers a unique opportunity for synthesis of lessons learned from the Suez Canal region development for future projects in similar areas in the US and internationally.</AbstractNarration>
