<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) Projects explore the viability of new kinds of learning technologies by designing and building new kinds of learning technologies and studying their possibilities for fostering learning and challenges to using them effectively. This project seeks to understand, and capitalize on, how teachers or tutors build rapport with learners by building technologies that support rapport. Research will study what rapport with learners looks like, when students deploy rapport techniques, when and how deploying rapport techniques (whether by people or automated agents) increases learning, and how rapport evolves over time. The project will build software that can help measure rapport between learners and with computers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will begin by building a multimodal sensing rapport-detection system , based on recent advances in computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning which will automatically recognize audio and visual behaviors during learner interaction with an intelligent tutoring system. Human-human tutoring interactions will be used to guide development of the rapport detection system. Both short term and longitudinal analyses will be conducted using students working with an AI-based math tutor, focused on their visual behaviors (head gaze estimation will be used to measure facial action units and gestures like head nods or shakes, and mutual gaze between humans), verbal behaviors (using CoreNLP and other software to detect verbal utterances that represent rapport-related social constructs such as politeness, friendship, etc.), and entrainment behaviors (synchrony or asynchrony, divergence and convergence). The project will then design RAPT, the Rapport-Aligned Peer Tutor, which encompasses both the rapport detection system and an intelligent pedagogical agent that accounts for the persistent social states of rapport and non-rapport. Mockups/simulations of the interface will be used to test the designs before the full pedagogical agent is built. Trials will be conducted in 9-11 grade classrooms working with an intelligent geometry tutor using a two-iteration design-based research study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Partners in Learning project improved our understand on how interpersonal rapport is built and maintained between dyads of peer tutors, to identify the effects of that rapport on the process of tutoring and on learning gains, and to design a virtual tutoring agent that leverages the impact of rapport to lead to benefits in peer tutoring. The outcomes of this project span three main research areas: (1) Theory of Role of Rapport in Peer Tutoring where the goal was to to understand whether and how the rapport between a peer tutor and tutee provides a social infrastructure to the tutoring interaction, (2) Computational Model of Rapport-Building where the goal was to understand the temporal dynamics of the verbal and nonverbal process by which rapport is established in dyads of peer tutors and tutees, and (3) Rapport-Building Peer Tutoring System where the goal was to incorporate theory and computational models into the design and development of a virtual peer algebra tutoring agent.  A first key outcomes for the theory of rapport in peer tutoring systems is the extension of methods from sequence mining and temporal association rules to identify the      core clustered sequences of tutoring and learning behaviors associated      with high- and low-rapport time windows. We identified a relationship      between rapport and improved learning gains and problem-solving, and found      that a set of instructional moves related to help-offering by the tutor      were highly impacted by the rapport and associated with problem-solving. We identified the role of      self-efficacy and prior knowledge in impacting the use and efficacy      tutoring behaviors such as tutors’ help-offering and tutees’      self-explanations. For the computational modeling of rapport, we developed novel classifiers for social conversational strategies such as hedging, integrating these into our overall rapport detection and social reasoning computational models.   These advances in theories and computational modeling were integrated in a peer tutoring system. We developed and iterated on the design of an interactive Algebra problem-solving interface to automatically evaluate learners’ step-level correctness. We also developed a learner model to model each students’ skill mastery on knowledge components and an animated virtual agent, with feedback from participants from the target demographics.

An important aspect of this system was a reinforcement learning method to select the next appropriate pedagogical action by the virtual tutor, given the current rapport level with the tutee and the learners’ social behaviors.  Automated discovery of behavioral rules in dyadic interaction that map onto high or low rapport can play a fundamental role in building socially-aware agents that adapt to the rapport level felt by their users in ways that previous work has not addressed. Our work impacts psychology and social-science disciplines by augmenting previous expert hand-crafted rules for interpersonal rapport building, learning on verbal and nonverbal annotations of a particular corpus, but employing only the annotations of conversational strategies that are domain-independent.  Our work, which leverages the potential synergistic effect of interaction across visual, vocal and verbal modalities, can be applied for prediction of other social phenomena of interest in virtual agent systems, in domains as diverse as survey interviewing, sales, and health.
