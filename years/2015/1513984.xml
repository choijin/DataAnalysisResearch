<AbstractNarration>The Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences offers postdoctoral research fellowships to provide opportunities for recent doctoral graduates to obtain additional training, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond their undergraduate and graduate training. Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising interdisciplinary scholar studying ochre pigments from Stone Age archaeological sites. Understanding the potential significance and meaning of ancient symbolism has been enhanced by novel geochemical techniques for provenance studies of ochre, particularly minimally destructive trace element fingerprinting. This study builds on these methods by adapting iron, strontium, and lead stable isotope analysis to geologic sources used by traditional societies in Kenya today, and to ochre artifacts and rock art paint samples. Multi-isotope analysis can improve the accuracy of provenance identification, and also contribute to our understanding of the geologic mechanisms of ochre deposit formation. Finally, information provided by indigenous people who currently use ochre will allow us to learn more about their pigment source preferences, criteria for raw material selection, techniques of pigment preparation, and symbolic meanings associated with geologic sources, rock art images, and pigmented artifacts. Enhanced understanding of modern ochre use and its meanings will shed new light on the evolution of human symbolism from the Stone Age to present day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communicating information and identity with symbols is an essential attribute of our species. Humans have used red and yellow ochre pigments for symbolic expression for hundreds of thousands of years. However, rock art and other practices involving these iron-based pigments are understudied in the modern era. Research on this rapidly vanishing form of cultural heritage is thus critical to understanding the origins of symbolism. This project bridges archaeology, ethnography, and geochemistry to investigate ochre use. First, recent rock art sites and the ochre deposits used for pigments will be identified through collaboration with modern rock art painters. Geochemical techniques will then be used to characterize the ochre deposits, and to match them to paint samples from rock art sites and ochre artifacts from archaeological sites. This approach will facilitate verification of the sources of rock art pigments identified from ethnographic information. This project will refine minimally destructive analytical methods that can be used for ochre pigments and other iron-containing materials. Improving methods to determine geologic sources of ochre pigments has significant implications for identifying looted heritage items, forgeries, and for stemming the illicit antiquities trade that endangers tangible culture and fuels conflict around the world.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Dr. Andrew Zipkin has completed his postdoctoral fellowship for &ldquo;Integrating geochemistry and ethnography to understand modern and ancient ochre use&rdquo;.&nbsp; During his tenure as an NSF SBE Interdisciplinary Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Zipkin was mentored by Prof. Stanley Ambrose in ethnoarchaeology and Prof. Craig Lundstrom in geochemistry.&nbsp; Dr. Zipkin conducted field work in Kenya in 2015 with Prof. Ambrose to sample geological sources of ochre pigments throughout the Kenya Rift Valley and to collect ethnographic information about the modern uses of mineral pigments by Maasai, Samburu, and Dorobo herding and hunting peoples, in collaboration with National Museum of Kenya staff from the Archaeology and Cultural Heritage departments. From the fall of 2015 through spring of 2017, Dr. Zipkin conducted geochemical method development research and analyzed the isotopic and elemental composition of ochre source samples, ancient pigment artifacts, and modern rock art paint samples in the laboratory of Prof. Lundstrom.</p> <p>The overarching objective of this research was to develop new transdisciplinary approaches at the intersection of archaeology, ethnography, geology, and chemistry to shed light on human symbolic behavior using ochre mineral pigments.&nbsp; Naturally occurring red and yellow iron-rich mineral pigments are among the most ubiquitous materials used by humans for symbolic purposes. They occur in archaeological and rock art sites, and are still used traditionally, worldwide. &nbsp;This research focused on Kenya because of the rich cultural record of ochre use from three hundred thousand years ago through the present, and the widespread availability of geological deposits of ochre pigments.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Zipkin&rsquo;s postdoctoral project approached the use mineral pigments from the perspective of ochre as a collected, transported, and traded part of material culture rather than simply a vehicle for symbolic activities.&nbsp; By using geochemical methods to &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo; ochre sources and artifacts, it was possible to distinguish among dozens of geologic sources at the regional and local scale and to assign cultural ochre to its source of origin.&nbsp; This in turn allow him to investigate which sources of ochre were preferentially exploited, how humans moved pigments around the landscape, where such pigments were used for applications like rock art painting, and to interpret the &ldquo;site biography&rdquo; of symbolically important places like painted rock shelters.&nbsp; One particularly important archaeological finding was the discovery that the ochre buried with bodies at the Njoro River Cave Neolithic mass cremation site was derived from sources 100 to 150 km to the south, despite the presence of now popular high-quality pigment sources only 20 to 35 kilometers away.&nbsp; This suggested a strong symbolic motivation to transport large quantities of ochre over long distances rather than more efficiently exploiting nearby sources. Dr. Zipkin&rsquo;s field work with Prof. Ambrose and the Kenyan ethnographer Mercy Gakii also produced important new ethnographic information. &nbsp;Nearly a dozen previously unreported Maa language terms for different varieties of ochre, and many undocumented kinds of ochre use practices were recorded, especially regarding rock art painting and personal adornment.&nbsp; Rock art ethnographic information is important because many informants stated that rock art painting is dying out as younger generations adopt Western education and abandon traditional cultural practices.</p> <p>Regarding the broader impacts of this project, Dr. Zipkin&rsquo;s fellowship afforded him further training and career growth opportunities beyond his doctoral dissertation research and allowed him in turn to train junior researchers in relevant methods.&nbsp; The two students most impacted by this project were Mr. Matthew Magnani of Harvard University (graduate student), who conducted three seasons of ethnographic field work in Kenya, and Ms. Alyssa Dwyer of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (undergraduate), who was trained by Dr. Zipkin as a geochemical laboratory technician.&nbsp; Ms. Dwyer has since completed her degree and is employed as a professional analytical chemist.&nbsp; Two members of the National Museums of Kenya also gained new ethnoarchaeological and geological research experience and skills.</p> <p>From a method development perspective, this research led to three outcomes that are transferrable to other fields.&nbsp; First, Dr. Zipkin and colleagues refined a less expensive and less dangerous technique for preparing geological samples for strontium isotope analysis than the standard method of hydrofluoric acid dissolution.&nbsp; This method, aqua regia leaching, has been presented at multiple conferences with the objective of reducing technical and safety hazard barriers to conducting analytical geochemistry research.&nbsp; Second, this research addressed a previously overlooked instrumental analysis problem with strontium isotope measurements of geological samples that can lead to erroneous results unless more intensive sample purification methods are used.&nbsp; Finally, refining laboratory methods to obtain trace elemental and isotopic data from minimally or nondestructive sampling will make source provenience technology more widely available, including for authentication of provenance/chain of custody by art conservators and law enforcement agencies seeking to stem the sale of looted antiquities, and for other forensic analyses that require high precision chemical fingerprinting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/12/2017<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;M&nbsp;Zipkin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1513984/1513984_10362549_1502441643967_Figure2-Color--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1513984/1513984_10362549_1502441643967_Figure2-Color--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Photographs of some ochre sources sampled and analyzed for this project."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1513984/1513984_10362549_1502441643967_Figure2-Color--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Photographs of some ochre sources sampled and analyzed for this project."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">a.

Ms. Dwyer has since completed her degree and is employed as a professional analytical chemist.  Two members of the National Museums of Kenya also gained new ethnoarchaeological and geological research experience and skills.  From a method development perspective, this research led to three outcomes that are transferrable to other fields.  First, Dr. Zipkin and colleagues refined a less expensive and less dangerous technique for preparing geological samples for strontium isotope analysis than the standard method of hydrofluoric acid dissolution.  This method, aqua regia leaching, has been presented at multiple conferences with the objective of reducing technical and safety hazard barriers to conducting analytical geochemistry research.  Second, this research addressed a previously overlooked instrumental analysis problem with strontium isotope measurements of geological samples that can lead to erroneous results unless more intensive sample purification methods are used.  Finally, refining laboratory methods to obtain trace elemental and isotopic data from minimally or nondestructive sampling will make source provenience technology more widely available, including for authentication of provenance/chain of custody by art conservators and law enforcement agencies seeking to stem the sale of looted antiquities, and for other forensic analyses that require high precision chemical fingerprinting.
