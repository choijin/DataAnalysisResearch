<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Blue Heron, an 86 foot Coastal Vessel owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by the Large Lakes Observatory as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Large Lakes Observatory operates the largest university-owned research vessel on the Great Lakes, the R/V Blue Heron. Built in 1985 for fishing on the Grand Banks, the Blue Heron was purchased by the University of Minnesota in 1997, sailed from Portland, Maine, up the St. Lawrence Seaway to Duluth, and converted into a limnological research vessel during the winter of 1997-98. She is outfitted with state-of-the-art research equipment, has berthing for 11 crew and scientists, and can operate 24 hours per day for up to 21 days in between port calls. The Blue Heron is part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and is available for charter by research scientists on any of the Great Lakes. In 2014, the vessel completed 54 funded days where 45 (7%) were for NSF. In 2015, Blue Heron is currently scheduled for 47 days, 13 of these (189%) will be for NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;1) Searchlights/Thermal Camera $32,646&lt;br/&gt;2) Block                             $9,155&lt;br/&gt;3) UPS system upgrade          $39,763&lt;br/&gt;     $81,564&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Minnesota Duluth purchased the following equipment for the research vessel Blue Heron using funds provided in the National Science Foundation award OCE-1526323 'University of Minnesota Duluth RV Blue Heron SSSE 2015?: a new block, a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) for our below-deck laboratory, two searchlights, and tensiometers for our winch wire monitoring system.   This wide range of equipment will help the scientists on board the vessel and increase the safety of everyone that uses the R/V Blue Heron.     The new equipment was necessary for the following reasons: 1) the old block pinched the wire rope that we use to deploy scientific instrumentation and potentially damaged the rope.  The new block will ensure that our wire rope will last longer; 2) the new UPS replaces the multiple home UPS units we were using in our lower laboratory.  This new UPS not only ensures that the researchers using the vessel have power during any possible outages, but also allows our Captain to shut down power to the lower laboratory in case of a fire; 3) one of the two searchlights replaces our 30 year old forward-looking searchlight, while the second new searchlight gives us rear-facing searchlight capabilities, something we did not have before.  This will help during night-time science operations and help to recovery anyone who falls into the water at night; 4) the new tensiometers and additional equipment for our winch wire monitoring system allows us to measure the amount of tension we have on our wire rope therefore preventing any wire rope failures.     All of this gear is available to all users of the R/V Blue Heron, including the three National Science Foundation funded projects that are occurring in 2017.  Besides the NSF funded projects, we are supporting several other science projects in 2017: an Office of Naval Research funded cruise, multiple Great Lakes Observing System (NOAA) cruises, a State of Minnesota Department of Natural Resources cruise, and multiple research and educational cruises funded by the University of Minnesota.  Regarding the educational cruises, the University of Minnesota is funding eight cruises in 2017, which will expose close to 200 undergraduates to scientific research on the Great Lakes.  As stated above, all of the equipment purchased using the award 'University of Minnesota Duluth RV Blue Heron SSSE 2015? (OCE-1526323) is available for use on all of these cruises.
