<AbstractNarration>Abstract (Collaborative) &lt;br/&gt;PI: Zheng, Guoan &lt;br/&gt;Proposal:1510077 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: DiMarzio, Charles &lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1510280 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a new prototype microscope of ultra-high sensitivity with super-high resolution, yet with the ability to provide 3D imaging at a large field-of-view and rapid imaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal aims to develop a new type of microscopy technique, (coded-illumination Fourier ptychography), that incorporates the innovations of novel Fourier data recovery, structured illumination for tissue sectioning, multi-layer modeling, and spectrum multiplexing. Iteration across data acquisitions is used to optimize to a final image solution. Increased image dimensionality, either spectral or spatial, is a highly desired commodity. If these techniques can be made routine, then many areas of microscopy could benefit. The proposal reflects substantial outreach to women and significant educational efforts towards graduates and undergraduates. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The resolution of an optical microscope is normally limited to a fraction of the optical wavelength as a result of diffraction. In recent years Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) has been employed to surpass this fundamental limit. SIM is one of several techniques called super-resolution.  A further challenge is to section tissue optically; that is to image at only a single depth.  In our first significant accomplishment we used a set of random illumination patterns to achieve sectioning and super-resolution simultaneously in human skin.  Figure 1 shows an image of skin under ordinary illumination on the left and a processed image using what we call Cascaded Random Intensity Illumination (CRII) obtained by combining 80 individual images on the right. In the processed image it is possible to see individual details of skin structure at a depth of about 50 micrometers.  Although we obtained the desired improvements, as many as 80 different patterns were required, which increased the imaging time beyond what would be useful for in-vivo imaging.   Our second accomplishment used the mathematical technique of a Spiral Hilbert Transform on a simple structured pattern to obtain an optical section from a single image.  Most SIM approaches combine at least three images with different illumination patterns to obtain super-resolution.  If the goal is only to obtain sectioning, we have developed a single-image structured illumination microscopy (SISIM) technique, as shown in Figure 2.  In Panel A, we see an image of skin without SIM, where light from the desired depth is combined with that from other depths and contrast is reduced.  In B we see a conventional SIM image which suffers from serious artifacts because pulsatile blood flow and breathing introduce motion during the acquisition of three images.  The three images are of slightly different objects and thus cannot be combined correctly. Using SISIM yields a better image as shown in C, at a sufficient speed to avoid motion artifacts, making this a useful technique for in-vivo imaging.  We have also used a registration algorithm to combine multiple SISIM images to improve the contrast (D).  We observed that many biological samples exhibit a punctuate structure with many small points at or below the resolution limit of optical microscopy.  Such objects are not easily imaged with either of the techniques above.  In particular, we were working with a collaborator on an unrelated project to image the growth and organization of collagen.  Our collaborator was interested in determining the orientation of collagen monomers as they attach to newly forming fibrils as shown in the cartoon in Figure 3.  He proposed attaching two fluorescent tags to a monomer and determining the direction of a line from one to the other as shown in the magnified region.  The problem is that the tags attach at random locations along the monomer, and are often spaced by less than the resolution limit.  We developed a technique we call Structured--Illumination Point--Separation (SIPS) Microscopy, to process three images into a complex image as shown in the lower right.  The phase of this image shown in the right-most picture clearly indicates the orientation.  We have tested the technique on simulated data and in a few cases on a laboratory model. In simulations the technique is robust with respect to noise and to small separation of the fluorescent tags.  Our experimental work was interrupted by COVID-19, but has now resumed and we anticipate being able to determine the orientation of a large fraction of the monomers reliably.
