<AbstractNarration>SES- 1530714&lt;br/&gt;Jody Miller&lt;br/&gt;Rod Brunson&lt;br/&gt;Rutgers University Newark&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-1530728&lt;br/&gt;Ruth Peterson&lt;br/&gt;Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal continues the successful collaboration of a group of scholars from diverse backgrounds (African American, Asian, Latino, and White), disciplines (Criminology or Criminal Justice, Family Relations, Law, Public Policy, Political Science, Social Work, and Sociology), and stages of career (assistant-, associate-, and full-professors, and graduate students) whose work is oriented to (1) broadening perspectives and participation in research on crime and criminal justice, and (2) improving the quality of research on the interlinkages among race/ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice.  These scholars (the Racial Democracy, Crime and Justice Network, RDCJN) established a Summer Research Institute (SRI) and annual summer workshops as vehicles for pursuing these goals.  The group has achieved a number of important successes that include graduating 68 young scholars from the nine SRIs held thus far.  These faculty are publishing and gaining tenure.  Indeed, 33 of the 68 have attained tenure, and many more will join this group over the next few years.  Thus, the project is actively "participation" in STEM fields in an area with significant underrepresentation of minority scholars.   Specifically, the extent of underrepresentation of scholars of color within criminology and criminal justice is relatively high. Among American Society of Criminology (ASC) members who report their race/ethnicity, just 5.6% are Black; 5.1% are Latino/a; 5.8% are Asian; 1% are American Indian, and 1.4% identify as ?other.?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides fostering the academic career success of young faculty from underrepresented groups, the Racial Democracy, Crime and Justice Network has undertaken activities to improve research on the interrelationships among race/ethnicity, crime and criminal justice.  The group has developed a comprehensive research agenda and undertaken collaborative projects to address the issues posed.  Their efforts also include working to publish in mainstream sources so that the perspectives of underrepresented faculty become integrated into the mainstream of literature on crime and justice problems.  Given their unique backgrounds, experiences, and vantage points on crime and criminal justice, members of underrepresented groups bring alternative perspectives, approaches, and types of data to bear in studying these topics.  To the extent that such alternative approaches shed light on criminal offending and victimization, the operations of criminal justice agencies, and the treatment of different groups within the criminal justice system, it is important that they be included in the mainstream of disciplines.  Such inclusion fosters understanding of the sources and consequences of crime and the criminal justice processing of suspects, defendants, and offenders, and contributes to the successful careers among underrepresented scholars.. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RDCJN goals are to continue to (1) advance the research and professional development of young scholars from underrepresented groups for carrying out innovative research, and thereby foster democratic inclusion in academe; and (2) undertake additional collaborative projects that provide a more complete understanding of the interrelationships among race/ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice.  These goals are interrelated.  Improving understanding of crime and justice requires bringing the unique perspectives and methods of underrepresented groups to bear by democratizing academe.  The annual RDCJN workshops integrate the SRI faculty into a national network of scholars, while also:  facilitating progress in exploring a national research agenda on the study of race/ethnicity, crime and justice; yielding volumes of studies (6 so far) that enhance understanding of this topic and bring the work produced by underrepresented scholars into mainstream outlets; promoting the development of collaborative projects by participants; and enhancing the professional development of diverse young scholars who participate in the RDCJN, but not the SRI.</AbstractNarration>

Below, I discuss, in turn, the activities undertaken and  outcomes of our work regarding each objective.  First, towards  broadening participation, during each year (2016, 2017, 2018) of the  grant we held a 3-week Crime and Justice Summer Research Institute  (SRI).  We worked with 24 (8 per year) young faculty (called Fellows) to  provide tools for succeeding in research endeavors and in academe:  (a)  working with senior faculty mentors to develop research publications or  grant proposals; (b) attending professional development workshops  geared to survival within the university; (c) presenting and gaining  feedback on research during a culminating conference (the Racial  Democracy, Crime and Justice Network [RDCJN] Workshop); and, (d)  becoming integrated into the national network of scholars making up the  RDCJN.  The project has been very productive:  Young faculty credit the project with helping them achieve career goals.   The 24 Fellows remain in academe and are quite productive.   Four Fellows have published scholarly books; two received prestigious national book awards. Fellows  published 66 refereed journal articles following their participation in  the SRI, for an average of 22 articles per cohort and 2.8 per Fellow.  Numerous Fellows attained external grants and awards for their scholarship and/or service to their universities or communities.   Second,  RDCJN participants worked collaboratively to facilitate and produce  scholarship aimed at: (a) enhancing understanding of how race,  ethnicity, crime, and justice are related; (b) fostering a research  agenda to address unanswered questions related to this issue; and, (c)  highlighting the contributions of underrepresented scholars to  criminological thinking and research. Two accomplishments are  illustrative.  First, three former SRI Fellows edited a volume of papers  highlighting New Approaches to Research on Prisoner Reentry and Reintegration (NYU  Press, 2020). This volume was the outgrowth of a collaboration project  (and workshop) begun during a prior grant period; it brings to seven the  number of volumes produced by network members. Second, during the grant  period, I served as President of the American Society of Criminology  (ASC).

(See 2017 Criminology 55[2]: 245-272.)  Further, I collaborated with my program committee  co-chairs, also members of the RDCJN, to develop a special issue of the Du Bois Review (Spring 2018), entitled Color Matters:...,  which makes for an eighth volume relying largely on scholarship by  RDCJN members, and addressing the aims of this NSF-funded project.  Third,  we worked to create a pipeline to graduate school among undergraduate  students from underrepresented groups through the activities of a REU.  In total, 18 undergraduate students at six different universities, five  of them minority-serving institutions, participated.  To stimulate  undergraduates interest in and readiness for graduate school, our  central activities included: (a) workshops on graduate school  preparation and navigating graduate programs; (b) students planning and  executing original crime and justice research under the tutelage of  established faculty-including former SRI Fellows; (c) participants  preparing for, presenting, and gaining feedback on a poster summarizing  the research during the annual RDCJN Workshop; and (d) students  attending and presenting revised (based on feedback from the RDCJN  presentation) versions of posters at a subsequent ASC meeting.  It is  too early to determine our success in creating a pipeline, but there are  multiple indicators that the project has been productive:   Students express enjoying the experience, learning from it, and having their interest in research piqued;  Two students have enrolled in graduate school; two others are considering doing so;  The poster presentations were well received at both venues; and, Members  of earlier cohorts actively participated in follow-up RDCJN Workshops,  and, actively supported their first-time participant colleagues. They  also seemed to identify positively with one another.   Overall,  the SRI and RDCJN provide models of success for members of  underrepresented groups, contribute to the long-term presence of  underrepresented faculty within academe, and provide quality insights  regarding race, ethnicity, crime, and justice that inform the crime and  justice knowledge base.  The REU exposes students to experiences that:  help them develop research skills and knowledge of crime and justice;  inform their post-college choices; and, potentially increase their  likelihood of seeking graduate training.
