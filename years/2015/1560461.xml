<AbstractNarration>The University of Wyoming will host a summer REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) site in Astronomy. Each summer, eight students will work together on the same research project, mentored by the entire astronomy faculty.  In addition to the research experience, this will promote teamwork, leadership, and peer teaching skills.  They will also attend presentations or short courses on research techniques and results, preparing for graduate school, writing and speaking in science, exploring ethical issues in science.  Students will develop broadly-applicable skills in computer programming and image analysis.  This program will benefit society by enhancing the education of undergraduates through research and professional development programs and by extending these opportunities to students from institutions otherwise unable to offer such experiences.  Recruiting will focus on students with little to no research experience, mainly freshmen and sophomores from liberal arts colleges and smaller public institutions, including community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will have full access to the 2.3-meter and the 0.6-meter telescopes. The specific project and lead faculty member will rotate each summer.  Other faculty will play supporting roles and conduct professional development programs for the students.   REU students will have an opportunity to gain valuable outreach experience by assisting with AstroCamp, a 10-day residence camp for middle-school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Wyoming astronomy REU program recruited and nurtured 26 STEM undergraduates during the summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018.  Our program is unique in two ways.  First, we run the only collaborative astronomy REU program.  Each summer our cohort learns and works as a team on a single science project.  Second, we are observing-intensive, with each summer cohort spending an average of 53 nights on our 2.3m telescope.  Over the course of 10 weeks our students learn about cutting-edge astronomy science, become proficient ground-based observers, experience several seminars that aim to prepare them for their post-baccalaureate lives, and develop skills in teamwork, leadership, and peer teaching.  Though we run a collaborative program, the students develop tremendous "ownership" in their work.  Not only do the students ultimately focus their analysis on their own subset of the larger sample, students develop true ownership by being able to experience nearly all facets of astronomy research: sample selection, observational data-taking, data processing and analysis, and a culminating poster presentation at a national meeting of professional astronomers.  Our targeted demographic is a student who has little to no research experience, such as undergraduates from liberal arts and community colleges.  Moreover, though our applicant pool is typically two-thirds male, we take care to bring in equal numbers of females and males.
