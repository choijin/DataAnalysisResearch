<AbstractNarration>Computational Geometry is a branch of the theory of computer science that studies algorithms for problems best stated in geometric form.  The problems arise from applications in Geographic Information Systems, robotics, computer-aided design &amp; manufacturing, computer graphics, data analytics and visualization, molecular modeling, engineering simulation, etc. Computational Geometry was a young field in 1986 when Goodmann and Pollack (NYU) launched what would become the flagship journal, "Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry," with a scientific conference in Santa Cruz.  It, and follow-up conferences at Mt. Holyoke (1996), Monte Verita (1999), and Snowbird (2006), had a huge impact in defining and directing the field.  This project supports US participants, mainly young researchers, in a scientific conference, "A New Era of Discrete and Computational Geometry," at the ETH Zurich seminar center Monte Verita, in Ascona, Switzerland. It is fitting to revisit Monte Verita in 2016 to review this field's history and look to its future; junior researchers especially will benefit -- learning context from the review, and becoming equipped to create the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joint support from NSF's office of International Science and Engineering and from Computer and Information Science and Engineering broadens the opportunity for US-based participants.</AbstractNarration>
