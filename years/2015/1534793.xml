<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to allow a greater number of organizations, businesses, and individuals to access shortwave infrared (SWIR) imaging technology. Modern SWIR technology has existed for more than 40 years, but its expense has limited its use to the military and large corporations; this project is grounded in the belief that when everyone has access to SWIR technology, the benefits to society are exponential.  SWIR image sensors have potential applications in food safety analysis (e.g., identifying harmful adulterated foods and revealing sub-surface flaws in produce), manufacturing (e.g., sorting), security (e.g., night vision), medical sensing (e.g., vein mapping and blood oxygenation monitoring), and the automotive field (e.g., night/inclement weather vision systems and for self-driving vehicles). A low-cost sensor will open the SWIR imaging market to players in these fields who have so far been shut out due to price. In addition, a low-cost, high-quality sensor will also make SWIR imaging directly available to the general public for the first time ever in the form of a SWIR camera smartphone add-on, establishing a new market for SWIR imaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will produce low-cost germanium (Ge)-based shortwave infrared (SWIR) image sensors with features superior to those of currently available SWIR sensors. The research objective is to resolve issues of resolution, power usage, size, and sensitivity that limit advancement in the SWIR imaging field. This project will address these problems by utilizing a unique Ge-based SWIR sensor structure. In addition, a monolithic method of integrating the image sensor material onto the Si readout integrated circuit will be pursued. This will enable precise alignment of the readout integrated circuit  and the imaging device, which will lead to smaller pixel size and better resolution. Finally, issues of power use and sensitivity will be addressed through an innovative structure called Gate-controlled Charge Modulate Device. Research will focus on refining and improving the fabrication processes necessary to reliably produce low-cost, high-quality Ge-based SWIR image sensors.</AbstractNarration>

The research objective is to resolve issues of power usage and cost that limit advancement in the SWIR imaging field. This project will address these problems by utilizing a unique Ge-based SWIR sensor structure, which employs a monolithic method of integrating the image sensor material (Ge) onto the silicon read-out integrated circuit (ROIC).</p> <p>Compare to conventional SWIR sensor based on indium-gallium-arsenide (InGaAs), Ge-based sensor doesn&rsquo;t require an expensive bump-bonding process to Si ROIC. Such difference results not only in the cost but also in the production yield, hence the price of the sensors. Our Ge sensors will cost &lt;$1,000 compared to InGaAs sensors&rsquo; $10,000 up to $100,000 price point. On top of the cost advantage, Ge sensors are smaller and consumes less power. For this reason, the Ge sensor fits ideally for portable SWIR imaging solutions.</p> <p>During the NSF SBIR Phase I and Phase II funding periods, we have worked toward our goals of forming a plateau-shaped Ge-islands on silicon (Si) complementary metal&ndash;oxide&ndash;semiconductor (CMOS) ready read-out integrated circuit (ROIC) and refining the fabrication process of our innovative and unique sensor structure, gate-controlled charge modulate device (GCMD). We have demonstrated a mini-array of Ge-based SWIR sensor with the GCMD structure during the funding period, and we plan on launching the world&rsquo;s first portable, affordable, and smartphone-compatible SWIR camera, BeyonSense<sup>&reg;</sup> Pre (an 11x8 array Ge-based SWIR sensor/camera) by the end of the year 2019. Furthremore, we have filed nine patents related to our Ge-based SWIR sensor and optics design, and four patents were issued worldwide, including Japan, China, and the United States. We will continue our research and will launch BeyonSense<sup>&reg;</sup> 1 (128x128 array Ge-based SWIR sensor/camera) by mid-2020 as well.</p> <p>Stratio, Inc. has two products: LinkSquare<sup>&reg;</sup> (linksquare.io) and BeyonSense<sup>&reg; </sup>(beyonsense.io). &nbsp;LinkSquare is a pocket-sized spectrometer that will be a unique addition to the spectroscopy industry for its significant innovation in performance, cost, and size. LinkSquare analyzes the light that is reflected off an object to determine the &ldquo;spectral fingerprint&rdquo; of that object. Paired wirelessly with a smartphone app, LinkSquare can help check the quality of food, ascertain the truthfulness of product information and determine the properties of materials. LinkSquare<sup>&reg;</sup> 1 detects visible and near infrared light (400&ndash;1000 nm), delivering high resolutions of color analysis, as well as near infrared capabilities. Once equipped with our Ge-based SWIR sensor to empower SWIR capabilities (800&ndash;1600 nm), LinkSquare<sup>&reg;</sup> SWIR, our next version, will be able to deliver the lab science from medical sensing/imaging to state-of-the-art healthcare to biohazardous chemicals and explosives detection into the palm of your hand at an affordable price.</p> <p>BeyonSense<sup>&reg;</sup> is the world&rsquo;s first portable, affordable, and smartphone-compatible SWIR camera. The smartphone-compatible BeyonSense<sup>&reg;</sup> will incorporate our proprietary Ge-based SWIR sensor and bring the SWIR camera technology to everyday use &ndash; night vision, pest control, food inspection, medical imaging, security cameras, you name it.</p> <p>We have received a number of inquiries from large corporations seeking affordable and portable SWIR solutions. We promised to a few corporations that we would provide the first batch of our SWIR sensors to run pilot tests for their industry-specific applications. We plan to expedite our conversations with potential partners once we have our product to tap new markets, including food sorting ($1B), night vision ($5B), and IoT and wearables ($3T).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/06/2019<br>      Modified by: Jae-Hyung&nbsp;Lee</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1534793/1534793_10386924_1573099159565_[Main]BeyonSensewithanIRink--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1534793/1534793_10386924_1573099159565_[Main]BeyonSensewithanIRink--rgov-800width.jpg" title="BeyonSense with a brochure printed with infrared ink"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1534793/1534793_10386924_1573099159565_[Main]BeyonSensewithanIRink--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="BeyonSense with a brochure printed with infrared ink"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A handheld infrared camera with germanium (Ge)-based Short Wavelength Infrared (SWIR) image sensor, which can detect the wavelength from 800nm to 1,600nm.
