<AbstractNarration>The Big Data era has given rise to data of unprecedented size and complexity.  However, fully leveraging Big Data resources for knowledge and discovery is an open challenge due to the fact that conventional methods of data processing and analysis often fail or are inappropriate.  This project develops an innovative approach that utilizes Big Data to improve the classification of mood disorders for the purpose of improving diagnosis and outcomes for psychiatric patients.  Big Data issues are inherently more severe for mental disorders because of their elusive nature.  The psychiatric community has recognized the critical need for a more precise, evidence-based approach for the diagnosis and treatment of disease.  In fact, recent studies funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) have found that psychiatric interventions were effective in less than 25% of patients presenting with an acute episode.  This low efficacy rate is especially problematic given the prevalence of mental disorders.  Mood disorders alone (e.g., depression) will be experienced by 1 in 5 adults in the United States at some point in their lives.  This project is motivated by the hypothesis that a more precise and personalized classification of mental health disease can be obtained through the development of novel clustering methods that identify clinically significant structures with these large population data sets.  However, such an approach must overcome a large number of methodological challenges introduced by the complexity of the problem and the nature of large-scale real-world electronic health data.  These challenges include, among others, complex and unknown structure, high dimensionality, heterogeneity, complex mixtures of variables, missing data, and sparsity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports initiation of a collaborative research project, carried out by a team with interdisciplinary and complimentary skill sets, to develop methods for big data that address challenges inherent in the integration of biomedical data of this type.  Collective expertise of the team spans the areas of biomedical informatics, biostatistics, computer and information science, electrical and computer engineering, mathematics, and psychiatry.  A novel methodology is developed in a flexible and fully integrated framework that can be extended to other biomedical data and diseases.  Within this framework, clustering methods that capture different aspects of relatedness in the data are integrated in a rigorous way that not only accounts for model uncertainty, but also results in an interactive visualization that is accessible with strong model interpretability for the non-expert.  Specifically, the methodology will rely on novel modifications to bootstrap estimators of generalization error for the purpose of assembling a consensus over an ensemble of clusters inferred from topology-based and machine learning approaches.  The framework also supports iterative refinement of the consensus solution based on user input (via the visualization) to incorporate domain expertise.  The rigorous identification of sub-groups of individuals within heterogeneous populations will facilitate accurate and targeted diagnosis for mood disorders, and provide opportunity for personalized evidence-based interventions.   Applications focus on clustering individuals with mood disorders (bipolar disorder and major depression) from data collected in the Bipolar Disorder Research Network (BDRN).  Despite this focus, the methodology is generalizable to other diseases that face similar challenges for diagnosis and treatment.  In fact, this project supports the first steps of a long-term vision of generalizing the methods to more complex and less curated data, such as electronic health records, social media, and other sources.  This award is supported by the National Institutes of Health Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative in partnership with the National Science Foundation Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

While the proposed methods can be extended to other illnesses, the focus during the funding period has been on mood disorders, in particular bipolar and major depressive disorder. A major objective for this planning grant project has been to lay the groundwork for a longer-term program that includes the creation of interactive data-driven visualization tools to assist clinicians with precision diagnosis and treatment. The project received funding for one calendar year, and continued for a second year under a one-year no-cost extension.  The novel methods explored in this planning work include a weighted ensemble clustering approach that incorporates techniques from topological data analysis and self-organizing maps. Research activities during the planning period focused on demonstrating feasibility of the proposed approach, primarily on the challenge of heterogeneity. In addition, the investigators have developed a long-term research plan to (1) address additional methodological challenges, (2) develop software implementations, and (3) conduct evaluations with large-scale datasets.  The project was successful in achieving meaningful results across all three major goals of planning activities. This includes (1) data acquisition, (2) demonstration of feasibility, and (3) planning toward a long-term collaborative project.  Data which would support the research was secured and made available to the research team to support the demonstration of feasibility of the work.  In addition, software prototypes were developed and preliminarily evaluated.  The results of this work have been (and will be) used to support requests for additional funds to support a more comprehensive and sustained research effort to address the data science challenges outlined in our proposal.  Moreover, these preliminary results are reported in a journal article which is nearing publication, thereby disseminating the results of this project to others who are working in, or are otherwise interested in, this area of data analysis methodology.  Finally, large scale follow-up research proposals have been developed by the team of investigators and submitted for funding consideration.  In addition, a proposal to secure funds for cloud computing resources sponsored by the NIH Big Data to Knowledge program has been funded.  These results demonstrate that our planning project has been successful in laying the foundation for our research team to continue working on related clustering approaches to improved medical classification and diagnosis.
