<AbstractNarration>1541588&lt;br/&gt;Plante&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Division of Earth Science Instrumentation and Facilities Program grant supports acquisition of a Netzsch simultaneous Thermal Analyzer for analysis of soil and sediment organic carbon.  The requested instrument includes the capabilities for automated operation.  The instrument will support studies that investigate the character, stability and content of organic matter in soils, sediments, composts, biochars, and other environmental samples and will allow for high throughput, unattended analysis in support of large-scale soil ecosystem studies.  The instrument will support undergraduate and graduate research training.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare given the importance of training the next generation scientific workforce in modern techniques of geochemical oanalysis and research methods and the societal importance of understanding the impacts of changing climate and land use, including agricultural practices, on soil carbon reservoirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research using the instrument will allow exploration of the stability and composition of soil organic matter and complement techniques to identify specific soil minerals (XRD), the structure of organic carbon bearing compounds (NMR), and the age of organic carbon pools (AMS radiocarbon dating).  The instrument will support studies of a range of soil ecosystems through use on samples from numerous NSF/EAR supported Critical Zone Observatories to better understand the impacts of climate and land use change on soil carbon across space and time.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The amount of carbon stored in soil and its exchange with the atmosphere is of great interest because of the key roles these processes play in global carbon cycling, climate change and sustainable agriculture. Soil carbon can be found in several general forms: organic carbon in the form of soil organic matter, inorganic carbon in the form of carbonate minerals, pyrogenic carbon in the form of char derived from fire, and geogenic carbon in the form of coal. Soil carbon stability refers to its resistance to decomposition (i.e., the opposite of decomposability) and refers to how long carbon can be expected to stay in soil before being returned to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). Soil carbon stability is investigated using a wide range of biological, chemical and physical methods.</p> <p>All materials, including soils and sediments, undergo physical and chemical reactions when heated. The combustion reactions that occur at various temperatures during slow heating are indicative of the form and chemical composition of the carbon present in the sample, as well as the degree to which the carbon is associated with the minerals. Thermal analysis involves measuring mass loss (i.e., thermogravimetry, TG), heat flux (i.e., differential scanning calorimetry, DSC) and the products of combustion (i.e., evolved gas analysis, EGA) during ramped heating of samples. This makes it possible to determine the energy stored in soil organic matter that may be available to microorganisms during decomposition; and the energy required for combustion, which can be seen as an energetic barrier to decomposition. Because organic, inorganic, pyrogenic and geogenic forms of carbon burn at different temperatures in soils and sediments, thermal analysis is also an effective method for distinguishing and quantifying them.</p> <p>This NSF funding allowed us to purchase a Netzsch STA 449 F3 Jupiter simultaneous Thermal Analyzer with a sample changer attachment to allow the automated analysis of up to 20 samples, and a LICOR LI-840 infrared gas analyzer for the analysis of evolved CO2 and water. This new instrument was a substantial upgrade in our research infrastructure and allows running samples on a near-24/7 basis. While our previous instrumentation could only process 4 samples per day (and not on weekends or holidays), the new instrumentation can run 20 samples unattended and complete them in under 3 days (including weekends). This increased capacity has allowed us to undertake a greater number of projects, and projects requiring a larger number of sample analyses.</p> <p>Since its installation, the new instrumentation has been used to analyze almost 1000 soil and sediment samples. Research projects include soil samples from a long-term bare soil experiment in collaboration with researchers at New Zealand Plant and Food Research, soil samples from the Southern Sierras Critical Zone Observatory in California to characterize soil organic matter composition along a soil climate sequence, soil samples from a depositional profile from the Intensively Managed Landscapes Critical Zone Observatory (IML-CZO) to distinguish between in-situ versus deposited organic matter, soil samples from two installations (Michigan and Oregon) of the Detrital Input and Removal Experiment, samples of anthropogenic dark earth soils analogous to the Terra Preta of the Amazon from Australia and west Africa, soil samples from soil pits from the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine to assess organic matter stability as a function of soil depth, soil samples from a long-term biochar addition agricultural experiment in Wales, UK, soil and physically isolated fraction samples from a long-term organic amendment agricultural experiment in China, and soil and sediment samples rich in anthracite coal where historical coal mine spoils have been eroded, transported and deposited in islands and along the banks of the Susquehanna River, PA. These projects have resulted in the publication of several peer-reviewed scientific articles, and been presented at several national and international conferences.</p> <p>The new instrument is part of an open multi-user facility that is available to users at Penn and collaborators worldwide. The relative ease and speed of analysis enables its use by undergraduate students, directly supporting undergraduate research and teaching tool in the Earth, environmental, and materials sciences programs at Penn. One postdoctoral research fellow, two PhD students, several undergraduate students and one international visiting scientist have been trained on the instrument and have collected data for their projects. Other projects have involved collaborators from across the United States, New Zealand, France and Australia.</p> <p>We anticipate that this facility will continue to be of high interest to the research community. Evolving applications in the characterization and quantification of pyrogenic and geogenic forms of carbon will be of growing interest, and there is growing interest in environmental bioenergetics.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/17/2018<br>      Modified by: Alain&nbsp;F&nbsp;Plante</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536975988447_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536975988447_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536975988447_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2: NSF funding allowed us to purchase a Netzsch STA 449 F3 Jupiter simultaneous Thermal Analyzer with an automated sample changer to allow the unattended analysis of up to 20 samples</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alain Plante</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alain&nbsp;F&nbsp;Plante</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536976184198_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536976184198_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536976184198_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3: Example of evolved gas analysis during ramped combustion of a soil containing organic matter (left hand peaks) and carbonates (right hand peaks) before (blank) and after (red) acid fumigation to remove the carbonates</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alain Plante</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alain&nbsp;F&nbsp;Plante</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536975846930_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536975846930_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536975846930_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: Thermal analysis during ramped combustion can distinguish between organic, inorganic, pyrogenic and geogenic forms of carbon in soil and sediment samples</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alain Plante</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alain&nbsp;F&nbsp;Plante</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536976465095_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536976465095_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536976465095_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 4: Deconvolution of a thermogram of an Australian coal mine reclamation soil containing soil organic matter, pyrogenic carbon (char) and geogenic carbon (coal)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alain Plante</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alain&nbsp;F&nbsp;Plante</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536976648020_Figure5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536976648020_Figure5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541588/1541588_10445084_1536976648020_Figure5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 5: Bioenergetic evolution of soil samples in response to land use change to agriculture, long-term incubation to promote soil organic matter decomposition, chemical treatment to remove labile organic matter, and long-term bare fallow treatment</div> <div class="imageCredit">Elizabeth Williams</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alain&nbsp;F&nbsp;Plante</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 5</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
