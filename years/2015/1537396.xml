<AbstractNarration>The Organizational Communication and Information Systems (OCIS) doctoral consortium at the 2015 Academy of Management meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, will bring together approximately 25 dissertation-stage OCIS doctoral students for one and a half days of talks and interactions with distinguished OCIS researcher faculty. The Academy of Management is a well-established professional organization for scholars, social scientists, and management leaders, and OCIS is a division of the Academy. The OCIS division at the annual AOM meetings provides a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practical issues related to the use and impact of information and communication technologies in organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctoral consortium provides highly-talented students with feedback on their work from other students and faculty members, allowing them to enhance their own research proposal. As well, because of the diversity of the communities involved, the consortium will allow students to make connections beyond their own disciplines. Both faculty and students are diverse on several dimensions, notably research topics, methodological approaches, and cultural background. As a result, participation will allow students to develop a better understanding of the different research communities, which will facilitate their participation in future inter-disciplinary research. This event has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding OCIS researchers, in the past. It provides feedback to students in order to develop higher quality and more relevant research in the field of organizational communication and information systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The OCIS Doctoral Consortium brings together highly talented students and several senior researchers, facilitating the development of a social network that will play a major role in the career success of new researchers.  Activities during the consortium provide feedback to students in order to develop higher quality and more relevant research in the field of organizational communication and information systems (OCIS).    The 2015 OCIS Doctoral Consortium was held in Vacouver on August 7-8, 2015.  44 PhD students applied to participate: 18 from North America, 19 from Europe, 3 from Asia, 3 from Africa, 1 from Australia.  Following a competitive review process, 29 students were accepted to the consortium: 11 from US, 5 from Canada, 10 from Europe, 2 from Asia and 1 from Australia. The students came from a number of different educational institutions, including MIT, University of Illinois at Chicago, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Texas at Austin, and Washington State University, and represented the Information Sciences, Information Systems, Communication and Management disciplines.   Faculty mentors were: Izak Benbasat, University of British Columbia, Andrew Burton Jones, University of Queensland, Marina Fiedler, University of Passau, Ola Henfridsson, University of Warwick, Likoebe Maruping, Georgia State University, Wanda Orlikowski, MIT, and Emmanuelle Vaast, McGill University.  The consortium was held on Friday, August 7.  The students participated in a variety of activities, including round tables and panel discussions. These activities focused on information exchange around their dissertation and the research process with faculty mentors and other students as well as career advice.    A joint luncheon and evening dinner with the OCIS Junior Faculty Consortium provided further opportunities for networking and information exchange between these groups of promising new scholars.  Finally, a reception for the doctoral students was held on Saturday night (August 8th) to introduce students to the broader membership of OCIS and to encourage social networking among the group.  The students presented their research to the membership in poster format during the reception.  Below are a few quotes from emails received by the organizer from student participants that illustrate the value the students received:      "Thanks Emma for organizing this event! Just done the survey. I had a wonderful at the OCIS Doctoral Consortium. Hope our paths cross again in the future."  "Thank you very much for having me at the OCIS doctoral consortium.
