<AbstractNarration>This research project will investigate the geography of population loss in the United States.  It will generate new knowledge regarding the geographical extent and nature of population decline, including its demographic sources, the characteristics of the individuals exposed to this decline, and information about the demographic change occurring in locations of decline.  The project will enhance basic understanding in geography and population studies and will provide new information and insights about connections among population change, geography, and population composition as measured for specific areas as well as the individuals living in those areas.  The project will contribute to spatial demographic theory by focusing on the links between declines at various spatial scales and demographic characteristics.  Project methods and results will be generalizable to other countries experiencing regional population loss and will be useful for researchers in related fields who require up-to-date understanding of the evolving distribution and composition of the U.S. population.  Products from this project will be communicated to scholarly audiences in geography and population studies as well as to policy makers and directly to the public.  The project also will contribute to the professional education, training, and development of a post-doctoral researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Population loss is longstanding and widespread in the United States and will become more relevant if population growth slows.  Population loss affects places and people, although past research has tended to focus mostly on impacted places.  This project will highlight the disproportionate exposure to population decline experienced by different demographic groups.  The investigator will develop new measures of place-specific population change that incorporate spatial context and temporal scale. The resulting typology of population change will identify various types of declining and growing places according to recent population change, the growth trajectory of neighboring areas, and population change in previous decades.  She will identify the demographic sources of population decline (such as fertility, mortality, and migration) associated with each category of population change and investigate variations in migrant characteristics and destinations by decline type.  She will evaluate the demographic burden of decline (such as differences in the characteristics of those exposed to population decline), with special focus on the characteristics of those living in areas declining at multiple spatial scales, and she will assess the dynamics of decline in order to discover how age structure, residential segregation, population composition and distribution, and poverty levels change when places lose population.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through its focus on recent and historical population change across US neighborhoods, cities, and counties, this project has increased our general understanding of the phenomenon of population loss&mdash;how it manifests in space and who is impacted. It has also expanded the range of spatial and demographic methods brought to bear on the subject, emphasizing the role of spatial scale and context for classifying areas of population loss. Depopulation affects both people and places and the research produced from this project has shown who bears the burden of population loss in US cities and counties, how many people are impacted, and where these people live. Research has also highlighted the myriad impacts of population loss, from transportation policy to rent burden to shifting population composition and the importance of the foreign born. Specifically, from this project, our understanding of the population geography of population loss in the U.S. is considerably expanded. At the county level, we developed a typology of population change for both growing and shrinking counties, showing that, apart from numerical loss in a given time period (2000-2010), the history of population change as well as the spatial context in which that change is taking place also provide important information about scale and location of depopulation in the U.S. Our research also showed that population loss has tended to slow the tide of increasing racial/ethnic diversity at the county scale, and may also moderately increase poverty and income inequality. At the census tract (i.e., neighborhood) and city scale, our research shows that, even in shrinking cities, substantial growth has occurred in a number of demographic groups, especially the foreign born. Analysis also shows that the so-called rent burden differs across growing and shrinking cities and that the demographic burden of loss within cities tends to fall disproportionately on some groups more than others. Through its focus on multiple spatial scales and time periods, especially in the case of the county-level typology development, our research reveals that the spatial articulation of population loss across counties and within shrinking cities varies and can be usefully captured with a range of spatial metrics and methods. Effective policy will depend on our understanding the nature of the phenomenon and this research is a first step in providing that baseline information.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/05/2019<br>      Modified by: Rachel&nbsp;S&nbsp;Franklin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
