<AbstractNarration>A three-day international meeting titled First Latin American International Statistical Institute Satellite Meeting on Small Area Estimation will take place in Santiago, Chile, during August 3-5, 2015.  The meeting will serve as an official meeting of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) and International Association of Survey Statisticians (IASS) and will provide its members and a large international group of statisticians and social scientists a unique opportunity to meet and exchange ideas on small area estimation, a growing interdisciplinary field with a wide range of real life applications. The meeting will include a strong mentoring component for students and young researchers working on small area estimation and related areas. The meeting aims to provide a forum for leading experts and young researchers to discuss recent progress in small area estimation, thereby providing new directions for small area estimation in various fields. This award provides partial travel support and registration for graduate students from U.S. institutions to attend and participate in this meeting in order to disseminate their research and develop collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this meeting is to bring together both well-established and emerging young researchers from around the world who are actively pursuing theoretical and methodological research in small area estimation and their applications.  The meeting will have an excellent slate of invited, special topic, contributed, and poster sessions covering a wide variety of topics in small area estimation. These include resampling methods, hierarchical modeling, time series, higher-order asymptotics, and different real life applications. In addition, a poster session will be held, which will provide an opportunity for junior faculty and students to showcase their research work.  This should lead to acceleration and enhancement of research for participants. The meeting will also be a fitting promotion of the role of small area estimation methodology in science.

Twenty three countries were represented in the meeting.        Announcements about the possible NSF travel award were sent out in April and early May, 2015, by emails to the list server for survey statisticians and list of attendees from the previous small area estimation meeting. The announcement was also posted on the above conference official website.   Students from U.S. institutions interested in applying for the NSF Travel Award were asked to send their completed applications to the PI by May 15, 2015.  A completed application included     A 3-5 page (double spaced) abstract of the paper to be presented.  A personal statement (no more than one page, double-spaced) that explains expected benefits from attending the conference. Unofficial transcripts. Curriculum vitae. A letter from student?s advisor commenting on his/her ongoing research on small area estimation.      Each application was reviewed carefully by an Award Selection Committee consisting of the PI as the Chair and Dr. Malay Ghosh , Distinguished Professor, University of Florida, Gainesville and a plenary speaker, and Dr. Carolina Franco, U.S. Census Bureau and co-organizer of an invited session, as members.  Criteria for selection included, but are not limited to novelty in methods/applications, significance and potential impact of the research, and clarity of writing. Six graduate students were selected for the NSF Travel Award and were notified on June 4, 2015.      The meeting had an excellent slate of invited, special topic, and poster sessions covering a wide variety of topics in small area estimation. These included resampling methods, hierarchical modeling, time series, higher-order asymptotics, and different real life applications. The PI was the chair of the Advisory Board of the meeting and presented a plenary talk.  All supported students actively participated in the conference by presenting a poster on Monday, August 3, 2015, 18:30-19:30 during a reception.  Detailed information about the program can be obtained from the meeting website.      The PI met the NSF supported students, offered comments during their poster presentations and introduced them to other senior researchers.  Moreover, the PI invited the NSF award winners to a special dinner with a few senior researchers.      The following papers were presented by the students who received the NSF support.  The poster presented by Andreea Erciulescu was awarded the best poster prize.     Rohosen Bandyopadhyay, University of California, Davis: Benchmarking the Observed Best Predictor.      Isabelle Beaudry: Inference for Respondent-Driven Sampling with Misclassification.      Andreea Erciulescu, Iowa State University: Bootstrap Confidence Intervals for Small Area Means.      Judith Law, University of Maryland, College Park: The Effect of Nonstationarity on the Rao-Yu EBLUP Derived under the Assumption of Stationarity.      Sepideh Mosaferi, University of Maryland, College Park: An Adjusted Estimator for the Fay-Herriot Log-level Model with Measurement Error in Covariates.      6.
