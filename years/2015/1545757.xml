<AbstractNarration>Evidence suggests that the successful mapping of the human genome may revolutionize the treatment of cancers and mental disorders amongst other ailments.  A similar concept has been conceived for research and development in the study of engineering material. The Material Genome Initiative (MGI) which began in the United States in 2011 is seeking to develop a material innovation infrastructure and to incentivize a change in material design culture. The material "genome" can be described in terms of the material composition, the microstructure, and the inherent defects and can be determined by material characterization methods at multiple scales. Based on the measured material genome, multiscale mechanical models can then be established to evaluate the influence of the material genome on material properties. With the availability of high performance computational methods and tools, multiscale models based on actual composition and the microstructure of materials can help to speed up the material design process with a minimum of financial investment and labor costs. The ultimate goal of the material genome research is to be able to design materials of desired properties and performance by rational approaches. This has not yet been resolved for well-understood metallic materials and may be even more challenging to address for stone-based civil infrastructure materials, such as hydrated cement concrete, asphalt concrete, aggregate, and human-augmented soil. These engineered hybrid natural-synthetic materials are important for the sustainable development of society, with significant potential impacts on both the economy and the environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanding concepts from the human genome to the material genome raises a number of questions, including: (i) what is the material genome? (ii) how can one identify the material genome and evaluate the influence of the material genome on material properties? and, (iii) how will understanding the material genome speed up discovery and innovation in material design?  An international workshop will be held at the University of Science and Technology in Beijing, China in 2016 that will include the world's leading researchers and educators in stone-based civil infrastructure materials to develop a roadmap to help answer these questions in a timely manner. The purpose of the international workshop on The Genome of Stone-based Civil Infrastructure Materials is to: (i) review and update the latest research and developments related to the genome of metallic and stone-based materials; (ii) identify technical barriers to developing international collaborations; (iii) promote the establishment of an international consortium for the identification of the genome for stone-based materials; and (iv) develop a roadmap for research and education in identifying and establishing a relationship between the material genome and the properties of stone-based infrastructure materials. The workshop will provide US participants an opportunity to develop partnerships for future interactions with Chinese and European researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The workshop was conducted on June 8-9, 2016, Beijing, China with more than sixty participants from universities and research institutions around the world.  The following describes the outcomes in terms of intellectual Merits and Broader Impacts.      Intellectual Merits     The researchers in subject areas of three stone-based infrastructure materials of cement concrete, asphalt concrete and human augmented soils presented more than 25 talks summarizing the recent and ongoing innovative developments in experimental methods, modeling and simulation methods, and the database approaches. The discussion sessions brainstormed the roadmaps to achieve the targets and objectives of genome research, identify the technical barriers, social, economic barriers for research, education and technological implementation, barriers to collaborations, and strategies to overcome these barriers.       The technical barriers identified include 1) lack of methods to seamless characterize and represent the multiscale microstructure of materials; 2) lack of unified bridging scale methods that are commonly accepted and numerically implemented on widely available platforms; 3) the inconsistency of different systems developed by far in mechanisms, methods, leading to  results that are incomparable and non-transferrable among different groups; 3) lack of high quality data sets of consistent types and formats repeatedly acquired by consistent methods; 4) challenges in sharing even the limited data due to intellectual property protection; 5) lack of collaborations among researchers in different stone-based materials; 6) lack of collaborations between researchers on stone-based infrastructure materials, materials scientists and computer scientists; and 7) lack of immediate interest from the industry. Stone-based infrastructure materials are mainly used for the construction of civil infrastructure. These materials do not cause drastic failures and the industry doesn?t have the motivation or economic incentives to design and synthesize better materials. Nevertheless, the industries do expect these revolutionary changes but do not foresee the urgency.       The roadmaps outlined to achieve stone-based infrastructure materials genome research goal and objectives focus on overcoming these barriers identified. They include the following strategies and plans as recommended.     The research community needs to establish a consensus on what the genomes of stone-based infrastructure materials are; identify the most promising experimental, modeling and simulation methods, and define the necessary data variety and quality. Different from purely scientific explorative projects, the genome projects should have specific objectives for products, and develop some tools for applications and use by a wider community including the academia, the industrial and the agencies.            The research community should develop protocols for data collection, and agreements for sharing data, and intellectual properties. A group of researchers with common interest should collaborate in developing such database, which may rely on developments by small businesses.     It is very beneficial if funding agencies can provide long-term small grants to support the workshops annually for next few years to motivate more researchers and encourage tight collaborations.   It is also very important that tools and case studies be developed for training purposes and wide adoption.       Broader Impacts     The broader impacts of the workshop conducted include the following:     The research community has reached a consensus that genome research for infrastructure materials united major academic and applied research activities in experimentation, modeling and simulation, data accumulation and implementation.  Since this workshop, a number of participants have started collaborations in data sharing, and organization of symposiums on infrastructure materials genome research. This has a significant impact on the orientations that researchers will follow. Several working groups also started approaching the funding agencies that regularly fund their projects for potential funding to support research and educational activities related to genome of stone based infrastructure materials. For example, the Chinese counterpart (University of Science and Technology Beijing, USTB) who supported this workshop, has managed to apply for funding to support three US scholars to visit USTB for student advising, joint proposal development and short courses offering.
