<AbstractNarration>The main objective of the project is to develop a method to use existing multibeam sonars, available on NSF-sponsored research vessels, to measure small displacements of the seafloor associated with rapid events such as earthquakes and landslides. The seafloor displacements are measured by comparing the location of a patch of seafloor surveyed at two times spanning an event. The published accuracy of this approach is currently tens of meters which severely limits the utility of the method. The planned work would greatly improve the accuracy to better than 1 m by collecting data at a slow ship speed and navigating the repeat track to closely follow the reference track. This order of magnitude improvement in displacement accuracy would provide a valuable tool for assessing and understanding large and sometimes-destructive seafloor events. Broader impacts include improvements to the system software that will be freely available to others. Funding includes the training of a graduate student in the methods of high-resolution sonar and seafloor geodesy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a method to use existing multibeam sonars, available on NSF-sponsored research vessels, to measure small displacements of the seafloor associated with rapid events such as earthquakes and landslides. The seafloor displacements are measured by differencing the location of a patch of seafloor surveyed at two times spanning an event. The published accuracy of this approach is currently tens of meters which severely limits the utility of the method. This work would greatly improve the accuracy to better than 1 m by collecting data at a slow ship speed and navigating the repeat track to closely follow the reference track. This order of magnitude improvement in displacement accuracy would provide a valuable tool for assessing and understanding large and sometimes-destructive seafloor events. The proposal addresses one of the eight high-level science questions posed in the recent National Research Cpuncil Decadal Report (NRC, 2015), i.e.,  how can risk be better characterized and the ability to forecast geohazards like mega-earthquakes, tsunamis, undersea landslides, and volcanic eruptions be improved? The tools of GPS and InSAR are used to monitor the crustal deformation onshore of the Cascadia Subduction Zone but most of the locked part of the megathrust interface lies offshore. While the PI?s method does not have sufficient accuracy to monitor interseismic motions, it can serve as a pre-event survey of the surface trace similar to the San Andreas Fault B-4 lidar survey.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>Offshore earthquakes pose a significant threat to coastal communities from both ground shaking and tsunami inundation. For example, the 2011 M9.0 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan was the costliest natural disaster in world history ($309 billion) and also transformed our understanding of the safety of coastal nuclear power generation. Offshore threats of this scale in the United States occur in the Pacific Northwest (last major earthquake in 1700 and last major volcanic eruption in 1980) and the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zones (last great (M9.2) earthquake in 1964). However, these offshore earthquakes are difficult to study because they are masked by the deep ocean so GPS or satellite remote sensing techniques cannot be used. The purpose of this project is to develop a method for measuring movement on the seafloor due to hazards such as offshore earthquakes. The instrument we use is a multibeam sonar, which is mounted on the hull of a research vessel and uses sound waves to take a snapshot of the seafloor.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit and Findings</strong></p> <p>To measure seafloor movement, we consider a comparison between two multibeam sonar surveys, collected before and after the movement. By looking at changes between surveys in one of the multibeam sonar data products, called sidescan, we can measure the size and direction of the seafloor movement. We tested this method by collecting many repeated surveys of multibeam data in the region above the Ayu Trough, a remote area of the west Pacific ocean that is to the southwest of the Marianas Trench. The Ayu Trough is special because it barely moves 3-5 millimeters, less than a quarter of an inch, every year. Thus, any measurements of seafloor movement we made in this region must be due to errors introduced while collecting data. By comparing the sidescan data collected in successive surveys, we find that we are able to routinely locate the same patch of seafloor to about 0.5 meters, or about 20 inches. This means that we could use repeated multibeam sonar surveys to measure seafloor movements from large earthquakes with magnitudes greater than magnitude 8.0. The primary source of noise in these measurements is from our knowledge in the location of the ship. The ship has a GPS on board that can report the ship position in real-time with an accuracy of 3 meters, or about 9 feet. This is much larger than the seafloor movement we would like to measure, so it is very important that we perform a type of data processing on the ship GPS data called Precise Point Positioning, or PPP. This improves the accuracy of the ship GPS to about 0.1 meters, or 4 inches, by using solutions for the GPS satellite locations that are generated by the International GNSS Service (IGS) two weeks after the GPS data is collected.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p> <p>This method may be used to measure the movement on the seafloor due to large offshore earthquakes with magnitudes greater than magnitude 8.0 or due to submarine landslides.
