<AbstractNarration>This REU Site will support ten undergraduate students per year to carry out research on reconstructing climate impacts on hydrologic, soil, and ecological systems, and on energy-water nexus and infrastructure adaptations. The new 10-week REU incorporates the previous program's unique aspects and particular strengths, including: (a) cross-cohort field exercises, seminars, and peer shadowing (b) recruiting of highly-diverse, competitive student cohorts, (c) STEM professional development, (d) an emphasis on campus sustainability practices, and (e) significant undergraduate research publication. In recognition of the critical links between scientific research and societal implications, the new REU site will include an environmental policy component through new workshops, seminars (Climate Science BootCamp), and 1:1 interactions between students and policy mentors.  In addition, there will be opportunities for research in Botswana, China and Guam, the fields of study of have been broaden, and several new aspects to the evaluation have been added (including a comparison of semester long vs. summer REU research experiences).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this REU site was to introduce undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and schools that lack significant research infrastructure to interdisciplinary research focused on an integrating theme that spanned natural sciences, engineering and social sciences. Four racially, ethnically, gender and economically diverse cohorts completed the program; over 70 percent of the students represented non-Research I universities. Each student participated in a cutting-edge research experience, professional development, and an expanded perspective regarding graduate school and a science or engineering career.  Students in the program participated in ten weeks of individualized research supervised by faculty/scientists/graduate student mentors as well as a series of theme-based field trips, seminars and workshops; career-based seminars and workshops; and social events.  The intellectual theme of this REU program was the impact of climate change in semi-arid and arid regions, a topic that requires collaboration among scientists, engineers, planners, and policy makers as well as students versed in collaborating across these disciplines.  Students developed communication skills for a range of audiences and worked collaboratively on a grand challenge project; two culminating experiences included a university wide poster session in which the students presented their individual research and a final group presentation on their grand challenge project.  Overall, this REU provided a holistic view of interdisciplinary education in which students learn to collect, analyze and synthesize data, understand how it applies to larger global issues, and then make connections between their research and society.
