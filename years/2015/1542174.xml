<AbstractNarration>Development of nanoscale materials and devices, and incorporation of these components into full systems, has become an important part of addressing global challenges in energy, health, and the environment. However, nanoscale science and engineering often requires the use of complex and expensive tools and facilities for the fabrication and characterization of these materials and devices. This necessitates the support of shared national resources for both basic research in academic institutions and the translation of these discoveries into commercial products by small and large enterprises. As part of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) program, the Southeastern Nanotechnology Infrastructure Corridor (SENIC) will create a partnership between the Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering, an academic collaboration between North Carolina A&amp;T State University (NCA&amp;T) and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). This national resource will provide open access to nanofabrication and characterization facilities and tools along with expert staff support to a growing user community across the southeastern U.S. The SENIC infrastructure will strengthen and accelerate discovery in nanoscience and nanoengineering, benefiting both traditional disciplines, such as electronics and materials, as well as newer areas, such as biomedical and environmental sciences. In addition, because societal and economic need requires a skilled workforce trained in the tools and techniques of nanotechnology, SENIC will implement a comprehensive education and outreach program, embedded with lessons in socially and ethically responsible development and use of nanotechnology, designed to reach a broad and diverse audience of students, teachers and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With access to more than 230 nanotechnology fabrication and characterization tools, SENIC's goal is to provide a one-stop-shop approach, covering both top-down approaches using nanoscale patterning, as well as bottom-up approaches based on nanomaterials synthesis and additive processing. A particular strength of the partnership is the ability to connect nanomaterials and devices to full packaged systems. This helps transition nanoscale research achievements more quickly into high-impact applications in biomedical/health, energy, communication, smart transportation, textiles and smart agriculture. SENIC will operate with an interdisciplinary culture where engineers, scientists, physicians, educators, policy experts, and economic development professionals work together with shared access to facilities and tools and a deep understanding of industry opportunities and societal challenges to promote the accelerated translation of invention into innovation. Furthermore, the SENIC partners will work with undergraduate and graduate students, as well as partner with 2-year technical colleges, to produce science and engineering professionals from diverse backgrounds who are ready to meet the global workforce demands of the 21st century. In tandem, the public outreach with hands-on classroom activities as well as interactive facility tours will encourage K-12 students to participate in the STEM pipeline and will help create an informed citizenry that supports the safe development of nanotechnology. Closely coupled with its education program, SENIC will have a social and ethical implications program that educates on the challenges associated with the expectations that nanoscale science and engineering will contribute to the solution of societal, environmental, and economic problems, while anticipating and avoiding potential negative consequences.</AbstractNarration>
