<AbstractNarration>Title:  Evolution of the mechanism of peptidylglycine-alpha-amidating monooxygenase &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peptides are very small proteins made up of short and precise sequences of amino acid building blocks.  Many peptides serve as signaling agents such as hormones and neurotransmitters in complex multicellular organisms.  After synthesis many of these signaling peptides require further modification for activation. In this project, the investigator will study the enzymes needed for a specific peptide modification from several distantly related organisms.  The goal of the research is to identify different structural and chemical changes across the different organisms that resulted in the gain or the loss of different features of the enzyme.  Determination of the mechanism of this important step in the modification of peptide signaling molecules and how the mechanism changes in different organisms will guide the development of new ways of producing synthetic modified peptides.  The work will also lead to a better understanding of how different enzyme structures can give rise to improved efficiency or specificity for a chemical reaction. The laboratory of the PI will continue its efforts to bring the excitement of science to high school and undergraduate students with emphasis on including underrepresented minorities in the research programs and STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication between different parts of an organism via secreted peptides is a widely distributed biological signaling mechanism.  Many of these peptides require amidation at their carboxy terminus for full-activity.  Such peptides are expressed as precursors that, after processing, contain a glycine residue as their last residue. Oxidative cleavage of the glycine N-C(alpha) bond produces a des-glycine amidated peptide and glyoxylate.  Only one enzyme in the complete phylogenetic spectrum is known to catalyze this reaction: the bi-functional peptidylglycine-alpha-amidating monooxygenase.  The reaction takes place in two stages, the hydroxylation of the glycine C(alpha) by peptidyl-glycine-alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase, and cleavage of the N-C(alpha) bond by peptidylglycine-alpha-amidating lyase. This project will study the peptidylglycine-alpha-amidating monooxygenases from several distantly related organisms with the goal of determining when in evolution they appeared, while trying to identify the structural and chemical changes that resulted in the gain or the loss of different features of the enzyme not critical for the chemical reaction. Structural and biochemical information obtained by X-ray diffraction, small angle scattering and kinetic measurements of the proteins from evolutionarily distant organisms will be used in this work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many eukaryotic bioactive peptides, including  hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors require C-terminus amidation before secretion to express full biological activity.  The reaction is sequentially catalyzed by two activities: peptidylglycine &alpha;-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) and peptidyl-&alpha;-hydroxyglycine &alpha;-amidating lyase (PAL). PHM binds to peptidylglycine substrates and hydroxylates the C&alpha; of the C-terminal glycine using two bound copper atoms, ascorbic acid and molecular oxygen. This hydroxylation is followed by the action of PAL, which catalyzes the production of the des-glycine &alpha;-amide peptide and glyoxylate via cleavage of the glycine N-C&alpha; bond.  In most species, PHM and PAL are found as a single polypeptide chain, PAM.  Our laboratory determined the structure of the two components of PAL as separate proteins and, based on extensive information from ours and other laboratories, proposed mechanisms for the two enzymes.   PHM consists of two major lobes (N-terminal and C-terminal lobes) separated by a solvent-filled cleft. The N-terminal lobe contains the 'CuH' site, which uses three histidine residues (H107, H108A, and H172) to coordinate one copper atom (CuH) in a T-shape geometry. The C-terminal lobe binds the other copper in the 'CuM' site.  In the CuM site,copper is tetrahedrally coordinated by two histidine residues (H242, H244), one methionine residue (H314) and one water molecule. From previous crystallographic, biochemical, and spectroscopic studies, it has been suggested that these two copper sites have distinct roles during catalysis: while CuM binds to small molecule copper ligands, including nitrite (NO2-), azide (N3-), and carbon monoxide (CO), the empty coordination site of CuH does not bind to these ligands even at high concentrations. This evidence suggests that CuM binds to molecular oxygen and is involved in hydrogen abstraction while CuH serves as a single electron donor to the CuM site.  During this award we investigated a number of important questions relevant to the evolution, the metalation, and the transfer of substrate between the two subunits.  To understand the evolution we expressed, purified and attempted to crystallize PHM, PAL and PAM from primitive organisms.  Because these preparations, despite extensive experimentation, did not produced diffraction quality crystals the efforts were discontinued.   Highly successful  studies of the metalation of PHM were designed based on the hypothesis that preparations lacking one of the two coppers will sample different regions of the conformational space than does the fully metalated enzyme.  A combination of clever experimentation (mutants designed to  limit copper binding) and serendipity (the inclusion of citrate in the crystallization media) showed that enzyme preparations lacking CuH can sample a large number of conformations that can be described as preventing CuM from carrying out unwanted one-electron reactions (Effects of copper occupancy on the conformational landscape of peptidylglycine &alpha;-hydroxylating monooxygenase.  Maheshwari S, Shimokawa C, Rudzka K, Kline CD, Eipper BA, Mains RE, Gabelli SB, Blackburn N, Amzel LM. Commun Biol. 2018 Jun 25;1:74. doi: 10.1038).  These results suggested that, besides their catalytic role, the two coppers have distinct structural roles such that the final catalytically competent structure is only accessible with both coppers bound.  Based on this suggestion, we carried out molecular dynamic simulations of PHM with different copper occupancies.  The calculations we are preparing for publication reveal a complex conformational landscape that appears ideally tuned for metalation and catalysis.  Since PAM contains both the PHM and the PAL domains, the possibility exists that PAM is a processive enzyme, i.e., it transfers the product of the PHM reaction directly to the PAL catalytic site without releasing the hydroxylated peptide to the solution.  We checked whether in the PAM structure the two sites were close enough for the transfer to take place in two ways: SAXS (with and without cross-linking) and crystallization and structure determination of human PAM (hPAM).   The SAXS data, analyzed using the known PHM and PAL structures, showed excellent agreement with a number of structures with different relative orientations of the two domains.  However, in all cases the catalytic sites of the two domains were not close to each other making the direct transfer of the intermediate extremely unlikely, i.e., PAM is not processive.   The analysis of the x-ray data of hPAM produce results which are completely compatible with those of SAXS.  In the crystals, the PAL domain is perfectly positioned and explains the major features of the diffraction data.  However, the PAL domain structure cannot be the only component as in one crystal direction there is a large gap, large enough to accommodate the PHM domain but the electron density in this unoccupied region is not strong nor organized enough to be interpreted.  The simplest explanation is that the PHM domain is actually in this gap but it can adopt more that one conformation, all of which are compatible with packing with the fixed position of the PAL.  (This kind of crystal peculiarity, although not common, has been observed before.)  These results are being prepared for publication.       Last Modified: 12/11/2019       Submitted by: L.
