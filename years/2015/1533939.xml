<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes peak demand relief for utilities, reduced&lt;br/&gt;freezer operating costs for retail stores, and natural refrigerants for regulators. Unfortunately, no state-ofthe-&lt;br/&gt;art system simultaneously addresses all these issues. Industrial/commercial batteries remain&lt;br/&gt;unaffordable, refrigeration costs account for 60% of a retail store?s electricity bills and equipment&lt;br/&gt;manufacturers are only realizing incremental efficiency improvements with new vapor compression&lt;br/&gt;architectures. This project introduces an energy storage technology, embedded in a natural refrigerant&lt;br/&gt;cooling cycle, that provides load-shifting services and a 40% reduction in commercial freezer electrical&lt;br/&gt;purchases. More importantly, it achieves this at a 3-year payback without government incentives using&lt;br/&gt;natural, near ambient, materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will investigate an energy storage&lt;br/&gt;technique utilizing water as the storage material in a time delayed, freeze-point-suppression refrigeration&lt;br/&gt;cycle. The project will focus on the internal testing, third party validation and commercial demonstration&lt;br/&gt;of a 10kWth system. Successful integration within low temperature refrigeration architectures requires&lt;br/&gt;industrial design focused on skid/waste heat integration, validation testing to inform required part count&lt;br/&gt;reductions/system revisions and demonstration to monitor, learn and revise the technology in preparation&lt;br/&gt;for scale up.</AbstractNarration>
