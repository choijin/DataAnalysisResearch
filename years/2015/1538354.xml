<AbstractNarration>Shape memory alloys are multifunctional materials that undergo an reversible phase transformation when exposed to heat or external load. These transformations can led to useful properties, and their behavior can be controlled if the relationships between the transformational and fine particles dispersed throughout the material can be understood. A class of shape memory alloys comprised of nickel, titanium and niobium (NiTiNb) exhibit structures with unique constituent morphologies. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports research seeking to couple thermal and mechanical deformation processing and examine and understand the resulting Nb particle interactions with the underlying phase transformation and deformation mechanisms.  The industrial partner specializes in fabrication of NiTiNb materials and employs laser-based machining techniques for post-processing without compromising the shape memory behavior.  The approaches and findings can extend to deformation processed shape memory alloys with insoluble third elements in general. Fundamental interrelationships this research establishes will unlock the full potential of manufacturing multifunctional shape memory materials to tune performance for novel deployable structures. The success of this research will advance processing multifunctional alloys to commercialization as next-generation materials in broad ranging applications from biomedical implants to unmanned vehicles that benefit the U.S. economy and society.  Furthermore, education and outreach programs will closely integrate the technical research.  Programs designed for high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels will deepen the engagement of minorities and underrepresented groups in academic disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small business industry-university collaborative GOALI project will investigate the underlying physical martensitic phase transformation (MT) mechanism of a novel shape memory material response referred to as strain-induced austenite (SIA) in a class of ternary NiTi-based shape memory alloys (SMAs) with an insoluble third element Nb. A consequence of ternary alloying and thermo-mechanical deformation processing is a micro-/nano-structured Nb particle constituent morphology.The collaborative team will (1) systematically vary thermo-mechanical processing and post-processing parameters of deployable structures; (2) conduct x-ray, electron, and optical microscopy characterizations of micro-/nano-constituent sizes, spacing, and coherency as well as grain size and texture; (3) undertake multi-scale thermo-mechanical experiments that determine multifunctional material properties and structural response; (4) establish quantitative and qualitative relationships between processing, microstructure and multifunctionality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biomedical shape memory alloys (SMAs), typically Nickel-Titanium compositions, have been implemented as implant materials (e.g. stents, braces, bone plates) as well as deployable endoscopic devices or device components.  The ternary NiTi-based SMAs with an insoluble third element Nb offer the potential for on-demand stent expansion without the detrimental chronic outward force pertinent to NiTi SMAs.  For biomedical implant staples, the NiTiNb will require a lower staple force and thus ease application in practice. Compared to the knowledge of the well-known influence of precipitates in the workhorse NiTi, a fundamental understanding of the martensitic phase transformation (MT) morphology within the nanostructured Nb particle morphology in NiTiNb SMAs is deficient.  This small business industry-university collaborative Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project aims to establish the interrelationships of materials processing, structure and properties that are fundamental to advancing the manufacturing of novel deployable shape memory constructs pertinent to biomedical applications.    In the current work, we demonstrate thermo-mechanical processing can tailor the nanostructured constituent morphology for controlling the underlying MT.  For practical applications, NiTiNb alloys are cast and thermo-mechanically deformation-processed to wrought forms (e.g. rings, rods, sheets).   The cellular morphology of the cast structure becomes a nano-structured composite-like material after deformation processing.   Nb-rich &beta;-particles are dispersed throughout the matrix similar to aligned discontinuous fiber reinforced composites. The cellular morphology of the cast structure becomes a nano-structured composite-like material after deformation processing.   Nb-rich &beta;-particles are dispersed throughout the matrix similar to aligned discontinuous fiber reinforced composites.   Stress-induced martensitic (SIM) becomes locked and reverts to austenite via heating after unloading with revision occurring at much higher temperatures relative to the typical thermal-induced martensite.  The results expose an atypical MT pathway. Post-processing heat treatments tune the characteristic length scale of the particle morphology "locking" and shape memory effect recovery via heating.  Localized deformation measurements and differential scanning calorimetry confirm an atypical MT pathway.
