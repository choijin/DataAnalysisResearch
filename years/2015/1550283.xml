<AbstractNarration>The understanding of tectonic and earthquake processes depends upon observations of earth motions that span periods from years to fractions of a second and amplitudes from nanometers to meters. Up until now such observations came from a variety of instruments such as seismometers, geodetic-quality GPS receivers, gravimeters, and strain meters. Even as GPS networks are reaching up to nearly seismic frequencies and observatory quality seismometers extend down into the geodetic range, the multiple instruments required are complex and expensive to deploy and operate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund the concept and design of a combined instrument that will provide much of the relevant information. This instrument concept will meet the stringent requirements of the Global Seismographic Network while providing geodetic measurements with significantly lower noise than GPS. Housed in a simple borehole sonde, the instrument will be inexpensive to construct, install, and operate. If our expectations are met it will become practical to significantly expand the network of geodetic/seismic observations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locations in which both seismic and geodetic data are relevant to socially-important problems include volcanoes, areas of subsidence, oil fields, and CO2 sequestration The proposed instrument will provide low noise and extremely broadband data in such settings, enhancing the ability to understand such processes as induced seismicity, reservoir dynamics, and pre-eruption behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broadband seismometers are aimed at a frequency range between several tens of Hz and about 0.0002 Hz to observe seismic disturbances from earthquakes and from Earth normal mode vibrations, the slowest of which has an oscillation period of 55 minutes (0.0003 Hz).  Lately, motivation has grown to observe much lower frequency signals from Slow Slip Events (SSE), in which stored elastic energy on faults is released over time scales from hours to weeks or longer.  Normally geodetic sensors (GPS receivers or tiltmeters, for example) would be deployed to observe these signals.  There would be an advantage to the availability of instruments that are capable of observing both usual teleseisms and SSE.  For several years we have been developing seismometers based on optics.  In these, the position of a mass suspended from a spring (for a vertical component, for example) is tracked with a laser interferometer.  Rather than measuring the electrostatic or magnetic force required to maintain a constant position of the proof mass, as is done in almost all broadband seismometers manufactured today, we record variations in the proof-mass's position in this non-fedback system and compute from that record the associated ground motion.  While feedback, as conventionally used, solves many difficulties, the advantages of optical displacement transducers can outweigh the disadvantages of not having feedback.  The optical displacement transducers have a dynamic range of more than the equivalent of 30 bits.  Optical fibers are not susceptible to damage from electrical storms (as are electronics situated deep in a borehole).  And finally, the mechanical simplicity of the system (in part because of the wide dynamic range of the optics &ndash; no leveling motors are required) supports stability in the long term geodetic functions provided by the proof masses (gravity and two components of tilt).   In this project, we advanced the design of the next generation borehole optical seismometer.  The main outcome was the selection of infrared optics.  Prior to this point we had been using a visible Helium Neon laser for the interferometer source.  Advances in opto-telecommunications have dictated the conversion to infrared wavelengths for optical fiber based systems.  We therefore designed a new interferometer using infrared components, and built a test system to evaluate the components.  This work has led to a Major Research Infrastructure (MRI) grant to follow-up on the new design and complete and install an actual borehole system.  The intellectual merit of the design is in the ability it will give us to create a complete borehole seismic and geodetic system.  The infrared laser used is much smaller than the visible HeNe laser sources we have used in the past, allowing the entire opto-electronic package to be held in the near surface portion of the borehole (where desirable) to achieve higher laser wavelength stability and therefore increased stability in the geodetic components of the recordings.  The broader impact of the new design is that we expect the size and power savings to enable deployment on the seafloor eventually, allowing a battery-operated system to run for long durations &ndash; necessary for recording slow slip events.
