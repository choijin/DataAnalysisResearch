<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to advance the development of compact, next-generation light sources and other laser-based accelerators. Laser-plasma acceleration is a key enabling technology for a new generation of compact particle and radiation sources, but the existing theoretical understanding of the processes governing electron beam formation in such accelerators is incomplete.  Further advances require development of computational tools with high physical fidelity, which is the expected outcome of this project.  The project will aid in workforce development at all levels by providing training in the basic physics underlying advanced accelerator technologies.  The research is expected to benefit society as a whole primarily through advancement of accelerator technologies based on plasma physics. Knowledge gained in this project will aid the effort to realize the technological promise of various laser-plasma accelerators with a wide range of applications from high-energy physics, astrophysics, and nuclear science to medicine, biology, and chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in the development of improved numerical models suitable for understanding the physics of electron beam formation and evolution in a large class of laser-plasma accelerators.  This includes the development of a new two-dimensional Eulerian Vlasov-Maxwell simulation code.  Comparisons of results from the new Vlasov-Maxwell solver and predictions of various particle methods will be used to identify regions of validity of the particle methods and to determine the key physical processes involved in electron beam formation and the origins of dark current in laser-plasma accelerators.  The project will focus on studying electron beam formation in the bubble (or blow-out) regime.  The results of this study will also inform the development of high-fidelity three-dimensional computational tools suitable for designing both near-term experiments and future facilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit Laser-driven particle accelerators are an emerging technology with wide-ranging applications.  A necessary ingredient to realizing the promise of this technology is ability to make accurate, first-principles computer-based predictions of system performance.  This project was focused on creating new computational approaches to this challenging problem.  The algorithms developed in this project provide building blocks and proof-of-principle examples for the construction of computationally efficient, high-fidelity tools for studying phase space processes in kinetic plasmas generally and in laser-driven plasma accelerators in particular.    Higher-order Eulerian methods, especially as part of a multi-physics approach, can yield understanding of phase space processes at a level of accuracy not possible with currently used methods.  We expect that these methods have the potential to provide the first-principles predictive modeling capabilities needed to design radiation and particle sources exploiting laser-plasma accelerator technologies.  In addition, we have shown that macro-particle models obtained from variational principles have excellent conservation properties, on par with Eulerian phase space methods.  Notably, the conventional PIC algorithm produces large errors in both particle and field momentum.  While the variational macro-particle algorithms only conserve momentum on average, their performance in this regard is still significantly better than the PIC algorithm which sacrifices momentum conservation for exact charge conservation.  The large scale effects of these momentum errors requires further investigation.   Broader Impacts This project provided educational experiences to graduate students and career training for postdoctoral fellows.  A Ph.D. dissertation was completed based in part on this research.  In addition some of the software developed in the project was used by the PI in teaching a graduate course on plasma physics.  The results have been disseminated through publications in professional journals and conference presentations.       Last Modified: 10/14/2020       Submitted by: Bradley A Shadwick]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
