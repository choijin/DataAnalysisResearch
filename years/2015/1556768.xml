<AbstractNarration>It is well known that plants alter their flowering times in response to local climatic conditions, but the factors influencing the magnitude and direction of their responses are not well understood.  Moreover, not all species change their seasonal flowering time in response to the same climate factors.  Consequently, as climate changes, some species may flower too early, resulting in exposure to winter frosts, while others may flower too late or fail to shift their flowering enough to reproduce successfully. This project will improve our understanding of how the timing of flowering by individual species and groups of plant species shift in response to future climatic conditions.  This research is essential for forecasting the future availability of floral resources for pollinators and other animals that feed on nectar and pollen, as well as for assessing plant risk of exposure to frost damage, herbivore activity, and other seasonal stresses (e.g., summer drought). To date, however, no comprehensive, continental study of the direction and magnitude of changes in flowering time in response to changes in climate has been conducted.  This project will create a single, large database and make all data available online to the public.  In addition, this project will provide research training to undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary evidence suggests that the magnitude of phenological responsiveness (or sensitivity) to climate changes may be conserved among closely related and functionally similar taxa.  Consequently, it may be possible to predict the phenology of species that have not been studied through examination of closely related taxa that are well-documented.  Hundreds of thousands of electronic records archived in educational and research institutions throughout the United States provide standardized information about plant specimens collected by botanists across the U.S. over the past 200 years, including the date and location where each specimen was collected and whether it was flowering on the date of collection. This research integrates these disparate records into a single database, and leverages them to evaluate the factors influencing historical and contemporary flowering times across &gt;1000 well-sampled species.  In turn, this information will be used to forecast shifts in seasonal flowering under projected climate scenarios. Digital herbarium records and recorded in situ observations will be used to evaluate the factors influencing historical and contemporary flowering times across an unprecedented diversity of angiosperms (&gt;1000 species, each represented by &gt;100 specimens; &gt;400 genera; 80 families).  Predictive models will be generated to enable researchers to forecast phenological changes of individual species given specific climatic conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project evaluated the ways in which flowering phenology (the timing of flowering) of 2,468 angiosperm taxa has responded to both spatial and temporal variations in climate throughout North America through the assembly of a very large (894,392 observations) database of plant specimens collected throughout North America since 1895.  A central product of this project was the evaluation and development of species-specific models of spring flowering dates for these taxa, and the production of publicly available software to facilitate the prediction of flowering phenology among these species using a straightforward graphical interface.  Through comparison of phenoclimate models derived using both historically collected plant samples (i.e. herbarium specimens) to those derived from in-situ observations of living plants, this study A) demonstrated that herbarium specimens can be used to predict flowering phenology with similar accuracy to observations of living plants,  B) demonstrated that some of the most important aspects of climate to the prediction of flowering time may have been overlooked by previous investigators, and C) that the phenological responsiveness of angiosperm species to both geographic and interannual variation in climate exhibit low levels of phylogenetic conservatism. This study also demonstrated that the rate at which species successively begin flowering throughout the growing season exhibits systematic shifts along spatial climate gradients, and that future warming will likely produce greater shifts in flowering synchrony among early-flowering than among late-flowering taxa.  Finally, this project demonstrated that the risk of frost exposure by flowering tissues (which are often most susceptible to frost damage) has broadly declined across North America in response to recent warming (among 1092 of 1653 sampled species).     The phenoclimate models and phenological software produced by this project have broad applications to other researchers exploring the impacts of climate change on flowering phenology, as well as to ecological researchers, land managers, and landscape designers.  Further, this work has contributed significantly to the development of revised methods for providing phenological information for preserved plant specimens, which will assist herbarium curators in recording higher-quality phenological information as they digitize their herbarium collections, and thus provide a superior data resource to future researchers utilizing such data.
