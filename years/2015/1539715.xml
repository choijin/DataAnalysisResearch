<AbstractNarration>The funding from NSF will provide partial participant support at several workshops and working meetings of the Cyber Education Project (CEP). CEP goal is to establish Cyber Science curricular guidelines for undergraduate programs and to develop program criteria leading to Cyber Science program accreditation by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). At these planned meetings, CEP group will solicit, develop, and refine learning outcomes from a broad swath of cyber educators and industry supporters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By fostering dialogue among academia, the private sector, and government, the CEP will promote and drive more-rapid maturation of Cybersecurity and Cyber Science learning objectives, while significantly improving the collaboration among the sectors that will operate, sustain, and employ the persons and technology that underpin the essential core of the Nation?s critical infrastructure. The CEP expects to see a significant increase in the number of students enrolling in Cybersecurity and Cyber Science once such programs are established; stronger partnerships between employers and academic institutions that find, educate, and hire these candidates; and increased research activities to continue forward progress on relevant hard problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Initially this grant was intended to provide travel support for the Cyber Education Project, a project to develop and promote curriculum guidelines for undergraduate cybersecurity programs and to establish ABET accreditation for such programs.  The project culminated in the publication of "CYBERSECURITY CURRICULA 2017: Curriculum Guidelines for Post-Secondary Degree Programs in Cybersecurity," a Report in the Computing Curricula Series Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education supported by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS), the Association for Information Systems Special Interest Group on Information Security and Privacy (AIS SIGSEC), and the International Federation for Information Processing Technical, Committee on Information Security Education (IFIP WG 11.8).  The report was published December 31, 2017 and can be found at https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/csec2017.pdf.  This project has broad impact.  The security of our nation's cyber infrastructure is critical to maintaining the safety and privacy of US citizens.  The production of well trained professionals is a necessity and curriculum standards are essential to the process of educating the next generation of cybersecurity workers and researchers.  In terms of intellectual merit, the development of curricular guidelines required the identification and categorization of a comprehensive cybersecurity body of knowledge.  In 2017, alternative sources of travel funding were located for the Cyber Education Project.  At that time, this grant was re-scoped to provide cybersecurity training opportunities for 25 veterans.  Over 300 active duty military personnel, veterans or relatives of veterans, women and minorities applied to participate in the training program.  89 participants began the training program 69 participants (76%) completed the program 39 (57%) were male  and 30 (43%) were female 42 (61%) of the 69 completing the program were active duty military, veterans or related to veterans 10  (24%) of the 42 active duty military, veterans or related to veterans who completed the program were female 20 completing participants (29%) report having passed the CompTIA Security+ certificate exam Approximately half of those passing the Security+ exam were active duty military or veterans   A post-training survey was administered.  Of the 42 respondents,  21% reported obtaining a new job in cybersecurity 2.3% reported obtaining a new position in cybersecurity (same employer) 4.7% reported receiving a promotion to a new position 16.3% found IT jobs (not necessarily in cybersecurity)   Broader Impact:  The 69 participants who completed this program are better prepared to contribute to the IT and cybersecurity profession.  Participants from the training program are now working at jobs in corporate cybersecurity solutions; banking, finance and audit; human rights; IT/cybersecurity staff for large IT corporations; agriculture; defense contract auditing; water hygiene and energy technologies and services; healthcare; local and state government; medical technology; Minnesota National Guard; education; home security; emergency restoration services and the energy industry.   Intellectual Merit:  The program may serve as a model of how to integrate veterans into the cybersecurity profession, a profession for which they are well-suited.
