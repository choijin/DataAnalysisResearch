<AbstractNarration>Applications of biotechnology affect diverse and critical facets of our lives from the development of medicines we take, to the production of food we eat, to the creation of fuels that power our vehicles and more.  Furthermore, the bioscience/biotechnology industry is a significant contributor to the United States economy, employing in excess of 1.6 million workers at more than 70,000 companies.  Whether they take place in major universities, large corporations or small start-up companies, research and development activities that lead to advances in the field of biotechnology rely greatly on the presence of well-qualified entry-level technical employees to carry out essential tasks.  In order to serve the needs of the regional bioscience/biotechnology industry, the Orange County Biotechnology Collaborative Partnership will unify and fortify the individual efforts in biotechnician education of three southern California community colleges, Santa Ana College, Santiago Canyon College and Fullerton College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working with an advisory board composed of representatives from the local industry and academic institutions, the members of the Orange County Biotechnology Collaborative Partnership will design a curriculum tailored to provide program graduates with professional skills and competencies highly desired in the workplace. Program elements being developed across the three colleges include simulated workplace experiences embedded within biotechnology courses, extensive outreach to local high schools and internship opportunities in industrial and academic settings for students in the program. A series of three successive stackable certificates will provide students with options for multiple program entry and exit points. Completion of the three certificates plus two additional classes in a specialty area of emphasis will lead to an Associate of Science degree in Biotechnology. As all three colleges in the partnership are Hispanic-Serving Institutions, this project will provide educational pathways into the STEM professional workforce for individuals historically underrepresented in science and technology. Project evaluation will involve metrics such as numbers and demographics of program graduates, employer surveys to ensure industry needs are being addressed and whether project goals and objectives are met. These efforts will contribute to the general knowledge base regarding successful practices for embedding professional skills training within formal advanced technological coursework, as well as the effectiveness of stackable certificates in promoting flexible entrance to and exit from the biotechnician program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Orange County Biotechnology Collaborative Partnership  The Orange County Biotechnology Collaborative Partnership was a project designed to have three separate community colleges; Santa Ana College, Santiago Canyon College and Fullerton College, work together to develop and strengthen our new Biotechnology Certificate/AS Degree Programs.  The major goals of the OC Biotech Collaborative Partnership that were funded by this grant were:  Increase enrollment in the community colleges? biotechnology programs, especially among underrepresented populations. Students completing the college?s biotechnology programs have the knowledge, skills and abilities required to enter and succeed in biotechnology occupations. Produce a high number of biotechnicians to address the regional workforce needs. Improve program alignment with industry workforce needs and build robust programs through regional alignment and collaboration.      The strategies we used to achieve these goals were:  To replicate the biotechnology lab work environment in biotech courses for students to develop occupational competencies Develop industry and academic internships for Biotechnology certificate students Provide work-based learning by engaging students in operating a biotech company  Outreach to local high schools and middle school students to generate interest in biotechnology and establish articulated pathways   We were able to meet and accede all of our measurable outcomes during the funding period.  The measurable outcomes reached were as follows:  Over 10,000 middle and high school students and 3500 college students received biotech pathway information Over 800 students completed hands-on biotech workshops Over 100 students participated in biotech internships Over 200 biotechnology certificates aligned with specific occupations have been awarded Over 85% of biotech students who complete biotech courses are proficient ("A" or "B") in biotechnology core competencies   In addition to these outcomes, we now have a very solid OC Biotech Collaborative Partnership which shares equipment, resources, curriculum, and an industry advisory board.  Irvine Valley College has joined us, bringing our number to four local community colleges working together in this program and offering biotech courses and certificates.  We have a full-time internship coordinator who maintains industry contacts and sets-up internships for all 4 schools.  Our biotech "company" works to supply media and reagents to community college and high school biotech classes and workshops.  While still small, the biotech programs at all four schools have grown and are actively recruiting new students.  Our interns have been very successful in local biotech industry positions, 87% of our interns have been offered employment or been given raises since starting their employment.  And finally, we have developed a high school to community college Biotech AS degree to Biomanufacturing BS degree pathway with Solano and Mira Costa Community Colleges.
