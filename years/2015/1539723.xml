<AbstractNarration>The proposal provides support to a group of graduate students from the University of Notre Dame to organize and conduct a symposium on biocatalysis at the 249th American Chemical Society National Meeting in Denver, Colorado in the spring of 2015.  Not only will this symposium bring together a group of inter-disciplinary experts in the emerging field of biocatalysis, but it will also provide valuable experience to the graduate students in exploring an area of research beyond their immediate thesis research topic and will serve as a magnet in attracting students and younger researchers to this field.  This activity has been conducted since 2005 under the guidance of the Graduate Student Symposium Planning Committee of the American Chemical Society (ACS), typically with base funding from ACS supplemented by funding from other organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Each year the American Chemical Society (ACS) Graduate Student Symposium Planning Committee (GSSPC) program provides a group of graduate students from a university in the United States the opportunity to organize an all-day symposium at either the spring or fall ACS National Meeting. Our group at the University of Notre Dame was selected to participate in the Spring 2015 GSSPC at the ACS National Meeting in Denver, Colorado. We sought to highlight an interdisciplinary aspect of chemistry research, selecting the unique and varied subject of biocatalysis to bring diverse and noteworthy scientists together and appeal to a broad audience. Our responsibilities as the Spring 2015 GSSPC included selecting and inviting speakers, advertising, fundraising, organizing day-of-symposium activities, and mentoring the next year&rsquo;s GSSPC. Through support from NSF PD 14-1401, we were able to bring seven professionals from both academia and industry together from across the country to discuss diverse aspects of biocatalysis. The outcomes of this project include the promotion of scientific discussion among invited speakers as well as symposium attendants, professional development opportunities for graduate students in the GSSPC, and mentorship of graduate students in the next year&rsquo;s GSSPC. With the help of PD 14-1401, we were the most funded GSSPC in the program&rsquo;s history, which allowed us to provide a large amount of start-up funds for the next year&rsquo;s committee. Not only did participating in ACS GSSPC provide unique graduate professional development opportunities, the incorporation of NSF PD 14-1401 provided important grant writing and utilization experience to which most graduate students are not exposed in their graduate career. The awarding of PD 14-1401 provided support to make our symposium an unequivocal success.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/18/2015<br>      Modified by: Michelle&nbsp;Pillers</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
