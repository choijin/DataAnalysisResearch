<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Over the past five years, the ACI CAREER program has supported early career faculty involved in research related to  cyberinfrastructure and computational and data-enabled science and engineering. Building on past successes, the  2015 CyberBridges workshop will again bring together ACI CAREER awardees with nationally recognized leaders in core areas of cyberinfrastructure to foster the continued development of CAREER awardees and the research community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the workshop are to encourage the development of collaborations and networking between CAREER awardees and senior keynote researchers, to foster the development of the cyberinfrastructure research community, to share challenges, needs, and practices in curricula development and education, and to provide feedback to the NSF on the challenges and opportunities faced by the community of computationally focused CAREER faculty.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The 2015 NSF CyberBridges workshop was organized to encourage the development of collaborations and networking between the growing community of NSF CAREER awardees and senior keynote researchers, to foster the development of the cyberinfrastructure research community, and to provide feedback to the NSF on the challenges and opportunities faced by the community of computationally focused CAREER faculty.  The workshop, titled "The 2015 NSF CyberBridges Workshop", focused on five core areas of cyberinfrastructure: Grand Challenges in Cyberinfrastructure and Interdisciplinary Research, Visualization, High Performance Computing, Computational-and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering, and Future Directions in Cyberinfrastructure.  The workshop was attended by 31 NSF CAREER awardees and five keynote speakers from thirty-two institutions.  The workshop provided a venue to facilitate and foster continued discussions among ACI CAREER awardees, keynote speakers, and NSF program directors.  Several broad themes emerged from workshop presentations and discussions. The need for exascale computing capabilities for faster and more detailed simulations and analysis is becoming clearer.  There are significant research and development challenges to be overcome by the community to provide effective and efficient exascale systems. A common theme from past workshops that was also discussed at this workshop is interest in and the need for an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approach that combines the expertise and strengths of faculty across domains. The need for better ways of visualizing information was another focus area.  There is a need for information visualization to help researchers better understand data from the micro to macro spatial and temporal scales across many domains and to better analyze and communicate high dimensional data both in traditional publications as well as in online dissemination venues. The final broad area related to the need for automation of repetitive data collection and analysis tasks and the need for platforms for service-oriented research computing.
