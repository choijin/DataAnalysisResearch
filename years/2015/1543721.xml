<AbstractNarration>Princess flowers (Melastomataceae) are one of the largest families of plants, forming prevalent components of many tropical biodiversity hotspots. They serve as a major food source for bees and seed dispersers such as birds and mammals, and play a critical successional role in the regeneration of disturbed forests. Through a combination of field work in targeted regions, molecular phylogenetic techniques, and scanning electron microscopy, the investigators aim to improve the classification of Melastomataceae, develop means to easily identify its major groupings (genera and tribes), track how diagnostic characters in the family have evolved, test ideas on how pollination systems have evolved in tropical ecosystems, evaluate models of ancient climate change, and provide new data to inform and direct conservation priorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will strengthen collaborations with foreign colleagues and institutions, build capacity in tropical developing countries, and help train the next generation of scientists. The researchers will mentor high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in project-related research and lead a workshop on the biology of Melastomataceae. Results will be disseminated to other scientists through print or web-based journals and made available to the general public through websites and exhibits at the California Academy of Sciences and the New York Botanical Garden.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This investigation has sought to elucidate the evolutionary relationships of the tribes and genera of the Melastomataceae, one of the ten most speciose flowering plant families. Historical classifications have primarily relied on morphological characteristics such as inflorescence position, numbers of flower parts, anther and anther appendage form, ovary position, and fruit type. More recent studies based upon DNA sequence analysis such as those supported by this grant have suggested novel patterns of evolutionary relationships leading to changes in the classification. Using these updated schemes and data sets, researchers have made significant discoveries pertaining to various fields of inquiry. For example, in terms phylogenetics, this research has helped to identify eight new tribes and many novel generic realignments, revolutionizing the family level classification. These have in turn permitted a re-examination of morphological character evolution, suggesting that seed form and internal anatomy are generally better indicators of relatedness than those mentioned above. In regards to historical biogeography of the Melastomataceae, it had been previously thought that only one group (Olisbeoideae) exhibited a pantropical pattern of distribution. Now it is known that such a pattern is found in three additional tribes, and their possible origins are still under investigation. Whereas about 97% of the family is buzz-pollinated by bees, in some tribes there have been extraordinary pollinator shifts to vertebrates such as hummingbirds, bats, and rodents. A novel and unique pollination syndrome was discovered in the Merianieae of South America involving passerine birds, a bellows-like mechanism for expulsing pollen, and sugar-packed anther appendages as rewards. Some melastome species produce structures, formicaria, that house ant colonies in a symbiotic relationship. The occurrence of this phenomenon in the Blakeeae is now known to have originated independently three times, each with its own kind of formicarium. Numerous new species were discovered and have been or will be described.</p> <p>Funds provided through this grant have been used in support of Melastomataceae field collections in eleven countries in Latin America and southeast Asia. Additional materials were collected from eight major herbaria. Over 7000 DNA sequences have been generated and uploaded to GenBank for ca. 1300 species representing 150 genera. Laboratory training opportunities have been provided for one high school student, five undergraduates, four post-graduates, and one university professor on sabbatical.
