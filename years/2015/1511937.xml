<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed study is to use a combination of theory and simulations to understand the transition from laminar to turbulent flows in the case of non-Newtonian fluids, like polymers and biological fluids. The work is motivated by the fact that non Newtonian fluids are used in many industrial settings (e.g., polymer processing) where instability and transition could lead to manufacturing defects. In addition, transition mechanisms in flows of complex fluids are very important for the development of micro/nano-fluidic devices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to understand, predict, and control the transition to turbulence is important for a multitude of technological applications and scientifically important processes. This proposal is focused on exploring the physical mechanism of transition to turbulence in the flow of viscoelastic fluids. While in Newtonian fluids a lot of research, experiments, computations, and theoretical analyses have been done over several years, transition in non-Newtonian fluids is a new, vibrant area with tremendous technological impact that needs to be explored. Preliminary results from the group of these PIs have indicated that in viscous flows the transition to turbulence can occur at much lower Reynolds number than for Newtonian fluids, and that another dimensionless number, the Weissenberg number, is an important parameter. This number characterizes the fluid relaxation time scale in relation to the characteristic time scale of the flow. Previous work by the authors has focused on the linear mechanism instability in viscoelastic flow. Streaks in the streamwise flow direction have been identified as the transition structure that can be amplified and lead to turbulence. The proposed work is focused on discerning the nonlinear mechanisms involved in the later stages of the transition process. In the proposed work, channel flow geometry will be used to examine the secondary receptivity and instability of the most amplified linear disturbance. The final stages of transition that lead to spectral broadening will be examined via direct numerical simulation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Conventional fluid dynamical wisdom is largely based on the analysis of Newtonian fluids, for example the study of small- and finite-amplitude perturbations in canonical flow configurations as a foundation to understanding more complex problems. When even minute amounts of polymers are introduced in the fluid, the ensuing flow dynamics are often intriguing and defy the Newtonian intuition.  A theoretical description of the new phenomena that emerge due to elasticity has been hampered by three factors: Firstly, the canonical problems that form the foundation of our understanding of perturbation dynamics in Newtonian flows have not been solved for the viscoelastic case.  Secondly, viscoelasticity introduced new constitutive relations and have special mathematical characteristics and should not be analyzed using the same approaches customary for Newtonian flow fields.  Thirdly, accurate simulations of viscoelastic flows are difficult to perform due to the nature of the fluid consitutive relations.    During this project, we targeted the above three challenges. We revisited the classical works by Taylor and Orr for Newtonian flows, and derived their viscoelastic equivalents. In doing so, not only did we expose the new dynamics that can ensue due to viscoelasticity, but we have also established the foundation for analyzing more complex configurations.  Additionally, we have  developed a new mathematical framework to analyze the polymer conformation tensor and its deformation in viscoelastic flows, and used it to derive the appropriate analysis tools for small and finite amplitude perturbations. We have also performed high-fidelity simulations of the evolution of transitional and turbulent viscoelastic flows and contrasted them to their Newtonian counterparts.  An example of flow in a channel is shown in the accompanying figure.  The qualitative change in the nature of the turbulence, which is also associated with a significant drag reduction in the viscoelastic case, is the outcome of the new dynamics that our simulations accurately capture and our theory clearly explains.  More generally, together the computational and theoretical tools that we have developed have a wide range of applications including materials and chemical processing and biological flows.
