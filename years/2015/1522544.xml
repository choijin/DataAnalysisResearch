<AbstractNarration>The Tropical Cyclone Research Forum will be held on March 3-7, 2015 at the Marriott Hotel in Charleston, South Carolina. The theme of the workshop is "Tropical Cyclone Operations &amp; Research: Setting the Future Course". Topics include: snapshots of tropical cyclone R&amp;D; federal numerical modeling initiatives; transitioning research to operations; tropical cyclone model development and technology transfer; observations and observing strategies satellite, aircraft reconnaissance, unmanned aircraft systems, upper-ocean observations/profiles; improvements in tropical cyclone forecast and warning products and services; and social science applications to the tropical cyclone forecast and warning notification problem. The Tropical Cyclone Research Forum is sponsored by NSF/Physical and Dynamic Meteorology Program, NOAA/Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, and the Office of Naval Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;At the Tropical Cyclone Research Forum, representatives from the academic research community, industry and Federal agencies will have the opportunity to discuss the latest research on Tropical Cyclone activity and forecasting such as:&lt;br/&gt;1. Review of the 2014 hurricane/typhoon season from both an operations and reconnaissance perspective.&lt;br/&gt;2. The Research Priorities of the Operational Centers&lt;br/&gt;3. Observations and Observing Strategies&lt;br/&gt;4. Tropical Cyclone Model Development and Technology Transfer&lt;br/&gt;5. Transitioning Research to Operations&lt;br/&gt;6. Advances in Tropical Cyclone Forecast and Warning Products and Services&lt;br/&gt;7. Applications of Social Science Research Results/Demonstration Projects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The workshop is important to society because it brings together the academic research community, industry, Federal agencies and other user communities such as emergency management, to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season and make improvements to the United States hurricane forecasting and warning program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 2015 TROPICAL CYCLONE RESEARCH FORUM  69th INTERDEPARTMENTAL HURRICANE CONFERENCE  With the support of the Interdepartmental Committee for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research (ICMSSR) and the sponsorship of NOAA/OAR, the Office of Navy Research (ONR), and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the 2015 Tropical Cyclone Research Forum (TCRF)/69th Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference (IHC) was hosted and chaired by Mr. David McCarren, Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research (Acting), from March 2-5, 2015, at the Wyndham Jacksonville Riverwalk, Jacksonville, FL. During the 2015 TCRF/69th IHC, the following observations were highlighted:  In addition to the on-site participants, the forum had a substantial "virtual" attendance, with attendees participating via the internet, using "GoToMeeting" and dial-in audio technology. There were 143 total registrants&mdash;83 attended in person and 60 participated virtually. It was pointed out by several participants that the face-to-face interaction at the forum was very valuable; lots of good discussions went on during the breaks. The session presentations were delivered in a timely manner and, in most instances, adequate time was available for questions from both on-site and virtual participants.   The Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research (OFCM) annually hosts this event to provide a forum for the responsible Federal agencies, together with representatives from the academic community, industry, and other user communities, such as emergency management, to prepare for the upcoming tropical cyclone season and to make improvements to the NationÆs tropical cyclone forecasting and warning program. The theme for the forum was: Tropical Cyclone Operations and Research: Setting our Future Course.  Forum sessions were structured to address the following objectives:  Review and update the NationÆs tropical cyclone forecast and warning program,  to include a review of the 2014 season. Assess the progress in addressing the operational priorities of the operational centers (NHC, CPHC, and JTWC) and adjust research priorities moving forward based on the inputs of the centers. Receive updates on Joint Hurricane Testbed projects, assessing their readiness to transition from research into operations. Review ongoing tropical cyclone model development and evaluation initiatives within NOAA, Navy, and NASA. Explore ongoing and future developments in observation technologies for both the atmosphere and ocean that will promote improvements in the forecasting and understanding of TCs and their associated affects.    Abstracts for the presentations that were given at the 2015 TCRF/69th IHC can be found at:  http://www.ofcm.gov/ihc15/final%20booklet.pdf. Presentation and poster preview slides, and available posters may be viewed at: http://www.ofcm.gov/ihc15/69IHC-Linking-File.htm.  Welcoming Remarks. Mr. David McCarren, Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research (Acting) opened by noting that the forum goal is to meet annually to improve the tropical cyclone forecast operations and set priorities for research to address gaps in forecast capabilities.  Perspectives from the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Mr. Steven C. Woodard, Director, Emergency Preparedness Division, Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department and Ms. Amy Godsey, Chief State Meteorologist, Florida Division of Emergency Management discussed the nature of the tropical cyclone threat to the Jacksonville area.  Richard H. Hagemeyer Award. The award is presented annually to honor the memory of the longtime Director of the NWS Pacific Region and patriarch of the IHC until the time of his death in 2001. It is awarded to dedicated supporters of the IHC who have made substantial and long-standing contributions to our NationÆs tropical cyclone forecast and warning program. The winner of the 2015 award was Mr. Edward Fukada (US...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
