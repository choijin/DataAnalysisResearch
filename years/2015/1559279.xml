<AbstractNarration>Ocean acidification (OA) refers to the lowering of ocean pH (or increasing acidity) due to uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).  A great deal of research has been done to understand how the open ocean is influenced by OA, but coastal systems have received little attention.  In the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) shelf region, pH in bottom waters can measure up to 0.45 units less than the pH of the pre-industrial surface ocean, in comparison to the 0.1 overall pH decrease across the entire ocean. Carbonate chemistry in the ocean is greatly influenced by even small changes in pH, so these seemingly minor changes lead to much greater impacts on the biology and chemistry of the ocean. The researchers plan to study coastal OA in the nGOM, a region subject to high inputs of nutrients from the Mississippi River.  These inputs of anthropogenic nitrogen mostly derived from fertilizers leads to increased respiration rates which decreases oxygen concentrations in the water column to the point of hypoxia in the summer.  This study will inform us how OA in coastal waters subject to eutrophication and hypoxia will impact the chemistry and biology of the region.  The researchers are dedicated to outreach programs in the Gulf and east coast regions, interacting with K-12 students and teachers, undergraduate/graduate student training, and various outreach efforts (family workshops on OA, lectures for the public and federal, state, and local representatives).  Also, a project website will be created to disseminate the research results to a wider audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased uptakes of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) by the ocean has led to a 0.1 unit decrease in seawater pH and carbonate mineral saturation state, a process known as Ocean Acidification (OA), which threatens the heath of marine organisms, alters marine ecosystems, and biogeochemical processes. Considerable attention has been focused on understanding the impact of OA on the open ocean but less attention has been given to coastal regions.  Recent studies indicate that pH in bottom waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) shelf can be as much as 0.45 units lower relative to pre-industrial values. This occurs because the acidification resulting from increased CO2 inputs (both atmospheric inputs and in-situ respiration) decreases the buffering capacity of seawater.  This interactive effect will increase with time, decreasing summertime nGOM bottom-water pH by an estimated 0.85 units and driving carbonate minerals to undersaturation by the end of this century.  Researchers from the University of Delaware and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium will carry out a combined field, laboratory, and modeling program to address the following questions. (1) What are the physical, chemical, and biological controls on acidification in coastal waters impacted by the large, nutrient-laden Mississippi River?; (2) What is the link between coastal-water acidification, eutrophication, and hypoxia; (3) How do low pH and high CO2 concentrations in bottom waters affect CO2 out-gassing during fall and winter and storm periods when the water column is mixed?; and (4) What are the influences of changing river inputs under anthropogenic forcing on coastal water acidification?  Results from this research aim to further our understanding of the processes influencing ocean acidification in coastal waters subject to eutrophication and hypoxia both in the GOM and river-dominated shelf ecosystems globally.</AbstractNarration>

The coupled changes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), oxygen, and nutrients suggest that biological production of organic matter in surface water and the subsequent aerobic respiration in subsurface are the dominant factor regulating pH variability in the nGOM in summer. The highest pH values were observed, together with the maximal biological uptake of DIC and nutrients, at intermediate salinities in the river plumes where light and nutrient conditions were favorable for phytoplankton growth. The lowest pH values were observed along with the highest concentrations of DIC and apparent oxygen utilization in hypoxic bottom waters. The non-conservative pH changes in both surface and bottom waters correlated well with the biologically induced changes in DIC.

The role of benthic processes in influencing bottom water acidification, however, has not been sufficiently explored. We examined this issue by analyzing a ten-year summer carbonate chemistry dataset in bottom water together with recent benthic flux measurements and literature benthic flux data in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The difference between the observed and estimated pH (&Omega;) values calculated from anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> increase and water column aerobic respiration were defined as DpH (D&Omega;). We found that DpH and D&Omega; values in DO&lt;63 umol L<sup>-1</sup> (or hypoxic condition) were &nbsp;lower than the previous estimates. Both DpH and D&Omega;&nbsp;values in hypoxic conditions were significantly lower than zero.<em> </em>Our analysis and model simulations demonstrate that severe hypoxic or even anoxic conditions favor the accumulation of benthic respiration products, leading to additional pH and &Omega; reductions. The findings on sediment processes contributing to acidification in bottom waters provide new insights into the sensitivity of coastal ocean acidification to low-oxygen conditions under current and future climates and anthropogenic nutrient loading scenarios.</p> <p>(3) We have disseminated our scientific findings broadly via publications, presentations, teaching and outreach. The PI gave a keynote talk on this research and a comparison of the Mississippi River-nGOM system with that in Changjiang, East China Sea at the Ocean Deoxygenation Conference in Kiel, Germany, in October 2018 and planned to write a broad review paper based on this talk on the linkage between pH and river plume eutrophication and pH and the resulting hypoxic bottom water and the impacts of storms. The PI has published a paper in <em>Nature Communications</em> (Cai et al. 2020) summarizing carbonate chemistry property distributions in North American margins.&nbsp; GOM is part of the synthesis and shows distinct difference with the east coast and west coast waters. In GOM, the Mississippi River input is the most important factor. In another review paper (Annual River of Marine Science, v. 13, 2021), the PI also used Mississippi River plume as a reference system to make comparison of estuarine acidification in large eutrophic estuaries such as Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound. Three postdocs and two graduate students from Cai lab and several students and postdocs from other universities have been trained during our cruises and publication processes.
