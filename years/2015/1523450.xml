<AbstractNarration>Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), will hold three two-day workshops (in New Jersey, Kansas, and California) for regional and state-level leaders in afterschool science education in more than 20 states who have been associated with the National Partnerships for After School Science (NPASS), Design It! and Explore It! afterschool science initiatives. The workshops will be designed to strengthen ties among current and prospective members of the NPASS network and to identify issues for future research for the after school field at large aimed at increasing understanding of how afterschool science programs succeed or fail.  Despite the current absence of centralized support to maintain or expand this network, many of its members continue to offer NPASS and NPASS-like programming in their states. The workshops will bring together some of the most experienced leaders in the NPASS network as well as experienced advocates and leaders of afterschool science from beyond the network.  The project builds on 15 years of prior work conducted by EDC that developed afterschool science and engineering curricula that was nationally disseminated via the NPASS network and train-the-trainer workshops.  The project will support the overall strategy of the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program to enhance learning in informal environments through the funding of innovative resources through a variety of settings. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The regional workshops will be designed to: (1) enable leaders of the NPASS network to re-establish ties and renew their understanding of and commitment to best practices and critical elements of afterschool science; (2) gather information about common obstacles to implementation of these practices and about when, where, and why adaptations to these best practices occur, and what they (the practitioners) believe to be the impact on program quality; and (3) identify questions for further research.  The findings from these workshops will be broadly disseminated to the field via a report summarizing the proceedings and findings from the workshop, including a revised NPASS statement of critical structural and pedagogical elements on practices critical to successful afterschool science programming.</AbstractNarration>

All day seminars for invited audiences were held in New Jersey and Kansas during the summer of 2016. A survey was sent to participants of the workshops ahead of time, and to all the afterschool science trainers who had participated in any of the above projects. Follow up telephone interviews were conducted with 12 former colleagues and associates with extensive knowledge of the field of afterschool science.  The PI has spent a career crafting what he hopes are enjoyable science and engineering curriculum that can attract and engage students in science exploration. But to take science beyond mere enjoyment, it is necessary that projects leaders adopt structural and pedagogical practices that are deemed necessary to increase the use and understanding of the science and engineering practices, as formulated in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and elsewhere. A premise of the all the work mentioned above, has been that very large numbers afterschool practitioners at both the front line and administrative level &ndash; people with little background in science or formal education&ndash; could be convinced of the value of these practices and trained to adopt them when implementing afterschool science projects with children.  Participants expressed widespread enthusiasm for hands-on science within their own agencies and across their professional spheres, and there was general agreement that the objective of this programming should be primarily to increase engagement and enjoyment of science rather than achieving measurable improvements in content learning.  There is very little academic commentary or research, however, on the practical challenges to getting good science to actually happen in the afterschool domain on a wide scale. The most obvious of these challenges are the cost of the science materials themselves and the scarcity of training resources for staff. This report does not directly offer solutions to either of these problems, but rather address the standards of excellence that, if adopted, would increase the likely impacts of any afterschool programming that does overcome the practical challenges.  Working against meaningful impacts of afterschool science programming, however, is a tendency to conflate the assumed potential impacts of such programs with the likelihood that these impact will be achieved. For a great many administrators, practitioners and advocates of afterschool science, the pedagogy that facilitates meaningful and lasting changes in attitude and skills, does not often figure prominently in their calculation of program success and utility. Getting the programming in place at all is challenging enough. Taking it to the next level of excellence is not a priority and few stakeholders are willing or able to provide the resources that would make it possible to do so.  An associated tendency is to overestimate the quality of facilitation skills at the front lines of science programming. Assessments often being more reflective of student engagement, group collaboration, orderliness and completion than on evidence of reflection, resilience and transferable critical thinking skills. Engagement, collaboration, orderliness and completion are considerable achievements but they fall well short of the declared objectives of afterschool science.  This study revealed and confirmed that there is a widespread belief that high quality afterschool science programs can offer great benefits to the children who participate. However, making support for afterschool science dependent on demonstrations of its ability to boost student achievement and commitment to future careers in science is ill advised. Even if it could be shown that certain programs do indeed produce such outcomes, it would still be necessary to examine what it is about these programs that accounts for their success in order to promulgate these impacts more widely.  The research question at that point would become: "What structural and pedagogical best practices for curriculum, professional training and facilitation are necessary to, and most effective in, increasing students? love of science, their understanding of the nature of scientific investigation and their use of science practices and critical thinking skills."  The field badly needs clear definitions of the pedagogical and structural practices most likely to raise the bar from simple happy engagement to the development of problem solving skills, the habits of critical and creative thinking and curiosity about the natural world. Widespread application of tested best practices would benefit all children who participate and would contribute to maintaining a scientifically literate and intellectually curious citizenry. Arguably, it might also increase engagement with academic science and the number and diversity of those who end up pursuing STEM careers.
