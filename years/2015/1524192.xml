<AbstractNarration>The University of Miami requests funding for additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Walton Smith, a 96,? general purpose regional vessel operated by the University of Miami?s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V WALTON SMITH conducts a substantial portion of her operations in the near shore waters of South Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, providing scientific information relevant to major environmental initiatives. The operations include oil spill monitoring, water management changes, municipal waste disposal, and storm water discharge among others which are deemed critical to the sustainable development of the South Florida and Gulf economy.  In 2014, R/V Walton Smith completed 138 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 17% of the total sailing schedule (24 days). In 2015, R/V Walton Smith is scheduled for 120 days with NSF days (20) accounting for 16% of the total sailing schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Profiler Winch $140,000 &lt;br/&gt;Upgrade of Ship?s Northern American Davit Cranes (2) $73,000 &lt;br/&gt;Naval Architect Evaluation for Winch Upgrades $25,200 &lt;br/&gt;Wire Lube System $9,000 &lt;br/&gt;Air Conditioning Upgrade $110,000 &lt;br/&gt;      $357,200 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>
