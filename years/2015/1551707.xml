<AbstractNarration>The scientific community has been under increasing pressure from policymakers and the public to explain how research contributes to the public good. The community has emphasized two distinct approaches to explaining its operations and value. The first is the use of narratives that can make the work of science more accessible and engaging to nonscientists. The other is the use of new data mining and analysis methods to document quantitatively the complex paths by which research progresses and eventually contributes to a variety of societal goals. While both of these approaches have proved useful, the goal of this workshop is to explore ways that they might be combined into a hybrid approach that will be even more effective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will assemble experts in the narrative and data-driven science communication approaches with leading science researchers to discuss how these various perspectives can be merged to define a template for a type of communication that encompasses the appeal of narrative, the rigor of new analytic data, and the understanding of how science works in practice&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The scientific community benefits enormously from the research funding provided by taxpayers, and the community has a responsibility to do all it can to spend that money wisely and to explain to the public and policymakers how it guarantees the rigor and value of research.   This workshop began with a presentation by an expert in the measurement of research productivity and quality.But this highly quantitative information is not easily understood by nonscientists. The challenge for the scientific community is to find a way to convey this information in palatable form.   The science communications experts at the workshop explained why the narrative format is so effective in creating interest and understanding. It can be used to explain specific scientific results and the overall operation of science.   All effective communications requires a thorough understanding of audience, and the polling experts provided up-to-date information on how the public perceives science. They offered evidence that science is held in generally high regard by the public, and they went further by delineating exactly what it is that the public finds most valuable in science--hope and progress.  Finally, the workshop turned to the actual task of producing quality narratives. A science editor and a science writer described how they have developed an understanding of what is effective.   The workshop summary pulls together all the important lessons that emerged during the workshop in a brief document that should be helpful to scientists who want to communicate what they do more cogently. The ultimate value of the workshop will emerge when scientists employ these lessons and the public and policymakers gain a richer appreciation of the research enterprise.
