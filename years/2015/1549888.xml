<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed EAGER combines recent advances in several scientific disciplines, including organic and polymer semiconductors, key materials behind highly flexible and intrinsically stretchable organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), single walled carbon nanotubes and silver nanowires spun out of efforts in nanomaterials development, and the demonstration of intrinsically stretchable polymer OLEDs and highly flexible CNT backplanes. &lt;br/&gt;This work will represent a major step forward in promoting practical application of wearable electronics, with the functional devices taking an innovative form factor, fabricated with non-toxic materials and by a low-cost process. Such displays will be light weight and stretchable.&lt;br/&gt;They can be folded like handkerchiefs into small sizes for easy portability and unfolded into large screens to plug in a number of small size portable electronics for use as large size, external screens. The displays can also conformally cover uneven surfaces and cope with body movement, thus making them wearable like human clothing.&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER will investigate the essential materials and scalable process for the demonstration of active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays that can be repeatedly stretched by 50%. All the components in such display including the OLEDs, thin-film transistors and interconnect are intrinsically stretchable. The simplicity and stretch ability of such new displays could offer important benefits such as deployment into large size displays from a small stowed volume onto uneven surfaces, compatibility with wearable electronic devices, and light weight.&lt;br/&gt;To achieve the above mentioned goals, the EAGER project will focus on the following research objectives: (1) Study of fundamental structure-property relationship essential for stretchable thin-film transistors. The research involves extensive exploration on materials design for the channel, the source/drain and the dielectric layers with superior stretch ability and inter-layer adhesion for ideal device performance ; (2) Integration of stretchable OLEDs and stretchable thin-film transistors. A set of RGB lighting pixels will be printed and connected to their neighboring transistors by ink-jet printing. The work involves the selection of light emitting materials for red, green and blue color emission and the optimization of printing process for uniform light emission.&lt;br/&gt;For broader dissemination of the research results and to improve awareness to the importance of advanced manufacturing for next generation flexible and stretchable electronics, the proposed research includes plans for educational outreach components, including research/teaching lab development and community college and local high school outreach programs. FSU College of Engineering is a joint venture between FAMU (an HBCU) and FSU.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The size of microchips has continued to shrink following the Moore&rsquo;s law during the past decades. This has led to more and more powerful and functional consumer electronics that has drastically improved the convenience of our daily life. Along with the advancement in rechargeable batteries that exhibit increased energy density, a number of the electronic devices are now have the characteristics of small size and light weight to fit into our pockets which has resulted in greatly enhanced portability. In contrast, the size of information displays has been seeing them grow larger: having a larger screen reduces the need to scroll through a document and can greatly increase productivity. Large external displays, such as projectors, can now connect to laptop and notepad computers for daily office work. However, carrying these large displays for travel is currently not practical given their large size and heavy weight. An ideal solution is to develop new displays that are light weight and highly flexible or even stretchable. Thus, they could be rolled up or folded into small sizes for easy portability and unfolded into large screens to plug into other small size portable electronics such as cell phones, smart watches, fitness trackers and Google glasses (Figure 1). In addition to enhanced portability, such displays could also conformally cover uneven surfaces and cope with body movement, or resemble the mechanic properties of human skin, which would enable new applications of wearable electronics for real-time health monitoring and diagnosis. This EAGER project is aimed to investigate the essential materials and processes for the demonstration of active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays that can be repeatedly stretched by 50%. To achieve this goal, the following research tasks have been accomplished (Figure 2 and 3): (1)&nbsp;Study the fundamental structure-property relationship essential for stretchable thin-film transistors; (2) Demonstrate intrinsically stretchable thin-film transistors using an all-printing process; (3) Invent new LED materials and device architectures that are fully printable and mechanically stretchable. This project has also provided training opportunities for students including ones from underrepresented minority groups to learn both experimental and analytic skills in advanced manufacturing of flexible and stretchable electronics.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/13/2017<br>      Modified by: Zhibin&nbsp;Yu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1549888/1549888_10373665_1489191153116_Stretchabledisplays--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1549888/1549888_10373665_1489191153116_Stretchabledisplays--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1549888/1549888_10373665_1489191153116_Stretchabledisplays--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">One potential application of stretchable OLED displays, which are light weight and can be stretchable from a small stowed volume into a large size displays for various portable electronics and next generation wearable displays and medical devices</div> <div class="imageCredit">Prof. Zhibin Yu/Chuan Wang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhibin&nbsp;Yu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1549888/1549888_10373665_1489191814895_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1549888/1549888_10373665_1489191814895_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1549888/1549888_10373665_1489191814895_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fully-printed and intrinsically stretchable carbon nanotube (CNT) thin-film transistors (TFTs) and integrated logic circuits</div> <div class="imageCredit">Prof. Chuan Wang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhibin&nbsp;Yu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1549888/1549888_10373665_1489191962012_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1549888/1549888_10373665_1489191962012_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1549888/1549888_10373665_1489191962012_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematically showing the fabrication processes of the stretchable perovskite LEDs, and photos of the light-emitting film before stretching and after stretching to ~100% strain</div> <div class="imageCredit">Prof. Zhibin Yu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhibin&nbsp;Yu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3.</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
