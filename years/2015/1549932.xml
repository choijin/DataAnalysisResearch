<AbstractNarration>Proteins carry out a vast range of critical activities including signaling, DNA replication, gene regulation, immune response, etc. Tandem mass spectrometry is the only high-throughput way to characterize these proteins in complex biological mixtures. This project will produce algorithms with the potential to dramatically improve the ability of proteomics scientists around the world to interpret their tandem mass spectrometry data, thereby providing critical insights into these fundamental biological processes. Because proteins are the primary functional molecules in the cell, such insights are foundational to our scientific understanding of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key intellectual contributions in this proposal lie in the development of novel machine learning methods for proteomics. Specifically, the project will develop novel methods for spectrum feature extraction, including deep neural network autoencoding and low-dimensional representation learning, learning deep similarity metrics that allow efficient spatial data access methods, applications of autoencoding for spectrum and experiment compression, submodular summarization methods on proteomic data, and classification and ranking methodologies that take advantage of network effects via a data embedding. These tools will then be used for proteomic metadata inference, cloud-based peptide and protein identification, and retrieval and ranking of similar proteomic experiments. The research will hence yield a profoundly more powerful, data-driven approach to jointly interpreting massive mass spectrometry data sets, thereby giving scientists valuable new tools to glean insights into protein function.</AbstractNarration>
