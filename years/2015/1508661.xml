<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular nanomagnets are nanometer scale magnets that produce a large magnetic field. Because of the quantum nature in their magnetism and capability to tune their magnetic properties, molecular nanomagnets are promising materials for future applications of nano-scale magnetic storage and quantum information processing devices. This project entails a research plan that integrates the investigation and control of quantum memory time, known as quantum decoherence time, in molecular nanomagnets with innovative inter-disciplinary educational and outreach activities centered at the University of Southern California (USC). The research activities focus on revealing the origin of quantum decoherence in molecular nanomagnets using unique magnetic resonance techniques to significantly improve quantum coherence. Furthermore, the project incorporates educational activities including research training and curriculum developments for USC graduate and undergraduate students as well as science experiences and outreach activities for high school and elementary school students in the neighborhood community of USC with a high concentration of under-represented population in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to investigate and control quantum coherence in molecular nanomagnets. Quantum decoherence has become one of the most pressing problems in many solid-state spin systems. Among the solid-state systems, molecular nanomagnets are excellent testbed for understanding nanomagnetism and for applications to dense magnetic storage and quantum spintronics devices because of their nanoscale size, quantum nature in the magnetism, physical and chemical stability, and capability to tune the magnetic properties and couplings to surrounding environments. In this research project, the principle investigator plans to investigates the nature of quantum decoherence in molecular magnets using novel magnetic resonance techniques to demonstrate long quantum coherence. Success in the proposed work will provide a promising pathway for developing molecular nanomagnets with desired coherent properties and setting a general platform for future science on molecular nanomagnet-based spin devices. Furthermore, the project incorporates educational activities including research training and curriculum developments for USC graduate and undergraduate students as well as science experiences and outreach activities for high school and elementary school students in the neighbourhood community of USC with a high concentration of under-represented population in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

Molecular nanomagnets are nanometer-sized magnets that possess properties of magnets at the molecular level. Molecular nanomagnets are promising materials for applications to dense quantum memory and quantum molecular spintronics. Through the research project, we have investigated the performance of molecular nanomagnets as a quantum memory, such as how long can we keep quantum information in molecular nanomagnets and a pathway to longer memory time.

With the research project, three (one female and two male) graduate students graduated with their Ph.D. Among them, two students became research scientists in high-tech companies. One student became a teaching faculty at colleges in the Los Angeles area. Additionally, one graduate student is expected to graduate with her Ph.D. in 2020 summer. Sixteen undergraduate students also obtained research training through this research project. Additionally, through the funding period, seven high school students were hosted by the PI?s research laboratory to obtain experience in the research.&nbsp; From the results of the project, 14 papers had been published.

The PI is the only faculty advisor in SCout. SCout has implemented classroom science sessions at five elementary schools. The enrollment of USC students keeps increasing. SCout has ~200 USC student members currently. As a faculty advisor, the PI secured an on-campus storage space to store the experiment items and provided liquid nitrogen for the cryogenic demonstration (~20 sessions per year). The PI also oversees safety in their activities. SCout has never had safety indents in SCout activities since we started in 2011. The PI was also active in exploring financial support for SCout.
