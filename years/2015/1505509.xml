<AbstractNarration>Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at his home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.  The award to the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The expansion of data availability in many large-scale, complex, and networked systems leads to a need to advance the understanding of learning from unbounded size and imbalanced data to support decision-making processes. An effective imbalanced learning system developed for the highly overlapped imbalanced classes involving rare diseases, abnormal behavior, or even trace explosive, can save money and human life. The knowledge developed from this project will contribute to improved clustering and classification algorithms. This project will also enhance the research experience and training of undergraduate students at UDC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will develop a computationally cheap context-sensitive intra-class clustering approach to overcome class overlapping problems by generating non-overlapping sub-clusters using context class data as a boundary. This novel algorithm can separate an arbitrary data distribution into non-overlapping unimodal clusters, while utilizing intervening context data distributions to further separate the clusters. A new swarm intelligence-based hybrid global optimization learning model will be developed to simultaneously optimize the feature subset and the tuning parameters of the least square support vector machine. Moreover, a novel particle swarm optimization self-organizing algorithm will be created to improve the classification performance through obtaining useful knowledge from the limited and underrepresented minority class data.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overall goal of this NSF Research Initiation Award: An Intelligent Optimization, Clustering and Classification Framework for High Dimensional, Overlapped Classes, and Imbalanced Data is to develop novel clustering and classification algorithms to mitigate the curse of dimensionality, minimize the overlap across clusters from different classes, and intensify the underrepresented class concepts for improved overall performance and less computational time. During 2015-2020, Dr. Zhang has mentored 12 undergraduate students, 4 Master's students, and 3 Ph.D. students on this Research Initiation Award (RIA) project. Dr. Zhang and her students have published 10 journal papers, 31 conference papers, and 16 abstracts on this project. The students have been trained to write papers under the mentorship of Dr. Zhang. They have published numerous journal papers - Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing (Impact Factor: 4.594), International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems (Impact Factor: 2.153), Cybernetics and Systems (Impact Factor: 1.433), International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools (Impact Factor: 0.689), and Complex Intelligent Systems (Impact Factor: 3.791). Additional journals include Applied System Innovation, WSEAS Transactions on Signal Processing, and Sports. Dr. Zhang's undergraduate research assistants have all got admirable professional jobs after graduation. The students have demonstrated impressive records of papers and research accomplishments, as well as conference experience in their resume. Her undergraduate research assistant has chosen Raytheon in Arlington, VA as an Associate Scientist out of six job offers he has received and graduated with BSEE degree in May 2020. Another of her undergraduate research assistants first received the prestigious scholarship from the Department of Defense (DoD) SMART Defense Education Program in 2016. Then in 2017, he accepted a full-time job from DoD Air Force as an Avionics Engineer. Other students also got full time jobs, such as a Data Analyst from BAE Systems, Software Engineer at Intel Corporation, Electrical Engineer at National Instruments, and Research Fellow at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Dr. Zhang provided advice and wrote recommendation letters for her research students to compete for the Student Travel Grant for the major professional conferences. Many of them have won the highly competitive grant to attend the conference and present their papers. Seven of her research undergraduate students received the prestigious Student Travel Grant for the Emerging Researchers National (ERN) Conference in STEM. One student also received the Student Travel Award (out of +1,800 applicants; 1 of 243 student travel awardees) for the 2015 15th Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS). Dr. Zhang has developed a new undergraduate course - ELEC 474 Special Topics Introduction to Machine Learning as part of this NSF Research Initiation Award Project. This course is unique in the sense that it addresses an important area in the intersection of photo-thermal infrared imaging and predictive modeling. She has also developed an additional new undergraduate course - BMEG 495 Special Topics Machine Learning for Medical Detection and Diagnoses. She has also developed a Ph.D. level course - ELEC 689 Machine Learning. Since machine learning is such a rapidly growing field, offering such courses provides students with a solid foundation as they embark their careers.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/21/2020<br>      Modified by: Nian&nbsp;Zhang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
