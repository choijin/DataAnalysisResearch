<AbstractNarration>While volatile elements like carbon are returned to the deep Earth at convergent tectonic margins like the Hikurangi Margin off the coast of New Zealand?s North Island, some carbon in marine sediments is released through volcanic and hydrothermal activity.  Geologic cycling of carbon ? both at settings like the Hikurangi Margin and globally ? is poorly understood and must be clarified to evaluate anthropogenic effects on the carbon budget.  This award supports the first concerted volatile sampling and analysis campaign aimed at elucidating where, relative to the Hikurangi Trench, slab-derived C is first detected in geothermal systems and how the extent of C release changes with distance from the trench. Field sampling and analysis will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Bruce Christenson of GNS Science, New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the overall carbon cycling budget, the sampling that will be conducted in the fore-arc, volcanic center (the Taupo Volcanic Zone), and back-arc regions of the North Island will be used to constrain cycling and devolatilization potential of various carbon, nitrogen, and helium reservoirs at different depths along the subducting slab.  Fore- and back-arc devolatilization processes are poorly understood, as are the particular geochemical reactions responsible for volatile release and the potential for carbonate in altered oceanic crust to contribute to carbon fluxes.  New volcanic, hydrothermal, and rock samples will enable more complete thermodynamic modeling of subduction zones, with local as well as global implications.  Comprehensive sampling and analysis will also permit refinement of standard models used to distinguish sources of volatiles released at subduction zones. This award is funded in collaboration with the Royal Society of New Zealand.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was designed to determine the initial sources of CO2 released at volcanic and hydrothermal sites along the Hikurangi margin of New Zealand?s North Island.  Samples were to be taken from hydrothermal sites such as hotsprings and mud volcanoes, as well as volcanic centers that are actively degassing CO2, to constrain how much CO2 comes from three sources: (1) from carbonate or limestone in sediments that are subducted beneath the North Island, (2) organic C in these same sediments, and (3) the part of the earth?s mantle that underlies this section of New Zealand.  We proposed to do this by measuring the C isotope composition of CO2 and He isotope ratio of gas samples that were to be collected in June-August, 2015.  Unfortunately, difficulties in obtaining permission to sample hydrothermal and volcanic sites led to only one sample being collected for the original purposes.  Upon analysis, this sample was found to contain significant air-derived He and CO2, making it unsuitable for the proposed research.  Because fieldwork was scheduled on White Island, an active volcano in the Bay of Plenty, NZ, I collected rock samples with the intention of determining the He isotope composition of fluid inclusions in phenocrysts to better understand how deep the fluids beneath this volcano originated.  However upon analyzing these samples at my home institution, I found that too little He was present to permit reliable measurements of isotope ratios.  While the samples collected during the field portion of this project proved unsuitable for the original project goals, I gained valuable understanding of the unique cultural and scientific challenges involved in collecting geologic samples in New Zealand.  I also gained additional familiarity with techniques for collecting and analyzing hydrothermal and volcanic gas samples.
