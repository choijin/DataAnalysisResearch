<AbstractNarration>To allow robots to achieve human-like dexterity, they not only need to be able to grasp objects, but also to move them within their hand.  Consider, for example, writing with a pen:  if all you could do was grasp it with your hand, and not move it between your fingers, you would not be able to write very well.  This project is about designing grasps and motions of the hand to create useful motions of the object in the hand.  The long-term goal is the development of control algorithms for robot hands to allow them to perform in-hand manipulation that allow them to function as assistants in human environments, which require human-like in-hand manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is a systematic framework for designing sliding in-hand manipulation.  A sliding-compliant grasp is both programmable and mechanically passive (and therefore stable).  In the "place" phase of pick-carry-place, sliding can be used to gain extra dexterity, controlling motions that cannot be reliably controlled by moving the grasped object with position control.  This is particularly true for recent human-interactive robots controlled with soft actuators with low positioning accuracy, like Baxter.   Sliding may be inevitable anyway, and therefore designing a grasp for the place operation can be as important as designing for the carry.  Controlled sliding also provides a means for compliant assembly without adding specialized hardware, like the RCC device.  Design of compliance for sliding includes the choice of the location and the normal forces of the grasping fingers, subject to equilibrium and force closure constraints, to shape the frictional limit surface to achieve a desired mapping from disturbing forces (inertial or contact forces) to corrective slipping motion.  An objective of the project is to demonstrate in-hand sliding manipulation for both quasistatic assembly tasks and for dynamic regrasping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In-hand manipulation, and specifically changing the grasp on an object within the hand, is a critical capability for improved dexterity of robot hands.  One example of an in-hand regrasp is a common technique for aligning the ends of a pair of grasped chopsticks:  pushing the chopsticks against a constraint, like a plate, so that the chopsticks slide within the hand to a configuration where they are more useful for picking things up.   This project developed two methods for motion planning and control of in-hand sliding regrasps by robot hands.  In one method, the fingers push the object against a constraint to ensure that they slide over the object to the desired new grasp locations.  In another method, the hand holding the object accelerates to cause the object to slip controllably in the hand.  Both methods were successfully demonstrated using a robot arm, hand, and vision system.   Other project results include a derivation of the equations of motion governing roll-slide motions of three-dimensional rigid bodies in contact.   Students working on this project engaged in educational outreach, particularly by helping with the design and filming of nearly 100 short YouTube videos to support a new textbook on robotic manipulation.  These videos collectively have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times and can be found at https://www.youtube.com/NorthwesternRobotics.  Students also developed practice exercises and other material supporting six MOOCs (massive open online courses) on Coursera, making up the "Modern Robotics" specialization at https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics.   These courses have been taken by thousands of students around the world.  Freely available materials supporting our new Modern Robotics textbook can be found at http://modernrobotics.org.
