<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at the University of North Florida (UNF) which is located in Jacksonville, Florida. A total of 10 undergraduates will participate in the 10-week program each summer for three years.  The theme of the program, which is hosted by the UNF Department of Biology, is focused on Coastal Biology, particularly threats to the biological resources of the north Florida coast. Coastal ecosystems represent some of the most biologically productive areas on Earth, but are also some of the most affected by human activity. Wide fluctuations in environmental conditions also occur frequently in coastal ecosystems. These factors influence all aspects of the biology of coastal organisms, from their molecular biology and genetics to the growth and survival of their populations. Students will have the opportunity to conduct independent research on a range of subjects related to coastal ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the program is to enhance the training and career development of early stage (rising Sophomores/Juniors) undergraduates who have not had significant research experience by engaging them in research related to the coastal ocean environment. Students will be recruited nationwide and from a variety of urban universities, including Edward Waters College (EWC). They will be paired with biologists from UNF or the collaborating institution Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve to conduct mentored research projects on major threats to coastal biological resources in North Florida. Students will develop short research proposals on their project which will be presented to faculty mentors and other REU participants in an oral format. In the final week, students will present the results of their studies in a poster session that is open to the UNF community. Students will also be encouraged to present their research findings at professional conferences and/or in manuscripts submitted to professional journals. Additional career guidance on topics such as designing research posters, scientific writing, finding and applying to graduate schools, and presenting scientific information to a public audience will be provided in workshops. Students will attend regular research seminars by UNF faculty, graduate students and scientists from other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of our project, Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Coastal Biology on Florida's First Coast, was to provide an intense mentored research training program focused on scientific studies taking place in areas along the Atlantic coast of Florida.  Each year, 10 undergraduate students from around the country converged on Jacksonville, Florida, to take part in this program.  Each of the students was paired with a faculty mentor working in their area of interest and the students would conduct a research project over the course of 10 weeks.  In addition to providing research experience, each of the students was also trained in a variety of essential life- and career-building skills. The overarching goal of the program is to aid in the recruitment and retention of students in the biological sciences to produce the next generation of scientists.  To achieve this goal our program attempted to select participants that were relatively young in their college career and that hadn't had access to significant research experience to that point. We also attempted to involve a large proportion of students from minority groups that are currently underrepresented in scientific fields.  This will allow for a more diverse field of future scientists and provides for greater growth by targeting students that have historically been ignored.      The goals of our program were definitely met.  Of the 30 participants in the program between 2016 and 2018, more than 83% were students that had only finished one or two years of college coursework.  More than half were from schools that do not award PhDs in biology or related scientific fields, and therefore, have limited opportunities for undergraduate students to get involved in research projects.  Furthermore, 60% of the participants were from minority groups that are currently underrepresented in the sciences. Aside from the overall participation numbers, the results of surveys of our participants indicate that the long-term goals are also being met.  Nearly all of our past participants have remained in a scientific field and many are either considering, or currently attending graduate schools in a scientific field.  Many of the students remark that participation in our program has helped them become better students and that it increased their interest in going to graduate school and ultimately getting a scientific career.      Students involved in our program have also been involved in a number of activities after leaving our program.  A total of 23 of the 30 students have presented the findings of their research at least once at regional, national or international scientific conferences. Three of our past students are co-authors on scientific journal articles.  Some have won impressive graduate fellowships or awards for best student presentations.  There is no doubt that our program has succeeded in helping train the next generation of scientists and in providing young students with the skills, confidence and experience necessary to be successful in graduate schools and in scientific careers.
