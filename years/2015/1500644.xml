<AbstractNarration>The investigator will continue long-term research into the study of symmetries and some of their applications.  Symmetry is a mathematical concept with direct applications in other sciences such as chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering.  The study of algebra, of which this research is a part, is in many ways the study of symmetries.  This project aims to advance understanding of important algebraic structures, with potential applications to number theory and theoretical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is concerned with symmetry breaking, that is, obtaining representations of a smaller Lie group from the representations of a large reductive semi-simple Lie group.  The representations of the large group are usually infinite dimensional, and the representations of smaller groups are related to quotients of the original representation of the large group.  Symmetry breaking of representations is far from well understood, and so the constructions and the understanding of examples are very important. This research has applications to number theory and possibly to theoretical physics.  Many of the techniques used in these constructions are analytic, and thus some new, interesting, and challenging problems in analysis arise and need to be solved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Merit :  Many problems in mathematics, physics and even in real life have a symmetry. These symmetries are extremely important to  solve problems in engineering (for example in robotics) and also in physics and mathematics. For example, to determine the path along which a ball might roll on an surface, we use that it is  round, i.e. invariant under rotations.  In the grant , an  interesting symmetric problem is studied and how its solution changes if its symmetry  changes, and becomes smaller, i.e. if the symmetry is broken. In the previous example the symmetry is broken if the ball suddenly has a small dent and so is no longer invariant under all rotations, but only under rotations around one axis.  A complete solution is obtained to our problem.  Impact:   The techniques introduced in  this research are completely new and the results are surprisingly beautiful. Some of these results are used to obtain a solution to a 25 year old problem in mathematics and to work out a generalization of some well known formulas.   I attended physics conferences and workshops to introduce the new techniques and results to colleagues who work in theoretical physics.   I expect that this will lead to more work in this area of mathematics.       Last Modified: 10/02/2019       Submitted by: Birgit Speh]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
