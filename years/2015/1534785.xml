<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on developing the process required to produce fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) rebar at scale.  FRP rebar offers significant performance advantages when compared to uncoated steel rebar.  These advantages include a sevenfold weight reduction, no corrosion - which in turn permits a 30% reduction in concrete usage (and a corresponding 15 billion ton reduction in CO2 emissions) - and equivalent tensile strength at smaller diameters compared to steel rebar products.  FRP rebar is being produced but has limited market acceptance due to its high cost.  The high-speed process to be developed in this project will allow price parity when compared to uncoated steel and enable a hundredfold improvement in process speeds compared to current FRP manufacturing.  Combined, these improvements will allow entry to the $140 billion global market for steel rebar and allow mass market adoption of FRP rebar.  Additionally, basalt mine waste will be explored and, where possible, utilized as a raw material for fiber production.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes job creation and environmental impacts.  With implementation of this process up to 35 manufacturing jobs can be created immediately.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The company's high speed process combines a thermoset resin and basalt fiber as primary reinforcements within the FRP composite.  A consortium of pultruders has collectively organized the Fiber Reinforced Polymer Rebar Manufacturers Council and has developed FRP rebar into a viable product over the last 20 years, with a $1.2 billion market at present.  Currently, no FRP rebar product is offered at price parity with uncoated steel rebar, and to reach this price parity a high speed process has been invented.  This novel process will be optimized and further developed by the completion of this Phase II SBIR project.  Basalt fiber, an emerging material with the potential to replace carbon and other fibers in a variety of applications will be brought into large-scale industrial usage with the completion of this project.  The Phase I project permitted the determination of the performance characteristics of thermoset resins which have not been commonly used in pultrusion, enabling product validation.  This Phase II project will address a range of manufacturing challenges that will be encountered in the production of FRP rebar at industrial scale, allowing a commercially viable final product that can be offered at price parity with steel rebar.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave the infrastructure in the United States a D+ grade in its 2017 report card.   The ASCE has identified key solutions within investment, leadership and planning, and preparing for the future that are designed to improve this score.  Specifically the ASCE has said that new approaches, new materials and new technologies are required to make the infrastructure in the United States more robust and resilient.   Currently the concrete construction industry uses steel predominately for concrete reinforcement.  While steel rebar is ubiquitous; it suffers from numerous disadvantages with corrosion and heavy weight being the primary issues.  This results in a finite life of concrete and composite rebar is a material that can solve these problems.   This National Science Foundation (NSF) project advanced a high speed manufacturing process that allows composite rebar to beat steel rebar.  This high speed manufacturing process allows composite rebar to be used in a variety of applications that could not be considered previously.  Where high value infrastructure such as bridges and parking structures could only be considered, now applications such as slab-on-grade concrete can utilize composite rebar.  This means a large portion of concrete infrastructure can now enjoy longer life, lower maintenance, and overall improved performance.   This project focused on the manufacturing aspects of this high speed manufacturing process.  This project allowed Neuvokas to utilize funding to design new equipment, optimize existing equipment, and reduce overall cost to manufacture basalt fiber reinforced composite rebar.  By utilizing NSF funding Neuvokas was able to attract other funding that was used towards marketing and sales efforts.  As a new business a first-class sales and marketing effort is key to overall market penetration.  NSF funding was a significant "seed" that allowed the Company to successfully create a marketable product, process, and prepare the market for that product.
