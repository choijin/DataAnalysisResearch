<AbstractNarration>A longstanding problem in astrophysics is to understand how our own Milky Way Galaxy formed and developed throughout its lifetime.  One important aspect of understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way is to study the supermassive black hole (called Sgr A*) at its center and how the black hole interacts with the rest of the Galaxy.  The proximity of Sgr A* provides an excellent laboratory in which to investigate two intertwined processes: how stars are formed in the vicinity of the black hole and how their stellar winds are subsequently captured.  This project will apply observation and theory to identify sites of current star formation very close to Sgr A* (within 2 parsecs) and will test ideas about how stars are formed in this environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators have an extensive history in communicating science and research to the public and are committed to continuing these efforts over the course of this project.  The team also includes two graduate students who have developed Galactic center lessons, some of which incorporate the WorldWide Telescope (WWT) visualization system, for high school and community college classrooms throughout the Chicago area.  The team will create and share two WWT tours on the topic of the Galactic center and the Milky Way Galaxy.  Team members will use data, WWT tours and videos in public talks on the Galactic center black hole, a very popular topic to schools and numerous astronomical societies.  The team will make FITS images related to this project available to professional and citizen science communities.  They will make JPEG images from the FITS files and embed Astronomical Visual Metadata information into the image headers.  The FITS and JPEG images, WWT tours and videos will be hosted at Northwestern University and will be accessible through a searchable content-managed web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine star formation where the tidal and radiative effects by Sgr A* are significant.  Their multi-wavelength approach (e.g., VLA, ALMA, VLT, SMA and CARMA) will examine water masers, compact H-II regions, SED fitting of protostars, proplyds and SiO outflows in the molecular ring and will identify protostellar outflows lying within 2 pc of Sgr A*.  In addition, the team will determine the mass accretion rate onto Sgr A* by measuring the mass loss rate of ionized winds from young stars using radio techniques.  The processes that lead to accretion are closely related to star formation in the nucleus of our Galaxy as well as in the nuclei of galaxies that host massive black holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailed observations of the inner parsec of the Galactic center have primarily been conducted at infrared wavelengths using Keck and VLT telescopes.  The recent upgrading of the VLA and commissioning of ALMA present an opportunity to apply novel techniques at radio and millimeter wavelengths to examine two related topics, star formation and accretion onto Sgr A*.  These new capabilities will allow the team to use massive stars to register the radio and infrared frames with milliarcsecond accuracy and to determine the proper motion of stars orbiting Sgr A*.  The accurate positioning of stars near the supermassive black hole will probe general-relativistic curvature of space-time by measuring periastron shift.  The investigators will use a novel pragmatic approach to studying the disk mode of star formation near the tidally stressed environment of Sgr A*.  The project may have far reaching implications on the nature of star formation and AGN activity in the nuclei of more active galaxies hosting massive black holes.</AbstractNarration>
