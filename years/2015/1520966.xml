<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Ikaros Bigi, Antonio Delgado, and Adam Martin at the University of Notre Dame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the successful discovery of the Higgs particle, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has just resumed taking data.  This new data is likely to show the need to modify our current Standard Model of particle physics in order to accommodate new particles and perhaps even new interactions.  Professors Bigi, Delgado, and Martin propose to analyze this possibility within the framework of exotic models such as supersymmetry, strongly coupled Higgs sectors, and extra spacetime dimensions.  As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical law.  This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts, as the PI's will engage in the teaching of physics at the undergraduate and graduate level, lecturing at graduate physics summer schools and organizing workshops and conferences around the world, and teaching particle physics to high-school teachers and students through QuarkNet, both nationally and internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, a careful study of how the new data can be accommodated into models of new physics will be performed.  Simulations of collider data will be run to see if any excesses reported by the LHC can be explained in one particular model.  Professors Delgado and Martin will try to implement new search strategies for situations where standard techniques fail to discover new physics.  Professor Bigi will pay special attention into the implications of new physics on processes that lead to violations of flavor.  Such situations are very rare in the Standard Model but nonetheless can provide a smoking gun for new models of particle physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The LHC has been running since 2008, after the discovery of the Higgs in 2012 it is now entering the era of new discoveries. The theoretical group at the Notre Dame has been actively engage into several aspects relevant for the LHC in order to make sure we use all the potential of the machine. During the last three years we have done the following project:  -Try to find new ways of characterizing new particles.  -Using complementary ideas to understand what Dark Matter is and to see what are the bes strategies to discover it both using the LHC or astrophysical probes like telescopes.  -We have worked very close with experimentalist to try to see what new variables can be introduce in the analysis to make sure we explare all possible avenues for new physics processes.  -Very rare processes can also be another place where new physics show up so the group have been involved in carefully studying those processes to make sure everything is understood.  -We have also worked very closely with our local high schools to make sure that these exciting times for particle physics can be adequately transmitted to the classroom to make sure a new generation of physicist exists with the best of preparations.
