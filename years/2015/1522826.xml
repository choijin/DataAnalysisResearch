<AbstractNarration>The project addresses a major challenge facing STEM education: the ability for underprepared ninth graders to succeed in Algebra 1 courses.  While many urban districts are utilizing extended-time Algebra I classes, most do not have a coherent, carefully-integrated program that addresses the various needs of underprepared learners, including the social-emotional, language and literacy, and organizational aspects of learning. Most districts tether together resources for extended-time algebra classes, and do not provide professional development to the teachers of the course, who tend to be younger, less-experienced teachers. The proposed initiative to scale up Intensified Algebra in urban districts has the potential to increase high school graduation rates, given the link of successful completion of Algebra I to high school graduation. It also has the potential to increase the number of students who pursue STEM related majors and fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the I-Corp initiative, the team proposes to create a new advocacy and marketing approach for Intensified Algebra (IA) to reach large, urban school districts. Innovative content for advocacy briefings and materials will be developed. The team's goal is to create novel ways to reach senior leaders in districts (e.g., superintendents, mathematics curriculum directors). Present marketing approaches for IA concentrate heavily on the components and design rationale for IA. Initial thoughts on directions for the new marketing approach include focusing district leaders on a cost-benefit analysis of intensifying struggling students' mathematics experience in 9th grade to support their success versus 'paying later' via credit-recovery; and synthesizing and presenting in compelling ways research that supports the power of intensification efforts (e.g., longer-term benefits of extended-time, 9th grade algebra initiatives, including higher graduation rates and higher rates of students taking advanced math and science courses; the importance of non-cognitive factors in helping struggling students succeed, and the ways in which IA incorporates those in the program; and the importance of affording struggling students opportunities to learn rich and meaningful mathematics).</AbstractNarration>
