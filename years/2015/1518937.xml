<AbstractNarration>The "Smoky Great Plains Geometry Conference" will  be held at Wichita State University on March 17-20, 2014. The conference will feature important areas of geometry and geometric analysis with leading researchers as speakers. There will be 13 plenary lectures with plenty of time between talks to encourage discussion and the interchange of ideas.  The funding will help to involve early-career mathematicians, including graduate students and postdocs. Particular attention will be paid to identifying and supporting women and other members of underrepresented groups. The organizers have pledged that at least 50% of the speakers at the conference will be female. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the conference is on metric geometry in the broadest possible sense and the relationship between global metric geometry and topology, including methods of Riemannian and Semi-Riemannian geometry as well as Alexandrov geometry and other singular geometric spaces. Key areas represented will be Metric geometry, Geometric flows, Lorentzian Geometry, Einstein Metrics, Ricci solitons and Mathematical General Relativity. The overlap between these areas makes very real the possibility for cross-collaboration among the participants. &lt;br/&gt;The webpage for the conference can be found at: http://www.math.wichita.edu/SGPGeometryConference/</AbstractNarration>
