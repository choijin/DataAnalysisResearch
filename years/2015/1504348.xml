<AbstractNarration>The Arctic freshwater (FW) system is likely to undergo considerable change in coming decades with downstream impacts on ocean circulation, climate, and ecosystems.  An ability to understand and project these impacts, in turn, will have important socio-economic influences on fisheries, energy distribution, and reinsurance industries, amongst others.  However, the reliability of climate projections is uncertain and there is only a limited understanding of the importance of natural variability in the midst of anthropogenically forced change.  This project seeks to address these issues through a series of modeling experiments and comparison of the model results with observational and reanalysis data sets.  This project will contribute to STEM workforce development through provision of support to a young, early-career, female PI during the formative years of her career and support for the training of a graduate student.  The PI will leverage her connections with the National Center for Atmospheric Research to include project results in their outreach exhibits for the general public.  Results will also be included in public talks and university lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the following major science questions:&lt;br/&gt;1. Do climate models show a consistent picture of projected Arctic Ocean FW changes during the 21st century and beyond? Are there obvious reasons for the model differences (e.g., resolution, sea ice model complexity, number of straits through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, etc.)?&lt;br/&gt;2. How large is the role of internal variability for different terms of the Arctic FW budget in climate simulations? How does this affect uncertainty in future projections at various timescales? How large does an ensemble need to be in order to capture the magnitude of internal variability?&lt;br/&gt;3. How well do simulated FW components in Fram Strait and the switchyard region agree with observations from the last decade? What are the dynamics that lead to changes in FW from different sources?&lt;br/&gt;To address these questions, first the Arctic Ocean freshwater (FW) budget in the suite of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations for the 20th and 21st century will be assessed, followed by an analysis of the role of internal variability of terms of the Arctic FW budget in a large ensemble of simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Finally, the contribution of FW from different sources in Fram Strait and the Arctic switchyard region in the CESM will be compared with observations using new simulated FW tracers, and the Arctic Ocean dynamics leading to the variability of FW from different sources will be investigated. The Arctic Ocean FW budget has not been analyzed for the new generation of climate models participating in CMIP5, despite the changes that can be expected compared to CMIP3 due to the improvements to the simulation of the Arctic sea ice and the additional open passages in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The use of the large CESM ensemble provides an unique opportunity to assess the role of internal variability in terms of the Arctic FW budget, and comparisons to across-model scatter from CMIP5 will allow insight on the sources of uncertainty in future projections. Furthermore, the use of FW tracers in the CESM will allow a more detailed comparison with a new set of observations and will enable analysis of the dynamics that lead to the observed interannual variability of FW from different sources in two key regions in the Arctic.</AbstractNarration>

This modeling study highlighted the importance of not only the amount, but also the pathway that freshwater takes as it leaves the Arctic. Relatedly, we also showed that the sea ice pathways within the Arctic are projected to change dramatically over the 21<sup>st</sup> century under all emissions scenarios as with long-distance sea ice transport pathways disappearing by 2100, in favor of short-distance pathways (Figure 2), with important implications for the dispersion of contaminants and nutrients transported by sea ice within the Arctic and to regions outside the Arctic (DeRepentigny et al., 2020). Arctic sea ice was also shown to be very sensitive to the 0.5&#730;C difference in the 1.5&#730;C to 2&#730;C IPCC global warming targets, with the potential to avoid ice-free conditions before 2100 if global warming is limited to 1.5&#730;C, but ice-free conditions every 2-3 years after the 2050s under 2&#730;C of global warming (Jahn 2018, see Figure 3). Scenario differences in the 21<sup>st</sup> century also impact the oceanic freshwater fluxes, but with less dramatic differences between the different possible future evolutions (Zanowski, Jahn, and Holland, 2020, see Figure 4). The newest generation of climate models all agree on the general direction of the changes in the Arctic freshwater system, with liquid freshwater storage and fluxes predicted to increase and solid freshwater storage and fluxes predicted to decrease over the 21st century. Despite this generally robust projection of the Arctic freshwater system changes, we also identified a large uncertainty in the projection of the Arctic freshwater fluxes west of Greenland, where the models disagree on the sign of the change in the first half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Zanowski, Jahn, and Holland, 2020).</p> <p>Quantifying the contribution of internal variability to observed changes in the Arctic freshwater budget was another goal of this project. We showed that when accounting for internal variability, the observed increase in the liquid freshwater in the Arctic is likely already the result of a forced change (Jahn and Laiho, 2020; see Figure 5). Forced changes in the freshwater fluxes from the Arctic are likely to emerge in the next decades, starting with fluxes through the Nares and Davis straits. In those straits, this change may have already begun although it will take a few more years to detect a forced signal from observations due to the large internal variability in the fluxes. The observed decline of the Arctic sea ice cover also includes a contribution from internal variability, but the effect of internal variability is neither uniform in space nor in different parts of the year (England, Jahn and Polvani, 2019). Specifically, we showed that while the observed spring sea ice loss has so far been dominated by internal variability, the contribution of internal variability to late summer sea ice loss is highly spatially variable, ranging from less than 10% of the late summer East Siberian Sea sea ice loss to more than 60% of the late summer Kara Sea sea ice loss.</p> <p>With the findings detailed above, this project has achieved the major goals it set out to accomplish: The insights from the studies we have performed have advanced the understanding of the variability and change of the solid and liquid components of the Arctic freshwater budget as well as provided a basis for future studies of the Arctic climate system and identified model biases that need to be improved in the future. Furthermore, it has allowed an all-female team of scientists to advance their careers.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Alexandra&nbsp;Jahn</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1504348/1504348_10380691_1603470888561_ArcticMap--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1504348/1504348_10380691_1603470888561_ArcticMap--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Arctic Ocean with its gateways."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1504348/1504348_10380691_1603470888561_ArcticMap--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Arctic Ocean with its gateways."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: Arctic Ocean with its gateways.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Figure from Zanowski, Jahn, and Holland (2020, submitted)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexandra&nbsp;Jahn</div> <div class="imageTitle">Arctic Ocean with its gateways.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1504348/1504348_10380691_1603472589356_Figure2_FinalReport_Transnational--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1504348/1504348_10380691_1603472589356_Figure2_FinalReport_Transnational--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Change in the average transit times of sea ice"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1504348/1504348_10380691_1603472589356_Figure2_FinalReport_Transnational--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Change in the average transit times of sea ice"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2: Change in the average transit times of sea ice for the 15 pathways with the largest transnational ice flux between the late 20th century (grey) and the mid (blue) and late 21st century under a high emissions scenario (yellow) and a low emissions scenario (green).</div> <div class="imageCredit">From DeRepentigny, P., Jahn, A., Tremblay, L.
