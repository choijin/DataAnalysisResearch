<AbstractNarration>#1511498&lt;br/&gt;Wyslouzil, Barbara E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The streaming vapor trail near an airplane's wing during takeoff or landing illustrates condensation in a high-speed flow initiated by heterogeneous nucleation. The air cools as it passes over the wing, and its relative humidity starts to exceed 100%. This unstable situation drives water condensation on particles forming a cloud. The same phenomenon can play an important role in many other engineering applications including energy extraction from low pressure steam turbines, dehydration and heavy hydrocarbon removal from natural gas, and development of hypersonic wind tunnels. Unfortunately, there are few experimental data to test theories of heterogeneous nucleation at the extreme conditions in these devices. This project will use a supersonic nozzle apparatus to measure rates of heterogeneous nucleation, rates at which particles grow, and the size and structure of the final droplets.  All of these are crucial for developing accurate models of heterogeneous condensation in industrial processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores heterogeneous nucleation under highly non-equilibrium conditions that occur in supersonic flows and investigates the resulting particle growth and structure.  Vapor-carrier gas mixtures containing two condensable species will flow through a supersonic nozzle. The seed aerosol will be produced by homogeneous nucleation and growth of the lower vapor pressure condensable under conditions where the higher vapor pressure condensable is subsaturated.  As the flow continues to cool, the higher vapor pressure material will become supersaturated and will nucleate on the preexisting aerosol. Static pressure measurements will characterize the flow, spatially resolved small and wide angle X-ray scattering will characterize the aerosol, and infrared spectroscopy will quantify the distribution of the condensable between the vapor, liquid and solid states. A one-dimensional flow model that incorporates heterogeneous nucleation and growth will be tuned to match experimental observations to yield estimates for the heterogeneous nucleation rates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding condensation in high speed flows  - whether it is initiated by homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation - is critical in a broad range of engineering applications. The streaming vapor trail that forms near an airplane's wing during takeoff or landing is a perfect illustration of this phenomenon. As the air passes over the wing it cools, and the relative humidity starts to exceed 100%. This unstable situation drives the water to find a surface to condense on - in this case the particles that naturally exist in the air or are exiting the airplane engines - forming the cloud. The same phenomenon can play an important role in many other engineering applications including energy extraction from low pressure steam turbines, dehydration and heavy hydrocarbon removal from natural gas, and development of hypersonic wind tunnels. Unfortunately, there is little experimental data available to test the viability of heterogenous nucleation theories at the extreme conditions that exist in these devices.  Intellectual Merit.  The overarching goal of the proposed research was to explore heterogeneous nucleation under the highly non-equilibrium conditions that occur in supersonic flows and to investigate the resulting particle growth and structure.  In particular we asked, what sets the limits to the supersaturation of the condensable vapors given the presence of particles? How do seed particle size and composition affect this process? Once the composite particles are formed, how does their shape, structure, and composition evolve?  To address these questions, we used a supersonic nozzle apparatus to produce seed aerosols by homogeneous nucleation and growth of a low vapor pressure condensable such as water or a short chain alkane. Under most experimental conditions, the high vapor pressure condensable - generally CO2 - was still subsaturated. Thus, after seed aerosol formation the flow continued to cool until the CO2 reached a high enough supersaturation to nucleate onto the preexisting aerosol. In almost all cases we studied, the highest supersaturation reached in the presence of particles corresponded to the conditions along the (extrapolated) vapor-liquid equilibrium line even though temperatures were far below the triple point, i.e. the solid was the stable phase.

Although we did not anticipate that we would be able to observe and quantify the condensation of pure CO2, we were able to do so. Thus, we extended the work to better understand the transition between heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation under these highly saturated conditions.  Broader Impacts  In a broader context, our work developed novel applications of small and wide angle X-ray scattering, vibrational spectroscopy, and high speed flow modeling that address fundamental problems in aerosol science.
