<AbstractNarration>In an increasingly globally connected world, solutions to real world problems are complex in nature and often outside the boundaries of traditional practice. Thus, future practicing engineers need to be supported through educational systems that teach them not only technical skills, but professional skills such as awareness of social and cultural implications of their designs, understanding and appreciation of diversity, and additional skills in project management, collaboration, and effective communication.  The EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service) program is an example of an innovation in engineering education which has been shown to present engineering in context, prepare students for the profession, impact their engineering identity, as well as significantly improve the diversity of those participating.  In this project, an EPICS program is being established at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT).  A unique aspect of this program is that it is institutionalizing existing collaborative design opportunities with a tribal college, the Oglala Lakota College and establishing 50% of the design projects to meet critical needs of stakeholders on the Pine Ridge Reservation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is investigating the impacts of service learning on participating students' intellectual diversity, critical thinking skills, and attitudes towards sustainability, social awareness, stakeholder involvement in engineering design by applying advanced assessment tools, including the Herrmann Brain Dominance Inventory, Reasoning About Current Issues Test, and the Lancaster Approaches to Studying Questionnaire. This project will increase critical thinking skills, engage culturally and intellectually diverse students, and improve student attitudes concerning their engineering studies and engineering as a profession.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In an increasingly globally connected world, solutions to real world problems are complex in nature and often outside the boundaries of traditional practice. Thus, future practicing engineers need to be supported through educational systems that teach them not only technical skills, but professional skills such as awareness of social and cultural implications of their designs, understanding and appreciation of diversity, and additional skills in project management, collaboration, and effective communication.  The EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service) program is an example of an innovation in engineering education which has been shown to present engineering in context, prepare students for the profession, impact their engineering identity, as well as significantly improve the diversity of those participating.  In this project, an EPICS program (EPICS@mines) was established at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT), engaging over 60 multidisciplinary students in community projects during the award period; it is the first member of the EPICS Consortium that partners with a tribal college, Oglala Lakota College, and focuses over 50% of its projects on meeting the needs of Native American community partners.  Through the establishment of the EPICS@mines program, unique partnerships were formally established through two Memorandums of Agreement between the university and the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe to involve students in service learning projects that directly meet the needs of the tribes.     Through this project, investigations provided quantitative measurements that definte the relationship between service learning experiences and student outcomes through mulit-institutional student surveys that included data collection on students both enrolled in and not enrolled in EPICS programs at the lower level and upper level at SDSMT and Purdue University.  Focus groups and Small Group Instructional Diagnosis (SGID) conducted with students participcating in EPICS@mines provided additional measurements of student attitudes and learning outcomes. Critical thinking skills were measured by the Critical Thinking Assessment Test (CAT) and intercultural competence were measured by the Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI).     The Intellectual Merits of the project include:  The assessment of student attitudes due to participation in service learning projects indicate substantial gains in students’ perceptions of the importance of real world projects, multidisciplinary projects, stakeholder engagement in design, sustainability, and considerations of culture and diversity in the design process. The validation that vertically integrated, team-based, open-ended, real world service projects will measurably improve critical thinking; it was further noted that students’ critical thinking skills are statistically lower for upper-level undergraduate engineering students not involved in EPICS than for lower level undergraduate engineering students. The validation that involvement in EPICS improves students’ intercultural competency, as measured by the IDI. The validation that involvement in EPICS results in substantial improvements in student diversity, with EPICS@mines participation of 20% Native American students and 38% women, as compared to under 4% and 18% in engineering programs at SDSMT.        The Broader Impacts are an inherent attribute of any well-developed service-learning program in that they both actively engage students in socially relevant projects and provide service to the community.  In particular, this project:  Actively engaged Native American students and community members as collaborators; Increased student awareness of societal issues; Provided real design solutions to meet the needs of community partners, including addressing the critical needs of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.
