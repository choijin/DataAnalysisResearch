<AbstractNarration>The proposal is to enable students from educational institutions in the United States to attend the CPSWeek 2015 collection of conferences, which are to be held April 13-17, 2015, in Seattle, Washington. CPSWeek is an annual international multi-conference for Cyber-Physical Systems, comprising five major multi-day conferences, multiple one-day workshops and tutorials. It moves from country to country each year. Attending the conference will provide students with a unique opportunity to listen to and learn from the keynote speeches, presentations, posters and demos on cutting edge topics on cyber-physical systems, and to network with both leaders and other young researchers in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CPS research is expected to have positive societal impacts in many areas, including transportation, energy, agriculture, water/sewage treatment, environmental management and manufacturing systems. These systems must operate safely, dependably, securely, efficiently and respond to events in real time. A key feature of CPS research is the requirement to cooperate across disciplines such as computer science, computer architecture and hardware, materials science and sensor design, software engineering, networking, and control engineering. In this inherently interdisciplinary field, where collaborations are essential, meeting other researchers is especially important. CPSWeek brings together the U.S. and international CPS research community. For these reasons, strong participation in this event, especially among students (our next generation of researchers) is important to maintaining and advancing CPS research in the U.S. In particular, this project supports students from groups and institutions that are underrepresented in the CPS research community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this proposal was to broaden student participation in CPS Week 2015 and its four constituent conferences: HSCC, ICCPS, IPSN, and RTAS, held from April 13-16, 2015 in Seattle, Washington, USA.  Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are characterized by a tight coupling between cyber (sensing and computation) and physical (actuating) components. This coupling enables intelligent monitoring, coordination, and control of the physical system, leading to significant improvements in reliability, efficiency, safety, and sustainability. CPS is expected to drive significant technological and economic growth in the coming decades, in diverse sectors including manufacturing, energy, health care, and transportation.   Funds were requested for the following reasons: 1. To broaden participation of U.S. students at CPS Week 2015 in Seattle, Washington. Students will have the opportunity to listen to keynote speeches, presentations, posters, and demos on cutting edge topics in CPS, and to actively participate by giving talks, presenting posters, and performing demos. Students will also have the opportunity to network with leaders and other young researches in CPS. 2. To encourage students from underrepresented groups and institutions, as well as students who traditionally are unable to attend CPS conferences, to join the CPS community. 3. To advance the science and technology of CPS by promoting original research in embedded systems, hybrid systems, real-time systems, and sensor networks, and cross-disciplinary research between these areas. 4. To support the ACM/IEEE Conferences on Cyber-Physical Systems as the premier forum for presenting breakthroughs in cyber-physical systems.   Received funding will be used to partially support travel, registration, and hotel accommodation for students from U.S. universities. Each travel grant for conference attendance will be provided in the form of a stipend of $1,500. Priority will be for students who cannot otherwise attend and to increase diversity of participants.

Students will need to provide proof of conference registration in order to be eligible for the stipend.   Broader Impacts : The proposal advances and broadens student participation in this critical and growing area, and will foster collaboration among researchers from disciplines including computer science, control theory, networking, materials science and sensor design, embedded systems, computer architecture and hardware, and security. A key component of the proposed project will be encouraging women and underrepresented minority groups to participate in the field of CPS. A total of 24 students were funded by this grant, allowing many of them to attend the CPS week. As part of the funding, we also requested that these students serve as volunteers for the CPS week. They were willing and helped with the event in addition to attending the event.   NSF committed $35K and we gave 23 students the stuipdent of $1500 and one student  who applied late an amount of $500 to fully expend all the allocated funds.  Professors Andrew Clark, Baosen Zhang, Sreeram Kannan and Sam Burden served in the selection committee to choose the students. Due to adequate funding, we were able to suport all the  requests that were received.   Student names and their affiliations are listed below.
