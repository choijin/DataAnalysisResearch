<AbstractNarration>This project aims to build Smart Buttons, a bio-enabled wearable device weighing less than 2 grams. A network of smart buttons will be built that scales from a few buttons for each person individually to over a hundred of buttons for a crowd. This network simultaneously records, generates, compiles posture and interaction data spanning various scenarios, time scales and physical settings. The smart button platform will be able to assist domain scientists in understanding human posture and behavior as well as social interaction in a crowd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual contributions include a novel bio-enable design philosophy and a set of concrete approaches to seamlessly integrate computation with bio-enabled functions. Subjects (e.g., humans) are treated not only as the source of information, but also as the source of functionality. Unlike electronic computation functions, bio-enabled functions are highly unpredictable and have inherent uncertainty in both measurement and control. The research explores (i) how computation from electronic systems interact with physical bio-enabled functions from living subjects, and (ii) how to integrate these functions. The proposal work first demonstrates a few cases of bio-enabled functions and their effectiveness, including bio-enabled proximity detection, ranging, bio-enabled on-demand sensing, bio-enabled networking and energy management. After these case studies, reusable patterns are extracted, and principles and methodologies to design bio-enabled wearable devices are derived. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research can be used in the future by domain scientists to support (i) individual's behavior predictions and generalizations, and (ii) crowd social interaction modeling and control.  The broader impact of this work includes (i) utilizing the smart button technology to analyze teaching effectiveness and reveal the issues and desired features in a teaching environment; (ii) improving curriculum development with hand-on smart button projects; (iii) raising interest in technology among K-12 students and under-represented minority groups through smart button demos in open houses; and (iv) supporting talented female and minority PhD students to successfully accomplish their doctoral studies. The ultimate impact of the smart button technology is to provide a low-cost open experimental platform for behavior/social scientists, leading to a solid foundation for a new science of social interaction. The principles based on bio-feedback can give rise to new paradigms, principles, theory and methods in computer system control with bio-in-the-loop.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Wearable devices such as smart watches and pendants are proliferating. The sensors in these devices have great potential to accumulate important information about an individual&rsquo;s behavior and his physiological state. Careful and private use of this information can benefit many individuals such as the elderly living alone and those interested in wellness support. This project created Smart Buttons, a bio-enabled wearable device weighing less than 10 grams. Instead of building yet another miniaturized wearable device, a transformative architecture was created where the design constraints (e.g., form factor, cost and energy) make it critically necessary to leverage bio-enabled functions to achieve a feasible design. In this context bio-enabled functions refer to the specific human behavior or physiological state being monitored, and this allows a highly efficient hardware and software implementation. However, due to difficulty in manufacturing the buttons during the time frame of this project, only prototypes were developed. Since it is the use of these smart buttons which is important, three application areas were chosen and developed using proxy devices. The areas are detecting gestures such as for detecting meals, detecting micro-steps in activities of daily living (ADLs), and supporting computer security support for the Internet of Things (IOT). The intellectual merit included the concept of bio-enable functions that directed hardware design, new machine learning solutions that detect complex gestures in real home environments, and detecting the individual steps of activities such as cooking or other ADLs. In this latter application, any missing steps, out of order steps, or taking too long to perform the steps of an activity can be indicators of the progression of dementia and can help determine when an individual can no longer live alone. In addition, to show the generality of the smart button concept it was also applied to non-wearable smart devices that constitute the IOT. Here the intellectual merit was to show that many security attacks against IOT devices cannot be solve only with software patches. A new smart button comprised of additional sensors and software is applied to the smart IOT device in these cases. This solution has the potential to improve security and to react to security attacks against IOT applications.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/04/2019<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;A&nbsp;Stankovic</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
