<AbstractNarration>The meeting "Partnerships: Workshop on Non-profit/NSF Collaborations" will take place at the National Science Foundation on May 28-29, 2015. The National Science Foundation (NSF) and non-profit organizations each provide critical support to the U.S. basic research enterprise in the mathematical and physical sciences. While the missions of these funders differ, many of their goals align and the grantee communities have significant overlap.  In recent years, efforts of private organizations have played a more and more significant part of the whole picture of the funding of science. There are great opportunities: private support can be very flexible and allow discovery-driven investigation beyond what public funding can tolerate. This workshop will explore the ways in which the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the NSF and private foundations can form useful partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will examine partnerships between the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) at NSF and non-profit funders in MPS-related disciplines to &lt;br/&gt;- understand different models of collaboration (the "how"); &lt;br/&gt;- understand different motivations for collaboration (the "why"); and &lt;br/&gt;- develop opportunities for future communication and/or collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;After examining partnerships of various types, participants will discuss creative opportunities for future coordination. Discussions will entail both scientific focus and logistical considerations. The central events of the workshop will be a series of case studies, and a series of small-group discussions with reports back to the workshop as a whole. A technical writer will take notes and synthesize take-away themes for a report that will be made widely available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the years, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has engaged in many fruitful partnerships with private foundations and industry organizations that fund basic science. Such partnerships allow public and private organizations to leverage each other?s complementary strengths, to the benefit of science. As philanthropic funding for science grows, opportunities for such public-private partnerships are increasing.  To get a better picture of the landscape of public-private partnerships, and to bring together public and private funders of science to foster communication, the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California, supported by the NSF?s Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), organized a meeting at the NSF in Arlington, Virginia on May 28 and 29, 2015, called "Partnerships: A Workshop on Collaborations between the NSF/MPS and Private Foundations."  In an introductory talk, Cynthia Atherton, the program director for science at the Heising-Simons Foundation, observed that government agencies, foundations, and industry don?t live in separate boxes when it comes to funding science. "We overlap behind the science grantee," she said. "There?s mess at the edges, but maybe that?s where all the good is coming from."  The meeting presented an opportunity to study examples of partnerships between the NSF and private entities, to see what lessons can be learned.  According to Jennifer Pearl, an MPS program director, "The point was to go from a collection of one-offs to something where the community understands the lay of the land a little better&mdash;what are the good practices and the pitfalls, and what impact do these partnerships have." The meeting was attended by more than forty academics and representatives of private foundations, along with dozens of NSF officials, and many new connections were made.
