<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the State University of New York at Buffalo to develop an instrument to measure the internal vibrations of proteins. Proteins are large molecules with thousands of atoms and perform most cellular functions. Proteins consist of long chains of amino acids, and these chains fold into specific structures. In general, proteins must alter their shape in order to perform their biological function. For example, Hemoglobin, the protein that transports oxygen, changes shape in order for oxygen to bind. The internal vibrations of the protein structure that enable this change in shape are critical for understanding protein function. Recently a method has been devised to measure protein internal vibrations, called crystal anisotropic terahertz microscopy (CATM). The instrumentation and protocol development in this project makes CATM accessible to non-specialists, and enables broad application of the technique. The development of this instrument leads to the interdisciplinary education of two graduate students and two undergraduates. Integrated with the instrument development are educational and outreach activities that include an undergraduate seminar course and a week-long summer program for 7-12th grade inner city students from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to produce a compact turn-key spectroscopic system for the routine characterization of intramolecular vibrations of proteins. The technique called crystal anisotropic terahertz (THz) spectroscopy (CATM) uniquely measures these motions. Auto-CATM  provides non-experts with the ability to quickly and easily categorize and classify biomacromolecules. The mini-system from Zomega Terahertz Corp. is the starting platform for the final instrument. A proof-of-concept database, and molecular modeling and data visualization software toolbox facilitate the development this new instrument. This instrument provides insights into how intramolecular vibrations are impacted by frequently modified parameters such as binding state and temperature. The technology developed for Auto-CATM also enable new rapid measurements for both bulk and micron scale materials and thus impact solid state physics and materials science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a result of this funding we have developed an instrument to measure the intramolecular vibrations of proteins with the rapid turn-around time critical to discern how these motions contribute to biological function.  Proteins are large complex molecules typically with &gt; 1000 atoms.  A specific protein has a well-defined 3-D structure, which typically changes as it performs its biological process.  The means by which the large molecule efficiently makes these structural changes is not known, however theory and modeling have suggested that the structural vibrations play a critical role, with the motions of the vibrations steering the overall structural change. Current strategies for developing therapeutics for infections are moving towards targeting the internal dynamics of proteins to prevent their function.  An example of how a pathogen relies on protein structural change is the spike proteins on the surface of the corona virus that causes Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2.  The spike proteins on the surface of the virus capsid need to change their shape in order to allow the virus genetic material to enter the cell.  A strategy to decrease infection is to prevent the motions that lead to the spike protein conformational change.  The challenge is to determine where drug binding on the spike protein surface would eliminate these motions, in particular how to prevent the intramolecular vibrations that lead to the protein?s function.  Experimentally it has been difficult to measure specific protein vibrational motions. These vibrations are at terahertz frequencies, 1012 Hz:  very high compared to vibrations of a violin string, 103 Hz, but very low compared to where vibrations are typically measured with light, 1014 Hz.  The terahertz range is an underdeveloped region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and only recently have standard optical measurements have become commercially accessible.  Unfortunately, this type of off-the-shelf instrumentation does not provide very much information for protein vibrations.  A single protein has many vibrations closely spaced in energy, so it is difficult to distinguish one from another.  We previously addressed this challenge by introducing a polarization method which readily isolates protein vibrations based on their direction of motion, anisotropic terahertz microscopy (ATM).   The ATM method can characterize these motions, but a single spectrum is not sufficient to establish the important frequencies which are robust enough to compare to calculations.  It is critical to be able to establish dynamical fingerprints by showing the spectra are consistent protein to protein.  Further to establish which vibrations are important to function, the spectra must be measured for proteins with specific mutations or drug binding.  Finally to establish that changes are arising because of changes in the protein vibrations and not from other causes, measurements must be repeated to account for small naturally occurring structure variations, or variations in sample preparation and environment.  This amount of sample characterization is not possible with the original instrument, which took 24 h for a single measurement.  The original ATM system used a microscope configuration where the sample was placed on an electro optic crystal, which allowed for high spatial resolution, but limited the ability to easily vary the polarization needed to get the contrast between different vibrations.  Using insight into how the electro optic signal varied with the polarizations of the THz light and the detection light, we designed and built the Stationary Sample Anisotropic Terahertz Microscopy (SSATM) instrument.  SSATM has reduced the measurement time to less than 1 h.  This rapid turn-around time will enable the determination of what vibrations lead to specific conformational change. The instrument enables the critical characterization of protein dynamics for fundamental understanding and biomedical applications.   The funding in part supported the work of 12 undergraduate researchers (2 female, 1 African American), 7 graduate researchers (3 female.  3 completed their PhD?s), and 2 postdoctoral researchers.  The funding enabled engagement in K-12 outreach presentations and activities.  The research has been published in high profile journals (6 peer reviewed publications published, 1 under revision and 1 currently under review, and 10 conference proceedings and abstracts published).  In addition the work has been presented at leading international conferences (14 Invited talks, 20 contributed talks, and 13 posters) and universities (5 Talks in European universities and 3 talks at U.S. universities).  Three of the graduate student conference presentations earned student travel awards. The research also led to NIH STTR funding with an industrial partner to further move towards commercialization and broad application.
