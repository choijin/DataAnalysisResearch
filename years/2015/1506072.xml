<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1506072 McKenna, Gregory B.&lt;br/&gt;CBET - 1506079 Zia, Roseanna N.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colloids are dispersions of particles in a liquid, such as water, and the particles are so small that they do not separate for very long times. The materials are widely used in commercial products such as paints and inks.   They are also believed to be a good model materials for glasses.  The present work is a collaborative study that combines experiment and large scale computer simulations that will provide novel scientific understanding of the behavior of colloidal glasses and comparisons will be made with knowledge from the literature concerning molecular glasses in similar conditions.  Graduate and high school students will participate in the research activities at both PIs' institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding dynamical arrest in complex matter is a great challenge in soft matter science. Most study of colloidal systems near jamming assumes parity with corresponding behavior in molecular glasses. Yet, recent studies reveal non-equilibrium responses in colloids that differ qualitatively from glassy dynamics as monitored via the Kovacs signatures, viz., the intrinsic isotherm, the asymmetry of approach, and the memory effect. The proposed study will illuminate the structural underpinnings of such differences through a novel combination of experiment and dynamic simulation. The structure and dynamics will be determined in experiments analogous to the Kovacs experiments for molecular glass-forming systems. Here stimulus-responsive particles will change diameter at constant number density to create concentration-jump conditions to mimic the temperature-jumps of the Kovacs signature experiments. Concurrent simulations will effect similar conditions in silico. Experiment and simulation will inform and validate each other and the joint interrogation of the colloid dynamics near to the jamming transition will potentially create a transformative understanding of arrested states in soft matter.  In a broader sense, this is a collaboration of two very different PIs.  One is an expert in the experimental physics of molecular glasses, especially aging. The other is an expert in large scale computer simulation, with emphasis on colloidal systems. The result provides unique cross-disciplinary training to graduate students in both computational and experimental physics, deepening their knowledge of the fundamentals of dynamics and aging of molecular and colloidal glasses. Further, women and under-represented minorities will play a central role as undergraduate and graduate researchers.</AbstractNarration>

The work at Texas Tech University was experimental in nature and used diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS), a light scattering method, and macroscopic rheology to investigate the response of colloidal systems in a series of experiments similar to the classic "Kovacs" experiments in molecular glasses.  The work was complemented by our collaborators at Stanford University who performed large scale computer simulations on near-hard-sphere colloids.  The works made several important discoveries.  In rheological measurements following volume-fraction jumps we showed that the three Kovacs signatures appeared in the behavior but were different in character from the Kovacs observations in molecular glasses. For example, in the intrinsic isotherm-type of experiment (intrinsic volume fraction for colloids) the relaxation time was found to increase dramatically with increasing concentration, as expected. But, the time for the colloid to age into its equilibrium state followed a very weak concentration dependence, i.e., the two times are decoupled.  This is shown in the attached Figure 1. It was also found that, while the macroscopic rheology showed strong memory effects, the DWS measurements did not detect such effects. Furthermore, the asymmetry of approach in up- and down-jump conditions were very weakly present in the colloidal systems compared with molecular glasses. The results suggest that the kinetics of structural recovery in colloidal glasses is fundamentally different from that in molecular glasses and the differences should be further explored in future investigations.     In addition to the aging behaviors we were also able to age the colloidal materials into equilibrium at very high effective volume fractions. Because these are very soft particles in our studies, the effective volume fractions are greater than unity, something well known in the characterization of soft colloids.  The findings are fundamental. From the DWS measurements, in equilibrium, the glassy relaxation time exhibits surprising behavior. While it shows an initial extremely rapid increase (similar to the &tau;&alpha; in Figure 1), the response turns over towards a linear behavior followed by a near-constant plateau response.  This is shown in Figure 2 for a sample with mass fraction of 12.5 % by weight. The observation of deviation from the diverging behavior depicted in the red line shows that the soft glassy colloidal system does not follow a type of behavior that can be mapped onto ideal glass-forming hard sphere systems.     In summary, the dynamics of concentrated colloids remains an area of intense investigation both for better understanding of the colloidal materials themselves and as model or surrogates for understanding the liquid-to-glass transition of molecular systems.  The present work has shown that colloids as surrogates for molecular glasses is valid over a limited range of system softness and concentration and that the colloids outside of these ranges need to be considered on their own.  It is of particular interest that the soft colloids investigated in this study show not only strong deviations from dynamics that diverge at a "glass" concentration, but also that these dynamics plateau at high concentrations, a behavior not seen in molecular systems.
