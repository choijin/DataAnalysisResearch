<AbstractNarration>The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the world ocean is part of the global carbon cycle that interacts with the planetary climatic system through its connection with atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Keeping track of this DOC requires the cooperative effort of many marine laboratories worldwide.  Making sure that all of these laboratories are making accurate DOC measurements requires that each one have access to a standardized sample of seawater for which the DOC concentration is set by international consensus. This award will fund the University of Miami to continue a consensus reference material (CRM) program that was first developed in 1998 in support of consistent, high quality measurements of dissolved organic carbon by the international ocean chemistry community.  With continuation of this work, the US and international communities will create with confidence consistent measurements of a major marine carbon reservoir, thereby advancing society?s ability to assess changes in the marine carbon cycle and the role of the ocean in climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With continued strong international efforts to investigate the marine carbon cycle, the existing CRM program provides the necessary benchmark for globally comparable marine DOC measurements.  Water from the deep Florida Strait (~42 mol/kg DOC) will be collected, ampoulated, and distributed to the US and international community. Since program launch, 126,000 ampoules of deep seawater and 90,000 ampoules of low carbon water have been distributed to 240 US and international laboratories in 42 nations at the rate of 13,000/year. With renewal of the reference material program for a sixth 3-year period of support, distribution of deep ocean water containing biologically refractory dissolved organic carbon and low carbon reference water will continue to aid the analytical work of the DOM community.  A website is maintained that provides direct and convenient links to a growing number of DOM data collected from the global ocean.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Carbon dissolved in ocean water is a variable that has taken on great scientific importance over the past few decades.  As a component of carbon dioxide, carbon is central to Earth's changing climate, and the ocean is an important reservoir for the carbon being liberated to the atmosphere with the burning of fossil fuels.  A large part of that anthropogenic carbon dissolves into seawater, where it can lower the pH of the water (acidification), and where it can affect the normal functioning of the cycling of carbon by ocean biology.  One product of the carbon cycle in seawater is organic matter released as dissolved material, such as sugars, fats, humics, and proteins.  These materials accumulate in the ocean, with a final inventory of carbon held in the ocean as organic matter of about 700 billion tons.  While this is indeed a big number, the ocean is vast, so this mass is greatly diluted.  The concentrations of this organic matter dissolved in seawater end up being small, and thus hard to analytically determine with confidence.  This project, funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, supported the production of analytical reference materials that were sent to the international community of ocean chemists who require confidence that their analyses are good, or who require corrections in their techniques if their methods are not yet well developed.  Here, water was collected from the deep ocean, holding low concentrations of organic matter; expert laboratories then assessed the concentrations of the carbon, and we distributed that water along with the expertly determined characterizations.  The receiving laboratories worked on their analytical techniques, using the expert's values as their guide for analytical skill.  Once that skill was improved and confirmed, the international community was ready to make measurements throughout the global ocean, and deliver high quality data to their international colleagues, in which we could have high confidence, making everyone's work intercomparable and broadly useful.  In the end, after years of analyses with high skill, this large community generated data from around the world ocean that allow us to characterize the role of the ocean in the cycling of carbon globally. This project distributed 10's of thousands of these reference waters over the course of the program; the international community of ocean scientists who used the reference materials have improved their analytical skills, and thus making their data increasingly useful and valuable to the wider community of ocean scientists who depend on these data for their own work.
