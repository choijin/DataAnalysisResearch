<AbstractNarration>Algebraic statistics is the branch of mathematics concerned with applying techniques and tools from algebra to problems in statistics. This project will be concerned with addressing an open problem in the field of algebraic statistics. The project will be conducted in collaboration with host Prof. Satoshi Kuriki, a renowned statistician, and Prof. Hisayuki Hara, an expert in the field of algebraic statistics, at The Institute of Statistical Mathematics in Tokyo, Japan. The goal of the project is to provide another tool for testing model/data fit for researchers and statisticians to use in applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem to be addressed is the question of how to compute Markov bases for the multi-nomial logistic regression model. Multinomial logistic regression is used to model a categorical dependent variable that can take values in more than two categories in terms of a set of real- or categorically-valued independent variables. A Markov basis is an algebraic object associated to a statistical model that allows one to perform otherwise intractable statistical procedures, such as goodness-of-fit testing and parameter estimation. The goal of the project is to compute a Markov basis for the multinomial logistic regression model and to study its computational complexity. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to understand a class of statistical models (known as multinomial logistic regression and Possion regression models) from an algebraic perspective.  These are well-known statistical models for discrete data (i.e. data that can be stored in a contingency table) that are applicable in a wide variety of social and physical situations.  Specifcally, the aim was to compute an algebraic invariant of these models known as a Markov basis.  With a Markov basis in hand, a researcher using one of these models to describe a physical or social phenomenom can perform hypothesis tests that can help the researcher decide whether the model provides a realistic description of the phenomenon in question.  In this project, we were able to compute the Markov bases for Poission regression models explicity, and compile a wealth of computational evidience for what the structure of Markov bases of multinomial logistic regression models should be in the general case.  This led us to formulate a series of conjectures with regard to the structure and complexity of Markov bases of multinomial logistic regression models, and also to establish some interesting connections between these models and other areas of the algebraic statistics literature.  We will continue to work toward a full characterization of the Markov bases for multinomial logistic regression models in the future.
