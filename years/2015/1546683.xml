<AbstractNarration>Visible and ultra-violet (UV) lasers have a large and increasing number of applications in science, medicine and industry. Scientific applications of the proposed lasers would include studies of atoms and molecules of interest in physics, chemistry and biology. The proposed lasers are well suited for Raman spectroscopy, which is of growing importance in biology and material science. In the biomedical area, potential applications include flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, as well as other fluorescence applications, such as fluorescein angiography. In engineering applications, semiconductor inspection is a growth area, as is sensing technology based on fiber Bragg grating fabrication with UV lasers. Laser sources produced with this team's approach can be tailored to all of these applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides an efficient, convenient, and relatively low cost method of generating laser light in parts of the visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectrum that current lasers do not provide. The approach is to use convenient and long lasting laser sources in the near infrared (NIR) as the fundamental source, which is then converted to twice the fundamental frequency (frequency doubler). It is also possible to use two doublers in series to generate deep UV (DUV) light. There are some similar products available commercially, but the proposed system has higher efficiency, more simplicity and convenience, and a much lower expected cost.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award allowed a recently graduated Ph.D. student an opportunity to study the potential commercialization of research discoveries and innovations that grew out of his NSF sponsored Ph.D. research and thesis.  This discovery involved a potentially promising method of producing convenient laser sources of visible and ultra-violet light.  To determine whether further work on this laser method was warranted, a research team (consisting of the student, his professor and a local businessman mentor) was trained in and studied methods centered on customer discovery.  Through customer discovery the team learned the needs of Raman spectroscopy manufactures, their ecosystem and what types of lasers could help that industry move forward.  This growing and diverse industry uses spectroscopic techniques (laser light shining on material) to essentially take a fingerprint of a substance for identification purposes.  It is used from homeland security and contraband identification to food safety monitoring.  The teamed learned in detail about the characteristics of lasers that are needed for this market and what has to be developed to make a contribution to this industry.  This better understanding of the needed basic research and the potential applications in this Raman field gives motivation and direction to the research and development the team intends to conduct.  The team now has a better tool set to connect and conduct this research, innovation and commercialization, and for sharing this basic approach with others in our educational and academic settings.
