<AbstractNarration>The timely and accurate in-service identification of faults in mechanical structures, such as airplanes, can play a vitally important role in avoiding catastrophes.  One major challenge, however, is that the sensing system relies on high frequency signals, the coordination of which is difficult to achieve throughout a large structure.  To tackle this fundamental issue, the research team will take advantage of 3D printing technology to fabricate integrated sensor-structure components.  Specifically, the team plans to innovate a novel printing scheme that can embed piezoelectric transducers (namely, sensor/actuator coupled elements) into layered composites.  As the transducers are densely distributed throughout the entire structure, they function like a nerve system embedded into the structure.  Such a sensor nerve system, when combined with new control and command systems and advanced data and signal processing capability, can fully unleash the latest computing power to pinpoint the fault location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new framework of utilizing emerging additive manufacturing technology to produce a structural system with integrated, densely distributed active sensing elements will potentially lead to paradigm-shifting progress in structural self-diagnosis.  This advancement may allow the acquisition of high-quality, active interrogation data throughout the entire structure, which can then be used to facilitate highly accurate and robust decision-making.  It will lead to intellectual contributions including: 1) development of a new sensing modality with mechanical-electrical dual-field adaptivity, that yields rich and high-quality data throughout the structure; 2) design of an additive manufacturing scheme that inserts piezoelectric micro transducer arrays throughout the structure to enable active interrogation; and 3) formulation of new data analytics and inverse analysis that can accurately identify the fault location/severity and guide the fine-tuning of the sensor system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The overarching goal of this collaborative project is new framework of cybernizing structural system for self-diagnosis.  The research team aims at synthesizing new sensing modality with piezoelectric transducers, designing new additive-manufacturing-enabled fabrication scheme that directly inserts sensing nerves throughout the structure; and formulating new data analytics and inverse analysis t to predict fault occurrence with high accuracy and robustness.  Specifically at University of Connecticut, our goals are 1) developing novel transducer array with electro-mechanical tuning capability that can effectively excite and at the same time sense high-frequency local oscillations within a structure; 2) calibrating transducer properties; 3) establishing first-principle-based transducer-circuit-structure interaction analysis to be incorporated in data analytics; and 4) demonstrate the system performance through self-diagnosis investigation and provide implementation guidance.  These goals are pursued in concurrent with those by the collaborative partners at Georgia Institute of Technology and Texas A&amp;M University, which collectively lead to a new strategy of robust structural system integration.  Throughout this project, at University of Connecticut, our major scientific progresses and outcomes include: 1) comprehensive modeling, design, and analysis of piezoelectric transducer arrays that can effectively guide ultrasonic wave propagation within a mechanical structure; 2) development of a variety of mechanisms in the mechanical and electrical domains to amplify the electro-mechanical coupling of piezoelectric transducer to enhance the wave manipulation performance; 3) formulation and validation of piezoelectric impedance/admittance based structural fault identification algorithms that take advantage of multi-objective optimization and computational intelligence; and 4) establishment of a comprehensive testbed that can experimentally investigate the performance of cybernized mechanical structure under various ambient conditions.  The outcomes of this research can play a significant role in facilitating intelligent structure with self-diagnosis capability for aerospace, marine, mechanical, transportation, and many other systems.  The collaborative nature of this research the interaction with industry provide students a multidisciplinary training environment.
