<AbstractNarration>The proposed project will bring together researchers in a workshop to be held April 22-24, 2015 at the Holiday Inn, Arlington, Virginia. The Workshop will address research areas of a wide range of non-graphene 2D atomic layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal di-chalcogenides, tertiary compounds of carbo-nitrides and complex oxides, as well as their applications in various devices. It will allow scientific exchanges among leading scientists working on graphene and beyond graphene 2D materials and devices from Europe and the United States to help promote future collaborations and address common challenges. The Workshop is expected to play a key role in addressing in detail currently faced bottlenecks in 2D material and device research and identifying new directions for research.  The research discussed at the Workshop is expected to lead to technological breakthroughs and disruptive technologies that can have great societal impact in the future in many areas such as sensing, communications and health.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this workshop was to bring together leading scientists working on graphene and beyond graphene 2D materials and devices from Europe and the US to help promote future collaborations and address common challenges for this dynamic field.  It was envisioned that such an interaction woudl help promote synergistic activities in the future and hence reseach progress.  Both the US and EU have already invested millions of dollars in this field over the past few years with initiatives such as the European Science Foundation Eurocores Programme EUROGRAPHENE and the European Commissions's Graphene Flagship Project, or the US National Scienc Foundation's (NSF's) Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) 2-Dimensional Atomic-layer Research and Engineering (2-DARE) initiative.  The list of topics addresed at the workshop involved synthesis techniques for these beyodn graphene 2D materilas with the view on potential scalability, characterizaiton techniques, device nanofabrication and device characterization, theory and modeling for predicting properties and research on 2D heterostructures.  In addition to the regular invited talks, three break out session topics were also included in the workshop agenda.   A workshop final report was approved for public release and posted on the workshop website in the the Fall of 2015, that provided the NSF with recommendations on future activities in this field (http://engineering.utep.edu/useu2dworkshop/index.htm). This workhsop served as a catalyst for the issuance of the Dear Colleague Letter by the NSF that came out in July 2016 (https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16102/nsf16102.jsp?org=ENG) to provide a mechanism for collaborations between US and EU researchers in this topical area.
