<AbstractNarration>1511820(Lei) &amp; 1510485(Turner)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct oxidation of propylene to propylene oxide represents huge potential for a change to much more sustainable production of a molecule that currently has production levels of 9 billion pounds a year. Current production is inherently inefficient using vast amounts of energy and producing significant waste. This work proposes novel catalyst compositions and highly-engineered structures that have the potential to promote the direct oxidation with molecular oxygen at improved selectivity and conversion, and with less energy consumption and environmental waste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs hypothesize that the stability, selectivity, and efficiency of propylene selective oxidation can be improved by carefully synthesizing Pd-Au and Ag-Au bimetallic nano-catalysts. The new catalysts are expected to benefit from the high selectivity of Au and the high activity of the additional second metal.  Au nanoclusters are decorated with surface atoms of Pd or Ag, and the resultant particles are isolated from one another and optimized for interaction with a titanium-silicalite support by the deposition of metal oxide hillocks between the particles.  The combination of colloidal synthesis and atomic layer deposition (ALD) will be used to create the highly-engineered structures.  Synchrotron X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, and atomic-scale kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) calculations will be employed to potentially reveal a dynamic picture of the working catalysts and precisely identify the mechanistic role of the second metal.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, these catalysts could be a a game-changer for the propylene oxide industry.  In addition the study will provide valuable understanding of the potential role of bimetaliic catalysts of this type for other large-scale industrial chemical reactions.  The study will achieve educational outreach by providing support to two graduate students and also undergraduate students at two institutions within the state of Alabama.  Another outreach component is field trips by both undergraduate and graduate researchers to catalyst manufacturing sites and commercial R&amp;D centers in the Huntsville area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Current industrial production of propylene oxide (PO) is inefficient and generates large quantities of environmental waste.  Currently, PO is produced at a rate of 9 billion pounds a year, so improvements to the energy and environmental aspect of this industrial process can provide significant benefits to society.  In our work, we have used experimental and computational tools to investigate well-defined catalyst compositions and structures to promote the direct propylene epoxidation with molecular oxygen.      The computational work led to the development of a comprehensive model for the propylene epoxidation reaction mechanisms.  This required strong collaborations with the experimental team at The University of Alabama in Huntsville, and this interaction provided excellent benchmarking of the model predictions.  The unique aspect of the modeling work is that it preserves the atomistic-level details in the systems, but it can still provide predictions relevant to experimental time-scales (minutes to hours).  Traditionally, atomistic simulations are limited to time-scales of nanoseconds or microseconds making experimental comparison very challenging.     By combining our simulations with the experimental work of our collaborators, we were able to uncover very detailed behavior of the site-specific catalysis behavior.  Most importantly, the activity of the catalyst is strongly correlated to the coordination of the TiO sites on the catalyst surface, regardless of the preparation method.     The computational aspects of the project have provided support for two female graduate students and also and an undergraduate student at The University of Alabama.  The close interactions between the computational work at The University of Alabama and the experimental work at The University of Alabama in Huntsville have provided unique training and interaction opportunities of the students and PIs, including multiple site visits throughout the project.  Presentations have been delivered directly by the students at national conferences, such as the AIChE Annual Meeting, as well as regional meetings like the Southeastern Catalysis Society.
