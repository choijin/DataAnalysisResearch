<AbstractNarration>Modern research is increasingly data-based, whether the endeavor is in the physical, biological, or social sciences. Increasingly that research calls for large amounts of data to be transferred, modified, synced, and reliably stored for both the short and long term. The remarkable increase in both the generation and use of digital data and data tools has left many researchers behind.  The primary mission of the CyberInfrastructure Engineer (CIE) is to significantly engage in the interaction between researcher and technology via personal support and consultation, and to teach introductory classes on selected topics, with a net goal of bringing useful technologies to more researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CIE is working to improve the data-driven nature of scientific research in three parallel avenues: 1) data safety through the deployment of automated systems to move large scale research data to off-site systems; 2) data transfer through the use of state-of-the-art tools and systems currently unknown to many researchers; and, 3) data performance by expanded use of the highest-performance storage, retrieval, and processing of very large datasets.  UCI is evaluating a number of competing designs and services for a large-scale campus storage pool, creating a hybrid backup system that caches data locally before sending it on via our NSF-funded Science DMZ (UCI-LightPath) to longer-term, less-expensive, Cloud backup systems, and automating and using existing high speed data transfer protocols to be much easier for researchers to take advantage of.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project was to provide a 'Cyber Infrastructure Engineer' (CIE) to support projects at UCI such as the NSF-sponsored 'LightPath' research network and related CI projects that involve a wide segment of campus researchers.    The project was successful and contributed to UC Irvine's effort to expand and enhance campus Research CyberInfrastructure.  The CIE has now been funded as a permanent member of UCI's RCI Center which was established with this goal through support of UCI's Provost, Vice Chancellor for Research, and Chief Information Officer.  The establishment of the RCIC was proposed as an outcome of UCI's 2016 RCI Vision initiative (sites.uci.edu/rci).  The CIE will continue and expand support efforts in the areas of large-scale research data transfer and associated computing and storage services.  The CIE has also supported other campus and UC-wide CI (and NSF supported) initiatives such as the Pacific Research Platform.  Six tasks were defined for the project after the hiring and training of the CIE:  1) To support campus users with their use of the 'LightPath' research network, specifically to assist and optimize their large-scale data transfer efforts;  2) To test and plan for the creation of a large-scale campus data storage system (the Campus Research Storage Pool) akin to Purdue's DataDepot;  3) To test and plan for a disk backup system from CRSP to Amazon's Glacier system;  4) To test and develop a research group level 'Owncloud'-based storage system for data sharing and collaboration;  5) To teach and train UCI students and researchers on 'BigData' data transfer and analytic teaching in coordination with the UCI Data Science Initiative, and  6) Develop a 'cloud bursting' service from a future computing cluster to Amazon AWS services in support of campus researchers requiring more computing resources than possible using on-premise clusters.  The project was successful on all the key aspects of these tasks.  Significant progress was made to allow the further development of the CRSP storage system and the upcoming ?HPC3? research computing cluster.  At the same time, many UCI research groups were directly supported in their CI efforts.  In particular the Biology and Genome High Throughput Facility, the Center for Hydrometerology and Remote Sensing, the Arianna Collaboration, and the CERN/Atlas project. Training of UCI research students occurred both through Data Science tutorials and events as well as continual on-on-one interactions with the CIE during the granting period.  Among the research products of the project are Github websites containing the programmatic tools created during the project along with support documentation.  The CIE was a continuing contributor to the NSF CIE community though the CI Engineering Brown Bag program run by Jason Zurawski.  In summary, the CIE project at UCI was successful in supporting new research CI efforts and projects on campus.  The high level of success of the program can be seen by the choice by campus research management to continue the position with permanent staffing.  A wide range of campus research groups made excellent use of the services provided by the CIE.  At the same time, the development work of the CIE will allow UCI to deploy several new CI services and systems that will be crucial to large segments of the campus research community.
