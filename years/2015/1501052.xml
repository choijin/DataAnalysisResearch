<AbstractNarration>This project is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science, deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. The specific problems in this project are instances of the dimer model of statistical physics.  A basic illustration of this is the real-world process (relevant in the study of lubricants) of adsorption of a liquid consisting of diatomic molecules---the dimers in the model---along the surface of a crystal, whose fixed atoms form a lattice pattern, with any two neighboring positions capable of holding one molecule, and any given crystal atom being involved in the adsorption of at most one molecule. The main issue in this setting is the asymptotic behavior of the quantities that are studied (specifically, the number of different ways the surface of the crystal can be covered by molecules). In some of the instances we encounter, the usually more difficult problem of determining quantities exactly turns out in fact to be more tractable, and allows progress in the asymptotic study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with the exact and asymptotic enumeration of dimer packings with gaps. More specifically, using work of Fisher and Stephenson as its starting point, it studies how the total number of dimer coverings of the complement of the gaps changes as the gaps are moved around on the lattice graph. The joint correlation of a collection of gaps is a non-negative real number measuring this change, and is the central object of study of this proposal. In earlier work, the proposer proved that the correlation of gaps on the hexagonal lattice is governed, for large separations between the gaps, by a law closely resembling the superposition principle of electrostatics: If each gap is regarded as a point charge of magnitude given by the signed difference between the number of white and black vertices in it (in a fixed white-black coloring of the vertices in which each edge has oppositely colored endpoints), then, for large distances between the gaps, their correlation is proportional to the exponential of the negative of the two-dimensional electrostatic energy of the resulting system of charges. Other previous results concern two naturally defined fields, which the proposer proved approach the electric field in the limit when the lattice spacing approaches zero. In the current project, the proposer presents a program organized in several inter-related groups comprising twenty seven specific problems and conjectures. This program is aimed at developing further the analogy to phenomena from physics (in particular to heat flow in a block of material, which turns out to correspond to the interaction of gaps with boundary) and also understanding the connections with independent combinatorial problems, such as conjectures on tiling enumeration of new regions and generalizations of classical results on plane partitions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The type of problems this proposal is concerned with is illustrated by the following example. Suppose one wants to cover a chessboard by 32 dominos (each domino covers precisely two adjacent unit squares). In how many ways can it be done? What if the chessboard is a 2n by 2n square? This problem was phrased in the 1930's, and it took 25 years until it was solved.   Things get more interesting if we allow the domino tiling to have a small number of gaps. To be specific, suppose we have a 100x100 chessboard, and we want to cover it by dominoes so that precisely four unit squares are left uncovered, somewhere around the center of the board. Fix the positions of these four unit gaps, and consider the number of domino tilings that leave precisely these four unit gaps uncovered. The main question is: How does this number vary as the four gaps move around the center?  Building on pioneering work from the 1960's by physicists Michael Fisher and Jon Stephenson, I was led to realize in earlier work that the change in the number of tilings is governed by the two dimensional version of Coulomb's law for the interaction of electrical charges.   A large part of this proposal is concerned with the more subtle question of understanding the interaction of gaps in the case when they are near enough to the boundary to feel its presence. The examples I worked out led me to conjecture that in this case the interaction parallels the steady state heat flow in a uniform block of material with heat sources and sinks at positions corresponding to the gaps. I managed to prove this in several special cases, which lend support to this conjecture.  I wrote up these results, as well as several others on related topics, as a total of ten research articles that were published in peer-reviewed journals. I have also lectured on them at several US and international seminars, conferences and workshops.
