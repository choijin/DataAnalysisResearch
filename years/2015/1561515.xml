<AbstractNarration>CSBR: Natural History: Addressing Critical Collection Needs at UC - Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An award is made to the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ), a center for research and education at the University of California, Berkeley. Its collections of over 700,000 specimens are used for research, education, and to inform conservation decisions. Implementation of the planned activities will secure this biodiversity data resource for the advancement of scientific research. Specifically, the value and security of the MVZ collections will be enhanced through upgrades to the storage conditions of the ornithology collection. Also, rare specimens and associated information will be cataloged and made accessible, potentially increasing their use in research and informing resource management decisions. The collection includes species that are protected and poorly represented in most museum collections. Additionally, some samples are important for understanding disease spread, reproduction, physiology, and population changes over time. The project will leverage existing outreach efforts at the museum and continue the museum's tradition of student mentorship and training. This will, in part, be achieved through a workshop on the curation and use of museum data. Students and postgraduates will be trained in curation methods, modern collection management and data standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two major goals: (1) Enhance pest protection of the MVZ Ornithology collection by replacing a subset of the bird specimen cases to protect against future infestations. This aspect of the project focuses on passerine skins as they comprise the bulk of the MVZ bird collection, are the most actively growing part of the collection, and are most heavily used by researchers. The work performed will also involve reorganization of the collection to reflect current published taxonomies, facilitating its use for research and teaching. (2) Provide long-term security of Ornithology and Herpetology specimens and data by cataloging 14 special acquisitions. Over 3,000 specimens in Ornithology and over 19,000 in Herpetology have been accepted through special donations and specimen transfers of orphaned collections since 1995. These acquisitions include: unique series or specimen preparations not found in other museum collections; specimens of historic and/or geographic relevance to NSF-funded research aimed at documenting faunal change over the past century; and rare and/or endangered and globally diverse amphibian specimens used for studying the effects of deadly chytrid fungus. These acquisitions contain critically important, but currently inaccessible data for scientific research and discovery and they enhance knowledge about biodiversity and environmental change through species, data, and geographic areas that are underrepresented in museum collections. By cataloging these collections, the specimens will be secured long-term and available more quickly to the scientific community. The MVZ is a leader in biodiversity data projects, and all data will be made available globally through Arctos, VertNet, iDigBio, GBIF, and other data portals. Broader impacts of this project include a webcast Digital Curation and Data Quality Workshop and new public displays that further the MVZ's mission. Plans are to develop new community outreach across multiple age groups, and recruit and train new students, postgraduates, and interns. The principal investigators will mentor and/or employ 20 individuals and train an additional 35 participants through the workshop and webcast.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-1fb51ed0-7fff-1eab-b15a-ad02b44e5aff">&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ) houses one of the largest university collections of terrestrial vertebrates in the United States, and is a center for scientific research and education at the University of California, Berkeley. Accordingly, the collections are heavily used by the global research community as well as by educators and students. This project had two main goals: (1) Replace 154 existing, century-old specimen cabinets in the Ornithology collection (see image) to provide urgently needed pest protection and expansion, and to update the collection's taxonomic organization in order to facilitate its use for research and teaching. (2) Provide long-term security of Ornithology and Herpetology specimens and data by cataloging special acquisitions that include donations and transfers of orphaned collections, and that consist of (i) unique series or preparations not found in other museum collections, (ii) specimens of historic and/or geographic relevance to NSF-funded research aimed at documenting faunal change over the past century, and (iii) rare or endangered and globally diverse amphibian species used for studying the effects of deadly chytrid fungus. These acquisitions contain critically important, but previously inaccessible, data for scientific research and discovery. The specimens cataloged for this project were used in 36 research projects and over 95 publications in the fields of biodiversity, natural history, biogeography, systematics and taxonomy, amphibian emerging infectious disease, community and urban ecology, physiology, migration, and phenology. They show the value of museum collections for scientific research across broad disciplines, and can be used to study changes in species distributions and land use, effects of changing climate, and other human and natural impacts on animals and the environment. Such studies are critical for making policy and management decisions for species conservation and land use. Overall, we cataloged nearly 27,000 specimens from 26 acquisitions, consisting mostly of amphibians and reptiles (88%) but also birds and bird eggs/nests (12%) and a small number of mammals. We also verified localities and added coordinates with uncertainty for about 20,000 specimens (75% of total) cataloged as part of this project (see image), and are continuing to georeference the remaining specimens with mappable localities. Highlights of specimens cataloged include: birds, eggs, and nests from the western United States collected from 1872-2000; amphibians and reptiles from the orphaned collections of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, <span id="docs-internal-guid-3602ef04-7fff-f260-03cd-026b8478c8bd"><span>collected from 1936-2006</span></span>; amphibians and reptiles from Mount St. Helens, WA after the 1980 eruption; amphibians and reptiles from California and Mexico from 1962-1965; southeast Asian reptiles and amphibians collected from 2003-2007; dried prepared skins from multiple species of frogs and legless lizards (</span><span>Anniella</span><span>) from the 1940s to 1950s, including from type localities, which can be used for historic DNA samples and to document species coloration; frogs from the southern United States, including different species/hybrids of leopard frogs from the 1960s-1970s where many populations have been extirpated; lizards from Argentina and Chile from 1967-1974; and threatened frogs from the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountains that were used to study chytrid fungus disease and amphibian declines in the 1990s to early 2000s. Completion of this project ensures that the MVZ collections are secured for the long-term and available to the scientific community, and enables faster access to these newly cataloged specimens and data through loans, collection visits, and global data portals including Arctos (https://arctos.database.museum), VertNet (http://vertnet.org), Integrated Digitized Biocollections (https://www.idigbio.org), and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (https://www.gbif.org). We also used this project to provide training and professional experience for a total of 6 recent UC Berkeley graduates, 23 undergraduate students, 5 high school students, and 1 volunteer during the course of the grant. Undergraduates were recruited through the UC Berkeley Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program, and high school interns participated through Biotech Partners, a San Francisco Bay Area non-profit that aims to provide professional development experiences to underrepresented students in STEM. Five of the recent graduates are enrolled in biology graduate school programs. In addition, we presented displays about the project during the MVZ annual open house (Cal Day) from 2017-2019, and in a display case at the entrance to the MVZ office (see image). These displays highlight several themes: (1) the acquisition of important orphaned collections by museums; (2) the importance of NSF funding for protecting and curating such acquisitions; (3) the value of historical specimens from the Mojave Desert and Great Basin for studying changes in species distributions in relation to environmental change over time; and (4) the value of specimens for studying amphibian disease and declines.
