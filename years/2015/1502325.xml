<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a conference on Privacy in the Infosphere: Developing Ethical Guidelines for Managing Big Data in Research.  The two-day conference will be held at Georgetown University early in 2015.  The conference will develop guidelines for prospective NSF investigators for Data Management Plans involving Big Data, with a focus on managing privacy in the collection, analysis, and archiving of Big Data.  Possible dissemination mechanisms include a chapter in a monograph and a book on ethics in Big Data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together investigators currently supported by NSF projects dealing with Big Data, as well as stakeholders from a variety of community and governmental organizations.  The conference will seek to identify salient issues with respect to privacy in Big Data from multiple sources.  The overall goal of the conference will be to develop approaches with examples for preparing effective Data Management Plans for NSF proposals in Big Data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The workshop occurred on April 15-16, 2015 in the Philodemic Room of Georgetown University, Washington, DC.  The participants included an organizing committee, a multidisciplinary set of researchers who have received National Science Foundation funding for big data projects from the Education and Human Resources Directorate (EHR) and the Building Capability and Community in Big Data (BCC) program, and a distinguished panel of big data stakeholders from a range of disciplines, organizations and community sectors, a composition intended to capture diverse perspectives and encourage lively discussion. The organizing committee prepared and sent materials to all participants before the workshop to help create a common foundation for launching the discussion.  The materials included a white paper, a case study template and an example case study.  After reviews of the concepts of big data and of privacy, the white paper focused on a heuristic device (the Privacy Matrix) designed to assist big data investigators in identifying privacy issues with potential ethical implications in their work.   The Privacy Matrix included a set of Privacy Contexts (individual, community, education, commercial, government and science) cross-referenced with a set of key ethical principles (beneficence, do not harm, justice, autonomy and trust).  Four participants prepared case studies using the Privacy Matrix from their own research  Broad Social impact: The diversity of backgrounds, experiences and organizational affiliation manifested itself in a diversity of perspectives on the interpretation of the case studies, the implications of big data research for privacy and ethical analysis and ideas about Data Management Plans ( a required component of all proposals) as tools for protecting privacy and promoting ethical reflection in big data research.  Some participants argued that, in contrast to government or commercial uses of big data, big data research posed few new privacy or ethical issues and that existing mechanisms (including the existing guidance for NSF proposal Data Management Plans) sufficed to handle them.  Adding new ethical concerns or human subject review questions might increase the bureaucratic overhead without enhancing the value of big data science. Other participants argued that big data research invites renewed reflection on privacy and ethical issues in scientific research.  Although existing mechanisms might suffice in some cases, other cases challenge current practice and institutional procedures.  In addition, some research communities such as computer scientists have begun work on big data about human subjects with little experience of the human subjectÆs protection process or tradition. Until such time as the scientific community has developed more experience with big data research, individual scientists and their institutional research support groups should examine big data projects on a case-by-case basis using tools such as the Privacy Matrix or expanded Data Management Plan format to assist them in proactively anticipating issues while planning research and comprehensively analyzing issues as they arise in the course of research.  Intellectual merit: The workshop discussion led to the formulation of a new interpretation of the concept of "Big Data" based on its ethical implications.  In contrast to the "3 Vs" (volume, variety and velocity), the workshop identified the "4 Rs" or repurposing, recombination, reuse and reanalysis. The 4Rs highlight the importance of ethical provenance and ethical horizon; that is, the ethical implications of the possibility that investigators using big data for human research will draw their sources from pre-existing data from multiple kinds of sources and that other investigators will use their data in subsequent studies.  The workshop shop developed a Data Management Plan decision tree to encourage and aid investigators in reflecting on the ethical status of any consent provided by the human...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
