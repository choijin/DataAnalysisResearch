<AbstractNarration>This long-term research project in Puerto Rico integrates research, educational activities, and outreach to broad audiences through examination of responses of wet tropical forests to disturbances. Development of strategies to manage and conserve tropical forested ecosystems globally depends critically on understanding the mechanisms by which these ecosystems respond to natural and human-induced change. The program will train numerous graduate and undergraduate students, especially members of underrepresented groups, producing a cadre of collaborative, multidisciplinary scientists who can link population, community, and ecosystem approaches to provide a predictive understanding of environmental change. An active schoolyard program develops K-12 curricula in science and mathematics throughout Puerto Rico, including a new 'data jam' workshop in which teachers will use the project's data to investigate basic ecological questions. The program will engage Puerto Rican high school students and teachers in educational programs at the El Verde Field Station. To date, 954 teachers and 1662 students have participated in an interactive teaching website, the Journey to El Yunque. The project collaborates with other large-scale networks including the National Ecological Observatory Network, the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory, the Cloud Forest Research Coordination Network, and the Forest Global Earth Observatories, strengthening research infrastructure to tackle future challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Luquillo LTER project will, over the coming three years, explore the development of novel ecosystems resulting from the separate and combined effects of increased drought and hurricane frequencies as these disturbances are mediated by land use legacies. Researchers predict that novel ecosystems resulting from these altered disturbances will differ from previous and current ones both structurally and functionally, and will integrate biogeochemistry, productivity, and population and community ecology studies to understand these differences. Two new experiments will be added to ongoing efforts: a stream drought experiment in which stream flow is reduced by manipulation and a forest through-fall reduction experiment in which rainfall is manipulated. The stream experiment will manipulate stream flow to examine the short- and long-term effects of drought on biota and biogeochemical cycling. The through fall exclusion experiment will determine the impact of multiple short-term droughts on soil biogeochemistry as well as on microbes, seedlings, and litter organisms. Results from both manipulations will be incorporated into models to investigate long-term effects and to evaluate the feasibility of future large scale manipulations that are logistically challenging in the forested ecosystems. A novel canopy trimming experiment will continue to simulate hurricanes in order to examine the effects of changes in hurricane frequencies and to separate the effects of canopy openness from deposition of material to the forest floor on forest composition, soil carbon storage, nutrient dynamics, and forest floor community structure. Results will test the hypothesis that increased frequency of intense hurricanes will increase the dominance of shade intolerant species with cascading effects through other biota and biogeochemistry. This integration of observational and experimental approaches is powerful because the effects of these disturbances over long time periods are poorly understood. The potential to gain insight into the mechanisms whereby these disturbance regimes result in future non-analog ecosystems in tropical forests is high and will significantly advance understanding of ecosystem ecology.</AbstractNarration>

Encompassing the forests of the Luquillo Mountains and surrounding areas, the goal of the Luquillo LTER program is to determine how changing climate and disturbances (hurricanes, land use, drought, etc.) drive changes in the characteristics of the forest and streams. By investigating the effects of these changes on animals, plants, and biological processes (nutrient cycling, food webs, carbon storage, etc.) within the forest, the Luquillo LTER supplies critical information for management and conservation of tropical forest ecosystems globally.</p> <p><strong>Hurricanes</strong></p> <p>The Luquillo LTER site was struck by Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, the most intense storm to strike Puerto Rico in 89 years. With &nbsp;Category 4 winds on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it passed near the LTER site causing widespread defoliation and significant alteration of forest and stream structure. While some research facilities were damaged by the storm, we were able to maintain all of our on-going long-term measurements, allowing us to capture the immediate effects of the storm and showing how tree communities, animal populations, stream dynamics, and terrestrial cycling of carbon and nutrients were altered. As we continue to track the effects of the storm we are exploring which elements of the forest ecosystem are most vulnerable to severe storm damage; so far there is little evidence that the ecosystem was permanently altered by the storm, although it will continue to be a dynamic system for years to come. This is now the third and most severe storm to affect Luquillo LTER in its 30 years of operation, a rate of disturbance much higher than recorded in the previous 150 years. Thus, the Luquillo LTER provides a unique opportunity to explore how a frequent rate of hurricane disturbance can challenge the resiliency of tropical forest and stream ecosystems.</p> <p><strong>Drought</strong></p> <p>Ample evidence documents that the Luquillo Mountains, like many regions in the tropics, are<strong> </strong>changing to a drier, warmer, and more seasonal climate. In this funding cycle, LTER researchers used data and models to determine what factors control precipitation around the Luquillo Mountains with the goal of predicting future climate changes. Puerto Rico experienced a severe drought in mid 2015. Coupled with a 30% reduction in overall growth of trees, dry soils altered critical biogeochemical pathways influencing nutrient availability and the production of gases controlling the Greenhouse Effect. Streams were reduced to small pools with poor oxygen availability that were crowded with shrimp. Rain exclusion shelters over small plots were used to experimentally refine our knowledge of drought. The results improved our understanding of the effects of drying on soil processes, microbes, seedlings, and litter organisms. Additionally, collection of pre-experiment data has begun for a stream flow reduction (StreamFRE) experiment in one of the focal streams. In the future, water flow in this stream will be reduced by 50% to study the effects of increased drought on aquatic systems.<strong> </strong>Finally, we implemented a large-term project to study the effects of climate change on organisms living along a transect from the top of the Luquillo Mountains (1000 m) to around 300 m in elevation.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Large-Scale Climate Changes Affecting the LEF</strong></p> <p>During this funding cycle, LTER researchers studied how large-scale climate changes influence rainfall variability at in the Luquillo Mountains. Utilizing historical precipitation records and regional analyses, they showed the factors associated with the driest periods, demonstrating that the early rainy season (April ? July) is responsible for ~60% of the year-to-year variability in rainfall in eastern Puerto. Building on this approach, they showed that the 2015 drought was likely caused by intrusions of hot, dry, dust-laden air arriving from Africa, a novel finding. These data are essential for predicting future forest and stream communities and their biogeochemical dynamics. We also explored long-term changes (1975 ? 2016) in cloud base height, a critical attribute of the elevation gradient in the Luquillo Mountains potentially linked to the future of endemic species located at the summits that require frequent cloud cover.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Education and Outreach</strong></p> <p>Many graduate students (48) and undergraduate (76) students participated in the Luquillo LTER. Our Schoolyard LTER program reached&nbsp;47 teachers and 410&nbsp;Hispanic&nbsp;students in Puerto Rican schools. Since 2012, an REU program based at El Verde Field Station, and strongly connected to the LTER, has involved 48 students, 73% of whom are minorities. Our field projects have been supported by volunteer internships for recently graduated students seeking experience in tropical research. Since 2012, 70 students have participated (59% women and 37% underrepresented minorities), and many have gone on to pursue academic studies.
