<AbstractNarration>This research addresses the fundamental science of measurement system design and recovery of large-scale structured signals of interest when (a) critical phase information cannot be measured, and (b) very few measurements are available.   Also known in the technical literature as compressed phase-retrieval, this research has applications to a plethora of important scientific fields like optics, quantum physics, bio-medical imaging, astronomy, and material science.  The inability to measure phase information renders the signal recovery problem particularly challenging.  Most prior approaches are either computationally prohibitive and therefore hard to scale, or based on unproven heuristics that come with no performance guarantees. In contrast, this research fundamentally addresses the challenge of scale together with provable performance guarantees in the theory, design, experimental evaluation, and applications of compressed phase-retrieval systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the theoretical and algorithmic foundations for next-generation compressed phase-retrieval systems.  These are derived from a novel interdisciplinary mix of tools from coding theory, graph theory, statistical signal processing, as well as their integration into applications involving  optical imaging and quantum information systems.  The research revolves around a novel paradigm built on a family of sparse-graph codes that represent a radical departure from existing approaches based on either computationally intensive convex relaxation methods or greedy heuristics without performance guarantees.  This research has the potential to revolutionize the design and applications of next-generation compressed phase retrieval systems, similar to how Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC) codes have revolutionized modern communication systems, with respect to (i) measurement cost (approaching the fundamental limits); (ii)  computational and memory cost (enabling real-time or near-real-time processing); and (iii)  provable performance guarantees (with respect to the problem scale and robustness to noise).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project led to four significant developments.  (1)    It led to advances in computational microscopy that achieves high-resolution images from a limited number of samples using a technique called Fourier Ptychography. The setup involves a simple replacement of the microscope?s illumination unit with a programmable LED array, allowing one to flexibly pattern illumination angles.  In previous work, a series of low-resolution images was taken by sequentially turning on each single LED in the array, and the data were then combined to recover a bandwidth much higher than the one allowed by the original imaging system.  We demonstrated a novel multiplexed illumination strategy in which multiple randomly selected LEDs are turned on for each image.  Since each LED corresponds to a different area of Fourier space, the total number of images can be significantly reduced, without sacrificing image quality.  Compared to sequential scanning, our multiplexed strategy achieved similar results with approximately an order of magnitude reduction in acquisition time.  (2)    It led to fundamental theoretical advances in the so-called phase-retrieval problem. In this problem, the goal is to reconstruct a complex-valued input signal or image given access to only its magnitude measurements: this happens in optical imaging.  The goal is to do this using a minimal number of measurements and to reconstruct it fast. We proposed an algorithm (dubbed PhaseCode) that was near-optimal in terms of both measurement cost and recovery time and memory.  A key contribution of our work was the novel use of coding-theoretic tools like density evolution methods for the design and analysis of fast and efficient algorithms for compressive phase-retrieval problems.  (3)    We made advances in the area of mixture of sparse linear regressions: this is a popular model used in the analysis of many real-world datasets, where it is postulated that the data comes from a mixture of linear models with unknown parameters.  The goal is to estimate the parameter vectors efficiently with low sample and computational costs.  This problem presents significant challenges as one needs to simultaneously solve the de-mixing problem of recovering the labels as well as the estimation problem of recovering the sparse vectors.  Our solution to the problem leverages the connection between modern coding theory and statistical inference.  We introduce a new algorithm (dubbed MixedColoring), which samples the mixture strategically using query vectors constructed based on ideas from sparse graph codes.  Our novel code design allowed for both efficient demixing and parameter estimation.  As a concrete example, to recover a mixture of two regressions with dimension n = 500 and sparsity K = 50, our algorithm is more than 300 times faster than EM algorithm, with about one third of its sample cost.  (4)    We have developed an algorithm (dubbed SAFFRON) for group testing, that is, the problem of identifying K defective items among N items by pooling groups of items.  The proposed group testing algorithm performs approximate recovery (for any targeted approximation level) with order-optimal sample complexity by leveraging design and analysis tools from modern sparse-graph coding theory.  Furthermore, our proposed algorithm runs fast as the decoding complexity is linear in K and logarithmic in N.  We also proposed variations of our algorithm which are robust to noise.  As a concrete setting, for a total number of items around 4 billion and number of defective items 128, our algorithm is observed to recover all defective items with around 830 thousand tests, even in the presence of noisy test results.  We also developed an extension of this proposed group testing which enables fast neighbor discovery in Internet of Things (IoT).
