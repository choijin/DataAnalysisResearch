<AbstractNarration>The New York Botanical Garden's William and Lynda Steere Herbarium (NY) proposes to join the existing Thematic Collections Network (TCN) entitled, Mobilizing New England Vascular Plant Specimen Data to Track Environmental Changes. The goal of this project is to mine data from preserved plant specimens in order to support studies of the nature and consequences of environmental change in the New England region over the last three centuries. The New York Botanical Garden will contribute approximately 150,000 digitized specimens to the 1.3 million specimens that will be digitized at other institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data generated through this project will be of immediate use to scientists who study climate and land-use change, and will provide a better understanding of how global changes will impact the distribution of native and introduced plant species in the future. The project will provide career-relevant management training for a recent college graduate, and will provide employment and job experience for college undergraduates, exposing these young people to an aspect of environmental science not commonly taught in universities. Citizen scientists will be invited to participate in this project by helping to transcribe label data, georeferencing, and scoring specimens for phenological state.  This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Partnership of an Existing Network (PEN) grant to the New York Botanical Garden allowed the addition of specimen records from the New York Botanical Garden to the Thematic Collections Network entitled, "Mobilizing New England Vascular Plant Specimen Data to Track Environmental Changes (NEVP).  The goal of this project is to provide data to support studies of the nature and consequences of environmental change in the New England region over the last three centuries.  The New York Botanical Garden imaged 127,917 specimens and fully transcribed label metadata for about 65,000 specimens to add to the approximately 1.3 million specimens digitized by New England herbaria.  The New York Botanical Garden specimens digitized belong to 30 different plant families.  The plant families with the largest numbers of specimens digitized for this project are the bean family (Fabaceae), the Rhododendron family (Ericaceae) and the elderberry family (Caprifoliaceae).   The addition of the New York Botanical Garden data broadens and deepens the utility of the NEVP dataset. The specimens digitized include those that form the basis for the New York Botanical Garden?s longest-running project, the documentation floristic change in Northeastern North America, published in several editions as the Manual of the Flora of Northeastern North America.  These specimens provide a useful comparative dataset for the New England Vascular Plants project, since temperatures are on average warmer in southern New York than in New England and thus should show different phenological patterns.  This project also contributes directly to a variety of existing New York Botanical Garden research projects.  We maintain an on-line checklist of the plants of Central Park in Manhattan.  We are conducting an extensive survey of invasive species in southern New York State.  We are carrying out surveys of a variety of local parks, often in conjunction with the New York City Parks department, high school students and citizen scientists.   We are revising the classic   Manual of Vascular plants of North America by A. Cronquist, last updated in 1990.  The data digitized through this project provide the foundation for the Ecoflora of New York City, which is a research and citizen science initiative to understand species interrelationships in an urban ecosystem and to monitor how these relationships change over time.  All specimens are available online through the Garden's Virtual Herbarium, and these data are also shared with iDigBio data portal, which is the national hub for digitized specimens from natural history collections; through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and through the Consortium of Northeastern Herbaria website.    This project provided career-relevant experience for two staff members and two undergraduate college interns.   The interns learned basic techniques for handling herbarium specimens; how to barcode and specimens, and how to transcribe data.  In addition to learning techniques associated with the specific tasks for the project, interns participate in project meetings, in weekly seminars, in special activities such as open houses, gatherings for visiting scientists, and tours of all Garden research and horticultural facilities.  We also invited public participation in the project through on-site and remote transcription projects using the Notes from Nature natural history specimen transcription site.  The project was featured in the Garden's Science Open House weekend in Herbarium tours in May 2015, May 2016, March 2017, and October 2017.  The latter two Open House weekends were part of the Garden?s Herbarium Exhibit (What in the World is a Herbarium? March&mdash;October 2017).
