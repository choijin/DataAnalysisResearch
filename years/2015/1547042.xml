<AbstractNarration>Additive manufacturing (AM), a process of printing a 3-dimensional solid object from a digital model, makes it possible to produce virtually any geometric complexity with very little impact on cost. However, most of the current AM technologies have not yet begun to achieve their full potential. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will explore the feasibility of advancing AM technologies, focusing on capacities that differ from conventional manufacturing processes, such as the ability to create materials with properties not generally observed in nature. These capabilities will lead to breakthrough manufacturing technologies, such as structural amorphous metals with much stronger and lighter products that cannot be currently made, and repairing parts stronger than their original condition. Thus the project will provide a transformative method to fabricate advanced materials.  The strength, hardness, and fatigue properties of fabricated materials will also enable extremely lightweight structure design, thus revolutionize many products in the market.  Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. manufacturing industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will demonstrate the feasibility of a novel Cyber-enabled Additive Manufacturing (CyberAM) system to transform material fabrication capability. Using the CyberAM system, structural amorphous metals will be fabricated using a metal AM system through well-controlled high cooling process. This project will also advance the knowledge of cybermanufacturing, including 1) a methodology to effectively extract process model information into a unified CyberAM representation for real time process monitoring and control; 2) a strategy to simplify model computation and data generation to support cyber manufacturing; 3) a learning and adaptation architecture to continuously improve process model and database using sensor feedback; and 4) CyberAM demonstration with the learned knowledge to make novel materials.  If successful, the researchers will be able to extend the developed knowledge to internet scale to support multiple AM stations to fabricate advanced materials that cannot be made before.</AbstractNarration>
