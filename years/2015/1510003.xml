<AbstractNarration>1510003 &lt;br/&gt;Bashur, Christopher A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term objective of this award is to conduct fundamental research into new tissue engineered scaffolds that that could improve graft viability in patients with peripheral artery disease. More than 30% of these patients do not have viable veins that can be used for graft surgeries. The controlled delivery of carbonmonoxide (CO) from a fibrous scaffold in this award represents a unique tissue engineering approach for treating peripheral artery disease. This award supports both the initial steps in generating the vascular graft and the basic science work to better understand the cells response to the scaffold. In addition, this research will be integrated with training of undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine tissue engineered scaffold compositions that promote endothelial cell proliferation in cell culture. One transformative feature of the proposed scaffold is the incorporation of unique photoactivated CO  releasing molecules (photoCORM). This strategy provides a fibrous scaffold with the ability to control delivery of a naturally occurring biological signaling molecule such as carbon monoxide to the surrounding cells. The specific tasks include:  (a) determining electrospun scaffold compositions that support this photoCORM technology, (b) investigating how localized CO dose magnitude and timing impacts endothelial cell function, and (c) designing and synthesizing novel photoCORMs for more effective CO delivery. The endothelial cells will be cultured both by themselves and in co-culture, which is more representative of the environment in the body. The applications of this fundamental research include treatment for peripheral artery disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of CBET is co-funded by the Biomaterials Program of the Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>
