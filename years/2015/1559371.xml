<AbstractNarration>Genetic engineering is commonly used in agriculture, but is also opposed by many. The aim of this program of research is to understand the prevalence and causes of opposition, especially moral opposition, to genetically modified (GM) food. This research program provides immediate insight into why individuals are opposed to GM food. It also illuminates how to begin a productive discussion about the role of genetic engineering in the modern world, as well as the consequences of moral beliefs for science communication more broadly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wealth of research has been devoted to understanding the causes of opposition to GM food. Generally, this research has focused on rational or quasi-rational factors, such as beliefs about GM food's risks and benefits, trust in GM food-related institutions, and scientific literacy. This approach (which implicitly assumes that consumers usually reason about costs and benefits to arrive at their attitudes) remains the dominant paradigm in the study of attitudes towards GM food. The present work expands the scope of explanations of opposition to GM by applying established theories about sacred values and the law of contagion. The researchers examine whether some opposition to GM food is a manifestation of moral, sacred values, i.e., moral opposition, and whether this opposition is related to perceptions that the process of genetic modification is disgusting and contaminating. In a survey study with a representative sample, the research assess the prevalence and correlates of moral and non-moral opposition to GM food. In follow up experiments, the research manipulates factors related to sacred values and contagion and examines the impact on moral and non-moral opponents attitudes. This framework explains otherwise surprising phenomena observed in GM opposition research, e.g., insensitivity to evidence about risks and benefits of GM and generates novel predictions about factors affecting GM attitudes, e.g., the impact of disgust and arguments grounded on moral principles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our work provides a new approach, based on theories about lay moral intuitions, for understanding GM food attitudes.  Prior research tends to view GM food attitudes as based on rational or quasi-rational bases, such as cost-benefit analyses (e.g., risk perceptions).  We provide an alternative framework, which examines attitudes as a manifestation of moral, sacred values.  We show that most opponents are opposed to GM food based on moral convictions.  These moral opponents believe the process of genetic modification is morally wrong. As a result, they are evidence insensitive (insensitive to cost-benefit evidence because they are unwilling to make trade-offs with moral convictions).      First, we examined the prevalence of moral opposition in the United States and in two European countries&mdash;France and Germany. We found that many people (the majority of all participants in the USA, Germany, and France) are morally opposed to GM food, and moral opposition is more common in Germany and France than the United States.      Second, we also examined potential bases of moral opposition.  In the United States and Europe, feeling connected to nature (a subjective feeling of being one with the natural world) was associated with moral opposition to GM food.  However, connectedness to nature was higher in Europe than the United States.  The correlation between connection to nature and moral GM food opposition may reflect an intuition that genetically modifying food reflects an unacceptable "tampering with the natural world" or contaminating nature. In the United States and Europe, religiosity was associated with moral opposition to GM food.  However, this relationship was stronger in the United States than in Europe, and religiosity was higher in the United States than Europe.  The correlation between religiosity and moral GM food opposition may reflect an intuition that genetically modifying food reflects "playing god" in a way that is unacceptable.      Finally, we examined what arguments, if any, can persuade moral opponents to change their mind.  We find arguments about safety are not as effective as arguments about potential moral benefits of GM food (e.g., helping minimize malnutrition for the world?s poor), though even after strong moral arguments the majority of moral opponents remain morally opposed.     This research helps shed light on the nature of opposition to GM food and the reasons why people are opposed to it.  Given that GM foods and related technologies have real promise to aid the poorer people on earth, and to promote sustainability, understanding opposition to them, and how to ameliorate it, has major public health value.
