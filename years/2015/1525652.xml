<AbstractNarration>A diverse, well-educated computing and information technology (CS/IT) workforce is vital to U.S. well-being. The unique inclusive and open-access mission of community colleges makes them crucial points of intervention.  The "EngageIT" project at the University of Colorado at Boulder will develop and test a model of professional development (PD) for community college CS/IT faculty that builds their capacity to recruit and retain women and underrepresented minorities.  The project will investigate student persistence in CS/IT disciplines to measure the effectiveness of the PD and to empower faculty with program-specific diversity data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will consist of three activities: (1) designing a scalable, research-based PD course; (2) implementing this course with two cohorts of faculty; and (3) tracking student persistence in the discipline as a means to evaluate PD efficacy.  The project will make use of the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology's (NCWIT) considerable expertise and network, including research-based recruitment and retention practices, a 1500+ curricula repository for student engagement (EngageCSEdu), a dedicated community college advisory board, and social scientists to support the project. The study will use a mixed methods approach, which will enable triangulation and synthesized data analysis that is unavailable through a simple quantitative or qualitative study.  Rubric-based assessments will provide an objective measure of the implementation of the PD for each faculty member.  Assessing both pre- and post-PD will account for the different levels of engagement practices the faculty may already be implementing prior to involvement in this project.  Research findings will help educators to understand differential student persistence in CS/IT and the role faculty play in the field's diversification, helping to provide more engaging learning environments for diverse students, and leading to a more diverse U.S. technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ EngageIT was a mixed methods research project to build capacity of post-secondary faculty to recruit and retain students who have been historically underrepresented in computing, including Black, Hispanic and Native Americans students and women from all backgrounds. The project was in response to community college faculty reporting the need for practical methods to broaden participation in their programs and their feelings of isolation from like-minded faculty.  EngageIT included piloting a semester-long, online, professional development course with community college faculty members from around the country. Faculty implemented at least one recruiting initiative and one pedagogical change in the introductory computing course they deemed most pivotal in retaining students in computing.  The research included gathering data on students in each faculty members' Target Course (i.e., pre-post surveys, tracking of individual educational pathways, interviews) and conducting repeated interviews with participating faculty.  Project Highlights:  New Materials for Faculty: Faculty professional development materials are available on the NCWIT website as freely accessible multimedia modules, usable as a course or as individual pieces. The modules include instruction on the underlying social science behind under-representation of certain groups of people in computing, research-based practices for recruiting and retaining these groups, instruction on how to evaluate interventions, and guidance on how to develop a strategic plan for broadening participation in computing. New Research Instruments: Two survey instruments were iteratively developed to capture student demographics and constructs related to persistence in computing, e.g., interest in computing, prior experience in computing, self-assessment of computing-related skills, as well as intent to pursue computing-related fields, and students' perspective on the extent to which their instructors practiced inclusive pedagogy. The survey instruments and our classroom protocol for observation of instructor pedagogical practices are available for other researchers to use. Intersectional Data Analysis Approaches: We used a clustering technique for understanding differences and similarities among students enrolled in introductory computing courses. Rather than make a priori assumptions about demographic groups, we analytically classified students based on constructs shown to influence success and persistence in computing, including programming experience, interest in computing, and self-assessment of skills related to success in computing. The resulting clusters were:    Inexperienced &amp; Alienated - Students reporting the lowest previous experience with and interest in programming and other computing activities, the lowest sense of belonging in and less positive beliefs about computing, and one of the lowest average expectations of course success.  Experienced and Onboard - Students reporting the highest levels of previous computing experience, interest in programming and belonging in computing, and high confidence in their computing-related skills and abilities and an expectation of success in the course.  Inexperienced but Onboard - Students with low levels of computing experience but higher levels on all other constructs. On average, they score higher than the Experienced and Onboards in their interest in computing areas that are more externally focused, such as finding technological solutions to world problems and helping people with computing problems.  Experienced but Alienated - Students who are almost the mirror image of the Inexperienced and Onboard group. They report high levels of previous programming experience but have more negative perceptions about the field of computing than even the Inexperienced and Alienated group.  Confident but Alienated - Students who report confidence in their academic self-efficacy but have relatively low computer science (CS) training and experience, and the lowest mean interest in CS, programming, and perception of CS.  Men and women are in every cluster as are students from every reported racial or ethnic group. This disrupts stereotypes about gender and race and suggests instructors' inclusive classroom practices can have effects across a wide range of students, resulting in a better classroom environment for all.
