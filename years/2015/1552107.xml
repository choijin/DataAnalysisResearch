<AbstractNarration>1552107 (Diwekar). The Trans-Atlantic Research and Development Interchange on Sustainability (TARDIS) workshops are a series of meetings on scientific topics related to environmental sustainability held every other year alternating between Austria and the United States. The first workshop was held on the subject of modeling for environmental sustainability at Schloss Seggau in Leibnitz, Austria in October 2004. Subsequent workshops were held in September of 2006 at the YMCA of the Rockies on the topic of underlying scientific principles of environmental sustainability, and in October 2008 again at Schloss Seggau on energy and environmental sustainability. The TARDIS 2012 workshop was held in April 2012 at Schloss Seggau in Leibnitz, Austria on the topic of time and time-frames for environmental sustainability. The most recent TARDIS workshop was held in June of 2014 at the YMCA of the Rockies in Colorado on the topic of social, economic, policy, and regulatory incentives to promote environmental sustainability in society. The next TARDIS workshop will be again held at Schloss Seggau in Leibnitz, Austria October 19 - 21, 2016 to explore the compatibility of economic growth and environmental sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The body of participants will be balanced to include adequate representation with respect to discipline (engineering, physics, chemistry, economics, policy, etc.), institutions (academic, government, private sector) and regional and national representation, and minorities and women will be encouraged to participate. Two reports will be produced: (1) a final report summarizing the results and conclusions and the presentations given, and (2) a briefer summary focused on policy. A WIKI site has been established and is currently being populated with the relevant information on all of the TARDIS workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ workshop participants to optimal use by providing platforms for intensive discourse. The objective was to use interdisciplinary expert discussions to break new ground in understanding the relationship between growth and sustainable development.  For TARDIS 2016 the following general topics were chosen:  The meaning of Growth Limits that must not be outgrown Growth contradicting sustainable development What shall grow, what shall be reduced?   All these topics were discussed at four tables that dealt with the following (fixed) aspects:  a)      ecological (table host Heriberto Cabezas)  b)      economic (table host Urmila Diwekar)  c)       social (table host Rupert Baumgartner/Michael Eder)  d) cultural (table host Michael Narodoslawsky     To achieve intensive exchange of ideas between the participants, four sub-panels were established to keep the number of disputants manageable and allow everyone to contribute. The method of "World Caf&eacute;" was chosen to ensure that every participant had the opportunity to contribute to all aspects raised in the workshop. This method requires as many tables with fixed table hosts as disputant groups. Each table is assigned a certain aspect of the general discussion topic. The disputant groups are assigned to a starting table, discuss the particular aspect treated at this table for a limited time (20 minutes). Every intervention shall be noted down on the paper cover on the table. After the time limit elapses, the disputants rotate to the next table. The table host is responsible for briefly summarizing the findings of the previous group(s), allowing the incoming group to build on the results of discussion already achieved, either critiquing or sharpening them or raising new ideas. Finally, the table hosts (with assistance from participants) summarizes the discussion in the plenum. Following this method guarantee that (1) every participant contributes to all aspects of the topics raised and (2) the discussion remains efficient with minimal repetition of arguments.  Broader Impacts:  The workshop participants from various disciplines like engineering, mathematics, political science, economics, computer science, and climate science.   There were participants from 19 countries and 20% of women participants.   The workshop report was posted on TARDIS website.
