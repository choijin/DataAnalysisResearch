<AbstractNarration>The "chemical arms race" between plants and their specialist herbivores is characterized by high diversities of both plant defenses and insect herbivores with adaptations to those defenses, and is considered to be a driving force of biodiversity. The newly discovered plant toxins in the tropical pepper plant, Piper kelleyi, are consumed and metabolized by caterpillars that specialize on this plant.  These chemicals are toxic to all other insects, especially in higher light environments. The research will quantitatively measure how the abundance and diversity of plant toxins respond to different light intensities and will document how specialized caterpillars evolve in response to differences in plant chemistry. The research strategy links the most recent advances in genetics and organic chemistry with important ecological questions about plant-insect interactions. The project will enhance graduate education and will promote science education through interactive projects with local K-12 students, teachers, and an international group of collaborators. In addition to providing insight into the origins of biodiversity, documenting the effects of variation in plant chemistry on interacting trophic levels provides data that could be useful for pharmacology and agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dissertation research will provide a significant contribution to studies of how plant secondary metabolites contribute to the origin and maintenance of biodiversity in the tropics. The work examines specific hypotheses relevant to coevolutionary theory using the recently discovered plant secondary metabolites of the tropical understory shrub, Piper kelleyi (Piperaceae). These compounds, which dimerize and are more toxic at higher light levels, are consumed and metabolized by specialist geometrid caterpillars in the genus Eois but they are very toxic to generalists. The hypotheses tested using this model system include: 1) if distinct phytochemical profiles are found in different host plant populations, these can function as isolating mechanisms for herbivores, and 2) these isolating mechanisms lead to speciation of specialist herbivores. Light intensities will be manipulated to quantify their effects on intraspecific phytochemical variation, and population genomics techniques will provide tests for local adaptation of detoxification of these compounds by specialist caterpillars. The project will also provide opportunities for the graduate student, who will promote science education through interactive projects with local K-12 students, teachers, and an international team of chemists and biologists.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p> <p>Plants have evolved the means to chemically defend themselves against a variety of pathogens and insects. It is broadly accepted that the co-evolutionary arms race between plants and insects is a major force that has led to the biodiversity of our ecosystems. In addition to a fundamental interest in the role of defensive chemistry in biodiversity, researchers have utilized nature&rsquo;s chemistry for the development of applications in agriculture (e.g. insecticides and herbicides) and medicine (e.g. antibiotics and pain suppressants).&nbsp; While this work has led to a number of advances, these developments have mostly focused on a few well-characterized compounds in a given plant and have failed to investigate the effects of these compounds in their natural setting where they are used as a defense against insects and pathogens. This study focused on three newly discovered anti-insect plant compounds in the tropical plant, <em>Piper kelleyi</em>, to understand how toxicity is enhanced by abiotic factors, such as light, and how these toxic compounds are metabolically processed by caterpillars. <strong>The following hypotheses were tested</strong>: (1) The concentration of plant defense chemistry increases with the presence of high light. (2) Caterpillars feeding on plants exposed to high light will grow more slowly and have other physiological changes compared to those feeding on plants exposed to low light. This project interfaces chemical ecology and evolutionary biology by combing natural products chemistry and field ecology to develop a better understanding of the population level effects of plant chemistry on herbivores.</p> <p>We found substantive concentration differences among three major plant compounds and these differences in chemistry predicted caterpillar and predator composition in host plant populations. Furthermore, caterpillar populations located at high elevations were genetically different from other populations. They fed on plants containing high concentrations of certain compounds. We found that caterpillars are holding small amounts of the compounds in their tissue, but further analysis is needed to determine if there is a significant difference between caterpillar populations located at high or low elevations. In regards to experimentally testing if these compounds are photoactive, we found that enhancement of UV irradiation increased the amount of the secondary compounds in the leaves of <em>Piper kelleyi</em>. The controlled bioassay demonstrated that naive caterpillars had significantly lower survival rates when feeding on diets high in <em>Piper kelleyi</em> leaf material while in the presence of enhanced UV light.</p> <p>Our research represents a significant contribution to our understanding of the chemical processes maintaining biodiversity and the radiation of new species. Furthermore, by documenting the effects of plant secondary compounds on interacting trophic levels, important biological activities can be uncovered that could be useful for pharmacology and agriculture.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>:</p> <p>The Broader Impacts for this project included substantive contributions towards science education through mentoring undergraduate students and maintaining an active community outreach program. The controlled herbivore bioassays provided training opportunities in the laboratory for several undergraduate students and a high school student from the Davidson Academy of Nevada. A female student from the McNair Scholar program was trained in natural products isolation. For international collaboration, the graduate student worked extensively with Ecuadorian local naturalist, Wilmer Simbana. For community outreach, this project involved volunteers from the <em>Earthwatch Institute</em>, which promotes environmental science to citizens throughout the world. Glassmire led an Ecuador <em>Earthwatch</em> team consisting of twelve K-12 teachers from different school districts in Los Angeles, California. They were an integral part of setting up the canopy experiment. They used this experience to learn about experimental design and incorporated it into their curriculum through interactive projects for K-12 students. Finally, specimens from this project are preserved in the Natural History Museum at the University of Nevada Reno. Adult <em>Eois</em> moths and herbarium specimen of <em>P. kelleyi</em> are on display at the museum and are used to engage in scientific discussions with the participating K-12 students in Washoe County, Nevada.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/27/2016<br>      Modified by: Lee&nbsp;A&nbsp;Dyer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502059/1502059_10356935_1472334365848_canopyexp_pinkbelly_figure--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502059/1502059_10356935_1472334365848_canopyexp_pinkbelly_figure--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Design of Piper kelleyi canopy experiment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502059/1502059_10356935_1472334365848_canopyexp_pinkbelly_figure--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Design of Piper kelleyi canopy experiment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We established clonal individuals of P. kelleyi plants that were treated with light conditions mimicking either the canopy or forest understory.
