<AbstractNarration>Many important processes in the natural and engineered world involve the infiltration of fluids into materials that then react to form new materials with significantly larger volume.  These large volume changes, in turn are thought to induce fracturing which opens up new avenues for fluid infiltration, potentially leading to a cascade of pervasively cracked materials in a process dubbed ?reaction induced cracking?.  While many natural systems give indirect evidence of these processes, very little is understood about the physics and efficiency of these mechanisms (or if they even work). The purpose of this proposal is to develop a fundamental understanding of the reactive cracking process by combining laboratory experiments, theory and advanced computational models of reactive brittle materials.  A better understanding of these processes could lead to new engineering methods for efficient carbon sequestration or hydrocarbon extraction, could give insight into induced seismicity as well important Earth science processes in the natural world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this award, we will combine laboratory rock mechanics experiments on simplified systems with computational models that can be used to test and validate a range of hydro-mechanical failure theories directly against the experiments. Lab experiments will be conducted in Lamont?s tri-axial deformation apparatus, with control of fluid flow and monitoring of stresses, pore pressures, acoustic emissions and permeability changes. Experiments will investigate both hydration and dehydration reactions on analog materials chosen to provide large volume changes in a simplified geometry. We will explore the behavior of nested cylinders of materials with an interior reactive cylinder that can either produce or ingest hydrous fluids, surrounded by an outer cylinder of brittle rock under various level of confining pressure. The modeling will be a collaborative effort across multiple departments and schools at Columbia and use an open-source computational framework developed by the PIs. Direct modeling of the experiments will provide the needed control for testing hypotheses, validating theories, and calibrating constitutive relations and failure models. Improved theoretical models of fluid-brittle solid interaction can then be extended to explore their consequences for large-scale geodynamics such as volatile cycling through subduction zones.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction: When rocks from the Earth's deep interior are exposed at the surface, they are chemically unstable and will react with water and carbon dioxide to produce new minerals such as serpentine that occupy significantly larger volumes than the unaltered material.  Field observations of such altered rocks (Figure 1), show that the alteration process is intimately involved in pervasive fracturing of the rock, in response to these volume changes.  The hypothesis of "reactive cracking" posits that the infiltration of reactive fluids and the formation of fracture networks is strongly coupled, where reaction drives fracture, which increases fluid flux bring in more reactant  leading to the spontaneous generation of highly altered regions and the consumpution of significant amounts of water and/or CO2.   Understanding the efficiency and physics of this process  is critical for a wide range of scientific and engineering problems. For example, this process has important consequences for both volcanism and earthquake genesis. Fluids bound in minerals at the surface are released again when plate-tectonics transports these minerals back into the interior leading to enhanced magmatism and potentially the lubrication of earthquake faults.  This process could also be important in engineering efficient technologies for the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere through the capture of atmospheric CO2 and permanent storage in carbon-bearing minerals.  To study both natural and engineered systems, however,  requires significant improvements in our understanding of the complex coupled physics of reactive flow and fracture in brittle materials.  The purpose of this award was to develop both experimental and theoretical/computational methods to investigate and quantify this fundamental process.   Outcomes:  This award produce a series of experiments on analog materials and natural samples that demonstrated that the chemical energy available in strongly reactive materials could be converted to mechanical work that could expand and fracture the materials leading to extensive alteration. However,  the response and efficiency of this process depended on confining pressure and the mechanical response of the materials.  A complementary modeling study, developed both  new theory and computational models to explore the behavior of strongly reactive fluid flow in  elastic-brittle materials.  These new models were the outcome of a collaboration between researchers in Columbia Earth Sciences,  Applied Math and Civil engineering who applied and tested a relatively new computational method, "phase field cracking", in advanced computer  models to simulate simultaneous reaction and failure.  Figure 2, shows some example models developed by a Ph.D.  student in applied math showing the evolution of branching crack networks filled with reacted serpentine similar to those observed in nature.  This work provides quantitative constraints on processes that can both enhance and impede the growth of crack networks.   Intellectual Merit:  Understanding reactive-flow in brittle materials is a fundamental physico-chemical process central to a host of Earth Science and engineering applications. The problem is a complex multi-physics problem with significant challenges for experiment, theory and computation.  This award has provided critical new understanding and quantitative tools in all of these categories.  Broader Impacts: Improved understanding of reactive cracking could lead to new technologies for CO2 capture from the atmosphere and permanent storage in minerals.  If sufficient stored chemical energy can be harnessed for efficient carbon sequestration and pervasive alteration, it may be possible to make this an economically viable process that would help in the long-term societal goal of net negative carbon emissions.  This award also provided advanced training for several early career scientists including graduate students, post-docs and junior faculty members.
