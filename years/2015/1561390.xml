<AbstractNarration>Aquatic insects and other invertebrates that live in rivers and streams help us gauge the quality and health of our Nation's waters. Healthy waters support a higher variety of species and water resource managers use measures of species diversity, along with chemical analyses, to assess whether a body of water is polluted or not. For almost 25 years, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) collected over 1 million aquatic macroinvertebrates from 2,300 streams and rivers across the United States and used these samples to establish baseline reference conditions of water quality. This collection serves as a valuable resource for contemporary information and future research on biodiversity, water quality assessment and management, and aquatic ecology. The collection was donated to the University of Minnesota by the USGS to ensure its continued existence, as it was slated for disposal in spite of its historical and contemporary importance and its excellent condition, diversity of species, and geographic coverage. This award facilitates the addition of this collection to the University's existing insect collection. Also, information associated with the specimens, such as where and when they were collected, will be databased and made available for use by researchers, educators, and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The targeted specimens were originally housed at the USGS facility in Denver, Colorado, prior to their transfer to the University of Minnesota. The University of Minnesota has demonstrated support and commitment to this project by providing physical space to house the specimens and cabinets for archival storage. This award facilitates goals of the project are now to unpack, reorganize, database, and physically integrate the material into the University of Minnesota Insect Collection. The University will implement a new databasing application, with a user-friendly interface, so that information associated with the specimens can be accessed for research and education. A full-time curatorial associate, assisted by undergraduate students, will carry out most of the work. In addition, a Master's level graduate student will be supported by the project to assist with project management and specimen curation, and will also receive advanced training in collections management, biodiversity assessment, and aquatic insect taxonomy. Results of the project and access to the database will be made available through the University of Minnesota Insect Collection website at http://insectcollection.umn.edu/.</AbstractNarration>

NAWQA material was sorted to species or to the lowest possible taxonomic unit. Locality information for NAWQA material has been downloaded from the USGS database and uploaded into a new Specify database. Over 4,000 NAWQA specimen records (representing over 18,000 specimens) were uploaded; additional databasing is on-going. All existing UMSP ethanol-preserved insect material was sorted, re-curated, and physically re-organized to reflect current taxonomic systems; the primary aquatic orders have had all specimen information and label data transcribed into spreadsheets, all vials received physical barcode labels, and await editing and uploading into Specify. The Specify database is fully functional and in use as the database for the University of Minnesota Insect Collection. Non-insect material has been donated to the Bell Museum of Natural History’s Mollusks &amp; Crustaceans Collection. Intellectual Merit: The proposal has multiple major components, all aimed at stabilizing the NAWQA collection specimens and their related data and making them available for use by the research community. Major objectives include physically sorting, organizing, and barcoding all NAWQA specimens; transcribing and uploading data into the UMSP Specify database, and training a graduate student in collections management and biodiversity assessment. Broader Impacts: The NAWQA collection represents fundamental information on the nation’s freshwater habitats and biodiversity.
