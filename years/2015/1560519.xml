<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program in the NSF Division of Chemistry supports Professor Jentoft of the University of Oklahoma in Norman in investigating heterogeneously catalyzed aldol condensation reactions for biomass conversion. This endeavor will be undertaken in collaboration with Karen Wilson at the Cardiff Catalysis Institute in Wales in the UK, whose research will be supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of the UK (EPSRC). Aldol condensation is a key chemical transformation for the conversion of small oxygenates from biomass to fungible fuels because it increases carbon chain length and reduces oxygen content.  The PIs will synthesize families of novel materials that differ in acid-base properties, surface hydrophobicity, and morphology.  The catalytic performance in aldol condensations using diagnostic and bio-oil-representative reactants will be tested. The acquired knowledge will allow the development of improved solid aldol condensation catalysts that are highly selective and stable in aggressive media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigated chemical transformation, aldol condensation, is a key step in the production of second generation bio-fuels and plays a role in several commercial chemical processes. The proposed research will provide the fundamental insight that is necessary to develop novel materials that catalyze this transformation with great efficiency, that is, without excessive energy input or generation of chemical waste. The program will also provide cross-disciplinary scientific and technical training and an international exchange experience for the involved researchers. US students will have the opportunity to perform research and participate in educational activities within the Cardiff Catalysis Institute, a center of excellence in the UK established at Cardiff University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project targeted the development of new solid catalysts for aldol condensation, a reaction that leads to a new carbon-carbon bond. Aldol condensations are widely used in the synthesis of commodity and fine chemicals, and also have potential applications in the upgrading of bio-oils to fuels or chemicals. Solid catalysts are easily separable from liquid reaction media and enable a more sustainable production of fuels and chemicals.  Several families of new solids were synthesized, and their structure, porosity and surface chemistry was characterized. These materials were then tested as catalysts for the cross aldol condensation of two test reactants, benzaldehyde and butanone, and their activity, selectivity and stability in the catalytic process was assessed. Commercially available resin catalysts and soluble organic acids and bases were used for comparison and as benchmarks.  The reaction network was unraveled. The products of aldol addition and subsequent dehydration as well as not previously reported cleavage products were observed and quantitatively analyzed. Reaction at the methylene group of butanone resulted in branched products, whereas reaction at the methyl group resulted in linear products. It could be demonstrated that the reaction intermediates (the addition products or aldols) can cleave into olefins and carboxylic acids.  Correlations of regioselectivity and chemoselectivity with catalyst nature and reaction conditions were established.
