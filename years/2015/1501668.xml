<AbstractNarration>One important goal of ecology is to understand how characteristics, such as body dimensions and weight, among many others, affect the way species interact with their environment and how they survive and reproduce. To do so, ecologists have long measured average characteristics across the individuals of a given species. However, mounting mathematical evidence suggests that averages can be misleading, because much information is lost regarding how, and by how much, individuals differ in their characteristics. These differences may in turn be crucial to our understanding of whether species can survive in nature, but more importantly, taking these differences between individuals into account may be paramount to make accurate predictions about how populations will respond to environmental change. This research will test these ideas using both mathematical models and experiments. By quantifying the effects of individual variation on a critical process in different environments, the research will promote the advancement of science, support science education and diversity, and enhance broader understanding of science &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite theoretical predictions, whether variation actually has detectable effects upon ecological dynamics, and whether this effect interacts with other important drivers such as environmental temperature, is largely unknown. This project will quantify the joint effect of individual phenotypic variation and temperature on foraging rates using an integrative approach that merges mathematical models and microcosm experiments. Foraging rates of a small copepod, wherein body size affects predatory activity, on a protist will be quantified for different temperatures.  These results will clarify how this largely overlooked aspect of every population may help to predict ecological changes with greater precision, informing decisions about how to respond to climate change. Broader impacts will include enhancement of science education by involving undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and minorities in experimental and theoretical approaches to ecology and through outreach activities on the predator-prey dynamics to be run in the "Science with a Scientist" childrens outreach event at the University of Nebraska Museum of Natural History that involves radio controlled robots as predators and prey.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Educational and training accomplishments:  1)     The grant was meant to add an empirical component to the dissertation of Jean-Philippe Gibert, who was, up until then, theoretically focused. From that standpoint, the grant was a huge success, as it allowed Gibert to learn how to design and carry out experiments, using freshwater organisms in microcosm setups, that were interesting, publishable and involved. The empirical work also broadly informed further theoretical work on the link between individual variation and ecological processes.  2)     Among the tools and techniques Gibert learned are, how to design ecological experiments using freshwater organisms, how to set up temperature experiments, how to measure phenotypic traits using microscopic imaging and a special type of flow cytometer (FlowCam), as well as how to ID certain types of freshwater crustaceans.  3)     The grant funded two undergraduate students at the University of Nebraska&ndash;Lincoln, Rachel Allen and Ron Hruska. Both students were involved in all sorts of task, laboratory related, from keeping cultures alive, all the way to coauthoring a publication. In their almost two years in the PI?s lab, they contributed to experimental design, they carried out experiments along with Gibert, and contributed to the writing and publishing of a manuscript that was a direct product of this grant.  Scientific accomplishments:  The grant directly led to a:  1)     a dissertation chapter on how phenotypic variation in predator traits can impact predator-prey interactions,  2)     an experiment on how temperature can mediate those effects that will eventually become a manuscript,  3)     a published paper on the effects of environmental effects on protist phenotypes, and through those, on predator-prey dynamics, which can be found at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.12797  4)     a published paper on the role of individual variation on metapopulation persistence, which can be found at https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10144-016-0548-z.
