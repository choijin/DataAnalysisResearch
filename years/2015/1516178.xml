<AbstractNarration>The "Addressing the Need for Women and Minorities in Cybersecurity:  A High School Early Admit Study" at the University of Hawaii Maui Community College will investigate ways to increase the number of women and minority high school students in cybersecurity.  The project will create an early-admit afterschool career pathway for students in grades 11 and 12 that leads to a Cybersecurity Certificate of Completion.  The goal will be to motivate students to pursue jobs from basic Computer Support Specialist through advanced level positions in Information Assurance.  The project will be implemented in a rural setting where high schools often lack the institutional capital to offer information, technology and computer science programs. This project will investigate what high school women and minority students need to succeed in information security professions. Moreover, the project will identify factors that affect high school students' cybersecurity career interests.  The project specifically targets young women and minorities, who live in rural areas in Maui County Hawaii, without ready access to technology.  The project will be unique in that it focuses on cybersecurity issues that are critical for small businesses, an often-overlooked segment of the national economy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be based on an economic model in which early-admit afterschool programs present a viable option for high school students to signal their college/career preferences.  The project will engage more than 70 underrepresented high school students with core topics in cybersecurity: (1) participation in a combined problem-based learning (PLB) and game-based learning environment; (2) involvement in hands-on cybersecurity competitions; (3) connection to appropriate college academic and financial aid advising; (4) engagement with community mentors. The project aims to have at least 80% of the targeted participants complete all stages of the career pathway. At least 30% of the participants will be women and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can be replicated in other rural communities to broaden participation for historically underrepresented students by extracting and addressing key factors as important determinants for high school women and minority students' cybersecurity career/job interest.  The project will also develop and train faculty and community mentors as part of faculty-industry teams who will be in positions to disseminate cybersecurity technician education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report.  This project has successfully achieved its overall goal to increase awareness and readiness of underrepresented high school students for successful matriculation into careers in cybersecurity by implementing an early admit cybersecurity career pathway for high school students.  The project has also successfully met its objectives to: (1) Prepare students for careers in cybersecurity through career awareness, exploration and readiness activities and (2) Prepare students for college-level course cybersecurity program of studies through sequencing of information computer science and cybersecurity courses. The project successfully recruited women and other underrepresented high school students to courses that would prepare them for a cybersecurity pathway.  Overall, 32% of the students participating in the project were Native Hawaiian or Part-Hawaiian.  Over the three years, 39% of the participants were female. Throughout this project, students, parents, teachers, and stakeholders have consistently reflected on the success of the program.  Parents and students  (even those who withdrew from the program) have reported an increase in awareness about cybersecurity jobs.  Amazingly, even 88% of the students who withdrew from the program reported an interest in taking courses in cybersecurity in the future. Of the project third year cohort that have graduated high school, all are enrolled in college and 86% are majoring in a STEM field. Intellectual Merit.  The intellectual Merit of the project is that it demonstrates that an Early Admit High School Program in Cybersecurity can increase awareness and readiness of underrepresented high school students for successful matriculation into careers in cybersecurity by implementing an early admit cybersecurity career pathway for high school students.  Additional Intellectual Merit for this project is that it provides insights into the importance of time management skills for the success of underrepresented students taking early admit cybersecurity classes while in high school.  This project also provides insights into an under researched but important group of underrepresented college students, Filipino Americans.  Similarly, it provides insights into the recruitment and retention of first-generation college students into cybersecurity.  Finally, it establishes that online introductory cybersecurity courses to remote rural sites has been demonstrated effective under certain conditions (e.g. long-term relationships established, support, changes happen on both sides of the education sector not just on one side).    Broader Impact. The Broader Impact of this program is that it has been very successful in recruiting and retaining underrepresented students both women and minorities into the STEM pipeline.  Therefore, this program is working toward meeting the cybersecurity needs of the United States. The underrepresented students in this program (e.g. Native Hawaiian, Filipino, multiple ethnicities) are not often the focus of NSF grants. In addition to the recruitment of women and ethnic minorities into the STEM pipeline, the project has also successfully recruited and retained first generation college students.  The definition of underrepresented students was expanded to include these first-generation college students as the grant progressed as part of the iterative process of evaluation.  In addition, women and minorities may also be first generation college students.  Bringing an intersectionality approach to understanding underrepresented students provides a more wholistic approach to retaining rural, underrepresented students into the STEM pipeline.
