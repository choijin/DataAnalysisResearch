<AbstractNarration>This research project will investigate new ways to evaluate small area estimates.  There is a growing demand for statistics related to small geographic areas.  These small area estimates are used by policymakers to assess the well-being of a nation, develop public policies, and allocate funds in various government programs.  Users of these estimates generally are interested in understanding the uncertainty that is relevant to their specific small area as opposed to average uncertainty measures.  However, most of the uncertainty measures proposed in the literature for small area estimates are not area specific in the study variable.  This project will develop new uncertainty measures and examine their effectiveness in measuring area specific uncertainty in the study variable.  A focus of the project will be on the mentoring of students and early-career researchers.  The new research results will be incorporated into both a graduate course and a short course on small area estimation.  Software will be developed to implement the new techniques and will be made publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will examine the versatility of the adjusted maximum likelihood method, already found useful in certain small area problems, in obtaining reliable uncertainty measures of the estimates that are small area specific in the study variable.  The investigator will conduct a design-based simulation and real data analysis in order to understand the robust properties of the proposed uncertainty measures.  Data for evaluating the new methodology will be drawn from census and household survey data.  The project is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is a growing demand for reliable data on spatial and temporal granularity.  For example, residents are more interested in their own community's current statistics, such as the weekly crime statistics in their area, over national annual statistics.  Sample survey data for granular levels, commonly referred to as small areas, are usually too sparse to support the sort of standard estimation methods typically employed at the national level.  It would be prohibitively expensive to produce fine-grain data using traditional statistical methods that rely solely on sample survey data.   Large databases such as administrative or census records in combination with survey data offer potential solutions to the sparse data problems. In small area estimation, statistical models are used to borrow strengths from other alternative databases.  This statistical approach has the potential to reduce costs in producing small area statistics as it takes advantage of existing databases instead of requiring new costly survey data collection. In much of the small area estimation literature, mixed models are generally employed because such models can account for uncertainties at different levels of hierarchy. These models thereby can produce more accurate estimates and uncertainty measures compared to the corresponding standard regression model.   In this project, versatility of the adjusted maximum likelihood method, initiated by the PI and his students, is discussed in assigning accurate weights to the estimates obtained from different databases.   Moreover, simplified classical uncertainty measures of the small area estimates that avoid traditional complex bias corrections are developed.  This helps reduce the computational burden and avoids undesirable negative uncertainty measures.  Under the project, a new concept of a multi-goal prior is introduced in order to reconcile the Bayesian and classical approaches for random effects small area models.  The resulting Bayesian method provides an area specific uncertainty measure, which is more relevant in measuring the uncertainty of an individual small area estimate than the commonly used average uncertainty measures.  Furthermore, the project addresses important issues related to variance modeling, robustness to model misspecification, variable selection, and uncertainty measures that include uncertainty due to variable selection.   Small area official statistics are routinely used for a variety of purposes, including assessing the economic well-being of a nation, making public policies, and allocating funds at the federal, state and local levels.
