<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Matthew J. Allen, Chemistry Department, Wayne State University, is studying new lanthanide systems that catalytically perform reductions and bond-forming reactions when exposed to visible light. Catalysts are substances that permit chemical reactions to be run rapidly with minimum energy consumption. They are used in a variety of industrial processes. In this project, catalysts are being developed that utilize and can be switched on and off by visible light. In addition, they operate under conditions that are not compatible with current catalysts. Several important processes including reactions that form carbon-carbon bonds are studied. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students are trained to become skilled and ethical scientists. High school students, who are from groups underrepresented in science, have an opportunity to participate in research, leading to a more educated and diverse scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on new lanthanide-containing complexes that can drive visible-light-promoted photoredox catalysis. Specifically, the project tests the hypothesis that if trivalent lanthanide-containing azacryptates are exposed to a sacrificial reductant and visible light, they perform catalysis at redox potentials more negative than divalent lanthanide salts alone. Testing this hypothesis simultaneously addresses two long-standing challenges in redox chemistry: (1) the need for photoredox catalyts tunable across a range of potentials and wavelengths for improved chemoselectivity and (2) the need for air-stable, non-toxic alternatives to samarium(II) hexamethyl phosphoramide. The research includes the synthesis of a series of complexes of divalent and trivalent europium and ytterbium. These complexes are characterized by UV/visible and fluorescence spectra, electrochemical potentials, thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities, crystal structures, solubilities, and propensities for transmetallation. Additionally, the complexes are studied with respect to their ability to catalyze important classes of photoredox reactions including reductions, carbon-carbon bond formations, and ring closures. Finally, students are trained in the scientific method and the responsible conduct of research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project studied how visible light can be used to control catalysis using the metals europium and ytterbium. Specifically it explored several new complexes of these metals. With respect to intellectual merit, the new complexes were synthesized and their properties relevant to catalysis were studied including what wavelength of light they absorb, how well and what type of light they emit after absorbing light, and their electrochemical potentials (a measure of how well they can reduce other molecules in catalysis). In the process of performing these studies, we discovered several highly luminescent complexes and discovered trends in what features of the complexes can be used to tune the absorption and emission of light from the complexes as well as what features can be used to tune the electrochemical potential of the complexes. Beyond characterizing new complexes, we demonstrated the first use of a divalent lanthanide in visible-light-promoted photoredox catalysis. We are able to perform reductions catalytically with our new system under relatively mild conditions that otherwise would require harsh conditions. With respect to broader impacts, the ability to use visible light to enhance reactivity is impactful because the energy of visible light is too low to directly promote side reactions with many substrates. Europium and ytterbium are more earth-abundant than the second and third row transition metals found in most photoredox precatalysts. Furthermore, our potent reducing agents enable the avoidance of harsh conditions needed to reduce molecules that tend to be extremely difficult to reduce. The new precatalysts that we discovered can be stored in the air-stable +3 oxidation state and have excited-state electrochemical potentials that rival, and in some cases exceed, those of the most potent reducing agents used in the synthesis of important molecules. In addition to the direct impacts of the research, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students were trained to become skilled and ethical scientists.
