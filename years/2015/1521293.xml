<AbstractNarration>Do and his collaborators will use new methods to investigate several questions related to Fourier analysis and its applications to completely integrable systems. This project concerns convergence of Fourier series along `thin' sub-sequences of partial sums, as motivated by a conjecture of Konyagin; extensions of classical and non-classical estimates related to Fourier series to weighted settings, with motivations coming from work of  Germain-Masmoudi-Shatah in partial differential equations; a new approach to Plancherel-Rotach asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials with rough varying weights, motivated by applications in spectral study of unitary random matrices and by applications in other non-commutative examples of the Fourier transform; and sharp estimates for lower-order terms in long-time asymptotics of Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur integrable equations, with additional motivations coming from studies of perturbation of integrable equations.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;This mathematics research project is in the area of harmonic analysis, in which data  is analyzed by breaking  it into more manageable components. An important tool is the Fourier transform, which provides methods to decompose complicated signals into basic waves. These decompositions and related techniques have a number of useful applications in engineering and other applied sciences. For example, in image processing, harmonic analysis is useful in de-noising images and analyzing image structures. More generally, harmonic analysis could be used in signal processing to compress and decompress data, allowing for very large amounts of information to be effectively transmitted with manageable errors.  Other variants of the Fourier transform also appear in statistics and mathematical physics. One such variant occurs in the study of energy levels of random physical systems. This research project seeks to improve the understanding of the above studies by investigating fundamental properties of the new variants of the Fourier transform.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Signals collected from many systems are often of complicated nature and one common approach used in the analysis of the signals is to  decompose the data into more manageable components.  An important mathematical tool used for the decomposition is the Fourier transform, and questions about the applicability of the  transform  have been of central importance in mathematics. Variants of the Fourier transform also appear in studies of nonlinear systems in sciences, and through these variants it becomes possible to study the long-time behavior of these complicated systems, and a fundamental research direction in this subject is to improve the mathematical techniques so that one could still determine the long-time behavior of the systems with less information about the systems? initial states.   The mathematical research supported by this award was designed to improve the theoretical understanding of these issues for the Fourier transform and its variants. The results of our research gave us a number of new insights into these transforms. In particular, we learned new information about the typical amount of fluctuations  that occur when data are recovered from assembling the components of the Fourier transform decomposition. We also learned that there is a novel mathematical theory that is behind the analysis of these highly technical issues, which in particular facilitates significantly the book-keeping of the mathematical derivations and in the long run should enable more scientists to understand and further develop this highly technical area of mathematics. Our methods also apply to multilinear settings which are first steps towards further understanding of similar issues for nonlinear variants of the Fourier transform. With regards to the  long-time behavior of nonlinear systems, the supported research leads to a number of intermediate results that will be useful in the future resolution of the questions of improving the assumptions on the system?s initial state. The supported research also leads to several related results about the large parameter behavior of random equations that arise in finance and physics.
