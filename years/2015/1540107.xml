<AbstractNarration>More than 40 million Americans suffer from anxiety. This creates a major social and economic burden upon individuals, their families and employers. One proven treatment for anxiety recovery is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy. Treatment involves in-clinic psycho-education and out-of-clinic homework for the patient to complete at home or in their daily lives.  While cognitive behavior therapies have been proven to help anxiety disorders, positive outcomes depend on patient engagement with their homework for a prolonged period of time. Unfortunately, the paper- or workbook-based homework often has the following problems: (1) clients try to hide their homework from family and friends who care; (2) they often intentionally or unintentionally forget to do homework; (3) while the clinicians expect the client to do homework off-session, the client hopes to do it as much in-session as possible for the reasons mentioned above. Thus, the clinician can be frustrated when the client fails to do homework as expected, and clients can be frustrated when they don?t see the promised improvement.  This project seeks to quantify the potential commercial market for a mobile health platform designed to support clinicians providing cognitive behavioral therapy and their patients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology will engage patients with digital cognitive behavior change exercises through a secure HIPAA compliant platform. In addition, other functions related to therapy, such as recording in-the-moment anxious episodes, will be done through an easy and intuitive mechanism using our technology rather than recording on sheets of paper or recollecting from memory later on. Clinicians will also have secure access to review patient's progress as well as to set-up engagement reminders. The proposed innovation provides a secure and engaging environment for clients that supplement their treatment with the clinician. In addition to typical clinicians and patients, this team will explore the potentials for organizations such as universities to sponsor their at-risk students and employees to use our system as a mobile health tool for promoting wellbeing.</AbstractNarration>
