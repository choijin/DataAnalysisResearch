<AbstractNarration>A central challenge in human evolutionary studies is to understand when, how and in what social and ecological context unique features of modern human life history evolved, including our early age at weaning, prolonged period of slow childhood growth, and late age at first reproduction.  These key elements of our life histories are proposed underlie key shifts in human cognitive and behavioral evolution.  Our closest living relatives, the great apes, provide critical comparisons for investigating human life history evolution, but current knowledge of their physical growth patterns remains overwhelmingly derived from captive studies and from chimpanzees. This project uses non-invasive methods to study growth and development in two long-term study populations of wild gorillas, for which there are very few existing data. The outcome of this research will significantly advance our understanding of comparative great ape development and will critically inform fundamental questions about the evolutionary origins of modern human life history.  In addition, the research will result in a valuable new dataset of interest to researchers across several disciplines, and support important efforts in primate conservation, student training, research infrastructure, and international collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research employs a novel combination of non-invasive methods to integrate morphological, physiological, and behavioral data to generate a comprehensive understanding of the manner in which observed differences in life history and socioecology interact with variation in physical ontogeny within and among ecologically distinct populations of wild gorillas. Data to be collected from Karisoke mountain gorillas (N=115; 0-18 years, N=80 based on current demographics) include measures of morphological growth and development (dental emergence, linear body dimensions, muscle mass via urinary creatinine), maternal and offspring energetics and diet (urinary C-peptide, suckling rate and bout duration, diet composition and nutritional content), maternal dominance status and parity, and other measures of behavior (e.g., activity budgets, daily travel distance) and health. These data will be partnered with measures of dental and somatic growth determined from a naturally accumulated skeletal sample at this site.  Comparative morphological and behavioral data for wild western lowland gorillas are from the Mbeli Bai Study, Republic of Congo (N=140; 0-18 years, N=50).  The project aims to: 1) provide the first data on physical ontogeny in wild mountain gorillas of known age, and test hypothesized socioecological factors influencing variation in development and life history between mountain and western gorillas; 2) test maternal energetics, nutrition and other effects on variation in offspring dental and somatic development within mountain gorillas; 3) test relationships between measures of morphological development and key behavioral and reproductive life history measures in mountain gorillas; and 4) test whether the timing of developmental milestones assessed from skeletal remains differs significantly from those determined from surviving members of the same population.  Results will yield a more comprehensive understanding of how and why dental, somatic, reproductive, and behavioral milestones co-vary in closely-related great ape taxa, and by shedding light on how individual variability in life history may be mediated by offspring growth, improve our understanding of reproductive (and thus, evolutionary) outcomes of ontogenetic variation.  Further, by generating a comprehensive model of development and life history in these extant populations, and testing the accuracy of our life history inferences from an associated skeletal assemblage, our results are expected to significantly inform approaches to studying life history in fossil contexts.</AbstractNarration>

This project employed a novel combination of non-invasive methods to integrate morphological, physiological, and behavioral data to study growth and development in a single genus of African great apes, <em>Gorilla</em>. Data collection was focused on Virunga mountain gorillas, a wild population studied long-term by the Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda (N=131; 0-42 years). Virunga mountain gorillas are the most folivorous of all apes, characterized by earlier weaning and higher fertility.

Using laser photogrammetry to measure body size growth in living Virunga mountain gorillas, we established that 98% of maximum body length was reached by 12 years in females and 14 years in males. In support of our hypothesis, results suggest that differences in age at body size attainment may characterize the eastern and western gorilla species; Virunga males reached adult size earlier than previously reported for western gorillas. However, within mountain gorillas, altering prenatal investment may be an important strategy for mitigating energetic risks; Virunga and Bwindi mountain gorillas reached adult body size at similar ages and grew at similar rates, but Bwindi gorillas were smaller. Second, within Virunga mountain gorillas, significant variation in body size growth rates and size for age was found among individuals. Results to date indicated that first born offspring were smaller than later-born offspring, and early life adversity (e.g., maternal loss, death of the dominant male, or injury) was associated with reduced growth rates compared to age-matched peers. These results shed light on factors influencing variation in physical development, which may have important fitness consequences and impact key life history transitions. We continue to incorporate other behavioral and physiologic metrics to investigate variation in physical development. Finally, partnering living datasets with naturally accumulated Virunga gorilla skeletons (N=42; 0-15 years), we found no evidence of a systematic mortality bias in age at tooth emergence. First permanent molar emergence, a proposed milestone for acquiring nutritional independence, occurred at a median of 3.2 years, corresponding to weaning-related diet transitions assessed from available individual and population analyses. Available skeletal data from Bwindi indicate similar first molar emergence timing (N=1, 3.04 years), despite delayed interbirth intervals compared to Virunga gorillas. Dental emergence timing may be under strong selection to accommodate mechanical requirements of processing fibrous foods at weaning in mountain gorillas, while attainment of offspring independence is more responsive to local ecology and/or energetics.
