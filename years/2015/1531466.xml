<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Theodore Burkey from the University of Memphis (UM) and colleagues Tomoko Fujiwara, Daniel Baker and Xuan Zhao will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with solid state capabilities. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance.  The instrument also allows study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The cryogenic probe provides a significant increase in sensitivity relative to standard NMR probes. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate and graduate students. Seven faculty members at UM serve as research project leaders comprising the primary user team. The NMR increases productivity, enables new areas of investigation, and enhances UM as a regional resource for industry. Since the NMR solids capability is not available in the region it has become a resource for regional research-intensive institutions including the University of Mississippi. The automatic sample changer along with internet connectivity allows real experimental results to be integrated in lab curricula for UM and local four-year colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studying cancer phototherapy using multifunctional nanocomplexes; (b) studying chemical modification of smart chitosan implants; (c) analyzing chain exchange kinetics and mechanism of tri-block copolymer micelles during sol-to-gel transitions; (d) investigating functional nanoporous membranes; (e) designing of metal complexes for catalytic splitting of water; (f) developing sub-picosecond photoresponsive organometallics; (g) investigating halogen bond-driven assemblies in pi-conjugated oligomers for materials applications; (h) designing sphingosine kinase and diacylglycerol kinase assays; and (i) studying autotaxin inhibitor optimization.</AbstractNarration>
