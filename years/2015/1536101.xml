<AbstractNarration>This project supports participation in the thirty-fifth annual meeting of the Southeastern Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE), on October 10-11, 2015, at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. The conference began in 1981 and has met annually since then, with the venue rotating among research institutions in the Southeast. The conference continues SEARCDE's tradition as a forum for discussion and exchange of research ideas and recent developments in both theoretical and applied differential equations. In addition to four invited plenary lectures by leading international scholars in differential equations, there are twenty-minute contributed talks given in parallel sessions. All participants have the opportunity to present their work in these contributed talks, which are organized so that talks by established and senior researchers are interspersed with talks by beginning researchers. Information about the conference can be found at the website, http://www.uncg.edu/mat/searcdeconf/2015 .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal objective of the SEARCDE conference is to promote research and education in the field of differential equations by bringing together established and beginning researchers to exchange ideas and discuss recent developments. The conference tradition fosters an atmosphere conducive to networking and the creation of new research collaborations. SEARCDE especially encourages the participation of beginning researchers, who get the opportunity to meet and hear renowned plenary speakers and senior researchers from the region. For over three decades SEARCDE has been the setting for many graduate students to deliver their first conference lectures. For others it has been their first opportunity to discuss their research with senior research faculty outside their graduate institution. Many researchers continue to participate regularly in the SEARCDE conference throughout their careers. The conference series provides important opportunities for young researchers, especially those from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
