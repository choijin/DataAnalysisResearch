<AbstractNarration>Structural health monitoring aims to detect damage and assess critical, physical infrastructures over long periods of time. The infrastructures assessed can include pipelines, bridges, steel cables, aircrafts, trains, and power plants. Due to the significant complexity and variability of structural health monitoring data, current technology can only reasonably assess limited amounts of information. Yet, as structural health monitoring expands to more complex problems and its data includes hundreds of terabytes of structural data over several decades, big data strategies become essential. This award supports fundamental research to integrate statistical, big data strategies with structural health monitoring systems. The new, integrated framework will enable the tracking and the anticipation of structural damage in harsh, highly variable environments over many years. This study will provide tools for the detection of structural damage before catastrophic failures occur. Results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society by improving safety and reducing life-cycle costs of many civil and mechanical systems, from airplanes to bridges to pipelines. The research also promotes highly interdisciplinary collaboration as the research employs methods and solves problems found across the disciplines of electrical and computer engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, and civil engineering. This diverse subject matter will promote a multidisciplinary engineering education and help to recruit and broaden the participation of underrepresented students in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will statistically identify barely visible, critically important trends in large (gigabyte to terabyte size) structural health monitoring data sets. Three primary challenges are addressed: (1) distorting environmental conditions, (2) poor scaling to large data sets, and (3) no standard statistic for reliability. This project addresses these three challenges through the creation of a modular big data structural health monitoring framework based on dynamic time warping, singular value decomposition, factor analysis, and maximum likelihood statistics. The big data structural health monitoring framework is assessed through several short-term (hours to days) and long-term (multi-year) structural health monitoring experiments that introduce composite panels to a variety of damage and environmental conditions. These experiments provide statistical validation as well as a unique opportunity to study the effects of environmental parameters on composite structural health monitoring data.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br /><br />Health monitoring systems for  structures, materials, and manufacturing have the amazing potential to  ensure the health and safety of the world?s aging infrastructure over  long periods. Yet, tracking material and structural variations (e.g.,  crack growth, corrosion, or other forms of degradation) are exceedingly  difficult. This is because (1) data is heavily altered by small,  environmental conditions (such as temperature, loading, moisture, etc.),  (2) there exists limited frameworks for scaling current research  methods to large-scale data sets, and (3) there exists few standard  statistical measures for assessing the reliability of current systems. <br /><br />As  a result, this project studied the creation of algorithms to identify  barely visible, critically important trends in large data sets. Our  successes include <br /><br />(1) a structural health monitoring framework  for storing and processing large ultrasonic datasets consisting of  multiple terabytes of data, <br /><br />(2) new strategies for reducing effects of the environment (that can ruin damage detection and  localization) for much broader environmental conditions (e.g., greater  temperature distributions) and broader signal properties (e.g., higher  frequencies) than previously possible, <br /><br />(3) techniques for  statistical detection and localization of structural damage that no  longer require prior knowledge or assumptions about the expected data,<br /><br />(4)  a framework for statistical models of ultrasonic guided waves that can  be used to evaluate the performance of damage detection methodologies, <br /><br />(5)  preliminary machine learning algorithms that can parse large,  multi-terabyte ultrasonic structural health monitoring datasets for  identifying important events, such as damage or other strong data  variations. <br /><br />We also created a unique experiment system and been  collecting a unique ultrasonic structural health monitoring dataset from  an outdoor health monitoring system for the last two to three years  (consisting of more than 3 Terabytes (TB) of data). This dataset offers  insight into how common environmental factors affecting ultrasonic  structural health monitoring data. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong><br /><br />Many  ultrasonic structural health monitoring strategies often only analyze a  few measurements from a short period, and the damage is often detected  by comparing only two measurements at a time: a baseline and the current  measurement.
