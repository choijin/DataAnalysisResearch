<AbstractNarration>Parking can take up a significant amount of the trip costs (time and money) in urban travel. As such, it can considerably influence travelers' choices of modes, locations, and time of travel. The advent of smart sensors, wireless communications, social media and big data analytics offers a unique opportunity to tap parking's influence on travel to make the transportation system more efficient, cleaner, and more resilient. A cyber-physical social system for parking is proposed to realize parking's potential in achieving the above goals.  This cyber-physical system consists of smart parking sensors, a parking and traffic data repository, parking management systems, and dynamic traffic flow control. If successful, the results of the investigation will create a new paradigm for managing parking to reduce traffic congestion, emissions and fuel consumption and to enhance system resilience. These results will be disseminated broadly through publications, workshops and seminars. The research will provide interdisciplinary training to both graduate and undergraduate students. The results of this research also fills a void in our graduate transportation curriculum in which parking management gets little coverage. The investigators will organize an online short training course in Coursera and National Highway Institute to bring results to a broader audience. The investigators will also collaborate with Carnegie Museum of Natural History to develop an online digital map and related educational programs, which will be presented in the museum galleries during public events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technically, new theories, algorithms and systems for efficient management of transportation infrastructure through parking will be developed in this research, leveraging cutting-edge sensing technology, communication technology, big data analytics and feedback control. The research probes massive individualized and infrastructure based traffic and parking data to gain a deeper understanding of travel and parking behavior, and develops a novel reservoir-based network flow model that lays the foundation for modeling the complex interactions between parking and traffic flow in large-scale transportation networks. The theory will be investigated at different levels of granularity to reveal how parking information and pricing mechanisms affect network flow in a competitive market of private and public parking. In addition, this research proposes closed-loop control mechanisms to enhance mobility and sustainability of urban networks. Prices, access and information of publicly owned on-street and off-street parking are dynamically controlled to: a) change day-to-day behavior of all commuters through day-to-day travel experience and/or online information systems; b) change travel behavior of a fraction of adaptive travelers on the fly who are aware of time-of-day parking information and comply to the recommendations; and c) influence the market prices of privately owned parking areas through a competitive parking market.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Parking has been a continued challenge in urban environments and searching for parking has resulted in significant road congestion. The increased deployment of sensing technologies and platforms such as smartphones provide an opportunity to design low-cost and efficient parking management. The emergence of Electric Vehicle and potentially autonomous vehicle technologies provide additional challenges and opportunities. Traditional approaches to address these issues have relied on traffic modelling to design solutions that affect driver and parking facility decision making statically in the absence of information and real-time sensing systems. Information and real-time sensing offer an alternative that can provide completely different solutions, that are more data-driven and adaptive.  In this project, we investigated novel approaches that enable such data-driven adaptive approaches to be both theoretical sound and practically deployable. The major accomplishments of the project in support of this goal were: (i) to design and deploy novel information systems for parking that leverage recent technology advances such as wireless sensor networks technology and mobile phones to reduce parking seeking; (ii) Develop predictive approaches that utilize data from the traffic network and parking sensors to provide improved occupancy information to drivers relying on real-time forecasting; (iv) design economically efficient and responsive parking pricing algorithms that utilize data; (v) develop algorithms to manage the charging of electric vehicles in parking lots with large numbers of them to reduce costs due to ageing of power infrastructure and electricity rates, while accounting for uncertainty in vehicle arrivals and departures and (vi) identify impacts of EV charging while parking at home or at the workplace. The solutions were developed and tested on real-world testbeds that included a multi-storey parking lot at Stanford that included the installation of wireless high-resolution occupancy sensors and a deployment at a Google Inc. parking location, where data is collected on EV charging, local solar power generation and the parking lot power transformer to enable scheduling the charging amongst all of those connected to the transformer. The promising results have led to the adoption of some ideas by industry, including incorporating forecasting innovations and improved optimization of EV charging in workplace parking lots.  The project enabled training of PhD students and postdocs that were able to develop their expertise in data science and infrastructure management. The project can have impacts beyond research and development: (i) modules developed based on the project data and deployments have been incorporated in undergraduate and graduate courses at Stanford University, (ii) improving the parking experience for drivers with the potential to significantly reduce congestion and increase driver well-being and (iii) reduce the workplace charging costs increasing the availability of workplace chargers and consequently enabling the increased adoption of electric vehicles.
