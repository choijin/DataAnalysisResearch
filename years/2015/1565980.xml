<AbstractNarration>Mark Tuckerman of New York University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to develop methods and software for the prediction of molecular crystal structure.  This award is cofunded by the CISE/ACI Software Reuse Venture Fund.   In the science of materials, ordered arrays of molecules forming structures known as molecular crystals play an essential role in the pharmaceutical, electronics, and defense industries. Often, the crucial question is which crystals should be made for a particular application.   It is worth noting that one of the most widely used pharmaceutical molecular crystals, aspirin, was discovered essentially by accident. Typically, in crystal engineering, it is necessary to screen large databases of potential candidate compounds. Unfortunately, making and characterizing molecular crystals in the laboratory is generally time consuming and costly, rendering a trial-and-error approach through such a database impractical. How many more important molecular crystal systems might be discovered if a systematic, targeted approach could be applied? Theory and computation, which can, in principle, rapidly predict molecular crystal structures and their properties, are uniquely poised to play a key role in creating such a targeted approach. What is needed, however, are robust algorithms for making these predictions.  The Tuckerman group develops computational techniques and software for predicting the crystal structures a given compound can form and ranking them according to a thermodynamic property known as free energy, which has been recognized in the scientific community as the proper figure of merit for such a ranking but has remained an elusive property to determine. The Tuckerman group also adapts these algorithms for studying the conformational preferences of short chains of amino acids known as oligopeptides in order to explore the role these important biological molecules play in immunogenicity and the design of new classes of pharmaceuticals.  Tuckerman and his coworkers are engaged in many software activities including developing a computer package for crystal structure prediction, improving the efficiency of their molecular dynamics software, PINY-MD and continuing to contribute software to many community software codes.  All of the software developed in this project is made available to the broader research community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic properties of molecular materials in the solid state are often strongly influenced by the details of their crystal structures and the existence of polymorphs.  Experimental determination of these structures is costly and time-consuming, which places increased importance on the role of theory and computation.  Similarly, the biochemical function of small oligopeptides, from immunogenicity to inhibition, is affected by their equilibrium conformations in different environments.  Computational prediction of structure in complex systems such as these is challenging due to the so-called rare-event sampling problem on a rough potential energy landscape, which arises when attempting to study the equilibrium thermodynamics and kinetics of many complex systems. Roughness on an energy surface refers to the existence of high barriers to conformational and structural changes.  The Tuckerman group has proposed to develop robust free-energy based enhanced sampling algorithms and software for overcoming the rare-event problem that arises in the crystal structure prediction and conformational sampling of oligopeptides, thereby allowing favored structures to be identified and thermodynamically ranked in an efficient manner. In the proposed methods, the free energy landscape is expressed in terms of select set of collective variables (CVs) designed to distinguish the different structural motifs in these systems. The CVs are first be subject to new surface navigation techniques in order to identify the minima and saddles points, collectively referred to as "landmarks" on the landscape, and then targeted for enhanced sampling in order to produce the free energy ranking of the landmarks. The new techniques are applied to predict the crystal structures and polymorphs of both rigid and flexible small organic molecules, to study the conformational free energy landscape of an immunogenic peptide binding to the major histocompatibility complex, and to understand the influence of mechanical force on the unfolding mechanism of Ã¢-hairpin peptide. Software creation will be accelerated via hackathons organized by the Tuckerman group.  Education of students in rare-event methods is aided through workshops organized at New York University's global campus sites.   Finally, the Tuckerman group reaches out to underrepresented groups via national organizations having a presence in New York City in order to help devise and participate in STEM-related educational activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Structural diversity abounds in nature, and in the molecular sciences such as chemistry, materials engineering, or biomedical engineering, our ability to harness this structural diversity in advantageous ways depends on our ability to understand and predict the diverse "landscape" of structural motifs a molecule or molecular material may access and to determine how the observable properties of a system vary over this landscape.  Examples that illustrate the influence of structural diversity include pharmaceuticals, in which a phenomenon known as "polymorphism" -- the ability of a molecular solid (how most pharmaceuticals are formulated) to assume multiple structures -- can cause drugs to fail, or the emerging field of cancer immunotherapy, where the efficacy of an antigenic peptide used to create a therapy depends on its specific conformation when it interacts with the cells of our immune system.          Designing experiments capable of providing full coverage of the structural landscapes of complex molecular systems such as those illustrated in the aforementioned examples is extremely difficult, and these experimental investigations tend to be costly, time-consuming, and possibly inconclusive as to the full range of possible structural motifs on the landscape.  For this reason, researchers are increasingly turning to computational approaches that leverage both direct physics-based computer simulations of a system as well as tools of artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning methods, both to provide complete explorations of structural landscapes and to elucidate changes in the properties of a system over the landscape.  This project has been concerned with the development of such computational tools and their application to problems in the areas of cancer immunotherapy and crystalline molecular materials.   The key challenge facing developers of such computational approaches is that the structural landscape is a complex one imbued with a ?roughness? that resembles a mountainous terrain with valleys, peaks, and passes.  In order to navigate from one ?valley?, corresponding to a structural pattern of interest, one must find a way over a pass or peak to the next valley or interesting structure.  In a computer simulation, traversing this landscape, therefore, involves passing through structures of high energy that are difficult to attain, and doing so involves the creation of specialized techniques known as ?rare-event? sampling techniques.  This project has introduced a number of new rare-event sampling approaches applicable to a wide variety of problems and has shown how machine learning methods can be used to characterize the nature of the structural landscape of a system and to predict important properties such as the time it might take for a significant structural rearrangement in a system to occur (the so-called ?kinetics? of the rearrangement), thus dramatically changing its properties.         An example application concerned the binding of a melanoma-specific antigenic peptide into the receptor site of a T-cell in order to engender an immune response against melanoma tumor cells.   The specific peptide used in this study exhibits two binding conformations (see first accompanying image), only one of which is able to engender an immune response.  The efficacy of a putative therapeutic peptide is often evaluated experimentally by crystallizing the complex of the peptide with a framework that includes the receptor site and then studying the binding conformation to determine if it is immunogenic or not.  However, these conditions are not those inside the body where the therapy must work, and the peptide chosen for our study registered a false negative in the crystalline state.  By performing a simulation at biologically relevant conditions, we were able to show that the peptide undergoes a conformational change from that seen in the crystal to a structure that leads to an immune response.  The study shows 1) the importance of evaluating these systems at the proper conditions and 2) that conformation matters and must be engineered into the peptides of interest in order for them to exhibit efficacy.   A second examples concerns the common pain reliever acetaminophen, in which we designed a study to target a solid form that is better for pharmaceutical manufacturing than that in current use, to pinpoint is location on the structural landscape, and to highlight specific properties that make it better (see second accompanying image).         This project has provided critical training for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in areas of machine learning and simulation of complex systems, skills they can transfer to careers in science or in other industries, including data analytics, software development, and finance.  Our work has also connected us to the pharmaceutical industry where our new tools are now being applied.  Finally, we have created research opportunities for high-school students of diverse backgrounds and have participated in programs allowing these students to dialogue directly with scientists about how careers in science are pursued and ways in which specific research projects impact society and how they might become involved in these efforts.  Tools funded by this project are made available to the community.        Last Modified: 11/29/2020       Submitted by: Mark E Tuckerman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
