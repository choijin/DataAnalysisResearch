<AbstractNarration>Loredana Lanzani and her collaborators will explore a number of fundamental questions in the area of Several Complex Variables and Partial Differential Equations, with emphasis onthe ambient domain's lack of boundary regularity. To accomplish these goals Loredana Lanzani and her collaborators will develop new techniques that hinge upon an interplay of complex analysis and harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several Complex Variables, Harmonic Analysis and Partial Differential Equations are major branches of mathematics. They are of paramount importance in pure and applied sciences and have vastly contributed to our present-day understanding of such basic phenomena as heat transfer and celestial mechanics.</AbstractNarration>
