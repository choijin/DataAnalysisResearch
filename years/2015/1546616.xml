<AbstractNarration>On 24 April 2015, the NSF-funded Ocean Observatories Initiative's (OOI) Cabled Array detected the onset of a probable eruption at Axial Seamount, heralded by a swarm of &gt;8000 small earthquakes and a rapid subsidence of the seafloor by &gt;2.4 meters at the center of the caldera. Evidence that lava was erupted in or near the summit caldera includes a dramatic temperature rise recorded by instruments on the OOI Cabled Array-- up to 0.6-0.7Â°C above ambient sustained for weeks after the event. This eruption is likely to have significantly perturbed the hydrothermal and biological systems in and around the summit caldera, and provides the rare opportunity to address time-critical scientific questions that can only be investigated with the near-term seafloor investigations. A currently scheduled NSF and NOAA funded cruise to Axial Seamount on R/V Thompson with ROV Jason and AUV Sentry in August 2015 provides an excellent opportunity for such a response. This study adds 3 days onto this cruise to facilitate time-critical event response science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailed seafloor mapping with shipboard multi-beam sonar and near-bottom Sentry surveys will cover areas of the caldera and adjacent rift zones that are expected eruption site(s). Fresh rock, if located, will be sampled and dated using the 210Po-210Pb technique. Hydrothermal plumes will be discerned with CTD casts and sensor tows. A mooring will be deployed with Miniature Autonomous Plume Recorders to measure temperature, light attenuation, and redox potential. The at-sea team plans to make samples and data available to the broader science community for targeted research on seafloor processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project was a rapid response to the volcanic eruption at Axial Seamount that started on 24 April 2015.  The NSF-funded Ocean Observatories Initiative?s (OOI) Cabled Array monitoring network detected the eruption, heralded by a swarm of &gt;8000 earthquakes and a rapid subsidence of the seafloor by &gt;2.4 meters at the center of the caldera. Rapid response activities enable the study of key processes that are poorly understood and require timely measurements to advance our knowledge and will not be possible later.  This award supported research activities during 3 extra days at sea that were added to a previously scheduled research expedition on R/V Thompson (TN327).  The research cruise made dives at Axial Seamount with the Jason ROV and Sentry AUV, during August 14-29, 2015.  Operations included mapping and sampling of the new lava flows, sampling of new hydrothermal vents on the new flows, CTD casts and tows of hydrothermal plumes over the new lavas, deployment and recovery of monitoring instruments and moorings, and continuing long-term measurements of the cycle of inflation and deflation at the volcano.   The rock samples we collected show that 2015 lava flows have the most mafic composition erupted in the last 600 years at Axial Seamount, probably a consequence of the four-fold increase in magma supply rate documented by the inflation/deflation time-series measurements since 2011.  CTD casts and tows documented and sampled hydrothermal plumes over the 2015 lava flows on the north rift zone, which varied significantly in character along the length of the rift.  The Jason ROV dives also documented small explosion pits in the 2015 lava flows that could be related to the impulsive signals detected by the OOI Cabled Array seismometers during the eruption.  Sentry AUV dives mapped some of the 2015 lava flows in high resolution and helped discover some previously unknown eruptive centers on the north rim of the caldera.   The outcomes from this project include a cruise web site (http://axial2015.blogspot.com/), as well as these papers published in scientific journals:  Chadwick, W. W., Jr., B. P. Paduan, D. A.
