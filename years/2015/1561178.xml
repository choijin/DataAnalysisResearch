<AbstractNarration>This I-Corps team has developed a method to create small tissue mimics of human organs within a microfluidics chip. Using this technology, we aim to create multiple chips, each representing a different organ system, to create an artificial "human-on-a-chip" platform to assess the organ specific and systemic effect of drug candidates without having to test these compounds in the human body. Currently, pharmaceutical companies spend billions of dollars and a few decades in drug development process, which effectively reduces thousands of candidates to one successful compound that can be put into the market. Initially, these candidates are tested on cells that are plated on plastic dishes, which do not resemble the conditions that would be faced by cells in the body. As a direct result, too many candidates advance from this stage into the costly and more time consuming preclinical animal studies, driving up the cost of drug development significantly. This team believes that the proposed organ-on-a-chip system, which not only recreates the structural features of native tissue, but also mimics the perfusion of blood in the body, will screen out drug candidates before progressing towards animal models. In addition, these chips will provide a more relevant perspective to the inner workings of biological systems on an organ level, allowing us to "de-risk" promising candidates by eliminating the poor performers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the proposed technology for generating organ-on-a-chips, the team has successfully created proof-of-concept prototypes of the heart-and tumor-on-a-chip platforms. Initially, the heart-on-a-chip platform has been chosen to showcase the proposed technology and address the need for assessing cardiac toxicity, which is a major concern for pharmaceutical companies. In the tumor-on-a-chip platform, the team has integrated different cell types found in the tumor microenvironment to mimic the progression of cancer. By providing a physiological relevant mixture of cells, the proposed system will provide the ability for pharmaceutical companies to assess the specificity of targeted cancer therapeutics, which have now become the norm in the treatment of oncology. For both platforms, one common goal is to provide further evidence of the relevance of our devices for drug testing purposes. To this end, the team will form partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to tap into their drug candidate libraries which have been tested prior to establish their efficacy and toxicity. The team will demonstrate the proposed platform's ability to recapitulate these drug specific results, which will allow them to build credibility amongst potential customers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The NSF award provided the opportunity for our team to advance the 3D organ-on-chip technology. The research in this field began in late 2014, and during the course of the NSF award, two manuscripts based on this technology were accepted and published. The award allowed the team to participate in the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program, in which two graduate students explored the commercial potential for the technology developed in our research lab. We underwent a rigorous seven-week process during which we developed and refined a value proposition and product-market fit for the organ-on-chip technology. Starting with an initial prototype of a &lsquo;heart-on-chip&rsquo; device for potential use in screening for drug toxicity, the team went through several pivots before realizing that the greatest and most immediate commercial impact would involve using the same technology as an drug efficacy screening tool for immuno-oncology therapeutics. While initially, the immense potential of creating an artificial &ldquo;human-on-a-chip&rdquo; system guided our belief that we can apply our technology to safely assess the effect of drugs on the human body without the risks of endangering patients during clinical trials, we realized through our customer interviews that this was still a far-off goal and it would be better to target a market with an unmet need.&nbsp; From our initial market research, we discovered the lack of complex <em>in vitro </em>oncology<em> </em>platforms beyond cells grown on 2-D surfaces.
