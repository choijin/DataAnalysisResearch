<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing the high temperature strength and durability of superalloys used in aerospace turbine engines will lead to enhanced engine efficiency and reduced fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Presently, improvement in superalloy performance has relied on trial-and-error alloy modification, which is utterly insufficient for materials innovation to keep pace with new engine design, leading to inevitable compromise in fuel efficiency and emissions goals. This award supports research that will develop a novel and efficient approach to connect alloy composition, microstructure and properties and enable more rapid and cost-effective superalloy advancement. The approach employs an innovative combination of cost-effective, rapid prototyping of highly relevant alloy compositions, with extensive modeling at essential length scales, and validating experiments and characterization tasks. Addressing these challenges will require close interaction with the project partner, GE Global Research, bringing practical experience and processing facilities to the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improvement in superalloy performance has relied on trial-and-error alloy modification, which is insufficient for materials innovation to keep pace with new engine design, leading to inevitable compromise in performance and fuel efficiency goals. This award supports an integrated experimental and computational research that aims to improve our basic understanding of these important alloys, develop predictive models of behavior from atomistic through mesoscale to aggregate (polycrystalline) levels, and to demonstrate the capabilities of the modeling tools developed through optimization of superalloys for performance at high temperature. The program is enabled by a novel rapid prototyping approach that will for the first time explore the inter-related effects of superalloy composition, microstructure, deformation mechanisms and creep response by producing a series of six-component alloys via a cast and wrought process at GE-GRC. This will be demonstrated by predicting optimized alloy composition / microstructure with enhanced properties relative to a present commercial alloy. Addressing these challenges will require close interaction with the GOALI partner, GE Global Research, bringing practical experience and processing facilities to the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This DMREF award supports an integrated experimental and computational effort to accelerate the discovery of new types of Ni-base superalloys that will have superior high-temperature creep performance, but most likely will have been missed by the traditional trial-and-error method. Ni-base superalloys are critical enabling high-temperature structural materials that determine the efficiency and carbon footprint of a wide range of aerospace and land-based power generation systems such as gas turbines. This effort is an integral part of the national efforts under the Materials Genome Initiative and the Integrated Computational Materials Engineering initiative. In this program, superalloy development has been led by computational modeling, detailed microstructure characterization and mechanical property evaluation, coupled with rapid alloy generation in collaboration with our GOALI partner, GE Research.  The most important outcome of this program has been the discovery that solute segregation and localized phase transformations (LPT) occur at stacking faults and twin boundaries within the strengthening precipitate phase in Ni-base superalloys.  This appears to be a ubiquitous effect and is associated with the weakening of these alloys at intermediate temperatures (in the range of 650-700&deg;C).  This discovery has required near-atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis of the structure and composition of these fault and twin features.  The nature of the segregation and LPTs at these planar defects can be dramatically altered by subtle variation in the overall alloy composition.  Furthermore, depending on the nature of the LPTs, the thermally-activated shearing of precipitates can either be promoted or suppressed.  Thus, these LPTs provide an exciting new atomic scale "marker" that correlates with enhanced high temperature strength and is a metallurgical analog to a DNA sequence that indicates predisposition to a particular disease.  These mechanistic insights have required computational modeling at three distinct length-scales in order to verify this LPT hypothesis, and to incorporate its effect into enhanced models of superalloy performance under mechanical loading.  These length-scales include (a) atomic-scale where density functional theory modeling has been used to verify the structural nature of the LPTs, (b) microstructure scale where phase field modeling has been used to simulate dislocation interaction with precipitates, and (c) polycrystalline aggregate scale where continuum plasticity/creep models have been developed to simulate overall material behavior at high temperature and under applied stress.  Because future materials R&amp;D activities, requiring substantially reduced time and cost cycles, must integrate computational materials research with critical experiments, this research project has also directly prepared graduate students to immediately contribute to the success of MGI/ICME in industry.
