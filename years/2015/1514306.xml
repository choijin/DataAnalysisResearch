<AbstractNarration>This project makes it possible for a tiny robotic bee to sense its distance to any nearby object. Such depth sensing for a small robot insect pushes the limits of sensor and algorithm design in terms size, weight, computing, and power. The key idea is joint design; every part of the robotic insect is optimized together, from wing design and optics to intelligent algorithms and efficient computation. This is possible by inter-disciplinary work across scientists and engineers from diverse backgrounds. The lessons learned through this project can be applied to transform other applications that involve small devices including medical sensors and endoscope imaging, smart homes and the internet of things, agricultural and industrial monitoring systems, and mobile vision for search and rescue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lidar sensing has enabled large robotic cars to navigate complex environments. This proposal introduces designs for "micro-lidar" that can be used on insect-scale aerial robots. Making micro-lidar work on small platforms involves four intertwined research thrusts. The first thrust uses MEMS mirrors and wide-angle optics to sense and modulate the laser pulses. The second thrust is adapting signal processing algorithms to estimate range data at this scale. The third thrust is developing novel perception and navigation algorithms to map the indoor environments using a micro-aerial vehicle. The fourth thrust is to improve robotic insect flight to allow novel manipulations that require knowledge of the surrounding range map. The utility of these sensors will be demonstrated on the robobee for novel maneuvers and building topo-feature maps of indoor environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goals of the project are to explore novel sensors, and associated control algorithms, for size, weight, and power limited autonomous robots. The chosen platform is the RoboBee, an insect-size flapping-wing robot chosen because of its extreme size challenges, limited payload, and high maneuverability. Specific to the Harvard portion of the project, we have developed hardware approaches to increasing the performance of insect-like flying vehicles (i.e., as the platform for integrating new sensors), developed small-scale sensor packages appropriate for basic flight control of this class of robot, and integrated power systems within this robot. Specific outcomes include:  Redesign of the 100mg insect-like vehicle to increase payload without significantly increasing power consumption through the integration of an additional paor of wings; Development of IMU and proximity sensor package that fits within the size, weight, and power constraints of the insect-like robot; Developed ~100mg high voltage boost and drive circuits to power the piezoelectric actuators yet remain sufficiently compact to fit within the strict weight budget of the vehicle; and Integrated solar cells to perform the first sustained power-autonomous flight of a robotic insect.  The Harvard group has coordinated with collaborators at U. Buffalo and U. Florida to understand the dynamic model of the flying robot and determine final sensor specifications (e.g., size, bandwidth, etc), respectively.
