<AbstractNarration>Critical research into cybersecurity vulnerabilities may be affected by legal considerations.  For example, cybersecurity researchers fear certain good-faith work could put them in personal legal jeopardy.  At the same time, the risks to the public and the economy associated with security research must be addressed.  This project convenes a set of leading computer scientists, academics, and lawyers to map out the challenges and propose a set of concrete solutions, including articulating reasonable norms, standards, or best practices for the conduct of cybersecurity research that could be used as a guide for defining good-faith research and for applying current statutes and exemptions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The grant provided funding to convene a workshop of leading computer  scientists and lawyers, from academia, civil society, and industry, to  map out the liability and related risks associated with cybersecurity  research and propose a set of concrete steps to address them.      The Berkeley Center for Law and  Technology, the UC Berkeley School of Information and School of Law, and  the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) convened on April 9  and 10, 2015, a workshop of leading computer scientists and lawyers,  from academia, civil society, and industry, to map out the problem and  propose a set of concrete solutions.  The specific objectives of the workshop were to:     Understand and document research that has not been undertaken because  of fears of legal liability, identify other real-world examples of  adverse impact of the laws or of the uncertainty surrounding those laws  on research, and, if possible, quantify or otherwise effectively convey  the cost of this chilling effect on research.    Identify and/or develop reasonable norms, standards or best practices  for the conduct of cybersecurity research that could be used to protect  responsible research and provide guidance to policymakers to reduce the  impact of existing statutes on cybersecurity research through the use  or creation of exemptions or other appropriate mechanisms.    Outline larger reforms to existing laws or other policy  clarifications, such as DMCA exemptions, that would reduce risks of  liability for the conduct and dissemination of cybersecurity research  and additional research that might inform their creation.      The workshop produced:   A full report is reflecting the thoughts of leading thinkers in the field: http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/files/cybersec-research-nsf-workshop.pdf  A sign-on statement explaining the importance of cybersecurity research and the chilling effect of the current legal environment http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/files/cybersecurity-statement-rev9.pdf.    These work products were publicly distributed and provided to relevant policy makers.  They have brought greater attention to legal barriers to cybersecurity research, and influenced policy activity.  The statement was filed with  the Copyright Office as part of the Section 1201 review under the DMCA. https://cdt.org/files/2015/05/CDT-et-al-Class-25-Reply-Comment-final-1.pdf   The  statement had an impact on the outcome.  Here is a brief analysis of  the positive features of the decision issued by the Copyright Office: https://cdt.org/blog/a-qualified-win-for-cybersecurity-researchers-in-dmca-triennial-rulemaking/ reflecting the statements impact.  The report was cited in the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan in support of a recommendation calling on policymakers to review and potentially modify existing and proposed laws to ensure they do not create barriers to cybersecurity research and development.  https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/2016_Federal_Cybersecurity_Research_and_Development_Stratgeic_Plan.pdf         Last Modified: 05/11/2016       Submitted by: Deirdre Mulligan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
