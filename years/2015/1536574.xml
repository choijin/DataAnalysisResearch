<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Experimental Calibration of the Isotopic Content of Marine Sulfate&lt;br/&gt;Alexander Bradley&lt;br/&gt;ID: 1536559&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sulfur is an essential element to life, and its biogeochemical cycle is of interest to a broad range of scientific disciplines. A requirement for understanding the sulfur cycle involves revealing and quantifying the mechanisms by which microbes oxidize and reduce sulfur species. This can be done by tracing stable sulfur and oxygen isotopes. Enzymes play a key role in the cycling of sulfur, but the degree to which individual enzymes preferentially use specific oxygen isotopes (fractionation) is not known and prevents complete understanding of observed oxygen isotopes patterns in marine sulfate. This project will investigate isotope fractionation (oxygen and sulfur) associated with two key enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of both sulfate reducing microbes and some sulfur oxidizing microbes. Resolving the influence of these enzymes on the isotopic composition of marine sulfate is important to stable isotope biogeochemistry and chemical oceanography. The project will serve as a vehicle to educate and train a postdoctoral researcher and undergraduate students, and will provide a teacher training opportunity in the investigators' labs to aid teachers in the design of student field trips and hands-on exercises for their students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cycling of sulfur between its oxidized and reduced forms is a major determinant of the oxidation of organic matter in the oceans and underlying sediments, and microbes play a key role in the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur. One of the key tracers of microbial sulfur cycling involves measuring the distribution of stable isotopes among sulfur phases. A number of studies have shown that the stable oxygen isotope composition of sulfate is an informative way to investigate the sulfur cycle. Despite its utility, there are few direct constraints on how biology impacts the oxygen isotopes of sulfate. The goal of this project is to place quantitative constraints on the enzymatic oxygen isotope fractionation associated with microbial sulfate reduction. This project will involve in vitro investigations of the kinetic isotope fractionations associated with ATP sulfurylase and APS reductase, and incorporate the resulting data into an existing model for understanding isotope fractionation during sulfate reduction and its resulting influence on the isotopic composition of marine sulfate. These models will provide critical insight into the behavior of the sulfur cycle and evolution of marine chemistry over key timescales.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our work on this porposal targeted using isootpic tracers to better understand the sulfate reduction metabolism.  Sulfate reducers are (generally) marine microbes that are critical in governing the carbon cycle.  Their collective behavior is difficult to directly track, thus isotopes (both sulfur and oxygen in sulfate) are used to proxy behavior and rates.  This study took a close look at one important step in the process and isolated the isotopic contribution of this step.    In more detail, we are attempting to understand how sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) influence the oxygen isotopic composition of sulfate. This will help us understand the d18O content of seawater sulfate, both in the modern and throughout earth history. Our research activities are targeted specifically at enzymes in the SRB pathway, with a focus on ATP sulfurylase (Sat)  This project has been performed in large part by postdoctoral fellow Derek Smith, who resides at Washington University but also works closely with collaborators at Harvard.  Derek has focused on (i) achieving the chemical separation of APS and sulfate, which is required in order to achieve the measurement of in vitro isotopic fractionation by Sat and (ii) performing batch culture experiments with Desulfovibrio vulgaris in which the activity of Sat has been modulated through mutations in a transcriptional repressor (Rex).
