<AbstractNarration>This project supports the travel of 20 graduate students from U.S. institutions to the ACM SIGCOMM 2015 Conference that will be held Aug. 17-21, 2015, in London, United Kingdom.  ACM SIGCOMM is the flagship annual conference of the Special Interest Group on Data Communications (SIGCOMM), a special interest group of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).  This project project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications.  Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated workshops.  The PIs especially encourage women and other minorities to participate.  SIGCOMM is the flagship international conference for computer networking research, and presents a unique opportunity for students to expand their breadth of ideas, research skills, and technical perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide each student with a travel award of $1,250 or the actual documented amount of expenses, whichever amounts to less.  The availability of the travel awards will be well publicized throughout the U.S. research community.  The project has established processes for selecting the awardees that are well described and that are appropriate for such a student travel grant.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ACM SIGCOMM 2015 conference took place from August 17-21, 2015 in London, United Kingdom.   SIGCOMM is sponsored by the Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM), a vital special interest group of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The purpose of the group is to provide a forum for the discussion of issues in the fields of data communications and computer networks. SIGCOMM was founded in 1969 and has about 1900 members, including more than 130 graduate students. Along with the IEEE Communications Society, SIG- COMM is one of the top two professional societies in data communications. In conjunction with the IEEE Communications Society and the IEEE Computer Society, ACM SIGCOMM publishes the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, the premier archival journal for state-of-the-art and practical applications of communication networks. ACM SIGCOMM also publishes the ACM Computer Communications Review, which emphasizes quick publication of interesting work, including work in progress.          Participation in conferences such as SIGCOMM forms a central part of the graduate school experience as it provides students with an opportunity to interact with senior researchers from academia as well as industry and exposes them to leading-edge research in the field.  The support requested in this proposal enabled multiple US-based students to attend the main conference and associated workshops at SIGCOMM  2015. These students would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. A total of 19 US-based graduate students, including 5 women were provided with travel support to attend the conference       Students also contributed to the conference by preparing paper summaries for a popular networking area blog (layer9.org)                       Last Modified: 06/05/2017       Submitted by: Vyas Sekar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
