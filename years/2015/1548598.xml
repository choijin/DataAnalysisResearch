<AbstractNarration>This proposal was co-funded by the Sedimentary Geology and and Paleobiology Program (EAR/GEO) and the Marine Geology and Geophysics Program (OCE/GEO)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sediment dispersal in the marine environment from small and moderately sized rivers can often be significantly impacted by episodic events such as large floods.  Unlike large rivers with extensive sediment routing systems or large estuaries at their mouths, these smaller rivers have a more direct sediment path to the ocean, thus maintaining a better signal of the flood event.  These episodic-event dominated rivers typically reflect climate variability rather than seasonal cycles.  This results in the record of past flood events preserved in the marine sedimentary deposit that can give insight into climatic variations over longer time scales.  Understanding these past climatic variations regionally will be critical for anticipating future variations due to climate change.  Unfortunately, developing strong proxies for river floods using the marine sedimentary record is not a straightforward application due to the complexities of sediment dispersal along continental margins.  This project aims to take advantage of recent, near historic floods on the Brazos River, a moderately sized, episodic river draining into the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), to investigate how a flood deposit is ultimately preserved in the continental shelf sediment record.  As large floods within this river typically result from El Niño conditions, flood deposits preserved in the sedimentary record will reflect past periods of intense flooding associated with El Niño events in the northwestern GOM.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this study is to develop a high-discharge/El Niño proxy for the northwestern GOM based on this most recent flood event that may be useful for future paleo-climate studies.  To accomplish this, PIs plan to collect sediment cores during two sampling cruises along the shelf between the river mouth and the distal depocenter, a feature known as the Texas Mud Blanket (TMB).  These cruises will take place at approximately 3 and 6 months following peak discharge to investigate: 1) how the flood deposit changes over this time period; 2) the fraction that may be transported to the TMB during a single event; and 3) the preservation potential of event layers in the TMB.  To answer these questions they will delineate the flood layer in the cores by analyzing a variety of sedimentological properties including: physical characteristics, short-lived radioisotopes (e.g. 7Be and 234Th), and elemental composition from XRF core logging.  Understanding these depositional characteristics will help to establish an appropriate environmental proxy for such events.   Some of the broader impacts from this study include funding an early career scientist, and engaging and training undergraduate and graduate students in geoscience research, many of which will be from traditionally under represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2015 we experienced one of the strongest El Ni&ntilde;o events in recent decades.  This climate phenomenon associated with warmer than usual surface ocean temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific can result in extreme weather events throughout the globe.  For example, the southern United States often experiences increased rainfall, and flooding.  As the Brazos River, which traverses across the state of Texas emptying into the Gulf of Mexico, was experiencing record discharge and extreme flooding in the spring and summer of 2015, this project sought to track flood deposits from the river mouth across the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf.  The goal of the project was to determine where river flood sediment is ultimately deposited on the shelf, and if those areas may prove useful in preserving the record of El Ni&ntilde;o related floods in the southern United States.  Beginning in September 2015 a series of research cruises  were conducted to collect sediment cores from offshore of the Brazos River mouth.  These short (&lt; 30 cm long) gravity cores were used to identify the thickness and extent of the flood deposit proximal to the river mouth by looking at physical sediment characteristics (bulk density, porosity, grain size, etc.), and short-lived radioisotopes (7Be and 234Th).  Coring sites were reoccupied in February 2016, and September 2016 to document changes in the flood deposit over time.  The data showed a persistent flood deposit during these times, consistent with persistent elevated discharge in the river.  The deposit ranged in thickness from a few centimeters-thick, to more than 10 cm thick, and was consistently thicker to the west of the river mouth; consistent with net longshore drift and surface plume dynamics.  In May 2016 box cores and vibra cores were also collected from an area of the shelf known as the Texas Mud Blanket.  This area, located ~ 100 km down the coast from the Brazos River mouth, is believed to be a distal depositional location for Brazos River sediment that is reworked from the near the river mouth by waves and currents.  Results from one of these cores exhibited a ~7 cm deposit at the surface that was likely derived from a river source, and had been deposited  within the past ~250 days.  As there are no other rivers that empty directly into the Gulf of Mexico in this region, we conclude that this deposit is mostly likely related to heavy flooding on the Brazos River that continued through the 2015/2016 winter and 2016 spring.  Additionally, further analysis of the core showed increases in sediment accumulation in the area that corresponded to other periods of intense El Ni&ntilde;o conditions such as in the mid-late 2000s, 1993, and 1987.  Overall, the preliminary conclusion from this study suggest that flood deposits on the shelf proximal to the Brazos River mouth are quickly re-worked down the coast to the Texas Mud Blanket.  Therefore, the Texas Mud Blanket may preserve evidence of floods on the Brazos River that are often associated with El Ni&ntilde;o events.Further investigation of the cores collected during this project may extend the record of El Ni&ntilde;o impacts on the southern United States.    This project involved a number of undergraduate and graduate students from Texas A&amp;M University Galveston in collecting samples offshore, and analyzing the samples in the lab.  Additional lab analyses were also conducted at California State University, Fullerton by undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the geosciences.
