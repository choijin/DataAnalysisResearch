<AbstractNarration>President Obama's BRAIN Initiative (BRAIN; Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) is directed at supporting projects that seek to advance understanding of normal brain function.  A workshop to identify areas where faculty and students from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI) can make unique contributions to the BRAIN Initiative will be held on October 14-17, 2015 in Chicago, IL. The central goal of the workshop is to enhance PUI involvement in the research challenges described in the Brain Initiative. Consonant with advancing the goals of the BRAIN Initiative, the workshop will focus on developing ways to further NSF's mission to prepare a scientifically literate workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A diverse group of twenty-four researchers from PUIs throughout the United States will be invited to participate in discussions of research, neurotechnology, computational approaches, and interdisciplinary training of undergraduates.  The workshop will be held in Chicago, Illinois 3 days before the annual Society for Neuroscience (SFN) conference, also scheduled to be held in Chicago.  Workshop participants will produce a report of their discussions, conclusions and recommendations aimed at increasing the participation of PUI faculty and their undergraduate research students in the BRAIN Initiative.  The report will be made available to the public on the NSF website (http://www.nsf.gov/bio/pubs/reports/index.jsp ), and distributed to the scientific community through the Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience website (http://www.funfaculty.org/drupal/ ). The workshop outcomes will also be compiled into a self-running presentation for dissemination at local PUI consortia, academic conferences, and national meetings.  It is anticipated that outcomes of the discussion at the workshop will be disseminated through conversations with researchers attending the SFN annual meeting.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The central project of our BRAIN STEM project was a workshop intended to enhance the engagement of faculty and students from Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions (PUI) in the challenges faced by the National Science Foundation's BRAIN Initiative. The NSF BRAIN Initiative (BRAIN; <em>Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies</em>) is a concerted effort to address fundamental questions about normal brain function that link what is known about single cells and subcellular activities in the brain with a system wide understanding of whole brain function across scales of organization. Currently, nearly half of the US bachelor?s degrees in STEM fields are awarded from PUIs. Over 2,000 institutions from all states have been identified as PUIs (Slocum and Scholl, 2013), of which 39% are private and 61% are public institutions. The impact of PUIs in producing graduates who obtain higher level degrees in STEM fields, serve in scientific leadership positions, become K-12 teachers or research assistants, or go on to careers in clinical fields is significant. Thus the goal of our workshop was to identify areas where PUI faculty and students can engage in and contribute to the BRAIN Initiative. Six invited Module Leaders led discussion with the 18 faculty attendees related to research integration and collaboration focusing on characteristics of the PUI that are particularly well suited to advancing the BRAIN initiative. The results of these discussions have been summarized in a power point presentation used by the faculty attendees to further disseminate our goals. Additional data has been collected though a web survey of PUI Neuroscience faculty identified from the 2013 Slocum and Scholl study. Workshop attendees have continued to meet, as possible at Society for Neuroscience meetings with the goal to build a Research Coordination Network.
