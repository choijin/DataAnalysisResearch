<AbstractNarration>The growing religious diversity in contemporary democracies makes the peaceful integration of religious minorities a policy and humanitarian imperative, and legal integration initiatives are an increasingly important avenue toward this goal. Yet limited consideration of rule of law exists in studies of the legal integration of religious minorities.  Moreover, popular and scholarly accounts tend to depict the intersection of state law and religious law as highly oppositional and generative of contentious public debate.  To better understand how rule of law might underpin or emerge from legal integration initiatives, this research explores the following questions:  Do legal integration initiatives promote or produce a particular orientation to rule of law? Do they enhance perceptions of rule of law among minority and majority populations or otherwise shape legal consciousness and, in particular, rule of law consciousness? In short, do legal integration initiatives produce more discourse about, more understanding of, and more opportunity for the rule of law?  By building theoretical understanding of the relationship between legal integration and rule of law, the research has the potential to contribute to scholarly and policy discussions of legal integration taking place worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research questions that guide this project will be examined through a cross-continental comparative analysis of legal integration initiatives, specifically the role played by family law in the integration of religious minorities. Field-based research (including interviews, discourse analysis, and focus groups) will be used to develop in-depth ethnographic studies of legal integration initiatives in two sites, Malta and Kenya.  The proposed comparative analysis offers a comprehensive treatment of legal integration initiatives through family law, including their dimensions, variance, and effects, and two case studies illuminate these effects in detail, including the experiences of religious minorities.  Anticipated project outputs include 1) scholarly publications and 2) a report on legal integration and family law designed for policy audiences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of the project titled Legal Integration and Rule of Law: A Comparative Analysis was to develop better understanding of the role of family law in the legal integration of religious minorities, specifically Muslim minority communities. Toward that end research on legal integration (including specific policies and integration initiatives) and family law was conducted through a broad survey of jurisdictions where significant Muslim minority populations reside to gain a sense of the range of legal integration initiatives and the effects on religious minorities. More specific questions about the effects of legal integration on legal consciousness were examined through in-depth ethnographic field research in two sites: Kenya and Malta. In Malta this totaled 22 weeks of field research, which is well beyond the initial amount projected. Three research trips to Kenya resulted in the anticipated seven weeks of field research there. In total approximately 150 individuals were interviewed using different formats, including focus group interviews, in-depth open-ended interviews, and discussions that emerged during field research. Data analysis yielded a variety of findings. The strongest is that legal integration initiatives in Kenya, including those related to family law, had strong impacts on legal consciousness. The process of law reform in Kenya, which has included Constitutional reform, new statutes and regulations in the areas of family and religious law, materials prepared for use by legal personnel, and legal educational efforts aimed at professionals and the broader public, has influenced the perspectives of Kenyan legal personnel at multiple levels and also those laypeople who use the courts. Specifically, their views&nbsp;on law, rule of law, and the state&rsquo;s role in their lives, as well as the relation between state legal processes and religious family law have been influenced through the reform process. What is remarkable about this finding is that ideas about rule of law are strengthened through the state's enhanced attention the delivery of religious (not secular) law. In the Maltese context a solid finding also emerged as relates to rule of law. Although legal integration initiatives fell short of addressing Muslim family law and thus did not offer religious family law as a route to rule of law consciousness, religious minorities came to experience rule of law consciousness through other engagements with the Maltese state. Although a growth in public discourse about rule of law generally was unanticipated in the initial formulation of research in the Malta, this phenomenon allowed for a deeper assessment of rule of law consciousness and consideration of how it is shaped for religious minorities, especially Muslim minorities, as well as the general population. The most important project outcome is a body of published scholarship on rule of law, legal integration initiatives, and religious minorities in Kenya and Malta, including book chapters &nbsp;and journal articles. A co-edited special journal issue on religious marriages in the Mediterranean also resulted; it offers a review of recent scholarly approaches to the study of religious family law and the state in a time of shifting demography related to migration. In addition a broad review of policy and ethnographic studies focused on Muslim minority communities led to an in-depth consideration of how the concepts of &ldquo;rule of law&rdquo; and &ldquo;rule of justice&rdquo; are used by those who are scholars of these communities and also in law and society scholarship generally. It bears noting that the public presentations of this work have occurred on three continents and that publications are also positioned such that they will reach scholars in Africa, Europe, and North America specifically and beyond aspirationally. Project results have been presented directly to NGOs, including migrant-led NGOs in Malta and Kenya, and to key legal and policy personnel in the form of scholarly and public talks as well as more in-depth consultations on particular legal integration initiatives. Four graduate students were trained in research methods through their work directly on the grant, and dozens of others participated in data collection and analysis, which enhanced their graduate experience.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/26/2020<br>      Modified by: Susan&nbsp;F&nbsp;Hirsch</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
