<AbstractNarration>WiSec is one of the leading international conferences on the security and privacy of wireless communications and mobile networks. Every year, researchers present novel ideas and fundamental advances in areas including location privacy, anonymity, security of smartphones, jamming attacks and defenses, and usable mobile security. WiSec serves to foster communication among researchers and practitioners with a common interest in improving the security of wireless networks and devices through scientific and technological innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support travel costs for graduate students to attend the WiSec conference, to be held in New York City NY in June 2015, allowing them to interact with experts in the field.</AbstractNarration>
