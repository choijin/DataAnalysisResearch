<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Brent Nelson is "Free Probability and Deformation/Rigidity Theory for Type III von Neumann Algebras." The host institution for the fellowship is University of California, Berkeley, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Dan-Virgil Voiculescu.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI produced a series of papers applying and extending the free transport results of Guionnet and Shlyahktenko. These papers, co-authored with Q. Zeng and M. Hartglass provide new (trace-preserving) isomorphism results for C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras.  In a collaboration with M.
