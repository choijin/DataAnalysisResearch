<AbstractNarration>Kim (1546647)&lt;br/&gt;This is an exploratory, proof-of-concept study aimed primarily at reacting furfuryl alcohol (a major intermediate product of biomass refining) directly to hydrocarbon molecules containing nine to twenty carbon atoms suitable for use as transportation fuels, specifically diesel and jet fuel. Traditional processing is based on catalysis by sulfuric acid.  This proposal seeks to demonstrate better performance and product selectivity utilizing supported catalysts while also providing opportunities for improved process efficiency, reduced waste, and a greener environmental footprint.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biomass conversion to useful products is challenged by the broad range of intermediate products produced from the intial pyrolysis of the biomass feedstock together with downstream conversion of the intermediates selectively to high-value fuel and chemical products.  Catalysis offers opportunities for facilitating the downstream reactions, but reaction selectivity to desired products is still a challenge and catalyst deactivation is common.  This project will provide a direct route for reacting a major intermediate product of biomass refining - furfuryl alcohol - directly to C9-C20 alkanes suitable for transportation fuels, while also providing insight into the mechanism of both the oligomerization reaction and the monomer reaction to cyclopentanone, another commercially important product. The proposal is based on the hypothesis that selectivity toward the targeted alkanes can be markedly improved with respect to the homogeneous acid-catalyzed reaction by using supported heterogeneous catalysts with tunable acidic and basic sites combined with optimized reaction conditions. To this end, the study will screen a broad space of catalyst formulations, reactor design, and operating conditions to enhance C9-C20 product efficiency.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work addresses an important area of research related to energy independence and renewable resources in the form of cellulosic biomass, with potential to produce economic routes to diesel and jet fuel. In parallel, the investigator will also explore conversion of furfuryl alcohol directly to cyclopentanone, a versatile chemical feedstock. Both studies will be conducted in collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory to obtain fundamental scientific understanding of relevance to a broad range of catalytic reactions.  From an educational standpoint, the project will provide broad catalyst training to one graduate student and an undergraduate researcher, as well as expanding educational outreach programs the investigator has previously established with high school students.</AbstractNarration>
