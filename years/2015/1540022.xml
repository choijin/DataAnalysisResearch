<AbstractNarration>This award aims to support a planning meeting to explore the potential for an NSF I/UCRC for Complex Adaptive Systems for Society 2030 aims to solve cross-cutting challenges faced by the mobility and health-care delivery industries that will result from ongoing demographic changes in society. These challenges will be addressed through the Center's innovative and inter-disciplinary research to develop and deliver technical and systems solutions that positively impact the lives of people of diverse age, sex, racial, ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The center will Advance Discovery and Understanding While Promoting Teaching, Training, and &lt;br/&gt;Learning, for example, by training graduate students and junior faculty and involving undergraduates in research experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working with the proposed industrial partners, the PIs have developed two preliminary thrust areas where they have significant shared expertise and interest. The first is Mobility and Transportation Across the Lifespan, focused on maximizing the impact of new technologies such as smart and connected vehicles, active safety, and automotive human-machine interfaces. The second is Technology-Health Interface Across the Lifespan, focused on advances in  wireless sensor and microelectronic devices and the revolution in smartphone application development.</AbstractNarration>

During the project period, we accomplished several key outcomes.   First, our proposed center structure and leadership team was reviewed and given support by key officials from The University of Michigan and Wayne State University.  Second, an I/UCRC Planning Meeting was held at the University of Michigan on March 31st &ndash; April1st.

During the planning meeting, faculty researchers presented potential projects to be carried out as part of this I/UCRC.  Third, the feedback provided at the planning meeting gave rise to a revised and more focused theme for the center, "Personalized Smart Living in 2030."  Fourth, with our validated center structure and revised research thrusts, we were able to solidify the membership commitment of several industry partners for our Phase I center proposal to NSF.  Fifth, we submitted a proposal to launch a Phase I I/UCRC in February 2017. Unfortunately this proposal/center was not funded. An alternative option was proposed by NSF for us to join an existing center based in Texas focused on basic and applied research to enhance human performance.

Following this decision, we engaged in a number of discussions with our industry partners that provided letters of commitment/support for the Phase I grant proposal. These exchanges included both updates and a discussion of potential next steps to continue our work together in addressing the challenges marked by our society?s anticipated changing needs in 2030. Our industry partners have expressed interest in the new directions we are considering, including establishment of a local research community, a ?Living Lab? that responds to the questions, problems, and issues raised by our industry and academic partners.  This would involve us inviting residents to become active partners in our work. Specifically, the community will employ a "design thinking" approach, in which every problem posed in collaboration with our industrial partners will support practical solutions.
