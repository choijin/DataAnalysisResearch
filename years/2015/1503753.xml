<AbstractNarration>Few aspects of human and  non-human primate behavior are so intriguing as the intense care of infants by fathers, and  nowhere among primates is paternal care more extensive than among owl monkeys. Owl monkeys are small, arboreal neotropical primates who live in monogamous groups with only one reproducing male and one reproducing female. The father is the main provider of infant care, transporting, sharing food and grooming the infant more than the mother; paternal investment is exceptionally strong and apparent in this species. Research focused on these primates should inform our understanding of the functional and evolutionary significance of this distinctive reproductive system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 1996, the Owl Monkey Project of Argentina has evaluated hypotheses to explain the evolution of social monogamy and infant care in primates. In this study, a team of investigators and students from the US and Argentina will evaluate the hypothesis that the functional significance of  paternal care in owl monkeys relates to the bioenergetic benefits that the parenting couple accrues from the father's assistance. Taking a novel approach that combines research on both captive and wild owl monkeys, the team will gather data on foraging and activity patterns, body mass changes, energy intake, and hormones. The relevance of the study, which has the potential to transform how energetics are measured in the field, lies in contributing to the understanding of the role of males in societies that are characterized by a strong bond between partners and shared parental duties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will expand the broad impacts of the Owl Monkey Project. As the only long-term research program on any mammal species in the Argentinean Gran Chaco, the project has multiplying effects on the conservation of this ecosystem and its fauna.  It also promotes the development of  young scientists and the discipline of biological anthropology through the participation over the years of more than 270 students (55% females, 45% males) from the US, Argentina and 14 other countries; student training and involvement in the research will further augment this strong record.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Owl monkeys live in monogamous groups where there is only one adult male and one adult female who mate with each other. The male owl monkeys are intensively involved in the care of the offspring and provide, more frequently than females, direct care like transport, playing, and food sharing. Why do male owl monkeys mate in a monogamous relationship foregoing reproductive opportunities with other females?&nbsp;And why do they invest so heavily in the care of offspring?&nbsp;</p> <p>The Owl Monkey Project of the Argentinean Chaco offered a novel situation to evaluate hypotheses on the evolution of such extreme form of paternal care. By focusing on a non-human primate, the project made it possible to study the behaviors, physiology and ecology associated with paternal care free from the cultural trappings that are associated with studies of care in humans.&nbsp;The PI evaluated the hypothesis that paternal care is beneficial for both the father and the mother because of the energetic benefits that the parenting couple accrues from the male&rsquo;s assistance. To examine the hypothesis, researchers studied how mothers and fathers handled energetic demands linked to caring for young by comparing groups with and without infants at different times of the year that may have more or less food available.</p> <p>They conducted their research in both captive and wild owl monkeys. In the captive colony, the team collected data from 16 families of owl monkeys, whereas in the field in Argentina they studied 10 groups of them. To study the role that hormones play in infant care behavior, researchers collected 1,500 samples of feces from wild fathers and mothers and another 800 samples from captive parents. The preliminary analyses revealed similar levels of testosterone in males and females and levels of testosterone in males that changed during the year. To estimate energy expenditure in the wild population, the researchers collected 1,500 hours of foraging, resting and moving data. These data show that females and males do not differ much in how they allocate their time to different activities. In the captive colony, the researchers were able to collect both observational and accelerometer data to estimate energy expenditure. Once fully analyzed, results from the study are likely to transform the manner in which researchers examine reproductive strategies in human and non-human primates; by focusing on a monogamous species where the males are the only individuals besides the mother providing infant care, the study contributes to current debates regarding the importance of energetic transfers and cooperative breeding as explanations for the evolution of human life history traits.&nbsp;</p> <p>The project offered educational opportunities to 19 US undergraduate students from six universities (77% females, 23% males, 12 from URM in STEM fields), two US Ph.D. students and one postdoctoral fellow. Their work led to four undergraduate theses, and two doctoral dissertations. The PI established new collaborations with the Universidad Nacional de Formosa, Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Universidad Nacional de Misiones and Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires in Argentina. In the US, new collaborations including the sharing of samples and data were developed with colleagues in Hunter College, Yale, UT Austin and CUNY Stony Brook. Part of those collaborations were launched during a 2-day workshop to bring together colleagues working on owl monkeys.&nbsp;The first meeting of P.A.I.R. (Program for Aotus Integrated Research) brought to Yale University 19 colleagues from Peru, Colombia, Argentina and the US; a was published in Evolutionary Anthropology. The PI was also part of the organizing committee of the 2015 meeting of the Argentinean Society of Biological Anthropology.&nbsp;&nbsp;The team produced educational material on the project. Some of the products that resulted from their work were: 1- the 30-minute documentary "To Have or Have not" produced by Dev Banerji that was selected for&nbsp; the New Haven Film Festival; 2- a series of podcasts on &ldquo;Anthropology of Dad&rdquo; where project&rsquo;s assistant Ben Finkel interviewed five Yale anthropologists studying fatherhood, 3- a full article for Natural History, the magazine of the American Museum of Natural History, which is available in both English and Spanish on the magazine&rsquo;s website.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Owl Monkey Project in Argentina is the longest on-going project on any mammal in the Argentinean Gran Chaco. The project has had multiplying effects on the conservation of this ecosystem and its fauna (which includes howler monkeys, peccaries, tapirs, armadillos and many other endemic and/or endangered species).&nbsp;The project has generated jobs, promoted tourism, trained local human resources and communicated to both the local, national and international community the importance of scientific research. The most recent indication of the broad impacts of the project is the recent award to the PI by the Argentinean government of a prize that recognizes researchers for their contributions to develop international collaborations in the sciences.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/30/2017<br>      Modified by:
