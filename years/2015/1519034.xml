<AbstractNarration>Formal verification covers a wide range of technologies that are widely studied in academia and routinely used in industry. Any acceleration in the diffusion of knowledge about these techniques will lead to superior technology, better users, and exciting and far-reaching applications. This grant will organize the Summer School on Formal Techniques for students to learn about cutting-edge techniques in formal modeling and verification. The lectures are rigorous and will cover the spectrum of formal techniques including static analysis, model checking, theorem proving, invariant generation, compositional verification, security and systems biology. The lectures will be supported by hands-on laboratories. Attendees at the school discuss their own research ideas and interact closely with both the lecturers and other students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous summer schools have had a significant broad impact in terms of imparting theoretical knowledge as well as practical skills to the students from many different research areas. These summer schools have been received enthusiastically by the participants, and helped develop a well-knit community of young researchers. The lectures, software tools, and other course material are available from the previous summer school web sites.</AbstractNarration>
