<AbstractNarration>Generally, this award aims to explore hydroclimate changes over the past Millennium that possibly occurred in response to changes in the mean state of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).  By advancing the development of a spatial-temporal network of ice core accumulation records covering the past millennium in the NE Pacific region of the United States, this research will foster a greater understanding of regional hydrologic response to the coupled ENSO system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers propose to investigate the hypothesis that a change occurred from a persistent La Nina-like state during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to a persistent El Nino-like state during the Little Ice Age (LIA).   The research team will test this hypothesis by reconstructing and evaluating the spatial precipitation anomaly pattern in the Northeast Pacific across the MCA-LIA transition.  Their hypothesis is founded on modern observations that show an enhanced (weaker) coastal-inland precipitation gradient in the region during La Nina (El Nino) conditions.  The researchers predict that the NE Pacific precipitation anomaly pattern will weaken across the MCA-LIA transition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will support an early career scientist, provide support for undergraduate and graduate students, and enable outreach to K-12 teachers and students through the PolarTREC program, an NSF funded program which seeks to link K-12 teachers with Polar researchers with a goal of integrating polar science research into K-12 curriculum.  The potential return on investment of the proposed science is high in terms of advancing the state of knowledge in this area of science and the support of early career scientists and outreach aspects of the proposal are important to the NSF Mission and mandate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past decade, the researchers have been developing an ice core array in the NE Pacific of the United States that targets the two nodes of this precipitation dipole (i.e., St. Elias Range and Central Alaska).  The most recent ice core acquisition was in 2013 with the recovery of two surface-to-bedrock 210-meter ice cores from Mt. Hunter in Denali National Park. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To determine precipitation variability at the Mt. Hunter site over the past millennium, the researchers will rely on a suite of supporting geophysical data to constrain glacier geometry, velocity, boundary conditions, and rheological properties in a 3-dimensional finite element numerical model. The combined observational and model datasets will allow the team to remove influences of ice flow (which causes layer thinning) and spatial variability in snow accumulation rate to estimate temporal accumulation variability from the two ice cores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast to Mt. Hunter, little is known about the geophysical characteristics of the coastal St. Elias Range ice core sites (PR Col, NW Col, King Col on Mt Logan and the Eclipse Icefield), which were drilled in 2002 prior to recent advances in geophysical techniques and numerical modeling capability.  This lack of information would introduce error in any comparison of the St. Elias and Mt. Hunter accumulation records, and thus evaluation of the MCA-LIA transition hypothesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consequently, the research team specifically proposes to improve ice core-based accumulation records, and therefore hydroclimate reconstructions for the past millennium, in the NE Pacific through the collection of new geophysical data at existing ice core sites in the St. Elias Range. The science objectives are to: 1) develop bedrock topography maps of the Eclipse Icefield, King Col, and Mt. Logan summit plateau sites; 2) determine surface velocities at all sites; 3) map near-surface spatial accumulation rate patterns; 4) trace internal isochrones at all sites; 5) estimate ice deformation effects on layer thinning; 6) produce updated, to 2016, and corrected accumulation time series at all sites; and 7) compare corrected accumulation records from the Mt. Hunter and St. Elias sites to evaluate spatial precipitation patterns over the past millennium. The research strategy necessitates the use of state-of-the-art ground penetrating radar (GPR), geochemical, satellite remote sensing, numerical modeling, and data synthesis techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Paleoclimate data from the Pacific basin show significant precipitation changes over the past millennium, possibly in response to changes in the mean state of the El Ni?o Southern Oscillation. One hypothesis invokes a change from a persistent La Ni?a-like state during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; ~1000 years ago) to a persistent El Ni?o-like state during the Little Ice Age (LIA; ~400 years ago).  A test of this hypothesis is to reconstruct and evaluate the spatial precipitation anomaly pattern in the Northeast Pacific across the MCA-LIA transition, because modern observations show an enhanced (weaker) coastal-inland precipitation gradient in the region during La Ni?a (El Ni?o) conditions.  For the past decade, we have been developing an ice core array in the NE Pacific that targets the two nodes of this precipitation dipole (i.e., St. Elias Range and Central Alaska), most recently (2013) with the recovery of two surface-to-bedrock 210-meter ice cores from Mt. Hunter (Denali National Park). To determine precipitation variability at the Mt. Hunter site over the past millennium, we rely on a suite of supporting geophysical data to constrain glacier geometry, velocity, boundary conditions, and rheological properties in a 3-dimensional finite element numerical model. The combined observational and model datasets allow us to remove influences of ice flow (which causes layer thinning) and spatial variability in snow accumulation rate to estimate temporal accumulation variability from the two ice cores.  In contrast to Mt. Hunter, little is known about the geophysical characteristics of the coastal St. Elias Range ice core sites, which were drilled in 2002 prior to advances in geophysical techniques and numerical modeling capability.  In this project, we improved ice core-based accumulation records, and therefore precipitation reconstructions for the past millennium, in the NE Pacific through the collection of new geophysical and ice core data at existing ice core sites in the St. Elias Range.  Our objectives were to: 1) develop bedrock topography maps of the Eclipse Icefield; 2) determine surface velocities; 3) map near-surface spatial accumulation rate patterns; 4) trace internal isochrones at all sites; 5) estimate ice deformation effects on layer thinning; 6) produce updated (to 2016) and corrected accumulation and stable isotope time series; and 7) compare corrected accumulation records from the Mt. Hunter and St. Elias sites to evaluate spatial precipitation patterns over the past millennium.  Our research approach utilizes state-of-the-art ground penetrating radar (GPR), GPS, geochemical, satellite remote sensing, numerical modeling, and data synthesis techniques.    The primary scientific outcome of our project is the new 619 year-long (1398-2017 CE) ice core accumulation rate record from the Eclipse Icefield (see image).  The most notable feature of the record is the significantly higher accumulation rate at the site during the 15thand 16thcenturies (the latter stages of the Medieval Climate Anomaly), and lower accumulation rates during the Little Ice Age and 20thcentury.  This pattern is distinctly different than what is observed in Central Alaska, where there is a doubling of accumulation rate in the 20thcentury as compared with earlier times.  Our hypothesis is that this difference is related to shifting ocean/atmosphere teleconnections in the North Pacific, driven primarily by the strength of the Aleutian Low pressure system and linkages to the tropical Pacific.  The intellectual merit of this work is that a better understanding of the ocean/atmosphere dynamics in this region, particularly prior to the instrumental period, will result in improved predictive capability as we move towards a warmer world.    The broader impacts of our work involve training several graduate and undergraduate students in remote field work, glaciological and geophysical data collection, laboratory skills, and science communication.  We are also actively collaborating with the Boston Museum of Science on a new exhibit titled Arctic Adventure: Exploring with Technology, which will have one section dedicated to ice core science.  Our work as part of this project will be highlighted in the exhibit, providing an excellent outreach opportunity to connect with thousands of visitors of all ages.
