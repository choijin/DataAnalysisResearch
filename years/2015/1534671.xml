<AbstractNarration>Scientists depend on acquiring new analytical techniques to improve their research abilities and communicate their findings to the public. This Scholars Award project provides a researcher with training in quantitative research, geo-spatial analysis, and data visualization in order to create new tools for understanding and representing linguistic diversity in multilingual communities. This project would broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences by also training undergraduate, graduate, and high school students in ethnographic, linguistic, and spatial mapping and other visual methods. The data from the larger project would also be disseminated to policymakers and educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jonathan Rosa of Stanford University, who has conducted extensive research on contemporary multilingualism focusing on U.S. Latina/o communities, will spend a summer month and a semester at the Smith College Spatial Analysis Lab, where he will obtain the methodological skills necessary to (1) conduct a long-term project combining  quantitative and qualitative analyses of community multilingualism; (2) create new visualization tools for linguistic data, including interactive maps, providing a more complex ?view? of linguistic diversity; and (3) train undergraduate and graduate students, as well as community members, in these new research methodologies. The project would advance the fields of linguistic anthropology and linguistic by training the researcher in novel visualization techniques that are on the leading edge for modeling language in society.</AbstractNarration>

With support from this funding, he consulted with the Spatial Analysis Lab at Smith College and the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis at Stanford University to learn strategies for creating digiital representations of linguistic and cultural practices. The broader goal of this work is to challenge deficit-based views of the linguistic and cultural practices of marginalized cummunities by creating multidimensional representations of these communities' expanisive communicative repertoires. Rosa used the funding to train Stanford University graudate and undergraduate students in the community-based research and mapping techniques he learned through the project. He also convened Stanford students and approximately 60 Latinx San Francisco bay Area high school students to conduct oral history interviews with the high school students' families and related linguistic investigations that reflect the dynamic bilingualism in their communities and schools. The techniques developed in this project will contribute to fields beyond cultural anthropology and linguistics, including education and sociology, by providing new tools for asset-based apporaches to representing marginalized urban communities' linguistic and cultural practices.
