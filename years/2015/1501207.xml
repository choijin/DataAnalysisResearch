<AbstractNarration>The establishment of this Regional Center for biotechnology technicians complements the activities of the Bio-Link Next Generation National Advanced Technological Education Center for Biotechnology and Life Sciences. The common mission of the two centers is to "(1) increase the number and diversity of well-trained technicians in the workforce; (2) meet the ever-growing needs of a continually evolving and diversifying industry for appropriately trained technicians; and (3) institutionalize community college education practices that make high-quality education and training in the concepts, tools, skills processes, regulatory structure, and ethics of biotechnology available to all students."  This regional center will expand on Bio-Link's distributed leadership network model to build replicable state Bio-Link networks. As a regional center, its activities will broaden the impact of the national center, while at the same time focus on the biotechnology workforce needs of Texas and Kentucky, two states that host a growing biotechnology industry and would benefit from establishing a Bio-Link network. The Texas and Kentucky leadership teams are located in areas of highest industry growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project include:  1) Establish a sustainable, replicable Biotechnology Community College Distributed Leadership Network in each state to establish collaboration across educational and industry systems; 2) Scale-up the Biotechnology High School/College Mentor Network to support high school teachers to implement industry appropriate life science courses; 3) Develop new student recruitment pipelines into the industry that include using undergraduate research as a hook in feeder courses and programs to attract and retain students in life science careers; 4) Implement an entry-level certificate in high schools and community colleges to facilitate entry into bio-technician jobs in industry; 5) Establish Contract Service Organizations (CSO) in community colleges pairing industry projects with student internships and faculty externships to benefit companies, students, and faculty; and 6) Establish statewide articulation and reversed articulation agreements among educational partners to facilitate academic transferability and increase degree completion. By fulfilling these goals, a collaborative network at several levels and in two separate states, Texas and Kentucky, will be established to meet the workforce needs of an interdisciplinary, evolving biotechnology industry. Biotechnology educational partners will share resources such as curriculum, equipment, best practices in teaching, utilize state and local resources to sustain them in mentoring secondary and postsecondary faculty, recruit and mentor students, and develop stronger relationships between two year and four year institutions so that students can transfer between the institutions to continue their studies. Educational partners will build on the strengths of their individual programs and the needs of area industry, and will work together to identify emerging technician trends on topics such as regulatory affairs, stem cell maintenance, biotechnology-related renewable energy technology, and biopharming. The Texas and Kentucky biotechnology industries will become more competitive in a global market and a sustainable, replicable model for establishing Bio-link state networks will be developed. The Center will establish a self-sustaining biotechnology workforce educational network across Texas, and the start of a similar system in Kentucky. Taking advantage of established state, local, and institutional infrastructures, the networks are to be built based on best practices developed and implemented through the Bio-Link Network.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The main goal of the AC2 Bio-Link Regional Center is to network the biotechnology educational workforce community composed of high schools, community colleges, and 4-year schools in the states of Kentucky and Texas. The purpose of networking the institutions is to share best practices in teaching, develop career pathways from high schools, to 2 -year biotechnology programs into 4-year programs or jobs. The effort is spearheaded by the community colleges that host Biotechnology Programs, namely Austin Community College, Del Mar College, Collin College, Lone Star College, and Bluegrass Community and Technical College. The high schools and 4-year schools that articulated with these programs are part of the working group. Industry is kept in the loop through advisory boards, and trade organizations located in these states.</p> <p>The network accomplished several major tasks and continues to operate as a unit, to undertake tasks as barriers, challenges, and opportunities arise. As the biotechnology industry continues to grow in these states, more colleges are joining the existing network. Some of the major tasks that were accomplished and are being sustained are as follows:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>(1) Texas State Education Agency adopted the biotechnology pathway courses leading to an entry level biomanufacturing/biotechnology certificate. The professional development for Texas high school teachers continues and is funded by CTE. Teachers from other states also attend the annual meeting. The certificate is being disseminated across Texas as well as into other states. At Bluegrass Community and Technical College, a dual credit high school program is flourishing and preparing students for employment. Local companies are hiring the students.</p> <p>&nbsp;(2) The Austin Community College Bioscience Incubator started during the grant time period, and is filled with companies, and student interns (picture included). Presently, it has a waiting list of companies who want space. The Bluegrass Community and Technical College contract service organization, B Cell, was started with start-up companies and USDA projects. The CSO Summit brought community college contract service organizations and incubators together to share and document best practices. This group continues to network to share best practices. (picture included)</p> <p>(3) Del Mar College spearheaded the undergraduate research initiative. Dr. Zang and Dr. Hatherill organized an annual meeting for community colleges and partnering 4-year schools during the grant period. The meeting was held annually and coincided with their Research Day where students held an undergraduate research poster session fort faculty, family and friends (picture included). Many of their students went on to win awards at prestigious meetings such as American Association for the Advancement of Science and American Society for Microbiology. They presented at the Gordon Conference on undergraduate research. They also wrote several articles on the topic. Collin College dramatically shifted the focus and trajectory of their major and non-major biology lab courses by developing research-based laboratory exercises instead of using canned labs. Austin Community College has added undergraduate research to both Biology and Biotechnology courses. The Biotechnology Program hosts a student research poster session twice a year. Bluegrass Community and Technical College continue to sponsor undergraduate research projects and industry-based projects.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>(4) A bioinformatics course for instructors was developed and taught for 3 years by Dr. Porter. It is still available in the Course in a Box site at the InnovATEBIO website. The course has proved helpful to instructors who needed to add bioinformatics to their programs. &nbsp;Some of the colleges that use the course are Austin Community College (Richard Nuckels) in Austin, TX, Ohlone College, in California (Laurie Issel-Tarver), and Flathead Valley Community College in Montana (Ruth Wrightsman), Bluegrass Community and Technical College in Kentucky (Deborah Davis). The availability of the course was especially helpful during the pandemic since the opportunities for professional development were limited.</p> <p>(5) Finally, and probably most importantly, the Texas network came together to save the two core courses BIOL 1414 and 1415 that are part of the entry level certificate. These two courses are classified BOTH as academic and workforce which is extremely important if the courses are to transfer to 4-year schools. The Texas Coordinating Board wanted to remove the academic distinction which would have made them untransferable for the dual credit high school programs and the community college students who wish to continue their education at a 4-year school. On the day the board was to vote, the Texas group including students, traveled to the board meeting in Austin to testify about the need to keep these courses as core courses. As a result of their testimony, the courses remain core courses.</p> <p>The network is still working together, the latest challenge is adding a biomanufacturing course to all of the programs and the sharing of best practices in teaching this course. Biomanufacturing has come to Texas and Kentucky and together the team will work together to meet the needs of industry.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/30/2021<br>      Modified by: Linnea&nbsp;A&nbsp;Fletcher</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1501207/1501207_10390571_1617124961240_ScreenShot2021-03-29at7.40.23PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1501207/1501207_10390571_1617124961240_ScreenShot2021-03-29at7.40.23PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CSO and Incubator Summit"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1501207/1501207_10390571_1617124961240_ScreenShot2021-03-29at7.40.23PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CSO and Incubator Summit"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Participants came from all over the US.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Linnea Fletcher</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Linnea&nbsp;A&nbsp;Fletcher</div> <div class="imageTitle">CSO and Incubator Summit</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1501207/1501207_10390571_1617125114803_ScreenShot2021-03-29at7.39.52PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1501207/1501207_10390571_1617125114803_ScreenShot2021-03-29at7.39.52PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ACC Bioscience Incubator"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1501207/1501207_10390571_1617125114803_ScreenShot2021-03-29at7.39.52PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ACC Bioscience Incubator"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Biotech student, David Blackwell, working in cell culture facility.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Linnea Fletcher</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Linnea&nbsp;A&nbsp;Fletcher</div> <div class="imageTitle">ACC Bioscience Incubator</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1501207/1501207_10390571_1617125290456_ScreenShot2021-03-29at7.39.25PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1501207/1501207_10390571_1617125290456_ScreenShot2021-03-29at7.39.25PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Research Day"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1501207/1501207_10390571_1617125290456_ScreenShot2021-03-29at7.39.25PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Research Day"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student undergraduate research at Del Mar College is open to students, faculty, and family.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Linnea Fletcher</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Linnea&nbsp;A&nbsp;Fletcher</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student Research Day</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
