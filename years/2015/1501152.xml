<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Connor Mooney is "Regularity Theory for Degenerate Elliptic and Parabolic Partial Differential Equations." The host institution for the fellowship is University of Texas-Austin and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Alessio Figalli.</AbstractNarration>
