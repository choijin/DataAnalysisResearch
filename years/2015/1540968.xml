<AbstractNarration>The grant funds student travel to the 2015 International Conference on Requirements Engineering. This conference brings together researchers in the interdisciplinary field of Requirements Engineering, which considers how people's goals for a system get implemented and evolved correctly over a system's lifetime. The supported students may be participating in the Doctoral Symposium and/or presenting papers. The proposal has a sound selection process and and a process for administering the funds. The funds will help the students advance their education and their research and to meet leaders in the field as well as the international community of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Requirements drive many aspects of the Software Development life cycle  such as architecture and design, testing, safety analysis, runtime  adaptation, and change management. There are many open challenges which need to be addressed in order to deliver fully-functioning, safe, secure, scalable, and reliable software systems, and it is therefore very important to engage the next generation of researchers. The IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference is the  premier international forum for researchers, industrial practitioners,  educators, and students to present and discuss the most      recent innovations, trends, experiences, results and challenges in  the field of requirements engineering.  This grant provided funds for four graduate students from US  Institutions to attend the IEEE Requirements Engineering conference. Three of the funded students (from Rochester Institute of Technology, Louisiana State University, and California State University) were first year PhD students. Attending the conference provided exposure to cutting edge research ideas and open challenges in the field of Requirements Engineering.  This exposure can potentially shape the future direction of their research and is influential in building the next generation of Requirements Engineering researchers.  The fourth student, from Carnegie Mellon, was in her final year of study and presented a technical research paper in the main conference.  Attending the conference was beneficial to all four students and enabled them to better understand the critical open challenges in Requirements Engineering research.
