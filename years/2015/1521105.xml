<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research of Professor Joel W. Walker at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research activities are to include the phenomenological investigation of topics broadly related to the subject of "supersymmetry", as well as the engineering and distribution of original software tools enhancing the productivity and efficiency of this and related studies.  Supersymmetry is an idea that may protect the relatively light mass of the Higgs Boson observed by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 from drifting to a much heavier value.  It works by hypothesizing the existence of a new class of particles whose interactions would naturally cancel the destabilizing effects of the known particles.  These supersymmetric particles simultaneously provide a suitable candidate for the cosmological "dark matter" and are themselves a primary target for discovery in collisions at the LHC.  Efforts to clarify the role of supersymmetry in low energy physics, and the search for new fundamental particles and interactions, benefit the national interest in advancing basic scientific knowledge.  Sam Houston State University is a primarily undergraduate institution that takes pride in its proportional over-representation of female, minority, and low-income students.  Specific activities will be designated for undergraduate participation that are sufficiently narrow and systematic in scope for students to productively engage at an early juncture, even as they are becoming more widely educated.  This real-world research exposure offers broader impacts on self-confidence, team integration, algorithmic problem solving, and systematic handling of data, while enhancing the likelihood of transitioning a successful high-energy physics graduate student.                                        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, specific topics itemized for investigation include experimental signatures of novel supersymmetric mass hierarchies, isolation of distinctive decay modes such as long-chain cascades, contemporary applications of collider discriminants such as a boosted event topology, methods for probing the spin composition of dark matter, and the phenomenology of well motivated alternatives to the minimal supersymmetric picture such as string-derived large volume scenarios and decays of the higgsino to the singlino dark matter candidate in the NMSSM.  A key methodology employed in the prior will be the numerical generation and analysis of Monte Carlo collider data simulations.  Support for these objectives will also be rendered by the authoring, documentation, and dissemination of programs useful to similarly interested researchers, e.g. for safe, fast computation of the asymmetric 2-step MT2 event statistic, and for the expeditious selection, optimization, analysis, and visualization of simulated collider event data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the project have been the generation and dissemination of original published research, and the mentoring of undergraduate students in research at Sam Houston State University.  Research activities have included the investigation of topics broadly related to the subject of "supersymmetry", as well as the engineering and distribution of original software tools enhancing the productivity and efficiency of this and related studies.  Topics itemized for investigation have included experimental signatures of models for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva Switzerland.  Additionally, studies were completed which establish prospects of future searches for exotic properties of the light and elusive neutrino particle at nuclear reactor facilities.  Efforts to clarify the role of supersymmetry in physics, and the search for new fundamental particles and interactions, benefit the national interest in advancing basic scientific knowledge.  Delivery of new software tools to the high-energy physics community may promote efficiency in analyses, facilitating the wider creation of knowledge.  Walker delivered 10 research articles, publishing or working directly with more than twenty research colleagues at fourteen different institutions, in addition to representatives from the eleven member institutions of the MINER (Mitchell Institute Neutrino Experiment at Reactor) collaboration.  Walker participated in fifteen professional conferences, and delivered a number of invited seminar and colloquium presentations.  Generated software products were distributed for free public download on GitHub.  The department of Physics at Sam Houston State University was expanded by the hiring of two new faculty with research specializations in high energy physics, greatly enriching prospects for future research and educational impacts.  Undergraduate physics students at Sam Houston State have been thoroughly integrated into the described research program.  Twelve undergraduate students have participated in funded research, six of whom have graduated and moved on to graduate study in physics or a closely related field.
