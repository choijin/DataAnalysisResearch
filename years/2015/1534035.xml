<AbstractNarration>The Partnership for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project, led by Clarkson University researchers, aims to develop advanced resilient microgrid technology to improve disaster response capability.  Advanced resilient microgrid technology provides continuous electric service to support critical services to people displaced during extreme disasters; and provides electric service to support recovery crews working to restore services. In an emergency, the microgrid is an electrical "island", idependent of the main power grid and serves these critical loads through local power generation. This project will focus on the human-machine operational impacts of the microgrid both during normal operations as well as during disaster response. The development of "smart scheduler" technology  will enable the microgrid  operator  and  the  local  disaster  response  team  to  maximize  the  microgrid's performance during the disaster recovery. The microgrid must operate successfully disconnected from the grid for two weeks or more in catastrophic situations where the level of damage is unanticipated and the microgrid itself has experienced reduced capability. Human-machine capability will be developed to respond to rapidly changing community needs with a minimum of human effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will complement ongoing projects to plan and design a resilient underground microgrid in Potsdam, New York. The Potsdam microgrid features a unique partnership of generator owners, local government, regulated utility, and critical load entities. This diverse set of microgrid partners is key to providing the resilience required of the microgrid. At the same time, designing, building, and operating the microgrid as a unit with its diverse set of owners presents a range of challenges. Developing the capability to schedule and control the microgrid in both normal and emergency events is a critical element of this project. Equally important is the development of a microgrid design that provides this service at a minimum cost, by maximizing the benefit of the microgrid assets during the normal operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lead institution is Clarkson University (Coulter School of Engineering, School of Business, and School of Arts and Sciences). The primary industrial partner on the project is National Grid USA (Waltham, MA), the electric service provider for a large part of New York and New England, including Potsdam, NY. National Grid would own the underground distribution network  that  is  the  backbone  of  the  microgrid.  The  Electric  Power  Research Institute, Knoxville, TN, is the broader context partner on the project. In Potsdam, NY, Clarkson University, SUNY Potsdam, the Village of Potsdam, and Canton-Potsdam Hospital are among the entities that would participate in the microgrid and are potential generation owners on the microgrid.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Resilient community microgrids hold significant potential for providing critical electric service to communities during extended (&gt;6 hour) outages of the bulk power system.  These extended outages could result from extreme weather events, human action, or system failure.  Developing the capability to provide reliable electric power for critical services during these extreme events will have a significant positive benefits for the communities facing the extended loss of electric service.  The successful development of resilient community microgrid technology, however, faces significant challenges.  This project focusses on the development of smart scheduler technology and the advancement of human factors issues that stand in the way in the sucessful development of these microgrids.  Smart Scheduler Thrust  In this project, we developed a restructuring strategy and market clearing framework for both normal and islanded operation of the microgrid.  It is essential to recover as much of the microgrid cost as possible during normal conditions when connected to the bulk power system.  During the rare instances of stand alone operation in response to extreme events, it is equally essential to provide the available electric power to the most critical services.  The microgrid must have sufficient flexibility to recognize and respond to the loss of key components of the microgrid that may be damaged by the event, and unavailable.  In this project, we developed a reconfiguration model and market clearing framework to accomplish these tasks.  We also developed microgrid specific economic dispatch and droop control methods for the microgrids, including those with significant renewable energy resources.   Human Factors Thrust  HMI Development  The Human Factors Engineering team focused on developing methods that improve situational awareness for microgrid operators.  While grid operators have the single task of maintaining grid performance, microgrid operators will have many and diverse tasks, particularly during extreme events.  In this project, two competing human-machine operator interfaces were developed, along with a real time microgrid simulator. Tests were conducted on the HMI’s for their effectiveness.      Policy and Governance. Community microgrid governance can be a major issue developing these projects.  In the study case used in this project, partners included the franchise holding utility, a hospital, a state university, the local high school, the village, a private university, and several commercial firms.  In this study case, we determined that it is much preferable to partner with the utility than to create an entity that would hold power delivery rights superimposed on the franchise area.  A key factor was that the utility has significant expertise in operating and maintaining system components that none of the other stakeholders has.  This also avoids a major regulatory barrier in overriding the franchise holder’s rights.  We identified regulatory and institutional barriers due to the differing federal and state regulations that are applied to the hospital, universities, village, and school.      On this and related projects, we developed a consortium model for microgrid governance, with a tiered recovery system.  The consortium would be charged with operating and maintaining the microgrid, apportioning costs, managing revenues and paying bills.  It would be governed by a board of local stakeholders including the franchise holder.  In the tiered recovery system, customers connected to the microgrid would pay the largest share of the wires expenses, those served by village services but not on the microgrid would be at the next level of costs, and so on out to the full hospital service territory&mdash;with those whose benefit is only due to the hospital paying the least.  Tiered recovery would recover costs due to the wires and controller.  A group or groups would also need to step forward and add the needed generation, and recover those costs through selling their energy and other services during both blue sky and emergency conditions.         In the final phase of the project, the effort was spent focusing on the development of a survey of residential consumers to determine willingness to pay (WTP) for various services powered by a microgrid. This survey explores a variety of factors that may influence a community’s acceptance of Microgrid Services, and also analyzes different potential associated resiliency services that a Microgrid could provide during extended outages. Extensive time was spent developing the experimental design and building the bank of questions to elicit personality, economic, and other factors that may be correlated with a consumer's WTP.  The results showed a significant willingness to pay for residential consumers, in order to ensure the availability of the critical services that would be available as a result of the microgrid’s presence.
