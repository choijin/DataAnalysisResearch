<AbstractNarration>The combined efforts of field linguists will not be sufficient to document the thousands of languages that are expected to disappear by the end of this century. Creating a lasting record of these disappearing languages is essential since all languages provide clues about how humans learn and process language.  Language description and analysis could be facilitated by deploying computational analytic techniques on existing and ever growing repositories of digital audio and video language data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will organize a workshop bringing together researchers in speech and language technology,  researchers on endangered languages, field linguists, and language repository archivists to help drive the development of this computational technology.  The workshop participants will discuss how Shared Task Evaluation Campaigns (STECs)  can promote the development of speech and language technology for documenting endangered and low-resourced languages.  Designed to enable comparability across systems and leverage the costs of data preparation, Shared Task Evaluation Campaigns operationalize research problems as tasks that are open to participation by researchers with uniform data, task specifications, evaluation metrics, and open reporting of  results and system methodologies.Experience with STECs for speech and language technologies has shown that they have helped standardize shared data, create useful evaluation tools, and provide venues for publishing, comparing, and discussing results. Participants will evaluate both the language archive data available for computational processing and the types of STECs that should be undertaken.  The results of the workshop can have long term impacts through acceleration of endangered language documentation, enhancement of digital language archives, and development of novel computational techniques for low-resource languages.</AbstractNarration>

Creating a lasting record of these disappearing languages is essential since all languages provide clues about how humans learn and process language. Language description and analysis could be facilitated by deploying computational analytic techniques on existing and ever growing repositories of digital audio and video language data.  This project brought together field linguists, researchers on endangered languages, and researchers in human language technology to identify key pain points in the workflow of endangered language documentation.  During a needs assessment workshop held September 14-15, 2016, nineteen participants from institutions across the United States and Canada defined automatic language processing tasks that could address these challenges.  These tasks are structured according to the paradigms of Shared Task Evaluation Campaigns (STECs): prior experience with STECs for speech and language technologies has shown that they have helped standardize shared data, create useful evaluation tools, and provide venues for publishing, comparing, and discussing results.  Based on discussions at the workshop, the project defined three families of shared tasks and articulated core shared task design principles. These principles aim to align the interests and goals of the different communities: speech and language processing communities, endangered language documentation and archiving communities, as well as speaker communities.  The tasks thus are designed around principles of task realism, typological diversity, accessibility of shared tasks and resulting software, extensibility of data resources and systems, and nuanced evaluation.    The shared tasks which were designed all address the need to broaden and accelerate the pipeline of processing data for language documentation. The Orthographic Regularization task addresses the lack of standardization in text corpora for endangered languages, where transcriptions may use different orthographies by transcribers of different expertise.  Shared tasks participants would develop systems to automatically convert texts to a uniform, standard orthography.  The First-pass Interlinear Glossed Text task requires participants to facilitate linguistic analysis by automatically generating morpheme segmentations, morpheme glosses, and word-level glosses given a sentence in the endangered language and its translation into a language of broader communication. Finally, the "Grandma?s Hatbox" cascade of tasks accelerates processing and archiving of endangered language audio field recordings through automatic language identification, speaker identification, genre identification, metadata extraction, and alignment of partial transcriptions.  These tasks will both accelerate the process of endangered language documentation and push the state-of-the-art in language processing technologies.
