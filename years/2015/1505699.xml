<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the University of California, San Diego is to explore an extremely innovative strategy for rapid and effective removal of endotoxins from the bloodstream and to investigate the fundamental principles of such a new detoxification approach. Endotoxin is an important pathogenic trigger of sepsis, a life-threatening complication imposing a significant healthcare burden. Emerging evidence suggests that effective endotoxin removal is critical for successful sepsis management, which however remains an unmet clinical need. In this project, a biomaterials-based nanostructure, consisting of safe polymers and macrophage membranes, is proposed to function as a toxin decoy to absorb a wide range of different endotoxins and thus minimize their with the target cells. As an integral part of this proposed project, the education components will be carefully carried out to contribute to the continual growth of biomaterials science and engineering. Particular efforts will be put on training a new generation of collaborative and skilled researchers and educators in the field of biomaterials and nanomedicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award is to develop and investigate a novel macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticle (denoted MØ-NP) platform for endotoxin neutralization. The approach taken will be to utilize an innovative and robust top-down strategy to transfer the entire cellular membrane of macrophage cells onto the surface of synthetic nanoparticles. A nanoparticle thus modified is expected to preserve the surface antigens and exhibit similar functionalities as its source cells. In this particular project, the MØ-NP is expected to inherit the macrophage's capabilities for binding endotoxins. To achieve the primary goal, three specific research tasks will be pursued in the proposed project: (i) prepare and characterize MØ-NPs; (ii) study endotoxin-binding capabilities of MØ-NPs; and (iii) investigate endotoxin neutralization by MØ-NPs in vitro. Further, through this project the PI will train a team of interdisciplinary and multi-level collaborative young investigators, provide minority students with stimulating research experience, and enhance scientific education among K-12 students and community at large.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>As one of the principal components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, endotoxin induces systemic inflammatory response characterized by induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, fever, hypotension, intravascular coagulation and nitric oxide, which lead to ?endotoxin shock?. While all endotoxins share a common architecture, they vary greatly in structural motifs dependent on bacterial genus, species, and strains. Accordingly, their interactions with ligands differ substantially, which imposes significant challenges in rational design of neutralization agents. This proposal is aimed to address these challenges by combining existing knowledge of endotoxins binding specifically to macrophages and technological advancement in engineering cell membrane-coated nanoparticles. The central goal of this proposal is to develop a novel macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticle (denoted M?-NP) platform for endotoxin neutralization. Supported by this award, the PI has systematically studied the preparation, formulation optimization, and physicochemical and biological properties of M?-NPs, and demonstrated novel biomedical applications for M?-NPs. These results have led to 16 peer-reviewed articles.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class="TAMainText">We have developed a protocol to prepare M&Phi;-NPs and verified the macrophage membrane coating on the nanoparticle surface. As shown in <strong>Figure 1</strong>, M&Phi;-NPs were produced by cloaking 100-nm polymeric nanoparticles with mouse macrophage membrane isolated from harvested J774 mouse macrophage cells. Macrophage membrane cloaking was accomplished by dispersing and fusing cell membrane vesicles with polymeric nanoparticles by sonication method. Physicochemical characterizations revealed that the final M&Phi;-NPs were approximately 120 nm and possessed an equivalent surface charge to that of macrophage membrane-derived vesicles. Transmission electron microscopy image revealed spherical shape and a core-shell structure as expected in a lipid bilayer-coated nanoparticle. The membrane coating on the M&Phi;-NPs had a right-side-out conformation, which provides stability and retains membrane receptors. These M&Phi;-NPs exhibited similar binding properties to endotoxin as the source macrophage cells and also demonstrated superior stability in PBS buffer. By acting as macrophage decoys, the resulting M&Phi;-NPs could bind and neutralize endotoxins that would otherwise trigger immune activation. In addition, these macrophage-like nanoparticles sequestered proinflammatory cytokines and inhibited their ability to potentiate the sepsis cascade (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). In a mouse <em>Escherichia coli</em> bacteremia model, treatment with macrophage mimicking nanoparticles reduced proinflammatory cytokine levels, inhibited bacterial dissemination, and ultimately conferred a significant survival advantage to infected mice. Employing M&Phi;-NPs as a new biomimetic detoxification strategy shows promise for improving patient outcomes, potentially shifting the current paradigm of sepsis management.</p> <p class="TAMainText">&nbsp;</p> <p class="TAMainText">The cell membrane coating technology has been further expanded to other immune cell types. Specifically, neutrophil membrane-coated nanoparticles (Neutrophil-NPs) have been created and demonstrated to neutralize various types of inflammatory cytokines (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). A series of quality assurance specifications for the production of neutrophil-NPs were established to ensure physicochemical and biological reproducibility of the nanoparticles. The neutrophil-NPs were able to neutralize a wide range of inflammatory cytokines, and thus could be applied to treat a series of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a common chronic inflammatory disorder and a major cause of disability. Despite the progress made with recent clinical use of anti-cytokine biologics, the response rate of rheumatoid arthritis treatment remains unsatisfactory, owing largely to the complexity of cytokine interactions and the multiplicity of cytokine targets. The neutrophil-NPs inherit the antigenic exterior and associated membrane functions of the source cells, which makes them ideal decoys of neutrophil-targeted biological molecules. It has been shown that neutrophil-NPs could neutralize proinflammatory cytokines, suppress synovial inflammation, target deep into the cartilage matrix, and provide strong chondroprotection against joint damages. In a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis and a human transgenic mouse model of arthritis, neutrophil-NPs showed significant therapeutic efficacy by ameliorating joint damage and suppressing overall arthritis severity. &nbsp;</p> <p class="TAMainText">&nbsp;</p> <p>Regarding broader impacts, the research findings from this project have been integrated in a new course titled ?Nanomedicine? created by the PI. This curriculum initiative has a great potential to shape and impact the development of the graduate and undergraduate curricula in ?nanoengineering?. In addition, this project provided undergraduate students with stimulating research experience. A total of 5 undergraduate students have been involved in this project during the entire award period. These hands-on laboratory training is extremely helpful for undergraduates to decide their future career path. This award also significantly enhanced scientific education among K-12 students. During the award period, a total of 2 highly motivated high school students have been accepted to directly work on the project. The research program also hosted visits from high school teachers and their students to learn more about nanotechnology and nanomedicine. Moreover, the research findings from this project have been effectively disseminated to the public in large through a series of educational lectures including over 50 invited talks at various national and international conferences and institutional seminars. The audiences included professionals, graduate students, undergraduate students, high school students and teachers, and general public. Collectively, these activities have generated tremendous broader impacts of this project.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/17/2018<br>      Modified by: Liangfang&nbsp;Zhang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1505699/1505699_10389135_1542439876625_Outcome-Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1505699/1505699_10389135_1542439876625_Outcome-Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1.
