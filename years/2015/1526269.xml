<AbstractNarration>Wirelessly-connected users encounter a vast array of environmental settings from factors including diverse terrain, buildings, vegetation, weather conditions, and velocities. Today, when traversing across these diverse conditions, each environmental change triggers a new wireless channel characterization so that links can have optimal performance for transmission rate and frequency band decisions, both of which depend on spatial and environmental characteristics. This characterization process can induce a high overhead on the network, greatly reducing the overall performance of the wireless links which were seeking to be optimized. In this project, diverse wireless scenarios will be classified into a finite set to recognize wireless channel types and optimize per-link and network-wide decisions. The project will significantly reduce the amount of characterization that needs to be performed per environment, especially when revisiting a location or when a new location shares many similarities as those previously visited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will use two different approaches to classify wireless channels and create a notion of channel type which will be fed into an online training framework to optimize transmission rate and frequency band selection. In the first approach, previously encountered channel types will be recognized for immediate link-level and network-wide decisions and the resulting performance from these decisions will be observed to improve future decisions. In the second approach, previously-unencountered channel types for which insufficient levels of training exist will be inferred via crowdsourcing as an initial starting point for on-the-fly training. There are four main intellectual thrusts to the proposal: (i) The geometric relationship that forms between the link-level performance and the n-dimensional space of environmental factors contributing to such performance will be characterized in order to classify and recognize channel types across geographically diverse regions. (ii) A crowdsourcing approach with a large data set of cellular and WiFi-based mobile phone users will be leveraged to experimentally isolate the roles of geolocation, land use, and situational context to geo-spatially infer channel types. (iii) An on-the-fly training framework will be developed to leverage these two notions of channel type for previously-encountered and well-trained scenarios for optimal link adaptation, network-wide decisions, and ongoing training, and previously-unencountered or poorly-trained scenarios to use inferred channel types with decisions and resulting performance used for constructing a sufficient training. (iv) This knowledge of channel type will be exploited along with the current spectral activity and demand to optimize the band assignment in multiband, multihop networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit. In the project, Channel Recognition for Optimized Links and Networks (CROLA), surrounding contextual information derived from sensors was used to improve the performance in wireless networks by maping wireless behavior to the environment and situation. At a protocol level, both online and offline machine learning structures were used to create the relationships between the environmental information and wireless adaptation strategies. At a network level, geographical features were used to predict wireless propagation for signal quality characterization for both planning deployments and characterizing the effectiveness of a deployment. In doing so, there were four major intellectual merits from the CROLA project.  Training wireless machine learning algorithms for the appropriate context was significantly enhanced, where channels that were previously encounted were recognized and previously unencountered channels inferred to be new with high accuracy over even a few channel samples.  Online training for in-the-field machine learning wireless algorithms were developed when new (or poorly trained) channels encountered. Specifically, nine-fold throughput improvements were experienced via the use of context information over rate adaptation schemes that used channel quality alone. The need for costly drivetesting was eliminated (or at the very least significantly reduced) via a measurement campaign that leveraged crowdsourcing. In particular, despite the mobile phone imperfections of quantization, downsampling over time and space, and averaging over multiple samples, path loss characterization was highly accurate as compared to a state of the art tool, a channel scanner. Machine learning was used with LiDAR and signal quality data to identify the role of geographical features in wireless propagation. Namely, by using geographical feastures, a seven-fold improvement in accuracy was achieved versus state-of-the-art methods for predicting propagation in areas where wireless measurements were missing.   Broader Impacts. The CROLA Project had four major broader impacts as outcomes to the project.  Undergraduate researchers made a significant impact on this project and the research outcomes. In particular, there were seven undergraduate students that participated in research over the course of the project. Three of these undergraduate researchers were involved with the REU program. Three of these undergraduate researchers were women, one of which was an under-represented minority.  Additionally, this project made significant strides in understanding the role a mobile phone can play in crowdsourcing wireless channels, which is an ongoing task force within the 3GPP standard to reduce the need for costly drivetesting. There were over 18 publications (7 journal papers and 11 conference proceedings) from which a data repository has been made available. Over course of the project, there were six Ph.D. that were mentored and defended dissertations and two MS theses defended. These students have all taken high-paying jobs in industry (three with Samsung, one with Qualcomm, one with Synopsis, one with Microsoft, one with JAM Wireless, and one with a mobile development startup).
