<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Anna L. Johnson is "Tracking the impact of species introductions and extinctions on ecological interaction network structure over 100 years in a diverse island ecosystem." The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Pittsburgh and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Tia-Lynn Ashman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key challenge in ecology is to understand how species invasions and extinctions impact the structure and stability of complex ecological interaction networks as environmental change occurs. Plant-pollinator interaction networks provide valuable ecological services and are likely to be particularly susceptible to species loss. The fellowship research tracks the impact of species compositional shifts on pollinator-mediated pollen transport networks using an extensive herbarium collection of the flora of the Hawaiian Islands, collected by botanist Joseph C. F. Rock from 1909-the early 1920's. The Fellow is reconstructing historic pollen transport networks from herbarium specimens and then resampling contemporary flowering plant communities in the same regions of Hawaii to determine 1) whether network connectivity is lost at a proportionally slower rate than species in island pollination networks and 2) whether invasive plant species are nested within the pollination network, facilitating retention of network connectivity. The resulting data provide valuable insight into the ways that biological systems respond over long time periods to perturbations. It also pioneers new methods for pollen transport network construction and automation of pollen data collection, with broad applications to future research questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training goals include new sampling and analysis methods and gaining experience with a novel study system. Extensive community outreach, with the assistance of experienced science educators, consists of a schoolyard plant-pollinator network project that engages underserved K-12 students in Pittsburgh, PA in observing, interacting with and studying what they see in the natural world every day. Students are encouraged to make connections between their local ecosystems and faraway tropical ecosystems and conduct their own experiments. In addition, the research activities pioneer new methods for reconstructing historic pollen transport networks that can be applied to other herbarium collections. This project also generates voucher specimens from contemporary sampling and develops a pollen reference library, all of which will be made publicly available as part of the herbarium collection after completion of the research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The general goals of this postdoctoral fellowship were to conduct research and outreach activities broadly focused on understanding how native and introduced species interact via pollination, while making use of biological collections. This project resulted in the design and execution of two academic research studies, as well as the development of a high school active learning science curriculum which is currently being implemented in public school classrooms.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The major intellectual merit goals of this postdoc--which the two completed studies were designed to address--were to 1) collect both contemporary and historical data on pollinator mediated plant-plant interaction networks, 2) construct pollen transport networks in both contemporary and historic dry forest communities based on pollen deposited on stigmas, and use this, 3) to test theory about the impact of changes in species composition on interaction network structure. These goals were tackled in the context of the endangered dry forest ecosystems of Hawaii. Hawaii--and oceanic islands in general--are hotspots of biological invasions as well as often being hotspots of biodiversity. This makes them excellent study systems for understanding how native species respond to environmental disturbances, such as species invasions. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For the first study, floral stigmas were collected from both native and introduced plant species along an invasion gradient in dry forest preserves on the island of Hawaii. Pollen deposited on the stigmas, in addition to pollen carried on honeybees, a dominant introduced pollinator in the system, were analyzed to determine how the structure of interactions between co-flowering plants changed as dry forest became more invaded. It was shown that species in more native-dominated sites were more tightly connected to one another, and also that honeybee foraging preferences were the major drivers of which species were interacting via pollen transfer. Additionally, we found that floral traits (e.g. flower size and shape) and native vs. invasive status of individual species determined how the species interacted within the pollination network. This study was one of the first to document pollination interactions in this system, and highlighted the individual invasive species which were potentially competing with native species the most, as well as the native species which may be most impacted by that competition.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The second study used herbarium collections to determine how species interactions have shifted over the last century in Hawaiian dry forest. Large numbers of species have been introduced to this ecosystem as well as have become extirpated in this ecosystem over the last century. This study employed a novel method for collecting pollen from herbarium specimen stigmas, and found that while the quantity of pollen which species received did not seem to shift substantially over time, the identity of species which interacted via pollen transfer did change dramatically. Species which are resilient to these changing pollination interactions are likely to be best able to survive dramatic, long-term shifts in species composition, such as has occurred in Hawaii.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Both of these studies provided valuable, empirical data in an understudied ecosystem. Additionally, by documenting how interactions vary in both time and space, they provided evidence that pollination interactions between species are not static, and that future studies need to consider both temporal and spatial variation. And, by pointing to specific floral traits which were correlated with different species? roles within pollination networks, this work generated new hypotheses to test in other systems about what makes species more or less resilient to shifting species interactions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to these research outcomes, this postdoctoral fellowship also supported the development of a new curriculum focused on the ecology of species interactions in ?our own backyards??baseline monitoring was done along urbanization gradients within Pittsburgh, PA, USA to examine how plants, pollinators, and plant-pollinator interactions varied as the urban environment changed. The results were used to train public school teachers in basic research methods and to work with science outreach experts at the University of Pittsburgh to develop a schoolyard science curriculum that trained high school students to identify pollinators, observe pollination interactions in the field, and then collect flowers to culture microbial communities present within the flowers. Students were encouraged to identify and test their own hypotheses about how the urban environment impacts species interactions. This urban biodiversity curriculum, which provides students and teachers with authentic research experiences, has been piloted in several high school science classes already, and will continue to be refined and expanded over the coming years by the University of Pittsburgh?s Department of Biological Sciences outreach staff.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Anna&nbsp;L&nbsp;Johnson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523771/1523771_10376538_1543524602076_HawaiianDryForest--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523771/1523771_10376538_1543524602076_HawaiianDryForest--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hawaiian dry forest"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523771/1523771_10376538_1543524602076_HawaiianDryForest--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hawaiian dry forest"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Native plant species dominated Hawaiian dry forest at one of the study sites.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anna L.
