<AbstractNarration>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Summer Topical Meetings are the premier conference series for exciting, new areas in photonic science, technology, and applications.  This Topical Meeting Series creates the opportunity for researchers to learn about emerging fields, and to interact with the research and technology leaders in an intimate environment. Unlike regular conferences of professional societies, the topical meetings provide a unique forum where members from academia, national labs, industry, and government labs working in the same field will convene in a highly interactive environment to foster active cross-disciplinary discussions. The funds requested for this conference support proposal will allow the participation of graduate/undergraduate students at this conference, in particular those from underrepresented groups, to leverage NSF funds to partially cover their registration and travel expenses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Topical Meetings of the IEEE Photonics Society are the premier conference series for exciting, new areas in photonic science, technology, and applications.  It serves as an international forum to facilitate information exchange between various technical communities using or affected by the rapidly growing areas of science and technology.  The program will: 1) sponsor a student poster session and poster presentation awards at the Summer Topical Meetings; and 2) provide financial support for student participants to attend the IEEE Photonics Society Topical Conferences. The conferences will cover six topical areas: Functional Two-Dimensional Materials (FTDM), Ultraviolet Lasers and Light Emitting Diodes (UVLED), On-chip optical interconnects (OCOI), Visible Light Communications (VisC), Mid Infrared Photonics (MIP), Nonlinear-Optical Signal Processing (NOSP). The six topics have been proposed by experts in the respective areas and selected by the IEEE Photonics Society, and represent some of the most important and intensively investigated fields as deemed by the photonics community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Topical Meetings of the IEEE Photonics Society are the premier conference series for exciting new areas in photonic science, technology and applications.  It serves as an international forum to facilitiate information exchange between various technical communities using or affected by the rapidly growing areas of photonic science and technology.  Unlike other regular meetings held by the IEEE, the meetings' topics are proposed by the community and reflect the emerging trends and intensively investigated areas in the general field of photonics.  The conference created an opportunity for the participants to interact with leaders in the field in an intimate environment and fostered cross-cutting discussions and collaborations to push the frontiers of photonics science, research, applications and technology.  The meetings also aim to enhance the participation of graduate and undergraduate students by hosting a poster session across five topics discussed at the conference.  The poster session provided an opportunity for students to present their work and have face-to-face discussions with photonics experts in their respective fields fo study.  This activity significangly encouraged student participation with the idea that it would help their career development by providing networking opportunities to students working in the photonics filed.   The program sponsored a student poster session at the 2015 summer topical meeting and also provided financial support for student participants to attend this conference.
