<AbstractNarration>The goal of this workshop is to bring together American and Brazilian cyber security researchers to discuss the main challenges of the field, and to promote cross-collaboration and the building of ties among the attendees. The workshop will be organized in two meetings, one in Brazil in the fall of 2015, and one in the US in the spring of 2016. The attendees will be comprised of about 35 American and Brazilian researchers in cyber security and privacy in universities in the US and in Brazil.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop promotes innovation in solving cyber security and privacy problems, by having the top researchers from both countries, from several sub-fields sharing their research and brainstorming solutions for open problems in the area. Having a scientific discussion on cyber security and privacy with Brazilian academics can increase the visibility and applicability of American technology in other countries, and increase the diversity of students applying to undergraduate and graduate programs in the US. Brazil is a large a diverse democracy with significant scientific strengths, and this proposal helps improve connections between the two countries.  Additionally, this workshop will strengthen the US-Brazil Bilateral Cooperation on Education, which includes the Brazil Scientific Mobility program, which has funded almost 30,000 Brazilian students at various levels in American educational institutions.</AbstractNarration>

During the workshops participants presented their research and experience, discussed timely topics on several panels and worked on small breakout sessions on the most pressing problems in cyber security at the time (Web Security Across All Devices, Human Factors in Cyber Security and Privacy, Science of Security, Security for Lightweight IoT Devices, Cybercrime, Malware, and Intrusion Detection, and Federated Command and Control for Cyber Operations) and the opportunities and challenges for collaborations between the two countries. Participants also attended 5-minute scheduled meetings randomly pairing attendees from each country. Among the workshop attendees were the Brazilian Secretary for Science, Technology, and Innovation (MCTI), Celso Pansera; the Assistant Director for the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Sciences &amp; Engineering for the National Science Foundation (NSF), Jim Kurose; and the Cyber Security Division Director for the Department of Homeland Security, Doug Maughan.&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Two reports were generated with the results of the breakout sessions for the Brasilia and the Orlando workshops.
