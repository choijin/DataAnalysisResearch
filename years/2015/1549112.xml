<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Capacity-building (CAP) projects increase the ability of researchers to understand how such technology should be designed and used in the future and supports new capacity in allowing researchers to answer questions about how people learn, how to foster or assess learning, and/or how to design for learning.  The proposed work is a series of summits designed to increase the capacity of researchers in the learning sciences community through exposure and instruction in advanced data analytic techniques.  It addresses a critical need at the intersection of two burgeoning fields of study and advances the larger goal of CAP projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a series of summits that builds on previously funded NSF work to advance learning sciences.  Members of the learning science community are often unaware of the complementary developments in the data analytics community that could enhance the depth and impact of their work.  The participants in these summits are current NSF awardees, from various programs, whose work focuses on learning sciences.  Building through exposure and instruction in data analytics not only expands the body of knowledge at the interface of these two fields, it smartly leverages current NSF funded projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Learning analytics are a set of methods and practices around the collection, measurement, and interpretation of data associated with educational systems. Successful application of learning analytics can greatly increase the efficacy and impact of educational research. However, these methods are rarely applied to NSF projects relating to the learning sciences for three primary reasons: 1) lack of awareness; 2) lack of understanding of how to prepare data for analysis; and 3) lack of understanding of how to properly apply learning analytics methods. Indeed, training individuals as data scientists in education is hard: the process is time consuming, technical and specific, expensive, and, in truth, neither the training of data scientists nor learning analytics itself is well understood by the larger learning sciences community.  We created the "Data Consortium Fellows" (DCF) program to bring together leaders in learning analytics to train both PIs and graduate students in how to best implement learning analytics in their own work. Furthermore, we created opportunities and provided training for Data Fellows to share their knowledge with their home institutions.  Over the life of the award, we recruited and trained Data Fellows from a wide variety of institutions, organizations, and backgrounds.
