<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Dr. Stephen E. Greiman is "Explorations of parasite and microbe biodiversity in shrews across a dynamic contact zone in the arctic." The host institution for this fellowship is the University of New Mexico, and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Joseph A. Cook and Dr. Eric P. Hoberg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Museum of Southwestern Biology is a premier research collection with its collection of whole fixed small mammals.  These specimens have preserved gastrointestinal tracts, including parasites, permitting study of host and pathogens in different locations and time periods.  Using next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the fellowship research uses metagenomics to examine community structure and diversity of a complex assemblage of macroparasites (parasitic worms or helminths) and microbes (bacteria and viruses) within two small vertebrate hosts (shrew species) across an extensive zone where these species contact each in northern Alaska. Hybridization is common and occurs when two related species that were once isolated come into contact, often due to changing environments, and successfully reproduce.  The offspring are hybrids and often can persist and, through selection over succeeding generations, become increasingly adapted in the novel environment. Parasites are known to reduce the fitness of their host organisms, and differences in the levels of parasitism and parasite community structure between the hybrid and parent species could play a role in the eventual persistence or success over time for potentially divergent lineages of the hosts.  New metagenomic methods are being developed for use in preserved specimens from collections; as these samples are irreplaceable, sustainable use requires special techniques.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training goals include developing expertise in bioinformatics, NGS technologies, museum curation and collection management.  Educational outreach to undergraduates includes developing, as part of the Aim-UP! program, an on-line module for evolution and parasitology courses based on the dynamics of parasites in hybrid zones.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Natural history collections are a critical resource for understanding the status, distribution and interrelationships of organisms on earth. Collections spanning multiple decades provide critical historical baselines to measure changes in biodiversity. Many of these collections have been underused; however, with the advancement of molecular technologies, like next generation sequencing, museum samples now can be utilized in novel ways to address significant questions about environmental change and species interactions. The goal of this project was to determine the feasibility of developing a new (metagenomic sequencing of all organisms in the gut) technique to identify the parasites (tapeworms, flukes and nematodes) and microbiomes (bacteria) of small insectivorous mammals (shrews). We tested quality of data from museum samples fixed in varying ways. Shrews occupy diverse habitats, host a speciose and abundant parasite fauna (97 helminth species: 9 trematodes, 39 cestodes, and 50 nematodes), and are wide spread across the US. Through comparison of guts preserved in alcohol to freshly collected samples, we examined how parasites and pathogens (bacterial) are changing both spatially (throughout the US) and temporally (over time). We successfully sequenced the parasite communities (using the genes 12S, COI, 16S, 28S) and bacterial microbiota (16S) of 46 museum archived whole gastrointestinal tracts (GI) of shrews (Figure 1). Guts were obtained from the Museum of Southwestern Biology and from my recent field collections and varied both in age (ranging from 16 years old to recent) and preservation method (70% ethanol stored at room temperature, 95% ethanol at room temperature, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80<strong>&deg;</strong>C). This newly developed technique allows us to critically examine the distributions and interactions among multiple groups of organisms over time.</p> <p>The project supported the training of a postdoctoral fellow in museum curation, next-generation sequencing technologies and bioinformatics, building on his previous background in parasitological research. This fellow then secured a tenure track faculty position in parasitology at Georgia Southern University. Several students from New Mexico received training in classical parasitological techniques (specimen staining and slide mounting, light and electron microscopy, specimen measurements, and line drawings) and molecular techniques (DNA extraction, PCR, Sanger Sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis). These included 1 high school student, 1 post-BA student, and one masters student (3 females including 1 Native American and 1 Hispanic). Two of these students presented their work with the High School student being awarded runner-up for the NM State-wide science fair competition as well as two additional categorical awards. A video about mentoring and multiple peer reviewed publications were developed with these students, including the description of 3 new species of tapeworm from shrews in NM. Lastly, through this fellowship, the fellow initiated a new collaborative project with colleagues at UNM and the USDA to sequence the genomes of 46 tapeworm species from small mammals. These will be the first whole genomes sequenced from non-medically important tapeworms and provides an opportunity to more rigorously investigate the evolution and biology of tapeworm parasites.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/14/2017<br>      Modified by: Stephen&nbsp;E&nbsp;Greiman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523410/1523410_10373885_1487087769877_Metagenomic_figure_NSF--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523410/1523410_10373885_1487087769877_Metagenomic_figure_NSF--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig:1 Metagenomic Results"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523410/1523410_10373885_1487087769877_Metagenomic_figure_NSF--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig:1 Metagenomic Results"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Top: Abundances of 16S rDNA reads of bacterial phyla within GI tracts of shrews.
