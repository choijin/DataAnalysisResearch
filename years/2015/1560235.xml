<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Louisville, offers research experiences in the field of advanced micro/nano-manufacturing to a diverse cohort of undergraduate students, over a three year period. Students will participate in an intense training/research program centered around exciting hands-on research projects which demonstrate how this interdisciplinary miniaturization technology can be used to create a wide variety of novel devices and systems capable of impacting the grand challenges of today in energy, healthcare, advanced manufacturing, security and the environment. The emphasis on mico/nano-manuafacturing is of economic importance to the nation and developing the required workforce is vital to our nation retaining its leadership role in this technology. Undergraduate programs such as this are vitally needed to introduce students to the fascinating field of micro/nano-manufacturing at an early stage in their academic careers so they can leverage it in their graduate studies and throughout their professional careers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this 10 week summer research experience are to: 1) Provide each student with a personalized research experience, with faculty and graduate student mentors, related to micro/nano-manufacturing, 2) Have all students obtain a core competence in the field of micro/nano-manufacturing through a common classroom experience where they design, fabricate and test solar cells, 3) Develop each student's independence and confidence through participation in research, in-house presentations, weekly scientific meetings and poster presentations, 4) Provide complementary programs to enhance each student's learning and skillset (i.e. seminars on writing, engineering design, critical thinking, ethics) 5)Stimulate the students' interests in graduate careers in related science and engineering disciplines, 6) Reach out to undergraduates (especially underrepresented groups) in Kentucky to help improve the state's national ranking in education, and 7) Make the 10-week REU experience rewarding and potentially transformative for the students. This REU Site program will help create greater awareness of micro/nano-manufacturing and the positive impact it can have on society today and in the near future.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of the NSF IMPACT (Interdisciplinary Micro/nanotechnology Program Addressing Challenges Today) REU program was to recruit and train a diverse group of STEM students in the advanced manufacturing field of "micro/nanotechnology" through exciting hands-on research projects which demonstrated how this remarkable miniaturization technology can be used to create new devices and systems capable of "impacting" the global challenges of today in energy, healthcare, advanced manufacturing, security and the environment. Although micro/nanotechnology has been around for several decades, its commercial success has been primarily limited to the fields of semiconductors and microelectronics. Only recently have researchers begun to expand the application areas of this attractive advanced manufacturing technology from the 2.5D field of semiconductors to the true 3D world of MEMS, microfluidics, sensors, optics, actuators, the Internet of Things (IoT), and other non-semiconductor disciplines. Furthermore, these next-generation applications of micro/nanotechnology require expertise and involvement from researchers outside the traditional ECE-dominated semiconductor discipline. For micro/nanotechnology and micro/nano-manufacturing to reach its full potential, it requires the successful recruitment, training, and integration of creative students in the non-traditional fields of physics, chemistry, ME, BE, ChE, material science, medicine and biology.&nbsp; Only then will the technical challenges be successfully overcome and the true promise of this unique manufacturing technology be realized. However, the intellectual barrier to broad implementation of micro/nanotechnology for solving global issues is that undergraduate students in these critical adjacent disciplines are never exposed to this technology during their undergraduate academic career.&nbsp; This IMPACT REU program was designed to specifically address that problem through the achievement of the following objectives: 1) We provided 28 students with a personalized research experience related to micro/nanotechnology, 2) All students obtained a core competence in the field of micro/nano-manufacturing through a common cleanroom experience where they designed, fabricated and tested custom solar cells, 3) Each student developed independence and confidence through participation in research, in-house presentations, weekly scientific meetings and poster presentations, 4) We provided complementary training programs to enhance their learning and skillset (i.e. seminars on writing, engineering design, critical thinking, ethics, etc), 5) We stimulated the students' interests in graduate careers in related science and engineering disciplines, 6) Our program specifically targeted undergraduates (especially underrepresented groups) in Kentucky to help improve our state's poor national ranking in education (47th in HS degrees, 47th in UG degrees, 32nd in graduate degrees), and 7) We made their 10-week experience fun through hands-on research projects and interesting social activities, such as Segway tours of the city's riverfront.</p> <p>During this three-year program, we trained 28 undergraduates in total from both the state of Kentucky and nation-wide.&nbsp; Among the many accomplishments, our 28 REU students gave 28 oral conference presentations, 67 conference poster presentations, published 2 journal articles, had 1 journal cover, and impressively won 2 highly-competitive national Goldwater Scholarships. Our REU cohort represented a cross section of talented students from 12 feeder schools in Kentucky, intermingled with talented students from across the nation, producing a highly dynamic and supportive experience. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of our micro/nano theme, we were able to attract students from a wide range of STEM fields, including engineering, chemistry, physics and biology. Our selection process was especially sensitive to applicants from NSF underrepresented populations. Our year 3 acceptance rate was only 14%, illustrating the growing demand for our REU program and its theme. Our diverse cohort of 27 students included: 33% from KY, 67% from outside KY, and ~20% from underrepresented groups. Most importantly, 100% of our in-state students came from schools with limited or no UG research opportunities. Therefore, our program served a critical need for the EPSCOR state of Kentucky. According to our August 2019 survey, 14 of our 28 alumni are still completing their undergraduate degrees. An impressive 5 of our alumni were accepted directly into engineering PhD programs at Vanderbilt, Texas, Ohio State, Wash U and Florida State, and 3 into Masters programs at Cincinnati, Vanderbilt and Morehead St. The remaining 5 accepted STEM positions in industry and government labs. We are especially proud of Canisha, an African American female student who received a full PhD fellowship from Wash University to study ME.&nbsp;We have begun compiling testimonials on our website from our 2016-2018 alumni, who continue to keep in touch and share their success stories with us (URL <a href="https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uoflnanoreu.com%2Fparticipant-testimonials&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cana.sanchez%40louisville.edu%7Cf605437bff5e4e65176308d8178466d9%7Cdd246e4a54344e158ae391ad9797b209%7C0%7C0%7C637285204709533831&amp;sdata=PusL46dLPfF%2BaTZXMy8IkZFm0xnVK7eExZ4uXBZ6x7E%3D&amp;reserved=0">https://www.uoflnanoreu.com/participant-testimonials</a>).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/26/2020<br>      Modified by: Kevin&nbsp;M&nbsp;Walsh</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560235/1560235_10414153_1591106950790_cleanroompicture--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560235/1560235_10414153_1591106950790_cleanroompicture--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU 2017 Cohort in the MNTC Cleanroom"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560235/1560235_10414153_1591106950790_cleanroompicture--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU 2017 Cohort in the MNTC Cleanroom"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU 2017 Cohort in the MNTC Cleanroom</div> <div class="imageCredit">Photo by MNTC Staff</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kevin&nbsp;M&nbsp;Walsh</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU 2017 Cohort in the MNTC Cleanroom</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560235/1560235_10414153_1591108025797_Convocation2018atRTNN--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560235/1560235_10414153_1591108025797_Convocation2018atRTNN--rgov-800width.jpg" title="NNCI REU Convocation 2017"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560235/1560235_10414153_1591108025797_Convocation2018atRTNN--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="NNCI REU Convocation 2017"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">NNCI REU Convocation at RTNN (NCSU)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Photo by RTNN (NCSU) photographers</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kevin&nbsp;M&nbsp;Walsh</div> <div class="imageTitle">NNCI REU Convocation 2017</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560235/1560235_10414153_1591108558713_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560235/1560235_10414153_1591108558713_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="KY NANO + AM Symposium"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560235/1560235_10414153_1591108558713_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="KY NANO + AM Symposium"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU  2018 cohort presenting at KY NANO + Additive Manufacturing Symposium</div> <div class="imageCredit">Photo by Kari Donahue (UofL)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kevin&nbsp;M&nbsp;Walsh</div> <div class="imageTitle">KY NANO + AM Symposium</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560235/1560235_10414153_1591108857829_Griselda3DPrintedPressureSensorPoster--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560235/1560235_10414153_1591108857829_Griselda3DPrintedPressureSensorPoster--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU Participant Sample Work"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560235/1560235_10414153_1591108857829_Griselda3DPrintedPressureSensorPoster--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU Participant Sample Work"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU participant sample work poster presentation</div> <div class="imageCredit">Poster by Griselda Saucedo -
