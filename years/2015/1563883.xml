<AbstractNarration>Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a transformative technology that is dramatically changing how data storage systems of the&lt;br/&gt;future are built. This technology allows an unprecedented combination of performance and persistence into a single&lt;br/&gt;device. This project will develop a suite of storage caching techniques for this transformative technology along four&lt;br/&gt;complementary dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first two usage dimensions address the selective use of NVM as host-side read caches for persistently stored data&lt;br/&gt;as well as using their persistence properties explicitly by developing fault-tolerant write caching solutions. The&lt;br/&gt;latter two develop advanced techniques for delivering storage quality of service (QoS) using NVM caches and building caching&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that are aware of data reduction techniques, such as deduplication and compression, for the NVM layer. Together, these contributions have the potential to transform enterprise data center storage stacks by readily adopting the best properties of current and future NVM technology. The expected performance benefits apply to a broad spectrum of computer systems and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational activities will include the involvement of undergraduate students and incorporation of the project's research findings into coursework. Planned outreach activities will focus on recruitment of under-represented students from minority groups in computer science for participation in the project.  Transition of the new technologies to practice through open source distribution of the Linux operating system and KVM hypervisor code implementing the innovations are successful expectations.</AbstractNarration>

We evaluated these implementations with both synthetic and real-world workloads. Such caches are widely used by enterprise and cloud systems today.

Finally, we also built Simulus, a generic python simulator for large-scale complex systems such as host-side and distributed caching systems.   Broader impact:   Storage I/O performance is central to the functioning of high-performance software systems and the services infrastructure in enterprise and cloud data centers that drive the Internet. Datapath and non-datapath caches represent fundamental building blocks for making storage more performant and cost-efficient. The contributions of this project thus impact state-of-the-art computing technology and computing infrastructure.  This project supported five Hispanic PhD students, three female PhD students, as well as four Hispanic undergraduate students, and two female undergraduate students over the duration of the project via REU supplements.   Outcomes summary:  The findings from this project significantly advance the development of next generation enterprise and cloud systems by allowing for significantly more flexible cost-performance trade-offs than their predecessors.
