<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael P. Doyle will explore dirhodium compounds that hold transformational potential for advancements in catalysis for organic synthesis and for the understanding of their applications. The research will focus on three major initiatives. (1) The development of catalytic oxidations of organic compounds using dirhodium carboxamidate. These studies will include the elucidation and clarification of the mechanisms of oxidations by tert-butyl hydroperoxide and the design of a synthetic strategy for peroxidation/Michael addition/peroxide cleavage.  (2) The development of acidic chiral dirhodium(II,III) carboxamidates for high enantioselectivity in Lewis acid catalyzed reactions, and expanding their broad use in Lewis acid catalyzed reactions (including carbonyl-ene, Henry, and azomethine cycloaddition reactions). (3) The development of an understanding of and control of catalysis that exclusively produces different products from the same reactants by the use of different catalysts (e.g., through metal carbene versus acid intermediates). A goal is to establish catalyst uniqueness in reactions of vinyldiazoacetates and to design useful predictions about how to develop new reactions..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research provides fundamental advances in catalysis and offers research opportunities for the education of graduate and undergraduate students who are preparing for careers in the chemical sciences.  Students are integrated into the research program with a strong mentoring program that prepares them for their intended careers. As a platform for student education, the development of new dirhodium catalysts and their applications for highly selective processes provides new transformations, enhanced catalyst control, and specific reaction pathways.  New oxidation methodologies catalyzed by dirhodium compounds promote green chemistry applications that are selective and efficient, and understanding how they occur increases the potential for uses of molecular oxygen as the oxidant.  Oxidized dirhodium compounds that are prepared by mild methods provide a broad selection of effective and highly selective Lewis acids for use as catalysts in carbon-carbon bond forming transformations.  The search for divergent outcomes in catalytic reactions is a concept whose applications have practical implications for catalyst comparisons in general; the uses of two or more catalysts that act independent of each other will increase the efficiency of many catalytic processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts  Chemical Oxidations: Funding made through this grant award supported investigations that clarified long-standing uncertainties concerning the chemical oxidations of amines and made possible aerobic selective oxidations of disubstituted anilines catalyzed by inexpensive iron compounds.  These studies not only provided access to new materials, but they also gave a basic understanding of how these reactions occur and the relative effectiveness of catalysts that accelerate them.  Chiral Lewis Acid Catalyzed Reactions: Our approach in this objective has taken us from the synthesis and catalytic reactions of chiral dirhodium(II,III) Lewis acids to asymmetric catalytic reactions of 2,3-diketoesters.  The former continues the development of processes that employed chiral dirhodium carboxamidates, such as the carbon-carbon bond forming process between a carbonyl compound and an alkene known as an "ene reaction", and demonstrates the characteristics and versatility of chiral Lewis acids that used only one-point binding to influence and control stereoselectivity in product formation.  The latter has utilized a broad range of chiral Lewis and Bronsted acids to control stereoselectivity and has demonstrated the broad utility of 2,3-diketoesters for the construction of complex molecules.  Divergent Outcomes in Reactions of Vinyldiazoacetates: During the grant period we have developed a catalytic methodology that combines three contiguous atoms from one structural unit to three contiguous atoms from a reactive structural unit that is formed by chemical catalysis.  This combination forms a six-membered ring containing the contiguous atoms from both structural units, and the chemical compounds that are formed are heterocyclic compounds that may have biological activity or form derivative compounds that are biologically active.  The reactive structural unit is derived from a class of compounds that are known as enoldiazoacetates, and these stable reactants form unstable enolcarbene complexes when treated with suitable catalysts.  These investigations with funding from the National Science Foundation have allowed us to produce a general methodology, known as a [3+3]-cycloaddition, that compliments the universally known [4+2]-cycloaddition that is widely known as the Diels-Alder reaction. With chiral catalysts high stereocontrol has been achieved.  Continuing investigations have described [3+2]-cyclization reactions of enoldiazoacetates that also occur with high enantiocontrol, and they have reached beyond stable structural units that contain three contiguous atoms for reactions with reactive enolcarbene complexes to reactive structural units that contain three contiguous atoms to form novel reaction products.  We have also discovered the previously unreported [4+2]-cycloaddition between the nitrogen-nitrogen double bond of a diazo compound and a diene.  This unprecedented reaction forms a stable dipolar species that is suitable for further cycloaddition.  This transformation occurs without the use of a catalyst from a reactant that is formed by gold catalysis.  Gold catalysis on a compound containing diazo and an alkyne functional groups, both of which are known to react with gold complexes, selects only the carbon-carbon triple bond for reaction.  These investigations have clarified understanding of gold catalysis as well as identifying a previously unknown reaction of diazo compounds.  Personnel and Publications: Three graduate students who were supported by this grant award have obtained their Ph.D. degrees from the University of Maryland and are in permanent employment or postdoctoral positions.  Four undergraduate students were integral participants in this research, and they are coauthors of publications from their research; one of them is a NSF Graduate Fellowship recipient and is currently in graduate school in chemistry.  Two postdoctoral students contributed substantially to this research.  More than twenty-five publications reported research that was funded by this award.
