<AbstractNarration>This project will study the adaptation, implementation, and dissemination of best practices in experiential learning in the core middle years of the engineering curriculum where students take the bulk of technical fundamentals.  The study will involve two series of junior-year fundamental core engineering courses; one taught at Northwestern University's Department of Biomedical Engineering and the other taught at the University of Florida's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.  The course sequences use similar tools and teach similar topics geared towards building skills needed for success in the engineering workplace or graduate school.  The differences are in methods of delivery and the types of experiential learning modules employed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a mixed method approach, the main goals of this proposal are to 1) assess each course sequence in terms of How People Learn and assess how student experiences and outcomes are linked to those attributes of each course and 2) enhance and expand effective experiential learning modules for broader adoption and implementation.  The project will evaluate student learning preferences, student engagement, retention of material in subsequent courses in their respective sequences, transferrable skills between courses and learning of course concepts.  Both schools have highly selective engineering programs, but the student demographics differ. These differences give the opportunity to consider more demographic factors in assessing the courses and in designing materials to take advantage of diversity.  The knowledge gained will guide future design or development of new interventions and their dissemination strategies.</AbstractNarration>
