<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1511450&lt;br/&gt;PI: Umbanhowar, Paul&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Granular materials such as sand, snow, and salt consist of large numbers of solid particles that interact with each other primarily through contact foces.  Flowing granular materials occur in natural phenomena, such as landslides and avalanches, and in industrial processes, such as pharmaceutical manufacturing and ore processing.  When the particles differ from each other in size, density, roughness or some other physical characteristic, they can segregate during flow, which complicates processing and diminishes product quality.  The goal of this project is to discover ways to avoid or reduce segregation and improve mixing in unsteady granular flows, i.e. flows that vary in time.  The project involves experiments to determine how flow modulation can best control segregation and mixing for materials consisting of particles of various sizes. The experiments will be complemented by modeling and computer simulation that can help interpret the results and predict optimal modulation methods for controlling segregation.  Results will generate useful processing methods and modeling tools for industrial practitioners.  The project team will comprise a diverse group of researchers and students, including students from underrepresented groups and local high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will examine the interplay between unsteady kinematics and segregation to develop a continuum-based framework to predict spatial particle segregation distributions for polydisperse particles in bounded heap flow and rotating tumbler flow.  The results will be used to demonstrate how flow modulations, such as feed rate variations in heap flow or rotational speed variations in tumbler flow, can inhibit segregation and improve mixing.  Findings from the project will guide industrial granular materials processes and systems by providing methodologies that apply over a wide range of operating conditions and that are supported by a continuum-based model. The model will account for unsteady flow, segregation, and collisional diffusion, all of which are important elements in a broad array of granular processes.  The combination of experiments and simulations will provide an expanded and improved understanding of flow, segregation, mixing and pattern formation in granular systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on controlling mixing and segregation of granular media in unsteady flows such as those that occur when filling and emptying hoppers or mixing material in rotating tumblers.  Granular materials are composed of large numbers of solid macroscopic particles and are ubiquitous in nature (e.g., sand, gravel, and snow), the home (e.g., laundry powder, coffee beans, and lawn fertilizer) and industry (e.g., plastic pellets, powdered metal, pharmaceuticals).  When the particles making up the granular material differ in size, density, shape, or other physical property, they have a propensity to spontaneously de-mix, or segregate, into spatial regions containing particles with similar properties.  The effects of unwanted granular segregation range from a nuisance (e.g., raisins at the bottom of a box of raisin bran cereal), to life threatening (e.g., incorrect ratio of active to inactive powdered ingredients in pharmaceutical products).  Unlike fluids (e.g., air and water) whose flow is well understood and can be accurately modeled and engineered for maximum performance and efficiency, the behavior of flowing granular materials lacks a comprehensive mathematical framework. Consequently, processes involving flowing granular media are often hampered by inefficiency and lack of product consistency, and scale-up of production is often difficult if not impossible.   While granular segregation in steady flows has been investigated for various operating conditions and geometries (e.g. chute flows), unsteady granular flows, even though ubiquitous in many industrial applications, remain largely unexplored.  The goals of this project were twofold: (1) Develop new techniques to control segregation and improve mixing by modulating parameters of granular flows. (2) Examine the interplay between kinematics and segregation of unsteady granular flow to develop a theoretical framework to predict spatial particle segregation distributions.   We developed two new techniques for controlling segregation in granular flows.  In the first, we showed that periodically modulating the volumetric feed rate in a bounded heap flow causes regular and controllable segregation patterns to form from initially mixed media formed from two components (bidisperse).  The patterns (see figure Influence of modulated flow on segregation pattern formation) consist of interlaced layers of the two particle species; the length and thickness of the layers are controlled by the frequency and amplitude of the feed modulation.  Of particular interest is the pattern consisting of thin interlaced layers that span nearly the entire extent of the heap. By applying this modulation while filling a hopper or bin, the variation in concentration during discharge is greatly reduced compared to when the hopper is filled with no modulation (in which case one species deposits mainly near the middle of the hopper while the other deposits mainly at the hopper wall and the resulting discharge is initially rich in particles from the middle and lastly rich in particles from near the wall).  This work resulted in one pending US patent.  In the second method of controlling segregation using unsteady flow, we showed that adding a small amount of liquid water (as small as 1 part in 10,000 by volume) to a size-bidisperse granular mixture changed the flow from steady to time varying.  This unsteady flow takes the form of periodic avalanches that flow downstream followed by a more rapidly propagating upstream front of particles that begins when the downstream avalanche reaches the lower wall.  In addition, this method of inducing unsteady flow changes the packing density in the material deposited on the heap: material deposited during the downstream avalanche is significantly more dense than that deposited by the upstream moving front.  The significance of this work is it shows that easily implemented flow modulation methods can greatly reduce mean streamwise segregation in depositing flows; the method works best where it is most needed - in strongly segregation materials.  On the modeling side, we showed that a transport equation formalism incorporating the effects of advection, diffusion, and, most importantly, segregation, is able to accurately describe the segregation of granular materials in a variety of developing and unsteady flows including chutes, tumblers, and modulated heap flows.  We have even been able to apply the formalism to the much more complicated but industrially-relevant hopper discharge flow.  Most significantly, by experimentally characterizing the kinematics of modulated flow avalanches and developing new methods for incorporating moving flow boundaries into continuum computations, we were able to reproduce the patterns observed in modulated heap flow experiments and their dependence on modulation parameters (see figure Segregation patterns from experiments and predicted by segregation model).  The significance of this work is that it (1) demonstrates the applicability of the transport model framework to unsteady flows, and (2) allows unsteady segregating flows to be accurately modeled when the flow kinematics are known.  The results of the project were communicated to the scientific community in eleven papers (including one review article), nine conference presentations, two dissertations, and one pending patent application.
