<AbstractNarration>The development of social and economic control that leads to inequalities in the distribution of wealth within human societies has been a central theme in understanding how people live. Because archaeology provides a long-term view of past societies, and how they become more or less socially complex through time, it is well suited to provide insight into this phenomenon that occurs within human groups.  Using innovative research techniques, Laura Swantek along with colleagues at Arizona State University will undertake research on this process, specifically focusing on understanding how some societies become more complex over time, others do not change, and still others cycle between high and low levels of complexity. Changes in complexity, such as those described here, can be seen today in parts of the world where social and economic changes occur within generations.  Understanding what people did in their everyday lives that cause changes in social complexity in the past, will provide insight into how this process occurs today across our changing world. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research examines how people form socio-economic relationships through time and across space and through these connections are able to exert control of labor, maintain long-distance trade contacts, and differentially access material and ideological resources and as a result become wealthy members of society while others cannot.  As a result of these kinds of actions, social networks, or the arrangements of people into complex social structures, change over time can be seen in the archaeological record.  This research will be conducted on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus during a 700 year period during which small village level societies exhibited unique characteristics of changes in social complexity.  Using data from past excavations of settlements and cemeteries and archaeological surveys, this research will combine methods developed in modern economics, and complex systems and network science, to examine how different social arrangements or network configurations are created by people striving for wealth and control within societies.  This interdisciplinary research will foster international scientific collaboration, as well as develop and test new methods for understanding how people exert social and economic control, shaping and reshaping the societies in which they live.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of complexity studies in the ancient Near East and Mediterranean has traditionally been on the emergence of the state.  This has come at the expense of understanding the emergence of social complexity or social and economic inequality in middle-range or smaller scale societies.  While complexity becomes institutionalized in states, this research indicates that it remains fluid and mutable in smaller scale communities.  In studying this more dynamic process in middle-range societies, we are able to investigate what people are doing that changes the scale of complexity or amount of  inequality in their communities.  This research has shown that people's actions and interactions build, break and rebuild social connections within a social network.  It is through these social connections that goods and services or material wealth pass between people.  Those people who make more social connections acquire more goods and services and thus greater social power and wealth within the social network.  Through this process, in which some people make more connections than others, social differentiation and wealth inequality are maintained or increase; through severing these ties, greater equality can be maintained.  As people go through this process, social networks which support the movement or control of goods are changing and with this change, inequality is increasing and decreasing.  This research indicates that changes in degree of inequality can occur relatively quickly, because they are occurring from the bottom-up or as a result of the actions and interactions of people as they go about their daily life.  People cycle between hierarchical or high differentiation to low differentiation and sometimes back to near equality over time.  Unlike in states, people in smaller scale societies are accustomed to and adapt more quickly to changes in social power and economic wealth within their communities.       Using the island of Cyprus during the Prehistoric Bronze Age (2400-1700 BCE) as a case study allowed for the investigation of this process in a semi-isolated location to test if the emergence of complexity or inequality is a phenomenon that requires or is aided by contact with more complex, outside cultures.  Complexity, in the form of differentiated or hierarchical social networks emerges on Cyprus during this period as a primarily endogenous or on-island process with very little extra-island contact or influence.  This result adds to our understanding of how smaller scale societies in which equality is maintained become socially and economically differentiated, but also indicates that this process does not have to occur through contact with more socially complex societies.        This research has application today as we try to understand the power structures in non-state level societies and small-scale organizations of people living in places like the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia.  The mutability of these smaller scale societies can be difficult to navigate and to understand.  This research not only reveals the dynamic processes within smaller scale societies, but it tests methodologies that are applicable to the past and also to today.  These methodologies could potentially help us understand the dynamic relationships between people and changes in social power and economic wealth in societies structured very differently than our own.
