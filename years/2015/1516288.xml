<AbstractNarration>In specialized brain areas called the basal ganglia, neurons generate certain rhythmic activity patterns during particular stages of motor processing.  This rhythmicity becomes enhanced in disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), where pathological activity patterns include pronounced oscillations within certain frequency bands, increased synchrony, and phasic bursting.  These patterns of amplified rhythmicity are thought to compromise functionality of basal ganglia networks and to contribute to motor impairments.  The overarching goal of this work is to understand how cellular and synaptic changes that occur in PD render neural circuits in the basal ganglia more susceptible to rhythmic activity in disease.  Specifically, this research will focus on an understudied neural circuit that is well positioned to influence rhythmicity throughout the basal ganglia and will help to identify potential cellular targets to disrupt pathological network activity in disease.  A combination of in vivo and in vitro physiological approaches together with computational model development, simulation, and analysis will be used to identify biological features of this circuit that can generate and maintain rhythmicity and to explain how this network contributes to runaway rhythmicity in PD. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) is a central nucleus within the basal ganglia that has been strongly implicated in the onset and maintenance of rhythmic activity.  Under normal conditions, neurons in the GPe fire tonically and independently, at rates of 10-80 Hz; after dopamine depletion, GPe neurons become highly synchronized and fire in rhythmic bursts.  The GPe interacts with other basal ganglia nuclei through multiple circuits, one of which, a pallidostriatal circuit linking GPe with the striatum, has only recently been identified as a natural contributor to basal ganglia rhythmicity.  A major goal of this work is the identification of features within the pallidostriatal circuit that generate and maintain rhythmicity and may underlie runaway rhythmicity in pathological conditions.  Achievement of this aim will help in the location of targets that can be modulated to disrupt the pathological amplification or propagation of basal ganglia rhythmicity.  These results will be achieved through an approach that integrates in vivo and in vitro physiological experiments with computational model development, simulation, and analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The basal ganglia  (BG) are a collection of brain structures that have been linked to  various behaviors such as decision making, action selection, and  inhibition of unwanted movements.   These functions are thought to emerge from the interactions of neurons  distributed across the components of the BG, and changes in these  neurons’ activity patterns and rhythmicity have been linked to various  pathologies including Parkinson’s disease, which  arises through the loss of a neurotransmitter called dopamine that is  normally released within the BG.  The overarching goals of this project  were to determine what BG components are necessary and sufficient to  produce rhythmic activity under control and dopamine-depleted  conditions and to determine the mechanisms through which these  components interact and influence basal ganglia dynamics under control  and dopamine-depleted conditions.  The research completed within this  project achieved five main advances.  First, we studied  a recently identified circuit involving neurons in the striatum, the  major input structure of the BG, and a downstream structure, the  external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), which receives  projections from and projects back to the striatum.  Using experiments,  we established that these structures form a communication loop, and  using computational modeling, we showed that changes in the strengths of  links within this loop, which occur under dopamine depletion, favor the  emergence of oscillations in a frequency range  that has been associated with parkinsonism.  The striatum itself  contains multiple types of neurons that send signals to distinct targets  elsewhere in the BG, and our next result used computational modeling  constrained to fit experimental and behavioral data  from decision-making tasks to show how changes in activity in specific  striatal components effectively act to modulate different cognitive  aspects of the decision-making process, namely the rate of evidence of  accumulation and the threshold level of evidence  needed for a selection to be made.  Third, noting the possible role of  the GPe in generating pathological oscillations, we stimulated or  inhibited different populations of neurons within the GPe of mice with  compromised movement capabilities due to dopamine  depletion.  We found that specific stimulation targets yielded  significantly improved movement generation during the stimulation  period; moreover, in some cases, multiple repeated stimulations led to  movement benefits that were sustained for hours beyond the  end of the stimulation, offering a direction for future exploration for  the treatment of parkinsonism.  We observed that these stimulations  induced some changes in activity downstream from the GPe, in a BG output  area called the substantia nigra pars reticulata  (SNr).  We therefore went on to perform computational modeling of how  the SNr integrates its inputs from the GPe together with inputs from the  striatum.  This investigation revealed that different ion  concentrations associated with different GPe firing rates  could lead to differences in the characteristics of SNr activity,  including the level of SNr synchronization and the susceptibility of the  SNr to being paused, as is believed to be needed to release motor  behaviors normally suppressed by SNr outputs.  Finally,  our experimental investigations of oscillations in the BG under  dopamine depletion, originally begun to test the predictions of our  computational modeling, revealed the presence of previously unreported  slow oscillations in the BG of awake, behaving mice.   We showed that these oscillations did not originate in motor cortex,  are associated with effects of a lack of dopamine on a certain subclass  of dopamine receptors found in some striatal neurons, and correlate with  motor signs associated with dopamine depletion.    Altogether, these results highlight possible new markers of  parkinsonism, approaches to address movement deficits of parkinsonism,  and mechanisms contributing to BG function and dysfunction.
