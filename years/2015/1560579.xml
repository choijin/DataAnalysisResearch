<AbstractNarration>Water quality and scarcity have been labeled "the defining crises of the 21st century" and are the main drivers behind the challenges and increasing regulations that limit the projected growth of the water industry over the coming decades. International reports agree that global water consumption doubles every 20 years. Modern water treatment technologies based on the active sludge method have significant disadvantages, including limitations on heavy metal removal and significant reliance on chemicals. Because of the urgent crisis in water quality and scarcity, greener and more cost-effective technologies are in demand. This NSF I-Corps team project will study the market prospects of technologies based on research that had elucidated the action mechanisms involved in removing contaminants from water using natural materials such as mucilage from cactus plants that are surface active. Cactus mucilage, the gooey part of cactus plants, is composed of flexible molecules capable of removing water pollutants. Different extraction methodologies can lead to different fractions of the cactus mucilage that are effective at removing water pollutants by engulfing heavy metals, flocculating sediments, coagulating bacteria, and dispersing heavy organic molecules such as those found in crude oils. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The desire to treat polluted and waste water to a level suitable for beneficial reuse plays an increasing role in market growth. The technologies based on cactus mucilage have the potential to treat ground/surface water, well water, and waste water to EPA maximum contaminant level (MCL) standards. These technologies also provide an eco-friendly alternative for cleaning oil contamination. They also can serve as a disaster recovery mechanism to provide mobile treatment units and emergency water purification kits. These technologies are natural, biodegradable, compostable, and provide affordable methods of water purification using cactus extracts that will stem the tide of water bottle proliferation, and will advance the filtration market by reducing the large, unfriendly carbon and plastic environmental footprints.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award allowed us to participate in the NSF I-Corps program at the University of Michigan Site. The kick-off workshop took place in the Ann Arbor, MI, area from October 13 to 16, 2015. We then participated in 5 online course meetings. The team returned to Ann Arbor for the final workshop from December 2 to 4, 2015. Our team worked on the technologies based on the efficient extraction of mucilage from cactus plants for water purification. Cactus mucilage, the gooey part of the cactus plants, is composed of polysaccharides and carbohydrates capable of exhibiting intermolecular interactions with specific water pollutants. Different extraction methodologies led to different fractions of the cactus mucilage that are effective at removing water pollutants by engulfing heavy metals, off-flavor compounds, flocculating sediments, coagulating bacteria, and dispersing heavy organic molecules such as those found in crude oils. The training tools and venues provided by the I-Corps program allowed the team to understand the pathways to spur translation of NSF-funded fundamental research knowledge to commercial products. At the end of the award, the PI formed a start-up company on May 3, 2016, with the name of &ldquo;Water, Health, and Sustainability, LLC.&rdquo; We created a position of executive manager as a new job, and consolidated ties with other industries such as Mote Aquaculture Research Park and Healthy Earth, LLC. The scope of &ldquo;Water, Health and Sustainability, LLC&rdquo; is centered on applying sustainable technologies to remove off-flavor compounds from recirculating aquaculture water. We also applied and were awarded the Bulls Ring Accelerator Grant (BRAG) from the USF-Foundation to create a pilot unit for our technology. The team also participated in the 4th Annual Building Entrepreneurship Around TampaBay (B.E.A.T.) Event, and was selected in the top 4 companies that won the pitch competition.</p> <p>The NSF-I-Corps team examined the strengths and addressed weaknesses of the cactus mucilage technologies with the aim to accelerate the development of products and services using natural materials and the NSF I-Corps strategies learned. Because of this NSF award, the team acquired knowledge, specifically an understanding of the competition, risk factors, and decision-making processes related to the cactus technologies applicable to commercial pathways and how to maintain high value for the consumer. The executive manager position was given to a Hispanic, female professional in charge of the commercialization strategies and activities such as industrial implementation, and design and testing of pilot units of our technology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/21/2017<br>      Modified by: Norma&nbsp;Alcantar</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560579/1560579_10398767_1492700723033_Somethingtobragabout--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560579/1560579_10398767_1492700723033_Somethingtobragabout--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Something to BRAG about"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560579/1560579_10398767_1492700723033_Somethingtobragabout--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Something to BRAG about"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dr. Alcantar's Article in the USF - Foundation Performance Report 2015-2016</div> <div class="imageCredit">USF Foundation 2016, Crafted by USF Foundation ADV Ops</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Norma&nbsp;Alcantar</div> <div class="imageTitle">Something to BRAG about</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560579/1560579_10398767_1492700435774_fishy-TalePicturefinal_Page_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560579/1560579_10398767_1492700435774_fishy-TalePicturefinal_Page_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nothing fishy about this tale"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560579/1560579_10398767_1492700435774_fishy-TalePicturefinal_Page_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nothing fishy about this tale"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Article featuring our company first grant from the Bulls Ring Accelerator Program.</div> <div class="imageCredit">USF Foundation 2016, Crafted by USF Foundation ADV Ops</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Norma&nbsp;Alcantar</div> <div class="imageTitle">Nothing fishy about this tale</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560579/1560579_10398767_1492763644391_WHASlogoandAcknowledgementforuploading--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560579/1560579_10398767_1492763644391_WHASlogoandAcknowledgementforuploading--rgov-800width.jpg" title="WHaS logo and acknowledgement"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560579/1560579_10398767_1492763644391_WHASlogoandAcknowledgementforuploading--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="WHaS logo and acknowledgement"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is the logo for the start-up company that was created after training provided by this NSF I-Corps award.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Norma Alcantar</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Norma&nbsp;Alcantar</div> <div class="imageTitle">WHaS logo and acknowledgement</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
