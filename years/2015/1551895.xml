<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to organize a workshop on Resilience Research in October 2015. Development of a national innovation strategy to advance a research and development for critical infrastructure resilience involves collaborative effort across the federal agencies, universities, and industry owners and operators, as critical infrastructure resilience involves energy production and distribution transportation, manufacturing and many other sectors, that are key elements for national security and the economy. The National Workshop on Resilience Research (NWRR) will gather leading researchers from academic, government and private institutions to advance a strategy to accelerate integrated efforts for developing near-ready-for-proof-of-concept technologies and applications for critical infrastructure systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will include a poster session for NSF Resilient Interdependent Processes and Systems (RIPS) program awardees. It will provide a venue for CRISP/RIPS program awardees to interact with each other and promote cross-fertilization of ideas. The workshop will also identify policy and economic incentives that can overcome current barriers to widespread deployment and development of technologies to address resiliency of infrastructure systems. The workshop participants will gain valuable experience from the interactions between industry, academic and federal agency participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The first NSF supported Workshop on Resilience titled "National Workshop on Resilience Research (NWRR) for Critical Infrastructure: Current Status and Challenges", was organized on Oct. 22-23, 2015 at National Science Foundation (NSF), Stafford I Building. The Workshop was supported by Elise Miller-Hooks, Gurdip Singh, Pramod Khargonekar from the NSF.  The NSF NWRR 2015 Workshop featured:  Seven keynotes, Eight breakout sessions, Three panels, Poster session and reception (first day), CRISP/RIPS session (second day),   with over 140 registrants for the workshop including CRISP/RIPS awardees.  Some of the major topics discussed were through the following breakout sessions.  The resilience of cyber physical architectures session identified the need for managing uncertainty and massive data sets as well as identification of interdependencies and policies for data information sharing. The human resilience breakout indicated that interdisciplinary research incorporating human factors and social sciences needs further focus and advancements.  The cyber security session summarized the need for situational awareness and the state-of-the art root cause analysis, as well as understanding interdependencies through a unified process and an integral approach . Distributed architectures breakout indicated the need for better understanding of the coupling between power and other infrastructures and open dialogues across different fields: economic, power, social systems. The metrics for assessing resilience session identified the need for a way to provide comparative analysis and trade-offs among solutions. Scalable testbed environments breakout pointed out to the importance of abstraction levels for industry buy in and differences between particular vs. generic infrastructure test beds. Policy/market based incentives breakout group concluded that effectiveness and interdependencies are an issue, as well as the return on investment and stakeholders. The technologies vs. real-world demand session pointed out to research problems of estimating available excess capacity and access to resilient infrastructures that can be utilized to support other infrastructures (military bases sourcing to civilian infrastructure).    NWRR 2015 brought up many important conclusions and observations as well as path forward in resilience of critical infrastructures. Two main conclusions are worth emphasizing: 1) the need for challenging and highly interdisciplinary approach, ranging from psychology, sociology and human factors, via cyber, CPS, to real-world demands and technologies and policy/marked based challenges; 2) the need for research on interdependencies among connected infrastructures and effects on one another.  Further details can be found in the full workshop report. Program agenda and speakers: http://cps-vo.org/group/NWRR2015.
