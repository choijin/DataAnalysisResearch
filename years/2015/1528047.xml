<AbstractNarration>Navigation in dynamic, uncertain environments is a difficult yet ubiquitous problem in diverse applications such as search and rescue, coordinated movement, distributed monitoring and surveillance.  Collaborative solutions are highly promising because of their potential to exploit strengths of both the human and the automation.  However, major challenges in collaborative navigation include not only the ability of the underlying automation to effectively handle novel scenarios and changing environments that may not have been considered at the design stage, but also human-automation interaction requirements.  The design of methods and tools that can address these challenges could enable fundamentally new functionality in collaborative human-robot systems.   The novelty of the proposed research is in the integration of control theory, motion planning, and human guidance to provide highly effective solutions for navigation in highly dynamic and uncertain environments.  The proposed project will also create opportunities to involve under-represented minorities in K-12 outreach and in undergraduate and graduate research, to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, and to develop a new interdisciplinary graduate course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to develop a generic framework for collaborative navigation in complex environments that can accommodate hundreds of moving obstacles (with possibly stochastic dynamics), non-trivial static obstacles, and humans in the loop.  We propose to a) evaluate the tradeoff between short-term and long-term information for both users and autonomous systems in highly dynamic environments, b) extend our existing algorithmic techniques to environments of higher complexity, e.g., multi-robots and non-planar environments, c) design and test several user-interfaces, which satisfy pre-determined conditions for user-observability and user-predictability, for their effectiveness in improving safe navigation, and d) experimentally validate our existing setup for collaborative navigation in dynamic, uncertain environments via an Android app.  We will develop tightly coupled planning and control tools, integrate human guidance and decision making with automated tools, and complete a rigorous analysis of safety in highly dynamic environments with uncertainty.  The developed methods will be validated in multiple environments, with human subjects, and on a micro robot testbed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed computational tools for identifying ways for humans to better collaborate with automation for navigation tasks.  Robotic navigation, moving from one point in space to another, is intrinsically challenging when the space is crowded and changing randomly.  Several automation methods provide solutions, however, none are able to guarantee safety in challenging spaces.  Therefore, this project focused on including the human in the navigation process via the development of methods for fast and inexpensive prototyping of human-automation collaboration methods.  Through integration of  control, planning, and human interaction, this project produced new methods for autonomous navigation, a system for humans to interact with these automation techniques, and methods for testing information passed from the automation back to the human. First, in order to enhance safety while navigating in challenging spaces with dynamic obstacles, this project developed new ways of integrating detailed predictions of the motions of obstacles into the automated planning of navigation pathways. Therefore, the automation can evaluate and provide a measure of safety between potential navigation routes.  Next, we developed and tested a graphical interface via a mobile app where humans can collaborate with automation techniques.  A mobile app promotes diverse and broad human participation in the evaluation of new methodologies.  Finally, we evaluated ways information from the automation could be passed back to the human to enhance outcomes and conditions when humans intervened in navigation.  Our methods have provided techniques for enhancing safety in navigation tasks in crowded and randomly changing environments.  We have shown that effective collaboration between the human and automation enabled performance simply not possible under fully automated control.  We provided libraries of techniques for autonomous navigation in crowded spaces and formal methods for safety.  The project also had several broader impacts. First, the products of this work are general and have the potential to improve the effectiveness of collaborative systems with high impact.  This work is already being integrated into new evaluations of human-automation research in basic research and industry application.  Second, the products of this research have been used to teach about human-automation collaboration at various K-12 STEM outreach events and schools.  Additionally, this project developed several broadening participation in computing workshops for undergraduates and early graduate students, the Becoming a Robot Guru Workshop series.  The outcomes found enhanced interest in and self-confidence regarding graduate school after a student's participation in the workshop. Third, this project had a great impact on personnel.  Postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students were mentored.  One postdoc has continued to academia, and several students have taken positions in industry or government research labs.  All postdocs and graduate students and some undergraduate students published papers in premier conferences and journals.  Several postdocs and students were from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in computing.         Last Modified: 12/22/2020       Submitted by: Lydia E Tapia]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
