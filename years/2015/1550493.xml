<AbstractNarration>Scientific discovery now often involves computer simulation in addition to, or instead of, laboratory experimentation. This can accelerate, improve, and/or expand scientific insight, often at a great reduction in cost. Many such computer simulations spend much or most of their time solving linear algebra (matrix) problems. For these simulations, linear algebra problems constitute the most basic building blocks of the computation. As a result, software libraries (bundles of specialized code) that efficiently solve linear algebra problems fundamentally support sustained innovation in science. The project aims to create a next generation of software libraries for this domain and will make these libraries available to the scientific community as open source software that can be easily ported to current and future computer architectures. This will directly and indirectly impact discovery in academia, at the national labs, and in industry. The project will also impact affordable education through open course ware that is expected to reach a broad audience. The involvement of undergraduate and graduate students will strengthen the pool of qualified individuals trained to support scientific computing.  The project involves research staff and students who are members of traditionally underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are well-known routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and widely available, they are commonly used in the development of high quality linear algebra software, such as the well-known Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK), as an example. However, the BLAS libraries that exist today have not evolved to new computing architectures, and hence do not perform as well as they could. The technical goal and scope of this project, therefore, is to develop a new high-performance dense linear algebra library with broad functionality that can be easily ported to current and future multi-core and many-core processors. The project builds on the BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS) effort that has exposed low-level primitives that facilitate the high-performance implementation of BLAS. By implementing the higher-level dense linear algebra functionality in terms of these low-level primitives, portable high performance will be achieved for higher-level functionality needed by many scientific computing applications. Contributions will include the to-be developed techniques for implementing such software, the resulting open source software, and pedagogical artifacts that will include open course ware.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientific computing and data-driven discovery are two of the four pillars of science, along with theoretical and experimental discovery. Scientific applications, and more recently data science applications, are often written in terms of linear algebra software libraries, which are therefore a critical infrastructure for scientific innovation.  For this reason, investing in the linear algebra software stack that can flexibly support the demands of the most advanced computational methods across current and future architectures broadly impacts science.   The intellectual merit of the project lies with the application and extension of new techniques for designing and instantiating high-performance linear algebra software libraries.  This leveraged the BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS) framework that supports rapid instantiation of a key set of linear algebra operations to provide higher-level linear algebra functionality, targeting scientific computing and machine learning.  It has also partially supported Tensor BLIS (TBLIS), a library for tensor contraction that overcomes shortcomings in traditional tensor software, such as the need for extra workspace and additional overhead due to data movement.  In addition, new theoretical results give insight into why the algorithms that underlie BLIS perform well on current CPUs and how they much change as architectures evolve.   In addition to contributing to foundational knowledge about how to develop mathematical software, the broader impact of the project lies with the software libraries that were developed and have been released under open-source licenses.  This software has been embraced by the scientific computing community and is also being distributed by industry.  For example, it is now part of AMD's mathematics software library.  The key fact is that these libraries are highly portable and easily adapted to new architectures, which has allowed established and new players in the field of high-performance and/or low-power processors to deploy libraries for high-performance computation.  This has improved the competitiveness of a number of US companies in this domain.   The grant funded the training of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, including members of underrepresented groups.  Two postdoctoral researchers have gone on to faculty positions.  Graduate students have moved on to postdoctoral positions at top universities or research positions in industry. Several undergraduates have been accepted into top-10 graduate programs.These individuals will become part of the next generation of computer, computational, and data scientists.  The grant partially funded a Massive Open Online Courses offered on the edX platform, which has exposed tens of thousands of participants to our NSF-sponsored research.
