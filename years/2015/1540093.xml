<AbstractNarration>This project advances modeling and computational frameworks to guarantee the sustainability of power distribution networks from environmental, economic, and social perspectives. Environmental sustainability is addressed by accounting for the increased uncertainty associated with the rapid and ad-hoc integration of renewable generation and elastic loads. With regard to economic sustainability, computational and inference foundations are put forth to ensure effective and secure market operations in the face of the imminent emergence of large-scale distribution-level electricity markets. Lastly, social sustainability is effected through cyber innovations focused on increasing economic utility and enhancing cyber security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims for broad socio-technical advances in electricity distribution networks. Successful project completion will offer cyber innovations that enable the systematic integration of stochastic renewable generation while improving end-user satisfaction. Given the ubiquity of the suite of research tools and methodologies, the utility of the proposed research goes well beyond the envisioned application area to the broader fields of optimization, stochastic processes, control systems, machine learning, statistical signal processing, and cyber security. Broader transformative impact will result from pragmatic test cases proposed for validation, involvement of undergraduates in research, and outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The project focused on the following objectives:  (1) How can advances in reliability modeling, robust optimization, big-data analytics, statistical learning, and cyber-security enabled sustainable power distribution networks  and  (2)  Conversely, what computational challenges emerge as a result of increased renewable integration, end-user participation, and the emergence of large-scale power distribution markets?  The research undertaken during the duration of the project:  (i) developed statistical learning methods for monitoring power distribution networks and identify anomalous behavior either due to exogenous factors, or due to malivious activities. A suite of time series models was investigated, assuming different strategies adopted by informed adversaries. The models were backtested based on data obtained over a two-year period from meters deployed at 150 buildings on a University campus.  Further, we investigated the ability of such models to simulate electric loads at the circuit level, using fine scale data from the the University campus to calibrate their parameters. Accurate generation of simulated electric loads can be used by researchers to test the impact of malicious activities, as well as strategies to mitigate it.  (ii) investigated time-of-use pricing schemes that represent an important strategy for power providers to manage supply, thus increasing the efficiency of allocating limited resources and seamelessy integrate intermitent renewable resources and consequently rendering the grid more reliable and for consumers to manage their costs.
