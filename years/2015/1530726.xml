<AbstractNarration>Improving learning in K-12 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) is a critical national need as more jobs require STEM proficiency. Recently, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have shown great promise in improving STEM learning in middle school and high school. While these tutors support students directly, they do not provide information to teachers. This project will remedy this shortcoming by developing software that will display the students' progress in middle school mathematics and will also suggest help that the teacher can provide to the students to enhance their learning. The help that the software provides is based on the analysis of learning built into the tutor, but which is too complex to be usable by teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will take a user-centered design approach to create a teacher's dashboard for ITSs, so that it can be effective in various realistic classroom scenarios. Classroom studies will be conducted to evaluate whether, when used by the teacher, the dashboard helps students learn more effectively. The work will focus on Mathtutor, a freely available website with intelligent tutoring software for middle-school mathematics learning. Specifically, the project will focus on Lynnette, a tutor for grades 7 and 8 with a proven track record in helping students learn to solve linear equations. The research questions to be addressed include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the up-to-the-minute data about student learning that intelligent tutoring systems can provide that is helpful to teachers and how can it best be presented in an actionable manner?&lt;br/&gt;How do teachers use actionable analytics presented in a dashboard to help their students?&lt;br/&gt;Do students learn better when their teacher monitors a dashboard and uses it to adjust the instruction?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project work will include design, development, pilot testing, and classroom studies. The dashboard will be designed with substantial teacher input. Further, the project will provide teacher guides for how to use the dashboard via the Mathtutor website. The dashboard will work with all Mathtutor units and all tutors built with CTAT/Tutorshop, a widely used tutor-building infrastructure. Diverse student groups will benefit, as tutoring software has been effective with a wide range of students, including minority students, non-native English speakers, and low-income students.</AbstractNarration>

It is likely that analytics generated by educational software could augment what teachers know and could help them help their students more effectively. Yet, the analytics should provide clear, succinct, up-to-date, and actionable information, which is rare. In our project, we worked with teachers to understand their needs and preferences regarding advanced analytics.

We conducted classroom studies and found that the tools have substantial benefits for teachers </span><span>and</span><span> students.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Working with K-12 teachers in co-design activities, we found that many of them strongly believe in making their instruction data driven and differentiated. To this end they use reports generated by software as well as data that they generate themselves, painstakingly, sometimes in a surprisingly detailed manner. Yet many obstacles prevent them from adopting data-driven practices, such as the fact that the analytics commonly generated by current teacher support tools do not strongly align with what teachers expect to be most useful. We found that teachers are very interested in having up-to-date analytics on what skills and concepts their students master, as well as their specific errors and misconceptions. Regarding real-time analytics, that is, analytics presented instantaneously as students work with learning software, teachers' primary desires are helping the students who are struggling the most and the students who are "almost there." To this end, they wish they could "see" students' thought processes, know who are truly stuck, and who probably just need a nudge to reach mastery. &nbsp;Teachers were highly receptive to technology designs that presented them with information that could help them prioritize their time among students, or could help them decide what topics or example problems to discuss in class, but without attempting to strongly recommend specific actions.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Based on these insights, we created two novel teacher awareness tools for use in conjunction with personalized learning software used by students. First, Luna is a prototype dashboard designed to help teachers tailor their lesson plans so they address common challenges faced by their students. It presents visualizations of students' up-to-date skills and misconceptions, at the individual and class levels. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dashboard designed specifically for lesson planning that leverages analytics generated by personalized learning software. A second tool, Lumilo, is a set of mixed-reality smart glasses designed to help teachers distribute their limited time and attention effectively among students, while the students are working with personalized learning software. Lumilo enables teachers to keep their eyes on the classroom while, superimposed on their view of the classroom, they can see real-time indicators of students' ongoing learning processes and struggles. Some indicators signal situations where teachers expect their help is needed, such as frequent errors.

The lesson planning dashboard (Luna) substantially influenced their lesson plans and classroom sessions, with more focused attention given to student struggle. The real-time smart glasses (Lumilo) helped teachers distribute their time among students differently, with more time spent with struggling students.

The real-time analytics presented through the glasses help create synergy between the benefits of personalized learning software and what teachers do well by themselves that seems beyond the reach of machines.&nbsp;</span></p> <div><span><br /></span></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/27/2018<br>      Modified by: Vincent&nbsp;Aleven</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1530726/1530726_10392826_1545356094895_Picture4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1530726/1530726_10392826_1545356094895_Picture4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Teacher using smart glasses with real-time analytics"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1530726/1530726_10392826_1545356094895_Picture4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Teacher using smart glasses with real-time analytics"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Middle-school mathematics teacher using Lumilo in the classroom, while her students work with intelligent tutoring software.
