<AbstractNarration>Research and development (R&amp;D) leads to the creation of new science-based technology innovations.  There is a need to improve understanding of how research discoveries translate into new technologies and then develop into useful innovation.  Methods used to address this concern either draw on trends in large amounts of historic information or draw on expert judgment.  This project will apply advanced research techniques to enhance methods to identify trends and patterns, and to help forecast innovation pathways.  Such knowledge is vital to promote scientific progress by investing judiciously in high promise R&amp;D.  It also can aid in technology management to determine how best to advance a specific field of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a case study to improve five analytical processes, identified as vital to improve the methodology of forecasting innovation pathways.  The case to be analyzed is ?big data &amp; analytics? ? a topic of great national importance.  Figuring out how to gain advantage from large data sets will impact national scientific progress, industrial productivity, and defense.  At the same time, big data poses issues of privacy and security, among others.  The topic of big data was selected because it is under study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).  We anticipate sharing information on methods and findings with GAO to gain insight into ways to make our methodology more useful. . This proposal extends a previously funded SciSIP project (1064146) to address a time-limited opportunity to address the GAO case.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The two goals of the project were: 1) to advance our Forecasting Innovation Pathways methodology, and 2) to contribute to understanding the potential impacts of "Big Data Analytics" to help inform U.S. policy considerations.  Regarding Goal 1 (methodology), we worked to improve 5 parts of our process for Forecasting Innovation Pathways (FIP):   Expand the data resources used.  We routinely retrieve abstract records from databases that cover research publications or patents.  In this project, we also retrieved data from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Awards and from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) projects, allowing us to compare US and China Big Data research funding emphases. We developed richer Technology Delivery System models to help understand what drives BDA and how four major applications may progress. We identified a richer range of innovation pathway options than we have ever done before.  We identified 28 developmental aspects and some 20 potential application domains.  See https://bigdatagt.wordpress.com. Previous work on FIP had not done much "Technology Assessment" (that is, analysis of potential impacts of the advancing technology in question).  Here we worked to expand use of data to help begin TA. We experimented with various ways to obtain stakeholder estimates of likely impacts of BDA and how important those might be.  See https://bigdatagt.wordpress.com.   Regarding Goal 2 (substantive contributions), we studied Big Data Analytics (BDA).  Findings include:  We redirected attention from "Big Data" as such to "Big Data Analytics" &ndash; i.e., to how enormous data compilations plus potent computing will be put to use via analytical tools to solve problems. Research, patent, and commercial attention to BDA all show amazing growth since 2008. BDA research is led by the U.S. and China; Figure 1 compares the research funding emphases of NSF to NSFC, finding much in common, but also some notably different emphases. Research interest in BDA centers on data and information sciences, but it shows remarkable engagement of many fields across the natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering &ndash; "everyone" is considering how BDA can advance their field (Figure 2).   Regarding Intellectual Merit, 6 journal articles and 10 conference presentations are listed at: http://stip.gatech.edu/forecasting-innovation-pathways-of-big-data-analytics-2/ .
