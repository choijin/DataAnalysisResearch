<AbstractNarration>Central African forests, the driest and second largest on Earth, have experienced a long-term drying trend. A recent study detected a widespread decline in forest photosynthetic capacity over the Congo Basin and attributed this large-scale decline, at least partially, to this drying trend. Persistent drought in the region could alter the Congolese forest composition and structure in a manner that might favor the spread of drought tolerant species and thus impact biodiversity, carbon storage, and the global water cycle. Understanding the nature and cause of this drought and assessing its impacts on the forests are of significant societal, environmental, and economic importance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding of climatic variability in the Congo basin is greatly hindered by a lack of observations and resources due to political, economic and historical factors.  Under this project, a combination of observational and modeling studies will be undertaken to investigate the nature and cause of the Congo rainfall variability in the 20th century. The role of global sea surface temperatures will be examined. For the observational component, observations and reanalysis data will be utilized to identify major patterns and drivers of the variability. For the modeling component, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations and idealized climate model simulations will be examined to investigate the physical mechanisms for the Congo drought. The relative contribution of anthropogenic versus natural forcing on the observed rainfall decadal variability over the Congo Basin will be investigated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involved the evaluation of climate change over the Amazon Basin, an area where there appeared to be a decline in the tropical forest cover.  The work involved development of data sets, analysis of meteorological variables such as rainfall, and modelling the Congo Basin climate.     Intellectual Merit     A gridded precipitation data set was produced that is available to any investigator.  It utilizes sources never before available and developed a unique approach to gridding the data.  The approach was appropriate for regions with large spatial gaps in rain gauge coverage.  This data set was used to evaluate recent trends in rainfall over the region and to determine whether satellite estimates of rainfall are accurate in this region.  It also assessed the performance of several reanalysis data sets, i.e., those that are produced from a combination of surface and satellite observations and model results.  A major result was that neither the satellite products nor the reanalysis data sets provide high quality rainfall estimates in areas where there is little surface rain gauge data available.  The study identified some major misunderstandings about what drives the climate in this region and also identified factors that govern the year-to-year variability of rainfall over the Congo Basin, i.e., in the rain forest region.      Broader Impacts     The precipitation data set that was developed will be a useful tool for researchers in many disciplines, including for example, hydrology, ecology, environmental science, even medicine (e.g., for studies of tropical diseases).  The results of the project were also disseminated to scientists in several of these disciplines, allowing them to be up to date on current changes in our understanding of the climate of equatorial Africa.     The results are also useful in the context of understanding and predicting drought in this region.  This has implications for economic development and is of great interest to the general public to policy makers, and to government agencies in the Congo Basin countries.
