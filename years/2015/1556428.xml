<AbstractNarration>The North American Summer School in Logic, Language, and Information (NASSLLI) will be held at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey-New Brunswick from July 8-16, 2016. NASSLLI is a biennial summer school that brings together top-tier faculty in Cognitive Science, Computer Science, Linguistics, Philosophy, and related areas, with the goal of introducing graduate students and advanced undergraduate students to topics that intersect various combinations of these disciplines. The aim of the summer school is to strengthen the training of the students, expand their knowledge of research possibilities, and introduce them to ways to engage in forward-looking interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NASSLLI 2016 will feature a variety of weeklong courses and workshops in five parallel sessions, which fuse together the foundational questions, unique findings, and innovative methods associated with each of these fields, highlighting both the commonalities and distinctions among them. These courses will cover a range of topics in Discourse, Epistemology, Language and Cognition, Logic, Methodology, Natural Language Programming, and Semantics. Courses are complemented by student presentations and workshops. In addition, the school is preceded by mini intensive orientation courses in fundamental areas). These combined offerings expand beyond those typically offered at academic institutions. The summer school also provides students with the opportunity to present their own research and interact with leading faculty and researchers in related fields. These aspects of NASSLLI make it a unique venue for training the next generation of researchers in the core cognitive science areas, providing them with the requisite tools to conduct innovative and groundbreaking research, and creating connections among them. Funding will compensate instructors for travel expenses and provide fellowships for graduate students to attend and present their work.</AbstractNarration>
