<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Savannah State University seeks to develop and implement an interdisciplinary undergraduate certificate program to educate students, including those from populations traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines, in technical, logistical, policy, research, and commerce-related issues of the transportation industry. Certificate recipients will be prepared to obtain career positions within the transportation industry, and thus help the U.S. economy remain competitive. The recruitment efforts include reaching out to high school students and exposing them to STEM subjects and their relationship to the transportation field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the following three goals: 1) to strengthen existing curriculum content associated with transportation concepts to better prepare students for transportation careers; 2) to increase awareness, student enrollment, and retention in transportation studies and associated fields such as logistics, civil engineering, and homeland security; and 3) to develop and implement student and faculty enhancement programs, specifically related to transportation studies. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Curriculum Modification  Four new courses in Transportation were developed:  1) CIVT 2109 Introduction To Transportation Planning  2) CIVT 3109 Traffic Engineering And Analysis  3) CIVT 3111 Intelligent Transportation Systems  4) POLS 2109 Introduction To Geographic Information Systems  K-12 Bridge Program  The bridge program was conducted during the spring semesters on select days. Three modules in the bridge program, roughly catered six to seven hours of instruction. Four hours pertaining to each module were conducted at the high school totaling to 12 contact hours by SSU instructors who travelled on four different days to Groves High School. The remaining eight hours of instruction was split into approximately two 2 hours sessions (one for each module) and one 3 hours session with one hour overlap time between sessions. Over 40 high school students received the Bridge Program certificate.  Professional Development  Over the project period, more than 7 faculty attended more than 15 conferences and workshops related to Transportation. Some of the conferences included the Annual ERN Conference, The Transportation Research Board Meeting, The International Conference on Transportation and Development, and the Georgia Logistics Summit.  Undergraduate and Graduate Student Research  More than 30 undergraduate and graduate students were&#65279; mentored by faculty who are part of the TIP-ITS program The research areas can be broadly classified into three sections: (i) Supply Chain and Logistics (SCL), (ii) Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and (iii) Traffic and Transportation Engineering (TTE). More than 20 of these students presented their work at local, regional, or national conferences.  Dissemination of Information  We developed a website called the TIGER group which lists all the activities of the project. ARISING Magazine &ndash; a annual feature of SSU, has a two page article about the Targeted Infusion Project-Interdisciplinary Transportation Studies which gets distributed to all students, faculty, staff, alumni, foundation members, and industry partners of SSU  which details the importance.   We visited local high-schools, professional associations (Maritime Logistics Educational Task Force, Savannah Maritime Association, Savannah Traffic Club and the Propeller Club) and spread the word around about the new certificate program.  We sent e-mails reaching out to all the logistics, supply chain, and transportation type business in the local savannah area.  We made presentations about the program at a few local companies including the Chatham Area Transit authority.  Newsletters were sent to all partners in the community as well as to the entire campus community.  Speaker Series  Twenty nine speakers (local, regional, and national) participated in the Speakers Series. Topics ranged from logistics, transportation, economic development, supply chains, six sigma, traffic engineering, and GIS.  Certificate In Transportation Program  A certificate program in Interdisciplinary Transportation Studies (ITS) was developed using the courses listed above, along with four existing courses. The certificate is stand-alone and is not part of a particular degree granting program. It can be taken by any discipline students across the campus.
