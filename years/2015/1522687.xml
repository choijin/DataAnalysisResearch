<AbstractNarration>Computational methods allow the simulation of experiments that are too costly, too dangerous, or otherwise infeasible to perform in physical situations.  Examples include evaluating the safety and efficiency of designs for nuclear reactors, predicting the frequency of breakdowns in power grids, and assessing the risks and rewards of financial investments.  This research project will develop new ways of computing surrogate models for time-consuming simulations.  These new surrogate models will be quicker to compute, avoid catastrophic computer error, and more faithfully represent the processes that they are designed to model.  More clever ways of exploring future scenarios will be developed to decrease the computational time required to find the average, or the worst possible, behavior of complex systems such as those mentioned.  The new algorithms arising from this research will be made publicly available for other researchers and practitioners.  Undergraduate and graduate students involved in developing these algorithms will be better prepared for scientific careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Function approximation and integration are two fundamental problems in computational mathematics. This research project will construct algorithms for function approximation and integration that are computationally stable, avoiding catastrophic round-off error.  These algorithms will be adaptive, determining the algorithm parameters based on function data to meet the user-specified error tolerance with rigorous justification. The algorithms will also be asymptotically efficient, requiring essentially the same computational effort as the best possible algorithms.  Function approximation algorithms will be based on the Hilbert-Schmidt SVD decomposition that the investigators have developed for kernel methods.  Integration algorithms will be developed that adaptively determine the sample size required.  The investigators will continue to mentor students as well as post-doctoral scholars and will establish the usefulness of the algorithms under development through collaborations with domain specialists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many mathematical problems involving integration (averages), approximation of functions, and solutions of differential equations, require solutions on a computer because hand calculations cannot provide the answer with sufficient accuracy in a timely manner.  This project has provided new computer algorithms for solving such problems, particularly when the functions involved depend on many variables (inputs).    The focus has been on obtaining solutions both quickly and accurately.  We have developed new algorithms that can accommodate more flexible sampling schemes&mdash;they are not required to sample on a grid.  We have overcome the round-off errors plaguing kernel-based methods so that we can take advantage of their accuracy and flexibility.  We have developed reliable methods for estimating the errors of our algorithms so that they can determine when to stop automatically to meet the user's error requirements without requiring unnecessary computation.  In some cases we have constructed adaptive algorithms where none existed, and in other cases we have constructed algorithms with firmer theoretical foundations than existing ones.  Some of our algorithms arise from a deterministic viewpoint, while others arise from a Bayesian or probabilistic viewpoint.  Each has its advantages.  We have made our new algorithms freely available to the public in the form of open source software.  We have also begun cooperating with other research groups internationally to enable our software libraries to talk to each other.    We have participated in and helped to organized and participated in a number of academic conferences that have brought together faculty, students, and researchers in industry from various disciplines to share our new ideas and learn from each other.  As academic leaders in our own departments we have encouraged junior faculty and promoted a healthy exchange of ideas.   A dozen or so students have been directly mentored in the course of this research project. They have learned about and become involved in computational mathematics research.  They have learned how to construct new algorithms, analyze their performance, and implement them as state-of-the-art computer code.  Undergraduate students involved have gone on to graduate study.  Graduate students have gone on to become key contributors in the financial services industry and as tertiary faculty members.
