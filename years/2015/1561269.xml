<AbstractNarration>Characters used to differentiate the vast diversity of insect species are often available only in primary taxonomic publications, making the specific criteria used for recognizing species difficult to access by individuals outside major research institutions. This is especially true for North American moths (Lepidoptera), within which many species lack scientific names. Natural history collections contain substantial amounts of untapped information concerning North American biodiversity that is largely unavailable to non-scientists. The digital revolution that is allowing the integration of photographic images and associated information permits the availability of information on species diversity along with the criteria used to separate species to anyone with internet access. Moreover, the end-user of such information can make important contributions to the knowledge of our fauna if they are given appropriate information on methods used to characterize species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cornell University Insect Collection (CUIC) includes a major North American moth collection, with extensive representation of moth species from much of the United States, especially the mountain forest habitats of the American southwest. The CUIC Lepidoptera holdings total 1.7 million specimens and are currently stored as four separate, parallel collections. These specimens will be integrated into a single comprehensive moth collection reflecting modern classification and up-to-date nomenclature. The currently parallel collections, housed under cramped and partially unsafe storage conditions, will be rehoused in expanded cabinetry incorporating archival storage materials, ensuring long-term preservation of the specimens and full access to all material by researchers. These tasks will be conducted by undergraduate student employees who will receive training in curation and insect taxonomy. Approximately 8700 adult specimens representing at least 2800 species of North American moths will be photographed along with their associated microscope slide-mounted genitalic preparations. These images with associated label data will be uploaded onto the NSF supported Morphbank website, making all images and information available for moth identification or taxonomic description. Approximately 1500 of the specimens in this special collection have never been assigned to a known, described species, supporting their status as representatives of undescribed, cryptic species.  An M.S. graduate student will conduct thesis research that emphasizes the use of moth anatomical characters for species discrimination and description. This student will also develop short educational videos that explain various aspects of moth taxonomy, including how to collect moths, how to dissect moths, and how to identify and interpret the morphological characters used for moth identification and taxonomic description. These videos will target knowledgeable amateurs of all ages, thereby integrating the substantial community of citizen scientists into a larger effort to understand our moth fauna. The adult and genitalic moth images will be made available at Morphbank (www.morphbank.net) and shared with iDigBio (www.idigbio.org). The internet videos as well as the moth images will be linked to the Cornell University Insect Collection website (cuic.entomology.cornell.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The World&rsquo;s natural history collections hold specimens representing all of Earth&rsquo;s Biodiversity. Given that upwards of 30 million different species share Earth, describing and housing specimens representing Earth&rsquo;s biodiversity is a major challenge. Yet just naming species and storing specimens representing them does not benefit mankind unless the information inherent in those species is made available to all. The digital revolution now allows accurate pictorial images and associated information for the many species on Earth to be shared among all who have a robust and secure internet connection. Our project contributed to increasing access to biodiversity information associated with the Noctuoidea, a diverse group comprising over 70,000 species including tiger moths, cutworms, and tussock moths. The Cornell University Insect Collection benefited greatly through the gift of Professor John G. Franclemont&rsquo;s Lepidoptera collection, which is rich in noctuoid moth species from North America. Prof. Franclemont spent a 50-year research career carefully preparing permanent, excellent quality Canada Balsam microscope slide mounts of moth diagnostic structures associated with their reproductive tracts. This collection includes over 8000 preparations representing more than 2800 species of North American moths. Many specimens are from the highly diverse mountain ranges of Arizona, a biogeographic crossroads where lineages from the eastern and western U.S.A. and Mexico comingle across a biodiversity hotspot. This project endeavored to make this collection available to all, with images and associated locality information made available on the Cornell University Insect Collection website: <a href="https://cuic.entomology.cornell.edu/projects/insect-images/">https://cuic.entomology.cornell.edu/projects/insect-images/</a>. Yet just putting images on-line does little good unless they can be understood and evaluated in the pursuit of biological understanding. To that end we developed instructional videos that will assist dedicated students of Lepidoptera in collecting moths, preparing them as scientific specimens, and dissecting them so that their internal diagnostic structures can be prepared on microscope slide mounts that can be compared to those in the Franclemont research collection and elsewhere. These six DIY Entomology (Lepidoptera) videos&mdash;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIZmoZQbddC2x9gIs3ZY-mQ9k5hvYTQW">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIZmoZQbddC2x9gIs3ZY-mQ9k5hvYTQW</a>&mdash;take the viewer through the basics of moth identification, collecting using a light sheet and bucket trap, and then into dissection and staining techniques that will allow the Lepidoptera student to view the important diagnostic structures used for moth identification. These activities are very important because many moths appear quite similar externally, but can be differentiated by these internal structures that can only be viewed after dissection. Also, new moth species are being discovered continuously because there are many, many moth species and not so many students of Lepidoptera. Many dedicated amateurs make important scientific discoveries in insect systematics, and this project aims to empower all students of moth biodiversity so that they can contribute to the continuing human project of understanding those species that share our Earth. This N.S.F. funded project recognizes that all of us need to collaboratively strive to undertake biodiversity exploration. Those who built the Cornell University Insect Collection recognize that anyone can contribute significant knowledge as long as rigorous scientific principles are employed.
