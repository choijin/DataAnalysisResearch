<AbstractNarration>Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program (I-Corps L), this project will develop ways to increase the scale and impact of educational software for teaching and learning about fuel cells. Fuel cells are very efficient energy conversion devices which could significantly improve the use of clean energy sources. Interactive educational modules were designed, developed, and tested in earlier work at the University of Central Florida. These modules are optimized to educate and train a broad audience which includes K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as engineering professionals to become familiar and better understand the principles of operation of fuel cells. The goal of the proposed scaling and sustaining of educational innovation efforts is to receive and use the support provided by I-Corps Learning program to accelerate the transition of the developed interactive educational software into emerging learning tools; and to increase the impact of this work among different educational institutions and industrial entities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed efforts and development of the software disposition pathways will be built on previously developed educational modules. These modules were tested in a variety of settings including introductory engineering courses, undergraduate engineering thermodynamics and a advance fuel cell systems course. In the I-Corps program, additional end users and potential adopters will be sought among both education entities, such as high schools, charter schools, community colleges, four year undergraduate institutions, as well as universities across the country. With the help of the proposed I-Corps project the educational software will receive additional review and a path that could potentially lead to more widespread adoption will be formulated. Given the important role fuel cells are already playing in global energy systems, the project has the potential to help US students to be well-informed about the opportunities presented by this technology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The main objective of this project was to explore the commercialization opportunities of an interactive and interconnected educational software that could be used to teach undergraduate students about renewable energy technologies. In this case, we are focused on devices known as fuel cells. Fuel cells are highly efficient energy conversion devices that can convert the chemical energy of a fuel into electrical energy, and can be used in both stationary as well as portable applications. As the renewable energy sector is expanding worldwide, it is important to educate current and future generations of engineers and scientists about renewable energy technologies such as fuel cells. Therefore an educational software was made that is both interactive and interconnected to educate students. Although, the software was designed to be used by undergraduate students in engineering or science, it is expected that it could be helpful to spark interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) related fields for high school students as well as that it could be used to train employees in the renewable energy industry. The team participated in I-Corps for Learning program to: (i) learn the lean startup methodology, (ii) how the methodology could be applied to the convert the software from an idea to a commercial market-ready product, (iii) identify the customer segments and identify their needs and wants, also called as value proposition of the product, (iv) understanding the other steps that need to be taken to develop the startup and make the product market ready.</p> <p>In our endeavor, one of the most crucial steps was customer discovery interviews. A customer discovery interview is an informational interview conducted with a potential customer to identify their wants, needs, pains and gains through a series of progressive questions, without actually giving away any information about your product. The idea is here is that instead of telling the customer all about your product and trying to see if they seem convinced to buy your product, you learn all about the customer and their needs and see if the product matches well with what the customer wants. Our potential customers included professors and undergraduate students in engineering and science fields, high school science teachers, people in the renewable industry who are seeking employee training resources, as well as other industry experts.

This will serve a larger market.
