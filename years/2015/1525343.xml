<AbstractNarration>The University of Colorado at Denver, North Dakota State University Fargo, and Florida International University have received an NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Education and Human Resources Design and Development tier award to observe, characterize, and interpret the active learning methods employed in a large sample of Learning Assistant (LA) supported and non-LA supported science courses at the three universities. The research will investigate how active learning methods and undergraduate LA support contribute to the learning gains, achievement, retention, and persistence of over 10,600 Biology students, 8,800 Chemistry students, and 7,600 Physics students during each year of the four-year project. The Project will provide critical evidence on active learning as it 1) examines a large number of students and faculty in three STEM disciplines (Chemistry, Biology, and Physics) at three large public universities, 2) provides deep understanding of how active learning and LA support promotes student success, 3) examines student success through a variety of measures, 4) provides critical insight into the learning of underrepresented/minority (URM) students in STEM, and 5) directly informs the large International Learning Assistant Alliance, which currently consists of fifty-five (55) universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is based on the strong evidence that the implementation of active learning methods in undergraduate science courses can lead to increased student outcomes, including retention and persistence to graduation. It is based also on the evidence that LAs can support the use of active learning methods in the large lecture science courses. While examining the interaction of active learning methods and Learning Assistant support in undergraduate science courses, the PI team will seek answers to the following four research questions: What are the activities employed in undergraduate science courses?  How can these activities be understood in terms of a cognitive process framework?  How are LAs involved in supporting these activities? How does engaging in these activities with and without LA support contribute to student level outcomes? Observational data will be collected at both the course and student levels, using both extant instruments (e.g. the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM) and new student survey instruments that probe student perceptions of instructional effectiveness. In addition student learning outcome data will be gathered using established concept inventories (e.g. the Force Concept Inventory). The results of this work will contribute to our knowledge on student learning and interaction in STEM classrooms and on effective strategies to retain students in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

The project goals were (1) to theoretically frame active learning in the undergraduate science classroom, (1) to characterize active learning tasks, (3) to measure student, LA, and instructor actions in classes, and (4) to quantitatively model the impact of these factors on student outcomes such as course pass rate and concept inventory gains. The data collected over the course of the project included over 47,000 student records from 524 core science courses (183 courses with Learning Assistants and 341 without) at three universities. In addition, observations were conducted of over 320 individual sessions of 57 unique undergraduate science courses that utilized more than 246 Learning Assistants. The three universities are located in different regions of the United States: Florida International University (FIU) in the Southeast, North Dakota State University (NDSU) in the Midwest, and University of Colorado Denver (UCD) in the Mountain West. All are considered large public research universities with high undergraduate enrollment. FIU and UCD are classified as very high research activity and primarily nonresidential, and NDSU is classified as high research activity and primarily residential. FIU is a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI), UCD is an emerging HSI, and NDSU is a predominantly white institution (PWI). As of the conclusion of this award, six peer-reviewed articles have been published and over 30 conference papers and posters have been presented. Major project outcomes were the development and dissemination of theoretical framing for researching undergraduate science teaching and learning, the development and publication of a taxonomy of Learning Assistant actions, the development and dissemination of a framework for assessing the authenticity of instructional tasks, and quantitative models which predict student outcomes from the data collected. The findings from quantitative modeling show that across all three institutions, LA support is associated with increased course pass rates. However, one key finding was that the three institutions are too different to credibly combine into a single statistical analysis. It was found that UCD was the only school with a statistically significant main effect for LAs on pass rates (Odds ratio [95% CI] = 3.203 [1.165,8.808]). In addition, it was found that different variables modified the LA effect (statistically as interaction variables) at each school. At UCD, the LA effect on pass rate was greater for females than it was for males; it was also higher for students with high financial need than it was for students with medium financial need. At NDSU, the LA effect on pass rate was also greater for females than it was for males; it was lower for increasing ACT or SAT scores, but the LA effect increased with a student's age. At FIU, the LA effect on pass rate increased with increasing ACT or SAT, and the LA effect decreased for students with low versus high financial need.</span></strong></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/24/2021<br>      Modified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;Boyer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
