<AbstractNarration>The Logical Journey of the Zoombinis implementation research study examines the development of computational thinking for upper elementary and middle grades students. Computational thinking is the set of ideas and practices considered vital for computer science skills and has been attracting increased attention over the past several years in K-12 education. This project leverages an existing game by embedding tools for studying patterns of students' decision-making and problem solving in the environment. This allows researchers to understand how students learn about computational thinking within a tool that bridges informal and formal learning settings to engage a wide variety of students. The project will also develop tools and resources for classroom teachers. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research examines three questions. First, what strategies do players develop during Zoombinis gameplay that may provide evidence of implicit computational thinking? Second, how can teachers leverage implicit knowledge of computational thinking developed in Zoombinis to improve formal (explicit) learning? Third, how can a large-scale commercial game be used for broad and equitable improvement of computational thinking? The research uses and develops educational data mining techniques to assess students' learning in conjunction with pre-post computational thinking assessments (external to the game), teacher interviews, classroom observations, and case studies of classroom use. The goal is to understand both students' learning of computational thinking and how to bridge the formal and informal learning via classroom implementation of the Zoombinis game.</AbstractNarration>

Pattern Recognition: Learners look for patterns within and across problems or tasks. Pattern Recognition is required for all kinds of sorting and classification tasks, for example, as well as seeing trends in data and other forms of information. Abstraction: Learners abstract, or generalize, rising above the details and seeing the rules that can be applied generally to other situations. Algorithm Design: Learners may express an algorithm, a sequence of instructions or steps required to solve a problem or accomplish a task.      This research had two primary goals:  To establish the validity of game-based learning assessments that used educational data mining (EDM) detectors to measure CT practices in the gameplay, and To understand the teaching and gameplay conditions that promoted the development of CT practices in Zoombinis classrooms.      Teachers kept and shared records of their classroom activities related to Zoombinis and CT during the study period, dedicating at least 10 hours of class-time to these activities. We collected these records, along with data logs from each students’ gameplay and characteristic data about students and classes (e.g. demographics and grade level).
