<AbstractNarration>This grant funds participation of academics for an interagency workshop on Computational Science &amp; Engineering Software Sustainability and Productivity Challenges (CSESSP Challenges), which will take place on Oct 15-16.  See  https://www.nitrd.gov/csessp/.   Government agencies that fund and develop software for Computational Science &amp; Engineering are concerned that planning for software pays attention mostly to the initial development of software and not for the operation, maintenance and ongoing sustainability.  Computational Science &amp; Engineering software often demand decades of useful life, thus these factors are of utmost importance.  The productivity and sustainability issues impede the advancement of computation science and engineering, which is important to US competitiveness.  The workshop will involve a diverse set of participants from different sectors and regions and will pay attention to Inclusion of under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

Areas of discussion in the workshop included: characterization of the emerging sustainability and productivity crisis from laptops to extreme-scale systems; software as a critical national infrastructure and as a virtual facility for computational science and engineering; new approaches to scientific software that significantly improve sustainability and productivity including leveraging software engineering research; understanding the economics of computational science and engineering software and opportunities and new models of partnership between academia, independent software vendors, the manufacturing industry and government; encouraging and developing software ecosystems to support and advance sustained scientific innovation and discovery; supporting and leveraging changes in computing technologies, science methods and algorithms; understanding how software tools can contribute to sustainability &amp; productivity; and supporting and encouraging computational science and engineering software user and developer communities; education and building a computational science and engineering software workforce.  Following the workshop, later phases of the project including an activity to explore how the robustness and effectiveness of scientific software could benefit from the adoption of cutting edge tools and approaches in software engineering, and understanding the challenges (both social and technical) of building connections between these communities.
