<AbstractNarration>This grant will provide travel support to U.S. based graduate students to attend IEEE GLOBECOM 2015 to be held in San Diego on 6 - 10 Dec 2015. IEEE GLOBECOM is a premier international conference for the dissemination of state-of-the-art communications and networking technologies and identifying future directions in the research and development areas. It is one of two flagship conferences of the IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc), together with IEEE ICC. This grant encourages participation by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Women and minorities will be especially encouraged to apply. NSF support is used exclusively to fund a group travel grant to subsidize junior researchers. No NSF funds are used to conduct the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year IEEE GLOBECOM attracts about 3,000 submitted scientific papers and attracts roughly 2,000 leading scientists, researchers and industry practitioners from all around the world. IEEE GLOBECOM is therefore one of the most significant scientific events of the networking and communications community, a must-attend event for scientists, researchers and networking practitioners from industry and academia. It offers not only technical paper presentations but also a wide range of other educational formats, including panels, tutorials, industry presentations, posters and keynote speeches by academic and industry leaders. This student travel support will enable sharing scientific information and stimulating research interests for U.S. based students in the field of communications and networking.</AbstractNarration>
