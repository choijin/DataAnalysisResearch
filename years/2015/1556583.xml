<AbstractNarration>Abundant and diverse fungi live inside healthy leaves of all trees. These 'fungal endophytes' (endo, inside; phyte, plant) can be important in enhancing plant health under stressful conditions. However, the factors that shape the diverse communities of endophytes found in different plant species are not well understood. This project's overall goal is to integrate fungal endophytes into our understanding of tropical plant ecology, with a special focus on the relationships among leaf traits, plant productivity, and the ability of plants to defend against insects and pathogens that attack leaves.  Improving our understanding of fungal endophytes is important since they influence plant productivity and resistance to environmental stresses such as drought and disease, including for plants of economic importance. Results will facilitate use of endophytes in mitigating plant responses to a rapidly changing world, with potential applications in sustainable agriculture and forest management.  This project will also support the training of undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary research, including students of under-represented groups, provide mentored research experiences for K-12 teachers and for high school students, and contribute to public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the context of tropical forests, where leaf traits and endophytes are highly diverse, this project will test the hypotheses that (1) endophyte communities in leaves vary in relation to leaf traits associated with growth vs. persistence strategies; (2) endophytes will influence leaf and plant functions; (3) contribution of endophytes to plant defense will vary as a function of leaf traits; and (4) understanding growth vs. persistence strategies of plants can be informed greatly by integration of these foliar symbionts. The research approach involves field observations and experiments as well as bioassays. A field experiment is planned where endophyte communities are manipulated in 12 focal species. Additionally, leaves from these same 12 species will be introduced to leaf cutter ants to test whether longer lifespan species are less attractive to leaf cutter ants, and whether this will be mediated by endophyte load. Furthermore, pathogens will be introduced to the 12 focal species to assay if damage will be lower in leaves with high endophyte loads.</AbstractNarration>

Leaves from different tree species have characteristics that are associated with a long life (thick and tough) or a short life (thin and easy to puncture). Endophytes from leaves of tropical trees have high levels of diversity, and we predicted that leaf characteristics would determine what species of endophytes would be found. We collected leaves, measured their characteristics, and used genomic techniques to describe their endophyte communities. We also did manipulative experiments where leaves were created with and without endophytes, then challenged by an herbivore and a pathogen. &nbsp;We found that leaf characteristics did determine which endophytes were present in leaves. In particular, the amount of carbon and the density of leaf tissue, or leaf mass per unit area, was associated with endophyte communities. Through our experimental work, we found that for some tree species, having endophytes changed some of the leaves? characteristics, like leaf mass per unit area. Likewise, the effects of endophyte presence on pathogen and herbivore damage were tree species specific. In sum, we showed that understanding leaf characteristics can help determine the groups or Orders of endophytes most likely to be found.&nbsp;</p> <p>This research also accomplished broader impacts with regard to training, education and broadening participation. Four Ph.D. students, three undergraduates and three biology teachers travelled to Panama and received training as part of this project. Three of the Ph.D. students are Latino and one is hearing impaired. The Ph.D. students learned many new skills in genomics that will serve to train the future workforce in life sciences. For example, one graduate student has earned his degree and is now employed by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The high school biology teachers created blog posts about their experiences that are present on the project website, and the project participants visited the classrooms of the teachers after their experience to meet their students. In addition, the investigators held STEM workshops for middle school students from New Orleans. This included outreach to many young students that are minorities in STEM.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2020<br>      Modified by: Sunshine&nbsp;Van Bael</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606763179486_545d8b4a-812a-4f56-accb-28c3c2f4fea7--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606763179486_545d8b4a-812a-4f56-accb-28c3c2f4fea7--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Worker ant"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606763179486_545d8b4a-812a-4f56-accb-28c3c2f4fea7--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Worker ant"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A leafcutter ant worker curls the leaf before cutting a section to carry back to her underground fungal garden.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sunshine Van Bael</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sunshine&nbsp;Van Bael</div> <div class="imageTitle">Worker ant</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606763036944_IMG_2848--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606763036944_IMG_2848--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ant observations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606763036944_IMG_2848--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ant observations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Undergraduate, Ally Martin, observes as leaf-cutter ants enter the area where she has placed an endophyte-inoculated and not inoculated leaf.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sunshine Van Bael</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sunshine&nbsp;Van Bael</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ant observations</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606763112407_a1b38a74-48b6-4422-854e-57508df5ff0d--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606763112407_a1b38a74-48b6-4422-854e-57508df5ff0d--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ant choice arena"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606763112407_a1b38a74-48b6-4422-854e-57508df5ff0d--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ant choice arena"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image shows what the choice arenas looked like - one leaf with and without endophytes was offered to ants and they decided where to cut.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sunshine Van Bael</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sunshine&nbsp;Van Bael</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ant choice arena</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606762940739_IMG_2550--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606762940739_IMG_2550--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Inoculating plants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606762940739_IMG_2550--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Inoculating plants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Graduate student, Bolivar Aponte Rolon, adds rainwater to plants that will spend the night in the forest, accumulating endophytes from sporefall.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sunshine Van Bael</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sunshine&nbsp;Van Bael</div> <div class="imageTitle">Inoculating plants</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606763269780_IMG_2873--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606763269780_IMG_2873--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pathogen inoculation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556583/1556583_10418979_1606763269780_IMG_2873--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pathogen inoculation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This shows how plugs of pathogen spores were clipped onto leaves with and without endophyte inoculation.
