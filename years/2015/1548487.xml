<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is of such scope and diversity it can be difficult to capture.  Over the coming decades passive UHF RFID will become a pervasive technology, not just in industrial, manufacturing, commercial, and retail operations but in the everyday lives of ordinary people.  As passive UHF RFID makes its way into homes and appliances to help automate and simplify peoples' lives, the Gen2 readers must simultaneously have excellent dense reader performance and be small, inexpensive, and low power.  The impact of this project includes a deeper understanding of polar transmitter application in UHF radios, in particular the achievable efficiency, linearity, and spectral purity in a pure switch mode envelope amplifier with no linear assistance.  By focusing on GaN devices for all class-D envelope switching and class-E RF switching this project may be used as a step toward a true single chip, high output power UHF RFID reader using GaN-on-Si integrated circuit techniques.  Such a low power, high performance reader chip would be an enabling component needed for the ubiquitous deployment of passive UHF RFID in the IoT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on improving the power efficiency of the radio frequency power amplifier (RFPA) for ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) readers.  In particular, the passive UHF RFID protocol known as ?Gen2? constitutes a substantial percentage of the Internet of Things (IoT), since most of the network?s endpoints do not have radio capabilities and will rely on Gen2 tags to be part of the network.  A pervasive deployment of Gen2 infrastructure in retail, manufacturing, and distribution centers may require hundreds of readers in a single facility.  Current technology requires expensive, bulky, power hungry RFID readers.  The objective of the research is to develop a proof of concept for a new polar transmitter demonstrating nearly 85% reduction in the dissipated heat of the reader RFPA.  The new RFPA architecture will employ a novel modulation format with continuously differentiable amplitude and phase signals enabling a pure switch mode polar RFPA while maintaining full time and frequency domain Gen2 dense reader compliance.  The anticipated results are efficiency, linearity, and spurious noise performance tradeoffs given design parameters of the class D switch mode envelope amplifier and class E switch mode polar RFPA output stage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Passive ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) allows wireless inventory and tracking of objects using tiny transponders costing around 10 cents each and requiring no battery.  This technology promises breakthrough levels of automation in diverse industries such as retail, logistics, manufacturing, home automation, as well as in the consumer space.  The primary obstacle to widespread RFID adoption is the cost of the RFID readers, which are the scanning devices needed to read the transponders, or "tags" as they are commonly called.  The principle component driving the cost of RFID readers is the transmitter, specifically the power amplifier.  Conventional designs use highly linear but very inefficient amplifiers to meet the stringent frequency emission masks.  This is crucially important in large scale RFID infrastructure projects such as distribution centers, retail stores, and factories.  These types of environments are commonly referred to as "dense reader environments" because they require many RFID readers to operate simultaneously.  The stringent frequency emission masks are required so the readers do not interfere with one another in dense reader environments.  Clairvoyant Technology has a patent pending RFID transmitter design which generates the same high fidelity RFID signals using switch mode power amplifiers.  Unlike today?s conventional linear RFID amplifiers with typical power efficiencies around 30% to 33%, these new switch mode RFID amplifiers promise power efficiencies over 70% while being "digital" &ndash; effectively providing an integration path toward single chip, very low cost, high performance passive UHF RFID readers. The goal of this NSF Phase 1 SBIR research was to demonstrate that the power consumption of the RFPA can be dramatically reduced using this switch-mode power amplifiers.  Proof-of-concept (POC) prototype polar transmitters for passive UHF RFID readers were designed, built, and evaluated.  The polar transmitter concept is to factor a transmit signal into its amplitude and phase components (a "polar representation", as in high school mathematics).  The amplitude component is sent through a class-D "envelope amplifier".  The envelope amplifier output modulates a class-E radio frequency (RF) power stage whose RF drive is phase modulated with the signal?s phase component.  The class-D envelope amplifier and class-E RF power stage are both switch mode devices which can in theory reach very high efficiency levels.  There are numerous challenges:  High switching speeds required for both class-D and class-E require use of emerging semiconductor technology such as Gallium Nitride (GaN)  The envelope modulated signal and phase modulated drive signal must recombine in precisely time-aligned fashion at the class-E stage to avoid severe distortion The polar transmitter requires very low spurious noise from the class-D amplifier.  Several techniques are used to mitigate noise    Very high resolution pulse width modulation techniques Sigma-Delta noise shaping Multi-phase class-D converters     OUTCOMES  Efficiency:  Five different class-E RF power stages where evaluated.  The class-E power stages achieved power efficiencies as high as 73%.  While some expensive devices were used, most of the prototypes focused on cost effective GaN which would provide commercially viable solutions for RFID readers.  Indeed, two of these designed were among the highest efficiencies.   Two different class-D envelope amplifiers were evaluated.  The first design was limited by switching speed of the power devices had power efficiency in the mid 40% range.  The second class-D design yielded 83% efficiency.   Performance: The overall power efficiency is measured as the cascade of the class-D and class-E amplifiers.  This was slightly over 60% with the final topology.  The spectral performance was also measured.  Spurious emissions due to class-D switch noise was excellent: within limits for both FCC and ETSI regulatory environments.  However, close in spectral components need additional effort to fully satisfy market requirements.  The fundamental limitation in this respect was the use of an off-the-shelf power controller to drive the class-D amplifier.  During the rapid prototyping, critical limitations of the device were uncovered.  While some compromises and work-arounds were sufficient to demonstrate feasibility, we believe fully custom signal generation is need to satisfy the entire set of system requirements.  A major question in the proposal was whether a pure class-D amplifier could be used.  This design promises the highest efficiency, but the majority of research papers examine using a hybrid linear-switch mode solution to meet the bandwidth and noise suppression requirements of a polar transmitter.  The research results here have definitively resolved that a two-phase class-D switching envelope amplifier can perform well with a correctly designed output filter and switching frequency.   Conclusion:  The wasted power in today's UHF RFID readers increases system cost in the power supply and mechanical packaging subsystems.  If RFID is to reach a tipping point of commercial adoption, the RFID reader cost, size, and power consumption must be dramatically reduced.  This Phase 1 SBIR research has demonstrated transmit signal generation at 60.6% power efficiency, twice that of today?s readers. This reduction in heat and power will have a direct impact on size and system cost.        Last Modified: 01/30/2017       Submitted by: Thomas Frederick]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
