<AbstractNarration>1512417  Bartoli, Filbert J.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will fabricate a new sensor array that will analyze secretory function of immune cells at a single cell.  It is believed by scientists that such understanding is important in understanding an important part of human physiology, the immune response. The impact of a successful complete of the project will be new data on how immune cells behave, and that could potentially be used in understanding diseases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a sensing platform that possesses the temporal and spatial resolution required for dynamic, multiplexed sensing of secretory function of immune cells at the single-cell level.  Intellectual Merit: Nanoplasmonic interferometric sensor arrays will be designed and fabricateed at predefined locations in a microfluidic platform, with careful alignment of functionalized surfaces for multiplexed biomolecular detection and for dynamic multiplexed sensing of single cells. Nanoplasmonic interferometric sensors is expected to exhibit two orders of magnitude greater spatial resolution than currentmethods, and two orders of magnitude lower detection limit than nanohole array plasmonic sensors with comparable spatial resolution. The microfluidic biosensing platform will be integrated with the interferometric sensor arrays for monitoring the single cell dynamic secretion pattern of three cytokines (IL-10, MMP-9 and IFN-gamma) from sixteen LPS-stimulated macrophages. These data are useful in the understanding of the dynamics and heterogeneity of immune response. It will advance the fundamental understanding of immunological function, and potentially impact development of new diagnostics and therapeutics for infection, inflammation, and autoimmune disease. Broader Impacts: Integration of research and education is a high priority of the proposed research, which will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student training, giving them access to new entirely instrumentation for interdisciplinary laboratory experiences. The research will contribute to new course development and directly impact the undergraduate curriculum. The investigators will actively participate in ongoing K-12 outreach programs focused on underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
