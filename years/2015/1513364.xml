<AbstractNarration>Biochemical reaction networks are the fundamental engines of life, giving rise to biological processes ranging from photosynthesis to digestion.  The objective of this research is to analyze such networks endowed with mass-action kinetics.  These dynamical systems model various biological mechanisms, and they will be studied using algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial methods.  The investigator  is pursuing the following aims directly related to reaction networks: (1) determining how the combinatorial geometry of a given reaction network informs the long-term dynamics of the resulting dynamical system, (2) classifying and analyzing multistationary reaction networks, and (3) parametrizing multistationarity in post-translational modification systems (important signaling motifs in biology) using techniques from real algebraic geometry such as real root counting.  In a fourth research direction, the investigator is analyzing Grobner bases of certain elimination ideals with the aim of developing criteria for identifiability, which is the question of whether parameters can be uniquely recovered from data.  This investigation will occur both in the context of quasi-steady-state approximations in chemical reaction systems and in the setting of graphical models in algebraic statistics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to provide new insights about the dynamical behavior of medically relevant biochemical reaction networks. Indeed, the reaction systems studied in this research are widely used models for biomolecular activities; examples include pharmacological models of drug interaction, signal transduction models, and enzymatic mechanisms.  In particular, this research will yield insight into the long-term behavior of reaction systems and provide a better understanding of multistationary networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was inspired by the following biological question: How do cells communicate and make decisions?  More specifically, how do cells use biochemical reactions to transmit and store information?  The investigator pursued hree topics in this direction: multistationarity (which is closely related to the capacity for storing information), persistence (the question of whether the chemical reactions will result in any components "dying out"), and identifiability (whether experiments can reveal the speeds at which certain reactions take place).  A summary of the results achieved in this project are as follows.  First, new methods were developed that guarantee that a network is multistationary. This revealed that the "Newton polytope" of a network (a polytope is a generalization of a 2-dimensional triangle or rectangle, or a 3-dimensional pyramid or cube) plays a key role, and this new insight will guide future research in this direction. Second, the investigator proved that certain reaction networks, post-translational modification networks (which cells use in a crucial way to transmit information), are persistent and in fact "globally convergent", a homeostasis-type property so that even when after environmental changes the system settles back into the prior equilibrium. This confirmed an observation in the experimental literature and gave insight into what types of networks can store more complicated information.  Finally, new classes of networks (which are also called "linear compartment models") were proven be identifiable.  Additionally in this setting, for the general question of which linear compartment models are identifiable (a crucial question with pharmaceutical applications), we now have an improved formulation of this question that only uses areas of mathematics, specifically, combinatorics and linear algebra, for which there is efficient computational software.  Therefore, going forward, this new formulation will likely yield more answers to the identifiability question.  As for the broader impacts of this project, the research provided new insights about the dynamical behavior of medically relevant biochemical reaction networks.  Additionally, the investigator served as a research mentor for one (female) postdoc, one graduate student, and one (female) undergraduate student &mdash; thereby supporting the future STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) workforce.
