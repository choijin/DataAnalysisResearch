<AbstractNarration>The relatively flat southeastern US coastal plain, from North Carolina to Texas, is particularly susceptible to sea level rise. As sea level rises, the boundary between the low-lying coastal freshwater forest and high marsh moves upslope. Highly productive forested wetlands are replaced successively by degraded wetlands and eventually by coastal salt marsh. Not only does saltwater intrusion change vegetation composition, high halide levels (called halogens) can interact with the large pool of soil organic matter through halogenation processes that are still poorly understood.  These halogenation processes are important to elucidate as they produce volatile halocarbons that act as ozone-depleting compounds in the atmosphere. Halogenation of organic matter may also affect the decomposition rates of organic matter. This interdisciplinary research will improve our understanding of chlorine and bromine biogeochemistry and demonstrate the importance of halogens in carbon cycling. This collaborative research represents a new collaboration between four investigators with different specialties from universities in the northeast, southeast and western United States. Graduate and undergraduate students will have opportunities to interact with citizen scientists in an on-going EarthWatch project and learn how to disseminate the scientific knowledge to the general public.  This study will also raise the awareness of the impacts of sea level rise on low-lying coastal areas in the Southeastern US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halogens have historically been treated as inert elements in natural humification processes.  However, numerous recent studies have demonstrated that chlorine and bromine are active components in C cycles. The overall goal of this research is to assess novel decomposition process routes of terrestrial organic matter in forested wetlands with high levels of chloride and bromide. The research project includes both field investigations and controlled experiments to determine the impacts of sea level rise on C and halogen biogeochemical cycles along salinity gradients in Winyah Bay, South Carolina.  Fluxes of halogenated ozone depleting C compounds and greenhouse gases, as well as concentrations of organochlorine and organobromine in soil and litter and water will be quantified along salinity transects and within controlled plots. The research team contends that the novel method of determining X-ray absorption near edge structures (XANES) of halogenated organic matter in soil and detritus layers, coupled with measurements of halocarbon emission and composition in water using Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), will be useful in understanding the roles of halogens in C cycling. Determining the seasonal variation of halocarbon in air, soil, and water from freshwater forested wetland, salt-degraded wetland, and salt marsh sites, representing the transition of coastal wetland under sea level rise, will be useful in developing a mechanistic and landscape understanding of how sea level rise affects decomposition, humification, and halogenation processes of terrestrial organic matter in coastal wetlands. The controlled field experiments using different concentrations of chloride and bromide waters would illustrate their roles in humification and decomposition processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over 30 million acres of low-lying coastal wetlands in southeastern US, from Texas to North Carolina, have been slowly inundated with saltwater and will convert from freshwater forested wetland to salt marsh in the next century due to rising sea level.  As part of this process, forested freshwater wetlands become degraded wetlands, also known as "ghost forests" owing to the stands of dead trees.  This intermediate region is a transition zone where organic rich soils are exposed to saltwater.  Biological and chemical reactions can create both methane (greenhouse gases) and halomethanes (stratospheric ozone depleting compounds).  We measured emissions of halocarbons and greenhouse gases from a degraded wetland near Winyah Bay (33&deg;16’29’’N, 70&deg;14’43’’W), South Carolina, and compared with adjacent salt marsh and freshwater forest ecosystems.  The overall goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the effects of sea level rise on organic matter halogenation, litter decomposition and carbon turnover.  Key findings include:  1) degraded wetlands are large net sources of chloroform and greenhouse gases; 2) chloroform emissions from degraded wetlands are influenced by fluctuating soil water levels associated with the flooding and draining of the terrain; 3) soil chloroform emissions are the result of chemical interactions between organic matter and halides, and not necessarily mediated by soil microbes;  and 4) chloroform emissions are temperature dependent, meaning that emissions increase in a warmer climate, drawing a link between climate change and stratospheric ozone recovery.   This portion of the collaborative research project supported the professional development of three graduate students, and 13 undergraduate student researchers.  It involved a partnership between University of California at Berkeley, Clemson University in South Carolina, and Princeton University in New Jersey.  Research was presented in 3 international conference presentations and 3 peer-reviewed publications, with many others emanating from the overarching collaborative project (see reports from Clemson and Princeton).   Outreach efforts included co-teaching a Communicating Ocean Sciences course, hands-on science demonstrations at Cal Day (the UC Berkeley open house), and public school presentations.
