<AbstractNarration>Animals can play key roles in freshwater ecosystems by converting food resources into waste products that affect the cycling of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Previous research has focused on the ecological importance of dissolved wastes (e.g. ammonium and phosphate) from animals, termed excreta, because these wastes are nutrient-rich and readily bioavailable to plants and bacteria. However, animals also produce substantial amounts of particulate wastes, termed feces. For example, leaf-shredding stream invertebrates convert plant litter into fine particulate feces that can be subsequently transported downstream, broken down, or consumed by other animals. Feces may vary widely in attributes depending on diet and the source animal, suggesting species-specific roles of animal feces in larger functioning of ecosystems. In this project, researchers will explore factors influencing attributes of animal feces and compare the impact of feces on nutrient cycling to that of excreta in stream ecosystems. This project will benefit society by contributing novel information about the importance of animals in ecosystems and providing career development for multiple undergraduates and one graduate student. Results can help guide management of human activities that drive changes in animal species distribution and nutrient pollution in freshwaters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will employ a combination of laboratory experiments and field surveys to assess controls, fates, and the significance of animal egesta (feces) in stream ecosystems. Dominant grazing and shredding macroinvertebrates from multiple species will be brought to the laboratory, fed diets of low or high nutrient content, and their egesta collected to characterize size and chemical binding as well as measure rates of microbial decomposition and nutrient leaching, uptake, and mineralization over the course of several months. Recurrent surveys of an Ozark headwater stream will quantify total excretion and egestion of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus by extant macroinvertebrates and compare these animal fluxes to background stocks and fluxes of dissolved nutrients (in the case of excreta) and fine particulate organic matter (in the case of egesta). All findings will be synthesized for modeling of how variation in background nutrient concentrations, animal community composition, and background stocks and fluxes of dissolved and particulate elements can affect the roles of animals in stream ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>

As the closing research of his doctoral dissertation, this project addressed the diversity and importance of animal wastes in aquatic ecosystems.

The goal of this work was to better understand how animals affect nutrient cycling in freshwaters.</strong></p> <p><strong>Halvorson&rsquo;s laboratory work (Figures 1-2 below) was a long-term study of breakdown of feces from three common animal species, which will help predict the persistence of feces in the environment after production by the source animal. He also measured leaching, uptake and release of nutrients by feces, which provides information about effects of feces on dissolved nutrients in streams. For example, feces may remove or release nutrients like nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate in the environment, but these processes remain poorly understood. Findings from the laboratory suggest that key properties of feces &ndash; including nutrient content, decomposition, and nutrient uptake &ndash; vary across animal species. Other key findings include (1) additional evidence that aquatic invertebrate feces break down very slowly, taking months to years for microbial breakdown, and (2) feces may serve as substantial &ldquo;sinks&rdquo; to remove dissolved nutrients (especially nitrate) from the environment during decomposition, possibly due to microbial uptake.

Much as feces breakdown and nutrient uptake vary across animal species, Halvorson and undergraduate student researchers found excretion and feces production rates vary across animal species in the field. Ultimately, Halvorson and collaborators will tie together results from the laboratory and field to understand how different animal species affect processing and transport of nutrients in headwater streams.
