<AbstractNarration>Building Interdisciplinary Capacity for Understanding and Supporting Computer Supported Collaborative Learning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data science techniques have revolutionized many academic fields and led to terrific gains in the commercial sector. They have to date been underutilized in solving critical problems in the US educational system, particularly in understanding Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and increasing retention for students traditionally underserved in STEM. The goals of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources through the Critical Techniques and Technologies for Advancing Foundations and Applications of Big Data Science &amp; Engineering (BIGDATA) program are to advance fundamental understanding of key questions in the field, and catalyze the use of data science in Education Research. Collaboration has a long history of research and a solid research base. However, the work is hampered by the difficulty of replicating or aggregating results due to the standard research methods used in the field. The current standard practice in collaboration research is to record student activity on audio or video, create qualitative coding schemes, and code the data by hand. This is labor intensive and prone to personal judgment and error. This project will investigate the use of data mining and learning analytics to overcome this challenge of aggregation and accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the proposal is to conduct a series of workshops to catalyze the community of researchers investigating the effects of collaboration by introducing and investigating the best uses of learning analytics and data mining techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  One outcome of this project is a common, shared language for talking about different aspects of collaborative learning that can be helpful conducting, reporting, and comparing research on collaborative learning. It can help researchers situate or advance their work through using existing coding schemes as a shared way of talking about collaboration. The cross-disciplinary perspectives gained from from computer scientists helped learning researchers in understanding collaborative learning models, what a vision of Adaptive Collaborative Learning Support (ACLS) might look like for learning scientists, and the kinds of data needed to provide good ACLS to students and teachers. The project synthesized how cross-disciplinary collaborative learning researchers conceptualized high-quality collaboration and indicators of lesser quality. Such efforts can help to increase understanding among these different research communities and help different stakeholders in the Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) community design for (and study) collaborative learning.  This project identified three specific qualities, and core practices of those qualities, that are associated with productive collaborative learning: task management and regulation, collective meaning-making, and socio-emotional regulation.  The core practices for productive collaboration in task management include:   balanced task participation, in which group members take on equal shares of the work and responsibility for its completion, ensuring that all have equal access to important materials;   high quality cognitive strategy use, in which group members use different strategies to ensure that desired domain methods and techniques are carried out; and   positive interdependence in which group members depend on each other for developing and refining ideas for the project and that the task not split up and completed by isolated individuals.    The core practices for productive collaboration in collective meaning-making include:    disciplinary engagement, in which group members collectively think about and discuss important domain concepts;   balanced verbal participation, in which group members contribute equally to collective meaning making process such that no member or members are dominating verbal discourse or are largely inactive during conversation; and    high quality socio-cognitive strategy use, in which group members use different strategies to ensure that ideas are shared, elaborated, analyzed, and checked for understanding.    Finally, the core practices for productive collaboration in Socio-emotional interactions include:    emotional engagement, in which group members are invested in the well being of the group, its members, and the project;    mutual respect, in which group members treat each other, their ideas, and their efforts with esteem; and    high quality social strategy use in which group members use different strategies to ensure that all members feel that their ideas are valued, that they can admit when they do not understand something, and  their mistakes will be seen opportunities to learn.   Finally, the project led to thinking of ACLS as an equity issue to provide access to collaborative learning to a broader range of students. Considering ACLS as an equity issue to provide access to ambitious forms of collaborative learning has potential to serve underserved students and support their teachers in bringing reform models of teaching to learners who don?t usually have those opportunities. We conclude that if educational equity is defined as equitable access to ambitious collaborative practices that CSCL?s understanding of scripts and scaffolding has the potential for unique and useful contributions to educational equity projects.
