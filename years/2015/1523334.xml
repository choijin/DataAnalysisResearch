<AbstractNarration>Stratigraphy is one of the classic disciplines of geology.  The stratigraphic record, assembled from outcrops of sedimentary rocks, provided the basis for the concept of "Deep Time", was the foundation for the Geologic Time Scale, and revealed the often-dramatic events in the history of the Earth and life upon it.  Stratigraphy is fundamental in the exploration and development of Earth's energy resources with petroleum, natural gas, and coal having formed over time in sedimentary rocks. Stratigraphers have meticulously described and sampled the sedimentary rocks where they are exposed in surface outcrops or penetrated by well borings.  Unfortunately, much of that information is not readily accessible.  It is scattered worldwide through a great range of local, regional and national publications, in the files of public and private organizations, and in the personal records of a multitude of geologists.  Little of it has been placed in computer based, publicly accessible repositories.  The time is now to initiate a program of vouchering (archiving) stratigraphic information as it is produced and to compile information gathered in the past.  The purpose of the Joint ICS-NSF Workshop "Vouchering the Stratigraphic Record" is to develop the plans for initiating this decades-long program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stratigraphers have measured and sampled stratigraphic sections worldwide for 150 years. The information gained provided a wealth of evidence for reconstructing Earth"s history and investigating its major events.  Information continues to be gathered in ongoing investigations that involve a great diversity of often-integrated methods that allow for fundamentally new scientific questions to be addressed.  Unfortunately, a most significant part of the wealth of information generated is not readily accessible to the current community of stratigraphers, and neither is much of the new data being gathered today.  Instead, it is dispersed through a great range of publications and files, electronic and hardcopy, personal and public, worldwide.  And much of the legacy data is lost from one generation of stratigraphers to the next.  This loss seriously limits modern studies of the stratigraphic record and results in a science that is fragmented among various, diverse disciplines or methods, specialists and geographic regions.  The solution is for the international community of stratigraphers to establish a publicly accessible stratigraphic repository for all data generated in ongoing and future investigations worldwide and eventually to place legacy data in the repository.   To initiate such an ambitious, long-term project requires considerable thought and planning.   Accordingly, the proposed ICS-NSF Workshop: Vouchering the Stratigraphic Record is to bring together an international group of experienced stratigraphers representing the full range specialties in order to fully consider all important aspects of initiating this long term project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Stratigraphy is one of the classic disciplines of geology.  The stratigraphic record, i.e. successions of sedimentary rocks and their contents, particularly fossils, provided the basis for the concept of "Deep Time", was the foundation for the Geologic Time Scale, and revealed the often-dramatic events in the history of the Earth and life upon it.  Stratigraphy is fundamental in the exploration and development of EarthÆs energy and mineral resources, and it provides the historical basis for understanding the response of the Earth system to current anthropogenic impact.  Stratigraphers have rigorously measured and meticulously sampled stratigraphic sections for 150 years.  They have collected information on the lithological succession and the paleontological, chemical, and magnetic signals within successions worldwide, and these informations serves as evidence of changes in the Earth system, particularly surface environments, over the 4.5 billion year rock record.  Unfortunately, much of that information is not readily accessible.  It is scattered worldwide through a great range of local, regional and national publications, in the files of public and private organizations, and in the personal records of a multitude of geologists.  Little of it has been placed in computer based, publically accessible repositories.  The time is now to initiate a program of vouchering (archiving) stratigraphic information as it is produced and to compile information gathered in the past.  This will require importing stratigraphic information into one or more easily queried databases and standardizing methods of data acquisition and entry.  Such a project is ambitious.  It would be a major undertaking with no end station, but the effort must begin.  In order to plan the initiation of this project, a two-day workshop (July 24-25, 2015), supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation was held in Graz, Austria, July 19-23, 2015.  It included 34 participants with 16 from the United States, 9 from China, and the remained from Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The goal of the workshop was to develop a plan of initiation for the project "Vouchering the Stratigraphic Record".  Factors that were addressed include 1) the nature and location of the database to use, 2) standardization of data to be included, 3) the great variety of stratigraphic information to be entered, 4) steps to begin acquiring data to be entered in the database, 5) steps necessary to include the entire stratigraphic community in the project, and 6) the organizational structure.  Selection of the Geobiodiversity Database at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology (Chinese Academy of Sciences was selected as the site of the database.  The International Commission on Stratigraphy will require its subcommissions to input stratigraphic information into the database as that information is acquired during investigation of candidate stratigraphic sections for GSSPs (Global Stratotype Points and Sections), which define the boundaries of the units of the International Chronostratigraphic Chart that, in turn, serves as the basis of the Geologic Time Scale.
