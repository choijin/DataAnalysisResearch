<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a stem cell-based platform to screen drugs for treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).  The global economic burden of heart failure is a staggering $110B per year, touching the lives of nearly everyone. Stem cell-derived disease models enable us to innovate in the heart failure space in a way that has not been possible before.  The ability to generate induced pluripotent stem cells from normal and diseased populations will enable the development of authentic preclinical disease models. These cell lines will contribute to a better understanding of cardiac disease, and will expedite the development of new and better drugs to treat the disease. This platform also will enable the understanding of cardio-toxic impact of any drug, which is a major problem for drug attrition in clinical trials.  The market potential for novel drug discovery, which is enabled by this technology, allows access to the multi-billion dollar drug discovery market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to establish the technical foundation for an in-vitro platform to screen for drugs to treat HCM. The goal is to address how select therapies with known results in animal models affect the morphology and function of cardiomyocytes generated from a library of clinically defined HCM genotypes. Preliminary results have demonstrated that the cardiomyocyte models mimic disease phenotypes, and that these phenotypes can be partially rescued. The work in this project will build on these preliminary findings and move the platform from an academic interest into an industrial technology. As with any new platform, developing standard processes can be a barrier for adoption, especially when that technology involves the complexity inherent in biological systems. The plan is to adapt high content imaging and multi-electrode array technologies to assess structural characteristics, calcium cycling, and electromechanical functions of the cardiomyocytes. Then, the platform will be used to screen a set of 11 drugs for their ability to rescue disease phenotypes. This work will demonstrate that the cardiac disease models are a valid preclinical drug screening technology to evaluate genotype-specific therapy for treatment of HCM.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The goal of this SBIR Phase 1 project is to establish the technical foundation for using patient derived iPSCs for drug screening by developing a suite of induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) derived from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients and establishing screening assays capable of identifying drug candidates that attenuate disease phenotypes.    Task 1: Compare the molecular and functional properties of iPSC-CMs derived from HCM patients with clinically known HCM mutations and their corresponding controls.    1A. The first aim of this task is to establish disease phenotypes for the iPSC-CMs selected for the study. We compare the molecular and functional properties of the disease iPSC-CMs to the corresponding control by measuring cell size, myofibrillar organization, electrophysiological functions, calcium cycling and contractile functions.     1B. The second aim of this task is to analyze the gene expression profiles of the HCM disease models and their controls to discover new HCM markers or new targets for therapeutics explorations.     Task 2: Rescue disease phenotypes with compound screen. It is the goal of this project to show that the HCM iPSC platform can be used to screen for compounds that attenuate and rescue the identified disease phenotypes.    We have successfully generated a panel of iPSCs derived from patients with inherited hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In addition, we generated a matched panel of isogenic controls using precision genome editing. All lines were successfully differentiated into highly pure (&gt;80%) iPSC-CMs preparations.  The most significant finding in our study was the discovery that HCM lines showed altered expression levels of genes involved in the hypertrophic response.  Furthermore, HCM lines showed a significantly higher fold induction of the hypertrophic marker BNP in response to ET1 challenge compared to their isogenic controls. This is potentially very significant and could lead to the development of a very simple diagnostic test to demonstrate whether a specific gene mutation that is clinically described as a variant of unknown significance (vus) is likely to be HCM disease causing/contributing. While we did observe some hallmarks of HCM in these cell lines, we did not observe disease phenotypes in all of the assay platforms (cell size, arrhythmias, calcium handling) that we explored.  We postulate that the main reason for this is that these disease mutations are not fully penetrant and are only represented in a sub population of cells, and as such maybe masked in higher throughput, well-averaged industrial assays. Previous studies in academia have focused on single cell analysis where certain cells may be selected for evaluation and the presentation of disease phenotypes is reported as a percentage of cells in the population.  While this is a perfectly acceptable approach for academic science, this is not sufficiently robust, unbiased and scalable to support drug discovery programs.    While we have made some exciting progress in this project, we plan on performing additional studies to further develop these concepts both with collaborators and customers in Pharma/Biotech industry.  Once we have a significantly validated body of work, we plan on re-submitting for additional funding.              Last Modified: 01/11/2017       Submitted by: Jason T Lam]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
