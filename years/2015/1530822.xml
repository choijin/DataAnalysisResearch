<AbstractNarration>The Measurement Techniques for Solar and Space Physics Conference will be held in Boulder,Colorado, on April 20 - 24, 2015. The workshop addresses and describes the measurement of techniques and technology development needed to advance high priority science and provide a survey of techniques for the situ measurement and remote sensing of space plasmas. This award supports the UCAR Visiting Scientist Programs (VSP) to provide planning and logistical support, including registration, creation and publication of agendas and schedules, and on-site support while the workshop is in session. &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be organized with four areas of measurement techniques: particles, fields, photons, and ground-based. Additionally, a broad survey of the current technologies will be provided to serve as reference material and as a basis from which advanced and innovative ideas can be discussed. Instrumentation and techniques to observe the solar environment from its interior to its outer atmosphere, the heliosphere out to the interstellar regions, geospace and planetary magnetospheres and atmospheres are included.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Measurement Techniques for Solar and Space Phsics Conference was held in Boulder, Colorado and brought together the academic research community, industry, Federal agencies and other user communities such as emergency management, to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season and make improvements to the Nation?s hurricane forecasting and warning program.  The Conference on Measurement Techniques for Solar and Space Physics gathering was born out of the desire to collect in one place the latest experiment technologies required for advancement of scientific knowledge in the discipline of Solar and Space Physics.   There were two goals for this conference and the associated publication of its content: (a) to describe measurement techniques and technology development needed to advance high priority science in the fields of solar and space physics, and (b) to provide a survey or reference of techniques for in situ measurement and remote sensing of space plasmas. To make significant progress in priority science as expressed in the NRC solar and space physics decadal survey and recent NASA heliophysics roadmaps, identification of enabling measurement techniques and technologies to be developed is required. Additionally, it is valuable to the community and future scientists and engineers to have a complete state of the art survey of the techniques and technologies used by the practitioners of solar and space physics.  The workshop was attended by 221 participants. The following is a partial list of the measurement technique categories that was featured at the conference:  Particles: Thermal plasma to MeV energetic particles,      neutral gas properties including winds, density, temperature, and      composition, and enhanced neutral atom imaging (ENA). Fields: DC electric and magnetic fields, plasma waves,      and electron drift instruments from which the plasma velocity information      provides a measure of the DC electric field. Photons:  Instruments sensitive from the near      infrared to x-rays. Contributions of techniques and technology for optical      design, optical components, sensors, material selection for cameras,      telescopes, and spectrographs are encouraged. Ground-Based:   Remote sensing methods for      solar and geospace activity and space weather. The focus includes solar      observatories, all-sky cameras, lidars, and ITM observatory systems such      as radars, ionosondes, GPS receivers, and magnetometers; conjugate      observations and airborne campaigns.   Volume I: Particles and Fields and Volume II: Phontons and Ground-Based were printed and sent to participants that attended the workshop.
