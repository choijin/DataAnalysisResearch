<AbstractNarration>Decision makers ranging from operators to policymakers need accurate, representative, intuitive, and repeatable measurements of Internet connectivity. Policymakers rely on data about Internet speeds to inform regulation and investment decisions. Human rights activists monitor the state of Internet reachability from a wide range of countries and Internet service providers and report broadly on those findings. Application providers, Internet service providers, and network operators all need to know the performance that a user is experiencing to allow them to better tune their services. These decision makers require an infrastructure that can measure Internet connectivity from the perspectives of typical users. Towards this goal, this project will develop an infrastructure to gather reliable, repeatable measurements from vantage points that reflect the connectivity experienced by home Internet users.  In addition to yielding valuable data about characteristics of Internet connectivity, the infrastructure will also serve as a platform for researchers to perform repeatable experiments and gather data on the Internet as seen from the home.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By developing software that will run on commercially available home gateway routers and which will allow researchers to securely dynamicly load sandboxed applications, this project will develop an open network measurement observatory for researchers, operators, and policymakers.  The project will combine elements of the BISMark and Wireless@Home measurement projects with the Seattle testbed in order to provide researchers with the ability to install sandboxed measurement applications on the home gateway.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project funded research to develop new techniques, measurement methods, and systems for improving performance of Internet access networks, both in the United States and around the wolrd.  The project resulted in several significant outcomes, including:  The deployment of new techniques to measure home wireless network performance and access network performance at higher access speeds. The design, development, and deployment of a passive network monitoring tool, coupled with sophisticated inference algorithms to allow network operators to determine application quality of experience on encrypted traffic, for real-time applications such as streaming video. A first-of-its-kind study of interconnect utiliazation and performance, comprising nearly all of the interconnects for 7 of the largest Internet service providers in the United States. The project shed light on interconnect utilization for U.S. ISPs and for the first time showed the existence of adequate network capacity on these interconnects. The continued development and deployment of a mobile performance monitoring application that was deployed in many countries around the world.   Much of the work from this project has been published in top-tier research publication venues, such as ACM SIGCOMM. In addition to research publications, the project has produced important data and software artifacts that can now be used in higher-speed broadband access networks (e.g., gigabit networks), where conventional modes of measuring network performance do not apply. We are in the process of transitioning many of these results to operational products, both in cooperation with large Internet service provider networks and with our own campus network.
