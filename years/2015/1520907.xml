<AbstractNarration>The researchers have developed sophisticated numericals models that explore how faults that produce earthquakes, large and small, also produce movements that are slow, and look different from typical earthquakes. Earthquakes are typically generated by rapid slip on pre-existing faults inside the Earth, loaded by tectonic plate motion. Observations show that the rapid slip, with the average velocity of the order of 1 m/s, coexists with much slower slip that can be measured, e.g. using GPS. These types of phenomena often exist in the same place and can influence each other. This project will look to simulate several cycles of large earthquakes and, by incorporating what we know about how the Earth deforms, the physics of seismic waves and faults, observe how slow events and both small and large earthquakes work. They will take their simulations and compare them with observations made in experimental labs and in nature. The studies will lead to better understanding of earthquake nucleation, fault properties, and the predictive value of foreshocks sequences, and hence help mitigate seismic hazard. Combined with codes for wave propagation and site and building response, the methodology for simulating slow slip and earthquake sequences can become a vital ingredient of physics-based simulation capability for seismic hazard analysis This kind of modeling could have transformative impacts on our understanding of earthquakes and their hazards. These types of models add another tool to our study of hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To study the interaction of slow slip with seismicity-producing fault patches, the researchers will use a unique numerical approach capable of resolving all stages of slip: accelerating slip during earthquake nucleation, dynamic rupture with all inertial (wave) effects, postseismic slip, and interseismic slip including transients. Slow slip will be generated as a part of long-term fault simulations using several physical mechanisms to enable comparison between them: (i) nucleation processes on faults governed by standard velocity-weakening rate-and-state friction, (ii) modifications of such processes due to inelastic shear dilatancy, and (iii) slow slip on velocity-strengthening faults. The fault models will include one or multiple patches defined as areas of different frictional properties. Several types of differences that may lead to seismicity will be explored, including variations in effective normal stress, rate-weakening properties, dilatancy, and permeability. The focus here is on simulating and characterizing well-resolved interactions of slow slip and seismic events in terms of their radiated spectra, stress drops, potential for seismicity recurrence on a patch during a single episode of slow slip, spatial extent of the generated events in relation to the patch sizes, modification of slow slip by the resulting seismicity and its postseismic effects, and the consequences of interaction between nearby patches. Comparison of these features with observations (including laboratory studies) will allow identification of scenarios relevant to the observed phenomena as well as clarify the nature of heterogeneity on natural and laboratory faults.  The developed detailed models of slow slip interaction with heterogeneous patches will be used to create simplified representations of microseismicity for use in future simulations of earthquakes and slow slip, including foreshock sequences and tremor, in realistic fault settings.</AbstractNarration>

The slow slip is often accompanied by microseismicity. Examples include foreshocks suggested to occur during slow nucleation of upcoming larger events (a phenomenon that has laboratory support), repeating earthquake sequences observed on a number of creeping fault segments, and low-frequency earthquakes that accompany aseismic slip transients. In all these phenomena, the seismicity presumably occurs on patches of different fault properties due to loading generated by slow slip around them.  This project has been devoted to modeling these observations with solid-mechanics-based models of faults with laboratory-derived rate-and-state friction laws.  Our goal has been to identify fault properties relevant to natural faults by comparing observations with model outcomes. To study the interaction of slow slip with seismicity-producing fault patches, we have used our unique numerical approach capable of resolving all stages of slip: accelerating slip during earthquake nucleation, dynamic rupture with all inertial (wave) effects, postseismic slip, and interseismic slip including transients. Slow slip is generated as a part of long-term fault simulations using two physical mechanisms: (i) nucleation processes on faults governed by standard velocity-weakening rate-and-state friction and (ii) slow slip on velocity-strengthening faults. To generate microseismicity, the fault models have included one or multiple patches defined as areas of different frictional properties.  We find that our models produce foreshock-like events, e.g., isolated microseismicity during the nucleation of a larger-scale seismic event, if the nucleation sizes of the larger-scale seismogenic region and of the patches within the region are substantially different, by a factor of ten or more. The separation of scales can be achieved by high levels of compression on the patches.  Remarkably, in our models, the stress drops of the patch-hosted events are reasonable and approximately constant, despite a wide variation in the patch compression, due to patch ruptures extending into the surrounding seismogenic region.  The finding that stress drops of microseismicity generated on highly compressed patches do not depend on the patch compression is unexpected and highly significant, as it makes the fault models that we are constructing quite plausible for explaining foreshock sequences observed both on natural and laboratory faults. The different seismic properties that we find for such events compared to standard source models is hopeful for potential detection of foreshocks, but further work is needed to investigate the similarities and differences of the seismic properties with other heterogeneous sources.   Our models successfully reproduce the observed repeating earthquake sequences on the creeping section of the San Andreas Fault and their properties.  In part, the modeling shows that the high stress drops observed for some of the repeating earthquakes can be explained both by enhanced dynamic weakening and by locally elevated normal stress.  In both cases, for patches close to the nucleation size, significant aseismic slip occurring on the patches between seismic events serves to make the recurrence irregular and leads to the repeating sequences being neither time- and slip-predictable.  Introduction of small-scale heterogeneity into the models further enhances the variability.  We find that differences in properties over scales much smaller than the source size significantly affect the variability, but not the average source properties.  Our models with asperity-like patches that have compression gradually increasing towards the middle of the patch, as expected for a flattened bump on the fault, reproduce the enigmatic recent observations of earthquake clusters with variable seismic moment but constant rupture duration.  Our models suggest that such observations can be explained by heterogeneous patches for which the duration of the events is controlled by the patch size and hence is approximately constant, while the moment of the events is controlled by how much of the patch ruptures and hence changes from one event to the other.   Our rate-and-state fault models can explain low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) as barely seismic events occurring on subcritical and near-critical patches.  In our models, LFEs represent the final stages of the nucleation process that can be detected in certain frequency bands.  The relatively long duration of the events is controlled by the acceleration of slip over the entire nucleation patch, and not be rupture propagation, contrary to the typical view of seismic ruptures.  Slip accelerates effectively in place, nucleating over the entire patch, and then decelerates.   Our studies have resulted in better understanding of earthquake nucleation, microseismicity origins, fault properties, and predictive value of foreshocks sequences; such accumulating knowledge will eventually help mitigate seismic hazard. Combined with codes for wave propagation and site and building response, the methodology for simulating slow slip and earthquake sequences can become a vital ingredient of physics-based simulation capability for seismic hazard analysis.
