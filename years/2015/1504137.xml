<AbstractNarration>The investigators propose to take advantage of three already-funded research expeditions to investigate the distribution of cycling of natural dissolved organic material (DOM) in the Arctic Ocean and in particular its relationship to the cycling of trace metals such as iron. The Arctic Ocean has experienced significant changes over the last 30 years, including declining sea ice and increasing continental runoff. The Arctic is considered a harbinger of changes in the carbon and hydrological cycles, with important implications for regional and global climate. How the physical, chemical and biological structure of the Arctic Ocean will respond to such fundamental changes is poorly understood. The proposed research will provide novel insights about dissolved organic matter and its role in trace element cycling. Recent studies provide tantalizing data indicating the transport and fate of DOM and trace metals are closely linked in the Arctic Ocean, and suggesting an important role of continental runoff and sea ice formation in the distribution of DOM and associated trace metals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water samples will be collected and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, amino acids, lignin phenols and detailed optical characterization of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) during 3 expeditions in 2015 aboard the USCGC Healy, the German ice breaker Polarstern, and the Japanese research vessel Mirai. The combined optical and molecular analyses will be used to distinguish and quantify terrigenous and marine DOM and their potential interactions with trace elements. A probe for measuring in situ fluorescence of DOM will be interfaced with the CTD/rosette for high-resolution mapping and real-time examination of interesting features to guide sampling efforts. The U.S. and German expeditions are part of the international GEOTRACES program, whose goals are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. The U.S. Arctic GEOTRACES project has established a central outreach program for this research program including meetings with local communities in Alaska, recruiting a high school teacher to participate in the expedition and interact with schools in the US and beyond via a blog. These investigators will tie into the existing GEOTRACES outreach efforts and will link interested Texas and South Carolina Schools to the expedition blog. This project will train 3 graduate students in and expose about 6 undergraduate students to research in the Arctic Ocean. The goal of the teaching component of this project is to provide students with an experience that demonstrates the scientific method, from development of goals and hypotheses to experimental design and presentation of results. Findings of this project will be conveyed to the public using established links with local newspapers where students describe research projects in their own words.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biological productivity of ocean waters is often limited by the availability of nutrients that are required for the growth of marine organisms.  Certain trace nutrients, such as iron, are not very soluble in seawater, and they predominantly occur in forms that are associated with organic ligands that increase the solubility of iron in seawater and its bioavailability to marine organisms.  Relatively little is known about the source, composition and bioavailability of the organic ligands that bind iron, so this project focused on characterizing the abundance, distribution and origins of dissolved organic molecules found in the Arctic Ocean.  This research utilized in-situ probes that continuously measure the fluorescence of dissolved molecules, and in combination with discrete measurements of dissolved organic carbon, lignin phenols and amino acids we gained insights about the abundance and origins organic molecules that bind iron and other trace elements in Arctic waters.  Ship-based oceanographic surveys across the central Arctic Ocean during the Geotraces 2015 project provided a clear distinction between waters from the Siberian shelves (Trans Polar Drift; TPD) and those from the Atlantic and Pacific.  We observed high concentrations of fluorescent dissolved molecules of river origin in the TPD.  These waters also have high concentrations of lignin phenols, clearly indicating the presence of terrestrial organic molecules from the large Siberian rivers.  Measurements of trace elements by other groups in the Geotraces project indicate that these waters also have high concentrations of iron.  It appears there is a strong correlation between dissolved terrigenous molecules and iron, suggesting riverine transport is an important source of both iron and organic ligands that bind iron.  The TDP transports Siberian shelf waters, organic ligands and associated iron to the North Atlantic Ocean, where biological productivity could be enhanced by iron and other trace elements derived from Siberian rivers.
