<AbstractNarration>This research will advance a novel technological approach that relies on machine learning techniques in general and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular to develop models and support for creativity during collaborative science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educational activities. We will extend existing educational software with NLP capabilities to automatically assess and subsequently support creativity during collaborative tasks. The research questions are: (1) Which factors influence moment-by-moment creativity during collaborative problem solving activities? (2) How can NLP be used to build student models that detect those factors? (3) How can an ITS use this information to create personalized interventions to support creativity?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The first phase in this research will collect data from students solving problems in pairs with an educational application to identify factors that are relevant to creativity processes and outcomes.  These data will be used to derive computational student models for automatically assessing student creativity in terms of both moment-to-moment processes and outcomes through machine learning methodologies focusing on an NLP approach. In addition to providing automatic assessment, the models will also inform factors that influence creativity during collaboration through educational data mining techniques. The final phase of the work will design and test a set of interventions to foster creativity during collaborative activities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Using data corresponding to pairs of students solving open-ended STEM-based problems, this research will develop a rich and nuanced understanding of creativity processes and outcomes in collaborative contexts, and how these relate to knowledge, affect and creative thinking styles. Relying on that understanding, it will develop and evaluate novel student models that recognize salient, creativity-related events through NLP techniques, as well as personalized support for creativity during collaborative activities and evaluating that support through an experiment with university students. This project will pave the way for a new class of collaborative cyberlearning technologies to both assess and foster creativity, through just-in-time personalized support based on easily deployed NLP-based student models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Creativity is one of the most valuable societal resources, as it is, by definition, required for the advancement of all novel and useful innovations.  Creativity is particularly important in developing STEM workforce and pipelines capable of meeting society?s grand challenges. Yet, studies show that students are becoming less, rather than more creative. This research focused on advancing understanding of elements contributing to and fostering creativity. Our goal has been to improve the effectiveness and innovation of the STEM workforce.  Specifically, we investigated ways to model creativity during collaborative, open-ended STEM activities and worked toward piloting adaptive interventions, based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) model information, that fosters creativity.  Our primary focus has been to evaluate the utility of using NLP to build models that can automatically assess student creativity as it occurs, moment by moment in real time. The project team has conducted research that has informed and refine NLP algorithms through the collection, use of, and human-coding of STEM learners? conversational chat-data.  This data was obtained from students engaged in STEM-based problem solving conversations within a chat application.  These refined methodologies will enable future research to more robustly identify potential features of interest to creativity researchers, particularly pertaining to the advancement of STEM topics and collaboration. This research resulted in a system capable of supporting a larger scale study of NLP based creativity research to (1) explore the utility of these factors in the NLP models that we built for predicting creativity and (2) collect additional data which will help to further refine the NLP models.  Key achievements, to date, have been the refinement of our data analysis methodologies in preparation for implementation of interactive interventions to enhance levels of creativity as students engage in dyadic-chat.  Advancing new NLP models has enabled us to detect and develop strategies to facilitate creative collaboration. These have the potential to contribute to advancing STEM education, collaboration, and innovation. This research also contributes to enhancing the ability to apply NLP in novel contexts/domains and contributes to advancing theories of creativity and related Creativity Support Tools.
