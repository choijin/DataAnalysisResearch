<AbstractNarration>Due to the massive proliferation of mobile devices like smart phones and tablets, mobile cloud computing (MCC) has emerged as a new paradigm and extension of cloud computing, with which users can access a plethora of unique features. Unfortunately, since mobile users offload most computation and storage to the cloud and are usually battery-powered, high performance connections to the cloud tend to become the bottleneck, hindering the efficiency of MCC. Thus, throughput and energy efficiency for the connections to the cloud are two critical and challenging design issues in MCC, which should be addressed carefully. In this project, the PI proposes a novel Multi-radio Multi-channel Multi-hop Cellular Network architecture to facilitate MCC, and investigates throughput and energy optimization by focusing on the following three main research thrusts: (1) throughput optimization for communications between cloud users and base stations (U2B) in hybrid mode, (2) path capacity optimization for communications among cloud users (U2U) with cooperation, and (3) energy optimization for U2B/U2U communications. The results of this project will advance the state of the art in network optimization for MCC and enrich the scientific knowledge of network design. The proposed research is thus crucial to the success of MCC, which can provide great opportunities for job creation, greater productivity, and economic growth. The results of the project will be disseminated through publications and talks. The proposed research will also be integrated with curriculum development, minority student recruitment, training and mentoring, and outreach to K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Due to the massive proliferation of mobile devices like smart phones and tablets, mobile cloud computing has emerged as a new paradigm and extension of cloud computing, with which users can see a plethora of unique features. For instance, users can store and access personal files such as music, videos, documents, and bookmarks or do word processing in the cloud wherever they go, rather than carry around a storage medium like a thumb drive or a portable disk. Users can also remotely monitor their home security systems, let other people in, and turn on/off some electrical devices according to the current electricity price. To give another example, frontline soldiers can use handheld mobile devices to feedback realtime information to the commanding cloud, which can process the data and send instructions to the soldiers so that they can get situational awareness en route. Mobile cloud computing holds a great promise for delivering various cloud solutions to users anywhere at any time.

Specifically, an M<sup>3</sup>CN is a cellular network in which both the service provider and network users can access multiple channels with multiple radios. For example, each base station can operate on certain cellular band consisting of a set of cellular channels using several radios, while each network user can have a few radios as well and access both the cellular channels and some ISM band channels such as Wi-Fi channels and bluetooth channels. Besides, if some base stations and some more powerful terminals are equipped with cognitive radios, they may be able to access more channels like the TV band channels, which have larger bandwidth and better penetration and propagation performances. The service provider uses the cellular channels for signaling, controlling, handling handoffs, accommodating users' voice traffic, etc., and uses all the available channels to support users' data traffic or cloud traffic. As a central coordinator, the service provider performs network optimization to find out the optimal radio and frequency allocation, link scheduling and routing schemes for satisfying users' traffic demand and/or minimizing users' energy consumption given unpredictable spectrum availability in the coverage area. We have investigated how to maximize the throughput for communications between cloud users and base stations, i.e., U2B communications, by exploring radio and frequency allocation, link scheduling, and routing under unpredictable spectrum availability, how to explore cooperative communications to maximize the path capacity for communications among cloud users, i.e., U2U communications, how to explore trade-offs between throughput and energy consumption with dynamic and uncertain system resources while supporting their traffic demand for U2B/U2U communications.

First, this project has conducted a fundamental study of throughput and energy optimization, resource allocation, security, and privacy in multi-radio, multi-channel, multi-hop cellular systems. The resulting future integrated networks can support much more varieties of services with more flexible qualities of services and provide ubiquitous access opportunity, which is crucial for applications such as urban sensing for public safety and disaster recovery, mobile healthcare and mobile social networks. The developed technologies will definitely help this realization.
