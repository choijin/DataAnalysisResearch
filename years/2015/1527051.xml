<AbstractNarration>Big Data analytics is the process of mining useful knowledge in very large data sets, critical to the advancement of many research and application fields. With manufacturing technology downscaling coupled with increasing power densities, modern computer systems suffer from potential hardware and software failures, which can manifest themselves as errors. The errors are to happen when long-running Big Data analytics are executed on the systems, causing crash or worse, returning incorrect results silently. While numerous hardware-based resilience methods exist, they often come at the cost of excessive power efficiency reduction and substantial design complexity enlargement among others.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to reinforce popular Big Data analytics by embracing a host of comprehensive algorithmic resilience (CAR) software techniques that include concurrent error detection, coordinated checkpointing, and execution recovery, for high execution resilience.   Upon detecting potential hardware and software errors concurrently during analytics, CAR enables execution recovery from detected errors without lofty overhead common to hardware-based resilience methods.  Research activities of the project aim to achieve six main objectives that focus on addressing several technical challenges to realize CAR, based on investigators? encouraging preliminary results and prior work.  The success of this project can benefit wide scientific and industrial applications due to its better support of Big Data analytics and processing.  Research advances from this research are to be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate education, to be disseminated and shared broadly through technical presentations and by a website, and to inspire high school students for their STEM interest.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative research involves two investigators from separate Louisiana institutions to jointly undertake important activities that are relevant to comprehensive algorithmic resilience (CAR) for Big Data analytics.  The PI and his project team address effective execution checkpointing and express failure recovery, which are critical for long-running Big Data analytics executed on a large computing system likely to encounter failures.  Research outcomes obtained from project activities have been covered by three journal articles, with one published, another under re-evaluation after revision, and the third under review, all in reputed IEEE transactions most relevant to the CAR research scope.  Three Ph.D. students have engaged in the project activities, supported in part by this research grant.  The supplemental REU fund enables three undergraduate students to participate in research activities pertinent to the project scope, including one minority female undergraduate junior.  Intellectual Merit.  The project aims to reinforce popular Big Data software by incorporating concurrent error detection and low-overhead coordinated checkpointing mechanisms in support of execution recovery from detected errors.

Broader Impacts.  Big Data analytics are critical to the advancement of various fields, and the outcomes of this project naturally benefit those fields to have substantial broader impacts positively, as a result of accelerating Big Data analytics conducted on large scale systems with high resilience.  Other scientific and industrial applications with execution invariants can also benefit from CAR software mechanisms for resilience enhancement.  In addition, project engagement by both research collaborators and their teams elevates the research and educational activities on computer systems and fault-tolerant computing in the two participating institutions.  Three REU students have participated in CAR research activities to materially inspire their interests in pursuing science and engineering careers.
