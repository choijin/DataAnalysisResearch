<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This project draws inspiration from the sinuous motion of a lamprey, in which neurons running down the spinal column are excited in sequence causing the musculature to contract, thereby propelling the lamprey. The fundamental principles underlying this behavior are understood, and this team seeks to engineer nonliving materials that possess these properties of living matter. They will develop purely synthetic materials that will operate autonomously, driven solely by chemistry without electricity, computers, or motors. These materials will execute multiple functions and be externally triggered to modify their behavior. Thus, this work will establish a new paradigm of precise and programmable chemical control for the fledgling field of soft robotics, in which soft, tissue-like materials replace the rigid, hard materials now found in robots on factory floors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the project is to develop purely synthetic, chemomechanical materials that emulate biological processes, such as the beating of a heart, at programmable rates and rhythms. The long-term goal is to elucidate the fundamental physical principles of active soft matter based on reaction-diffusion chemistry, enabling engineering of materials capable of chemical control and chemomechanical transduction. This research will address two fundamental challenges in the design of chemomechanical materials. The first is to understand and develop mechanisms of volume transitions in redox-sensitive gels, by which forces can be actuated. Materials engineered from a selection of promising building blocks will be probed over length scales ranging from nanometers to millimeters in order to fully elucidate gel structure and dynamics. These findings will be fed into atomistic and mesoscopic computer models, which will in turn inform the chemical synthesis of next-generation materials with desirable properties. The second challenge is to engineer a control mechanism comprised of an array of micron-scale compartmentalized reactors that contain an oscillating chemical reaction, and are physically networked via diffusion. Coupling the control and actuation sub-systems will yield chemically responsive gels that can change volume in concert with predictable and tunable chemical activity. Such materials will have attributes heretofore found only in living matter, such as flexibility in mammalian tongues, pulsatile contractions in human intestines, and heliotropism in plants. Thus, this work will establish a new paradigm of precise and programmable chemomechanical control for the fledgling field of soft robotics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview. The long term goal of DMREF: Programmable Chemomechanical Materials is to create artificial neural tissue coupled to synthetic musculature to create chemically-fueled automonous soft robots.  Summary. The research was divided into two thrusts that were worked on simultaneously: the dynamics of networks of chemical oscillators and the chemomechanics of gels. The research involved physicists, chemists and engineers using the methods of theory, computation and experiment.  Network Dynamics. The network thrust successfully engineered materials that exhibit programmed autonomous spatiotemporal chemical activity with the functionality of the autonomous nervous system,  developed feedback and control methods of these networks and determined which portions of the network dynamics were controlled by network structure and which by the dynamics of the underlying chemistry.  The chemical element that played the role of a neuron was the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) chemical reaction and the synthetic neural tissue was reaction-diffusion networks of the BZ chemicals.  We developed the processing methods to create diffusively coupled chemical networks for which we controlled (i) the topology of the network, the (ii) boundary and (iii) initial conditions of the chemical oscillators, (iv) the volume of each reactor, (v) the coupling strength, and (vi) whether the coupling is of an inhibitory or excitatory nature. With these new processing methods, we devised networks that exhibited rich dynamics mimicking that found in living organisms, such as the sinuous swimming of an eel and the gaits of a quadruped, and developed theoretical methods that distinguished between the effects of network structure and chemical kinetics on network dynamics. These results were described in a series of peer reviewed publications.
