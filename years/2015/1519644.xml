<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Christopher Carone, Joshua Erlich, and Marc Sher at the College of William and Mary.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Standard Model of particle physics provides a consistent description of all known elementary particles and their interactions.  However, there are many features of the theory that remain mysterious and suggest that the Standard Model is incomplete:  How must the theory be modified to explain the observed pattern of elementary particle masses?  How must the theory be extended to explain the observational evidence for the existence of dark matter?  Is the relatively small mass of the recently discovered Higgs boson hinting at a more complicated spectrum of Higgs-sector particles yet to be discovered?  The intellectual merit of the work proposed by Professors Carone, Erlich and Sher stems from its focus on addressing these and other fundamental issues, which will help to advance our understanding of the physics of the elementary particles.  With the restart of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and with new results from dark matter detectors imminent, one expects exciting new discoveries in the near future, and the PIs' research will be well timed to explore the results from these experiments.  As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical law.  The Broader Impact of this work is that it furthers the education of undergraduate and PhD research students, including those from underrepresented groups, facilitates outreach to the general public, and promotes high-energy particle physics in the southeastern part of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of their specific research projects, the PIs anticipate progress along several distinct lines.  On the issue of fermion masses, the PIs and their students will study model-independent bounds and cosmological consequences of pseudo-familons - particles that may be light enough to be experimentally accessible even though they are originate from new flavor physics associated with a very high energy scale.   On the issue of dark matter, the PIs and their students will consider new models in which a dark sector of particles arises dynamically, such as certain supersymmetric "moose" models in which non-perturbative physics associated with a strongly coupled dark sector drives a messenger sector gauge coupling to very small values.  On the issue of Higgs-sector physics, the PIs will study novel two-Higgs doublet models, one class that avoids flavor-changing-neutral currents via non-Abelian discrete symmetries and another class extended as in the Lee-Wick Standard Model, providing numerous predictive relations between heavy Higgs masses and couplings.  They will explore the implications of these models for the LHC.  In addition to these investigations, the PIs and their students will also consider other fundamental issues, for example, attempting to elucidate the appearance of black-hole horizons in gravity duals of finite-temperature theories by matching appropriate calculations in dual gauge-gravity models to perturbative finite-temperature quantum chromodynamics.   Carone, Erlich and Sher will also continue activities that provide a substantial broader impact, including the supervision of undergraduate, PhD, and REU research students, participation in local events (for example, QuarkNet), and continued interaction with local and national media on particle-physics issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the period of the project, Carone, Erlich and Sher published extensively in refereed journals on a wide variety of topics related to particle physics beyond the standard model.   Erlich presented an analysis of a class of cosmic inflation models and described a certain duality between examples of those models. He completed other papers which presented and analyzed a new class of models in which gravitation is not a fundamental interaction, but rather emerges as an interaction at long distances. This approach to emergent gravity addresses a number of puzzles in quantum gravity, including the problem of time (the problem that the the quantum state in quantum gravity satisfies a constraint but has no dynamics). Sher completed a number of papers related to the physics of the Higgs boson.The discovery of this particle in 2012 was a major triumph, but there has been strong motivation for additional Higgs bosons.   Most of Sher's papers dealt with extensions of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model, and the phenomenological implications for these extensions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).      Some studied non-standard Higgs decays into different types of leptons and some considered the effects of additional Higgs bosons on models with extra dimensions.    Currently, LHC experimenters are including these results in their analyses.    In addition, Sher co-authored work indicating that some experiments designed to search for millicharged particles at the LHC would also be sensitive to neutrino dipole moments, and experimenters are now including this possibility.  Carone published work on the emergent gravity idea described earlier, with Erlich and a string theorist at the University of Virginia; he studied an alternative way in which the forces of nature might unify at strong coupling and he studied models that aim to explain the mysterious pattern of elementary particle masses using symmetries.  Carone published work on models that include particles that could explain the rapid expansion of the early universe, and how these might be incorporated into models that explain elementary particle masses.   He also proposed a model that can explain the mass scale associated with the weak force with the physics of a "dark" sector, that includes dark matter.   The work of Carone, Erlich and Sher routinely involves graduate and undergraduate student researchers, including those from demographics that are historically underrepresented in the physical sciences.
