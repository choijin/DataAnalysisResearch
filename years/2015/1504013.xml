<AbstractNarration>This project will address the growing national need for improvements in undergraduate statistics education to enable a large cadre of America's residents to acquire a deeper understanding of statistics in order to make informed decisions. A corollary is that statistical literacy is imperative for an educated complex society. Recently, much has been learned about the teaching and learning of undergraduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, and one of the recommendations in STEM education is to foster active learning in the classroom. In line with this, education researchers in the STEM disciplines also have long noted that language often poses a barrier for students studying science. With funding from the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program, the project investigators will create and study a collection of research-based activities and corresponding materials for first-year undergraduate statistics courses.  These activities and materials will be designed to have high impact on student learning, while requiring little time for an instructor to adopt and implement.  These High Impact Little Time (HILT) activities and materials also will focus on breaking down language and jargon barriers in statistics in the process. Following a recommendation from the 2012 National Research Council Report on Discipline-Based Education Research, the project will bring together a multidisciplinary research team of statisticians, discipline-based statistics education researchers, and an expert evaluator with background in assessment and faculty development to guide improvements in learning and instruction in introductory statistics courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are to: (1) develop a set of research-based HILT activities for addressing issues in student learning of statistics related to language use; (2) generate evidence-based knowledge of the effects these activities have on student learning in statistics; (3) create an interactive professional development instructional model in statistics education that can be widely disseminated; and (4) produce the basis for a web-repository designed not only to disseminate the HILT activities, but also to contain the functionality necessary to promote and sustain the success of the professional development model. The researchers will employ a mixed methods methodology to determine (a) to what extent the implementation of the HILT language activities promote student learning in statistics and (b) the instructional approaches which are effective for developing or improving student learning outcomes in statistics. Quantitative data will be used to determine the extent of differences in student learning, and fhs data will be collected via the administration of the Comprehensive Assessment of Outcomes of a first Statistics Course (CAOS). The project team will also collect qualitative data via the Lexical Ambiguity Instrument (LAI), which will be finalized as part of the project. Data will be collected and analyzed from both students who are exposed to the HILT activities and those who are not.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Language plays a crucial role in the classroom: it serves as a primary means for communicating new ideas and helps students build understanding and process ideas.  Statistics, as with most disciplines, has no lack of jargon. In addition, many of the words used within statistics are ones also used in everyday language &ndash; but with different meanings.  Discipline-specific words that are similar to commonly used English words &ndash; but which have different meanings &ndash; are said to have lexical ambiguity.  Research has shown that language itself can represent a barrier to student understanding of a subject.  As such, the core of this project was to create research-based activities for undergraduate statistics courses that improve student learning by addressing language issues in statistics.  The specific goals of the project were to: (1) develop a set of research-based activities that have High Impact on student learning but require Little Time to enact (or have HILT qualities) for addressing issues in student learning of statistics related to language use; (2) generate evidence of the effectiveness these activities have on student learning in statistics; (3) create a professional development model in statistics education that can be widely disseminated; and (4) produce a web-repository to disseminate the HILT activities and to promote and sustain the professional development model.  During Project Years One and Two, the Project Team worked with six instructors from the same institution whose principal teaching focused on introductory statistics.  In addition to two two-day workshops over two summers, face-to-face, biweekly meetings were held during three semesters (Goal Three).  In Semester One, the six instructors used the same previously-developed HILT activity in their classrooms, which focused on student understanding of the word random as it applies to statistics. Each instructor also identified one+ words for which they wanted to develop a new HILT activity and began developing activity drafts.  Seven new HILT activities were developed, focused on the words or word pair parameter/statistic, normal/average, skew, correlation/association, and residual (Goal One).  The biweekly meetings were used to discuss various aspects of the research and to provide feedback on activity drafts.   The new HILT activities were classroom tested in Semester Two and data were collected toward the end of the semester to measure the effectiveness of the activities from both students exposed to and students not exposed to the activities.  The analyses to date have focused primarily on activities related to random, parameter/statistic and normal/average.  There is clear evidence, from both a definitional and content perspective, that students who are exposed to the HILT activities demonstrate a higher understanding of these words than students who are not exposed to these activities (Goal Two).  Instructors were surveyed regarding the time it took them to use a featured HILT activity in their classrooms.  The mean time to introduce, conduct, and remind students about the activity was 9.5 minutes across the semester.  Given the demonstrated gains in student understanding for the words analyzed to date, this is quite a modest investment of semester time &ndash; which can make using the activities even more attractive for instructors.   All HILT activities and videos demonstrating their classroom use have been made available to statistics instructors through multiple venues, including a web repository (Goal Four). The web repository has had over 2500 visitors since first advertised. While most of the visitors were located in the U.S., there were also visitors from several other countries including Australia, Canada, China, Great Britain, and Spain.  During a one-year, no-cost extension of the project, the professional development model was adapted for an online environment in which the Project Team met with three new instructors from differing institutions.  Two additional HILT activities, one focusing on significant/significance and another focusing on the difference between variable and variance, were developed during this period (Goal One).  The focus on helping students master statistical language removes a perceived barrier to access to the technical domain: when students understand the language they are less likely to find the subject difficult solely because the language is different.  Further, there is no question that an informed, educated citizenry needs to be statistically literate, particularly in today?s world of "big data" and given the availability of large amounts of data with the propensity of the media to report data-driven findings, sometimes incorrectly.  Anything instructors can do to help students gain a better understanding of statistical concepts is important.  Students who possess an enhanced grasp of statistics can bring this knowledge into the workplace.  This, in turn, can translate into companies being more competitive globally and can lead to creative and useful innovations &ndash; all of which can benefit society as a whole. Attention to language in general, and implementation of the short activities developed by this project to address language acquisition in particular, are one powerful way to improve the statistical literacy of citizens.
