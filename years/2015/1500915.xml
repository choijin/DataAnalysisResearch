<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium 2015" that will be held from May 26-30, 2015, on the campus of Purdue University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the thirty-fifth installment of the Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in operator theory or operator algebras. The main foci of the 2015 event are the following: classification of  C*-algebras; von Neumann algebras; recent advances in operator theory; noncommutative geometry; C*-algebras and dynamical systems. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web page:  www.math.purdue.edu/~mdd/GPOTS2015/index.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium is a long-running annual week-long conference covering the theory of operators on Hilbert space.  Hilbert space should be thought of as an infinite-dimensional version of the 3-dimensional space that surrounds us.  We can "operate" on this 3-dimensional space in various ways:  we can stretch it, we can rotate it, and so on.  The same can be done with the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.  The ways of transforming this space are known as operators, and the 2015 Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium is meant to disseminate new research in this field among its researchers and the general public.    The outcomes of this award which concern intellectual merit include the education of researchers in this field with regards to new results, with a particular emphasis on young researchers.  This was achieved by defraying the travel costs of all nontenured facutly and graduate students using the grant's funds.  Another such outcome was the formation of new collaborative groups to combine their expertise and unlock some resilient problems in this discipline.  The most significant broader impact of this project was its ability to grant access to a great many graduate students, postdocs, and untenured faculty.  These scientists usually possess no grant funds of their own, and so rely on grant's such as the one under discussion here to further their own education, research, and careers.  As mentioned above, the travel and accommodation costs for all such researchers were reimbursed by this grant.       Last Modified: 08/16/2016       Submitted by: Andrew Toms]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
