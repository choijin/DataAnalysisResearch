<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the activities of the Condensed Matter and Materials Research Committee (CMMRC).  The CMMRC is a sub-committee of the National Academy of Science Board on Physics and Astronomy and is tasked with serving as a conduit for interactions between the condensed matter and materials research communities and the federal government, including the agencies that support this research, and with monitoring the health of and identifying important new developments in these fields.  The members of the CMMRC are leading scientists from across all the subfields encompassed by condensed matter and materials research.  The CMMRC carries out its mission using regular meetings to discuss emerging research areas, working with sponsoring agencies to organize topical workshops, interacting with professional societies, and developing resources for the general public.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project provides partial support for the National Research Council's (NRC) Condensed Matter and Materials Research Committee (CMMRC). The CMMRC is a multidisciplinary group with membership drawn from universities, industry, and government laboratories. The areas of expertise represented on the committee are intended to cover the breadth of the condensed matter and materials research fields. Nominees for committee membership have been and will continue to be selected on the basis of demonstrated intellectual leadership in these areas and thoughtful consideration of cross-cutting issues. The operating guidelines of CMMRC include the following objectives: (1) to respond to requests for technical information and assistance, both from within the National Academies and from outside federal research agencies; (2) to initiate and oversee ad hoc studies in these fields and their multidisciplinary connections to other fields of science and technology; (3) to serve as long-term stewards for studies initiated under CMMRC's direction; (4) to act as an educational resource for the condensed matter and materials research communities and the agencies that support them; and (5) to provide a forum for discussion among condensed matter and materials scientists and Washington D.C. policymakers. To carry out those objectives, CMMRC meets on an annual basis and between those meetings, conducts its business through telephone conferences.</AbstractNarration>

Condensed Matter and Materials Research Committee (CMMRC).  The CMMRC is one of five standing committees of the National Academies? Board on Physics and Astronomy and is charged with assisting the Board in achieving its goals&mdash;monitoring the health of physics and astronomy, identifying important new developments at the scientific forefronts, fostering interactions with other fields, strengthening connections to technology, facilitating effective service to the nation, and enhancing education in physics. The CMMRC carries out its functions in several ways - providing expert advice to the BPA in monitoring the health of condensed matter and materials research and providing perspective on issues that arise in those fields; assisting other National Academies? boards in developing proposals and initiating studies that impact these fields; providing long-term stewardship of National Academies reports that it has played a role in initiating and that are of importance to the condensed matter and materials research communities, and providing a means for dialog with federal agencies on these and related fields.      To carry out its objectives, CMMRC meets face-to-face twice per year, and between those meetings conducts its business through telephone conferences.  At its fall 2017 and spring 2018 meeting,s CMMRC met with representatives of agencies that support condensed matter and materials research and discussed outstanding issues facing the condensed matter and materials research science community.  For its fall 2017 meeting, CMMRC then conducted a half-day focus session on Materials for Quantum Computing and for its spring 2018 meeting, a half-day focus session on Materials Life Cycle Analysis and Substitution.  Following the meetings, the committee prepared a summary of the presentations and discussions that took place during that focus session and provided that to the sponsoring agencies.
