<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Washington, Seattle. The program offers a broad selection of student projects from almost every sub-field of physics. It makes use of the University of Washington's strong in-house "table-top" experimental programs; its machine-shop facilities including a first-rate student shop; CENPA, a DOE center-of-excellence in nuclear physics and astrophysics; and theory opportunities ranging from the Institute for Nuclear Theory to a twenty-teraflop local cluster. The award supports ten students per summer. Selection will be competitive, considering past academic performance, letters of recommendation, and taking into account the potential for impacting the student's career. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student participant will be partnered with a UW faculty adviser. Several Physics faculty members participate as advisers, as do selected faculty from affiliated departments. Student work includes: design, construction, and commissioning of instrumentation; data collection and analysis; numerical modeling; the development of software for such modeling; and theory. Not infrequently this work culminates with a journal publication.</AbstractNarration>

The main goal of the Physics REU program at the University of   Washington is to provide an exciting and nurturing research experience   for the students, one that will encourage them to pursue careers as research   scientists. The program aims to accomplish this by offering a wide   variety of research projects and the opportunity to use first-rate   research facilities while also providing a strong support network. Additionally, while selection is competitive, the program strives to build a   group of students that is diverse.  We received 441 applications for   the summer of 2016 class with 10 participants, 402 applications for   2017 with 10 participants, 416 applications for   2018 with 10 participants, and 374 applications for 2019 with 10 participants.    Each student participant was   partnered with a UW faculty advisor and their research group. Student   research work included design, construction, and commissioning of   instrumentation; data collection and analysis; numerical modeling; the   development of software for such modeling; and theory.  All students proved capable of   doing quality independent research.  The concluding presentations --   written and oral reports on the results of 10 weeks of research -- were of   very high quality.  These are documented on the program's website at https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/uwreu/home.
