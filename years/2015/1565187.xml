<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds are requested in the amount of $3070 for supporting the travel of US based organizers  and speakers participating in the American Chemical Society (ACS)  Symposium: ? Advance in Functional Polymers with Sophisticated Branched Structures?, to be held in Philadelphia, PA, Aug.21-25, 2016. The  symposium?s objective is to fill a gap in the coverage of these important polymeric species among recent ACS symposia. The species include star polymers, graft polymers, molecular brushes, dendrimers, and variously branched polymer structures constructed from supermolecular assemblies. Advances, and novelty in structure design, synthesis, characterization and applications will be emphasized. The meeting will provide an open platform for active researchers to present their recent achievements, and allow for the exchange and dissemination of knowledge, ideas, and visions among researchers including graduate student and postdoctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF funding was provided to support a symposium titled "Advance in Functional Polymers with Sophisticated Branched Structures", held in Philadelphia, PA on August 21-25, 2016. The symposium included four regular sessions with a total of 30 oral lectures and an additional poster session that featured 9 posters. The symposium allowed exchange and dissemination of information among researchers from various countries, including many US academic laboratories. The symposium covered the latest advances on the synthesis and application of functional polymers with sophisticated nanostructures, including star polymers, graft polymers, molecular brushes, dendrimers, (hyper)branched polymers and various branched polymer structures constructed from supramolecular assemblies.     Intellectual merit:  The rapid development of polymerization techniques and polymer reaction chemistries has generated significant progress on the synthesis of functional polymers with sophisticated nanostructures, and subsequently led to the exploration of their novel properties that can be utilized for new applications in biomaterials, nanomedicines, catalysis, environmental remediation and sustainable energy technologies. Although conventional polymer structures, such as star polymers and graft copolymers, have been commonly synthesized, future development in this area urgently requires not only judicious synthetic strategies to next-generation nanomaterials, but also intensive collaboration and knowledge exchange among synthetic chemists, polymer physicists and materials scientists.  The symposium covered the latest advances on the synthesis and application of functional polymers with sophisticated nanostructures, including star polymers, graft polymers, molecular brushes, dendrimers, (hyper)branched polymers and various branched polymer structures constructed from supramolecular assemblies, for the interests of both academic and industrial scientists. The topics included new structure design, polymerization methods, chemical modification and functionalization, structure-property relationship, as well as new concepts in characterization and applications.     Broader impact:  With the unprecedented development of new polymerization techniques, the synthesis and structural control of polymers with sophisticated structures has witnessed significant progress in the last decades. These polymeric soft nanomaterials have demonstrated interesting properties with great potentials in applications ranging from nanomedicines, polymer catalysts, to self-healing materials and pollution salvation materials. On this aspect, both academia and industrial laboratories have reached a consensus on the importance of these types of nanomaterials. This symposium provides a fabulous platform for the exchange of expertise and ideas within this field and facilitate the discovery of new research directions. The knowledge gained from this symposium certainly benefits all participants, especially the graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Among the 30 oral presentations, 10 were given by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. All of the nice poster presentations were given by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. This forum provides a platform for the talented graduate students in US and around the world for networking to interact with academic leaders and industry scientists.     The entire budget ($3070) of the NSF support was dedicated to help offset the registration cost of meeting attendance for 14 presenters, including two graduate students, and three assistant professors.
