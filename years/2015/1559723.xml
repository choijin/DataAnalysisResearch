<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) site will support NSF's mission to promote progress of science by introducing big data analytics in Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) to undergraduate students, helping advance the state of art, and preparing them for the future scientific workforce. The site's objectives include (i) motivating and solidifying students' interest in Computer Science (CS) in general, and big data analytics in particular; (ii) providing students with problem solving skills for conducting research in big data analytics and for presenting scientific findings verbally and in writing; (iii) equipping students with working knowledge of applying data management and data analytics techniques, by involving students in research projects related to different aspects of CPS; (iv) enhancing self-confidence and self-efficacy of participants, by creating a sense of belonging to a diverse community; and (v) broadening participation in computing, and contributing to diversify the computing workforce. The research outcome will advance the state of the art of big data analytics and push the research agenda of utilizing big data techniques for CPS. The REU site will reach undergraduate students beyond the New Mexico State University (NMSU) campus and train workforce for big data analytics in CPS. Special emphasis will be placed on recruiting underrepresented students nationwide. The participating students will be mentored by the site researchers to disseminate their research projects' findings via professional conferences and through the REU site website. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this REU site initiative is to inspire and prepare undergraduate students to pursue careers in STEM with a focus on big data analytics for Cyber-physical Systems (CPS). PI's propose research projects to explore big data analytics for CPS in three intertwined layers: (L1) systems and architecture, (L2) models and algorithms, and (L3) visualization, spanning across four CPS application areas including smart grids, wireless sensor networks, smart homes for elderly and disabled, and disaster response. The planned student activities include: (i) team-based research activities on focused research projects, (ii) creation of cohorts, which will engage in training workshops, to develop research skills and to prepare for graduate schools, (iii) field trips to companies, and local and national labs to broaden students' research horizon, (iv) workshop and conference participation to present research findings, and (v) mentoring by faculty members and interaction with other student researchers. The proposed research outcome has the potential to advance the operation, protection, and utility of CPS. The research activities in the projects will equip student participants with skills and knowledge related to both big data analytics and CPS. The training workshops will help students develop research skills and their career paths. The field trips will broaden participants' understanding about data analytics research for CPS.</AbstractNarration>

We summarize our outcomes &nbsp;in what follows.</p> <p><br />Intellectual Merits.&nbsp;</p> <p>The participants have gained a broad understanding of big data analytics for CPS by working on different research projects. The students are trained on conducting research, writing critical research articles, making effective presentations, and applying for graduate schools and fellowships through different workshops.&nbsp;</p> <p>(1) Participant publications and presentations. The REU participants who were supported by this award have published 9 research papers in conference proceedings and workshops. Participants presented posters at different conferences such as the Emerging Researchers National (ERN) Conference in STEM, HEENAC conference.</p> <p>(2) Participants going to graduates schools. Among the 30 participants, 15 have obtained their bachelor's degree and 11 of them (73.3%) either have started their graduate studies or are going to start them in Fall 2018.</p> <p><br />Broader Impacts.</p> <p>Our REU Site has attracted the interest of many students. We received 97, 77, and 80 applications in the three years, respectively, and accepted 30 in total (11.8%). All selected participants meet the application requirements and have good academic preparation for the summer research.The participants of our REU site have shown diversity in their ethnicity and gender. We use the 2017 CRA Taulbee Survey as national norm for comparison. Among the 30 participants in our REU site, 11 are female. This ratio (36.7%) is much higher than the national norm (19.2%). The 30 participants are from different ethnicity groups: 11 Hispanics, 10 Caucasians, 5 Asians, and 4 African Americans. The participant ratios of Hispanic and African American participants (36.7% and 13.3%) are 4X higher than the national norm. These statistics show that our REU site has been very successful in recruiting minority students. In particular, we have focused on Hispanic students because NMSU is a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI). The participants are from 16 different states spanning from the east coast to the west cost.</p> <p><br />Other Impacts.</p> <p>The REU Site has been instrumental in creating a campus-wide interest on data analytics at NMSU; new collaborations among mentors have emerged, leading to submissions of joint proposals. The site has also been effective in coalescing expertise, leading to a proposal for the development of a new Master's degree in Data Analytics, which was approved in winter 2018.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/18/2019<br>      Modified by: Huiping&nbsp;Cao</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559723/1559723_10412182_1552762336407_2017_group_pictures_IMG_5056_up--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559723/1559723_10412182_1552762336407_2017_group_pictures_IMG_5056_up--rgov-800width.jpg" title="group picture in 2017"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559723/1559723_10412182_1552762336407_2017_group_pictures_IMG_5056_up--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="group picture in 2017"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Picture for 2017 summer participants, research mentors, and student helpers.</div> <div class="imageCredit">New Mexico State University</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Huiping&nbsp;Cao</div> <div class="imageTitle">group picture in 2017</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559723/1559723_10412182_1552763132457_2018_group_pictures_IMG_0583--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559723/1559723_10412182_1552763132457_2018_group_pictures_IMG_0583--rgov-800width.jpg" title="group picture 2018"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559723/1559723_10412182_1552763132457_2018_group_pictures_IMG_0583--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="group picture 2018"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Picture in summer 2018 for the whole group including REU participants, research mentors, and student helper.</div> <div class="imageCredit">New Mexico State University</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Huiping&nbsp;Cao</div> <div class="imageTitle">group picture 2018</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559723/1559723_10412182_1552924855473_2018_group_pictures_IMG_0583--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559723/1559723_10412182_1552924855473_2018_group_pictures_IMG_0583--rgov-800width.jpg" title="group picture 2016"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559723/1559723_10412182_1552924855473_2018_group_pictures_IMG_0583--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="group picture 2016"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Picture for 2016 summer participants, research mentors, and student helpers.</div> <div class="imageCredit">New Mexico State University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use -
