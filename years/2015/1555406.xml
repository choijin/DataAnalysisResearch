<AbstractNarration>Dynamics Days is a conference that focuses on nonlinear dynamical and complex systems, including physical and biological systems. The conference brings together experts in experimental techniques, theoretical analysis, and mathematical modeling. The themes of the conference include Mechanical Systems, Mathematical Sciences, Computing Sciences, Physics, Life Sciences, and Network Sciences. Funds are requested to support the participation of students and young researchers, who will have the opportunity to contribute talks or present in a poster session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last decades, Dynamics Days has established itself as a premier conference for interactions between specialists in different fields and between young and established researchers. The topics of the conference cover a variety of areas with overlapping interests in nonlinear dynamics, including mathematics, physics, engineering and the life sciences. This variety attracts participants from a broad range of fields.  Topics of emphasis in 2016 include, but are not limited to: Applications of Network Science to biological and social systems; Self-propelled particles, flocking, swarming; Complex materials, granular materials; Control and stability of dynamical systems and complex systems; and Pattern formation, fluid dynamics, nonlinear waves.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award allowed about 20 graduate students and post-docs to atatend the conference entiled "Dynamics Days" in Durham NC on January 7-10, 2016.  The conference has been held right after New Year and before classes start at most universities since its inception.  The conference website can be found at: http://ddaysus2016.phy.duke.edu/  The funding covered a few nights at the conference hotel, as described in the site: http://ddaysus2016.phy.duke.edu/?page_id=38  The international conference Dynamics Days covers a wide range of topics in the fields of nonlinear dynamics and complex systems and is highly interdisciplinary with a mix of mathematical modelling, theoretical analysis, and experimental research.  Topics of emphasis for 2016 included but were not limited to: Applications of Network Science to biological and social systems; Self-propelled particles, flocking, swarming; Complex materials, granular materials; Control and stability of dynamical systems and complex systems; and Pattern formation, fluid dynamics, nonlinear waves.  This is the 35th year of the conference, which has been held several times in the Research Triangle of North Carolina in the past because of the strong academic representation of these fields at the local universities.  The presentations were organized along the lines of longer invited presentations, shorter contributed presentatiosn, and a psoter session. The latter proved to be an ideal format in which young resechers were able to showcase their work.
