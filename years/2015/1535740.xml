<AbstractNarration>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) workers are critical for the innovative activities and technological growth of US firms and local economies. Foreign-born workers are a potential source of STEM labor that might therefore be capable of generating positive dynamic effects on output, wage, and employment growth that could benefit US firms, workers, and investors alike. On the other hand, foreign STEM workers could compete with native-born workers, depress wages, and possibly discourage Americans from pursuing STEM occupations. The net effects of foreign-born STEM labor will depend upon the strength of these two countervailing effects. This project will examine these issues using data variation driven by numerical quotas on H-1B work permits -- the main channel of entry to US labor markets for skilled foreign-born workers -- that affect the distribution of foreign-born STEM workers across firms. This project produces reliable estimates of the impacts of an increase in the number of H-1B workers on US firms' productivity, employment, wages, and growth. This provides a very important policy evaluation tool to assess costs and benefits of changing the H-1B quota as discussed in recent immigration reforms. Using these estimates, we will be able to simulate how changes in the number of H-1B workers can affect firm growth and outcomes for US workers under different policy scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first phase of the project will merge various datasets. Individual H-1B application records for 2000-2012 -- including information about the employer, location, type of work permit, and year -- were obtained from the US Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services. They will be merged with detailed firm-level information -- derived from confidential data in the US Census -- containing all relevant firm outcomes (such as revenues, wages paid, employment, profits and expenses). The resulting database will be used to produce a complete picture of the link between H-1B workers and the performance of firms in the US between 2000 and 2012. This will provide very important information on the nexus between the H-1B program and firm-level innovation and productivity. The second phase of the project will exploit the fact that lotteries were used to allocate H-1B work permits in 2007 and 2008. This random distribution allows credible estimation of the impact of foreign skilled workers on outcomes of US firms. The analysis will quantify the effect of one additional H-1B worker on firm productivity, investment, innovative activity, and profits. It will then estimate the effects of these workers on the employment and wages of native-born STEM workers. Finally, it will assess how long it takes for these effects to appear so that we can characterize the time evolution of these outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

This paper evaluates the efficacy of one particular aspect of H-1B policy--the quota on new issuances.

In other words we ask whether the employment of new H-1B workers would have evolved differently without the drastic reduction of the quota in 2004.

First, we show that the total annual petition counts in our micro data closely match USCIS-published records of aggregate issuances overall, by occupation, and by country of origin. Next, we use string-matching techniques to build a longitudinal company-level dataset for approved petitions, distinguishing between petitions for initial and continuing employment. This dataset contains roughly 400,000 company names. These data clearly show a very large increase in the concentration of H-1B workers, with a 150% increase in the share of new initial-employment H-1Bs awarded to the top-20 petitioning firms between 2008 and 2012, with an increasing role played by global IT consulting companies. Last, we match our dataset on approved H-1B petitions to Compustat data on all publicly traded companies. The data show that roughly 42% of Compustat companies had at least one approved petition over our sample period. We also find that firms using the H-1B program are larger on average and have higher growth rates than non-users.
