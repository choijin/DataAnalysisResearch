<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address current technology bottlenecks that are slowing advances in semiconductor manufacturing as conventional planar and advanced (FinFET) transistor technologies reach physical limits for scalability.   This project seeks to continue Moore's Law and advances the Silicon metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor development using a new device architecture.  This design may enable more power-efficient electronics to advance high performance computing, computer memory, mobile electronics, and the emerging Internet-Of-Things applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide successful validation of a new metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) device and manufacturing process can provide a cost-effective proof-of-concept of the underlying device physics. The general challenge in developing nanoscale MOSFETs is that device sizes are comparable to some critical quantum physics material parameters and the channel length is approaching the mean free path of carriers in silicon.  This work seeks to validate the devices using  Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) modeling and simulation tools. Design-of-experiments tables will also be developed to create effective test structures for fabrication in follow-on work. Two-dimensional quantum screening and other critical phenomena not properly modeled in TCAD  will be corrected using theoretical methods and experimental data from related research. This project seeks to provide the scientific basis for optimal, manufacturable three-dimensional nanoelectronic devices and characterization of the quantum effects that dominate their operation in the ballistic regime. Phase I will prove/validate device and processing concepts to motivate the fabrication and characterization of devices and test structures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Transistors are the basic building blocks of the information age, our personal electronic devices and the networks and computers that bring us "the Internet." Over the past fifty years, many recurring reductions in the size and costs to manufacture these transistors have seeded successive generations of electronic products and systems with substantially enhanced performance, features, portability and affordability, the use of which have broadly benefitted individuals, industry, infrastructure and institutions of all kinds and fueled global economic growth.  Recently the rate at which industry has delivered new reductions in transistor size has slowed, and it has become increasingly more difficult and more expensive to sustain the trends set by past progress. In the past five years significant new transistor innovations have been required to move the industry forward.  FinScale, a California-based small business, has invented new transistor device designs and associated manufacturing processes to enable further transistor and circuit size reductions. FinScaleÆs logic and SRAM transistor is called the Quantum FinFET because quantum effects have become a significant design consideration for fin-based transistors at the nanometer-scale sizes required for further miniaturization.  In silico validation of FinScaleÆs Quantum FinFET transistor inventions has been funded by the NSFÆs Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. Work performed in this project has demonstrated that the performance and power efficiency of manufactured Quantum FinFET devices can exceed the known best industrial achievements to date, and extend progress in transistor and circuit miniaturization into the future. Results from this research are helping FinScale to engage manufacturing partners to commercialize this technology.
