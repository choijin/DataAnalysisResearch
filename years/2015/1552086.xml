<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on increasing the understanding of how human-produced emissions combine with biogenic emissions from forests to influence the formation of small particles in the atmosphere.  A mobile laboratory will be deployed to two different types of forests (urban and remote) in order to compare and contrast the impact of long-range and short-range transport of nitrogen species to forests. The results will lead to improved control strategies that minimize the health, visibility and climate effects of anthropogenic emissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of the science campaign are to: (1) Characterize the ambient aerosol, radiation, and trace gases at two forest sites, both above and below the canopy, and along a north-south transect in the central United States; (2) Quantify the level of oxidation found in SOA using atomic ratios (such as the oxygen to carbon ratio, O:C) and determine the impact the presence of particulate organic nitrate (PON) has on the observed oxidation state of the submicron particulate matter (PM); (3) Investigate how in-canopy gradients and through-canopy transport impact submicron PM, PON, and oxidants; (4) Determine the impact nitrogen oxides (NOx) have on volatile organic carbon (VOC) oxidation and SOA formation in all locations; (5) Compare and contrast the chemistry of remote, on-road, and urban forested areas; (6) Identify the factors contributing to SOA using positive matrix factorization (PMF) to identify important components of SOA under different levels of anthropogenic influence both above and below canopy; and (7) Investigate the fate of NOx in all locations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project focused on observations of organic aerosols in a rural forested environment in northern Michigan and an urban forested environment north of Houston, Texas.  Statistical source apportionment techniques were used to identify factors contributing to the observed organic aerosol concentrations at each of the forest sites. In addition, vertically resolved measurements of organic aerosols are lacking in forested areas.  For the Michigan data set collected during this project, source apportionment of organic aerosols at two different heights (above and below canopy) in the forest resolved three organic aerosol factors: one associated with transport from urban areas to the south, one associated with local organic aerosol formation from biogenic compounds (monoterpenes), and one associated with both organic aerosol from a biogenic compound (isoprene) and transport from clean areas to the north.  The composition, temporal variation, and apparent age of the organic aerosol between the above and below canopy inlets typically were similar.  When intermittent episodes of differences in organic aerosol mass loadings above and below the canopy were observed, potential driving factors included vertical differences in inorganic aerosols (predominantly sulfate) and ozone. Relationships between organic aerosols containing nitrate groups and biogenic precursor gases (monoterpenes) indicate a potential sink of nitrogen oxides in the rural environment.  The formation of the organic nitrate aerosols in the Michigan forest appears to be related directly to reaction of monoterpene compounds with nitrogen-containing trace species (the nitrate radical). Other findings for the Michigan fieldwork include that chemical species that constitute the organic aerosol are much more diverse (in terms of number of species) than previously observed.  It also was shown that aerosol particles were ?bouncier? at night compared to the daytime (which impacts their loss processes to the Earth?s surface and their ability to participate in atmospheric chemical reactions). Organic aerosols observed over summer periods in 2015 and 2016 in an urban forest north of Houston also were apportioned into organic aerosol factors. These factors include a factor similar to the aged/transported/urban factor from the Michigan study, a factor related to urban and motor vehicle emissions, and a factor representing organic aerosol formed locally. The estimated magnitudes of production and loss rates of the nitrate radical indicate its ability to oxidize biogenic precursor gases (monoterpenes) to form organic aerosols at night.  Using observations from each summer campaign, a steady-state nighttime model was developed and used to demonstrate the magnitudes of organic aerosol formation, a fraction of which are organic nitrates, under different trace gas conditions. Higher mixing ratios of biogenic precursor gases, nitrogen oxides, and ozone in the summer of 2015 contribute, in part, to the higher observed organic nitrates. Dissemination of results from this work include publication of scientific manuscripts (one published, one in review, one in complete draft form, and two more in preparation) and presentations delivered as part of invited seminars and platform oral talks or posters at national and international conferences. The data collected and model developed are available by request.  In addition, this project developed personnel in scientific fields.  The graduate student supported by this grant for the first time experienced fieldwork, data analysis, and modeling.  In addition, while in the field in Michigan, our group participated in a program that provided research experience to a female undergraduate student in a technical field.
