<AbstractNarration>Due to the ubiquitous nature of software in the 21st century there is a great and increasing demand for software developers and programmers in the US.  Both Computer Science (CS) and Information Technology (IT) academicians and practitioners agree that a comprehensive strategy to improve the number and quality of 21st century CS/IT workforce is needed.  This project will assist colleges and universities in producing more well-qualified software developers through the use of a cyberlearning environment that builds on and extends WReSTT-CyLE (Web-Based Repository of Software Testing Tutorials), a cyberlearning environment for software testing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will: (1) investigate the impact that students' use of WReSTT-CyLE, at a cross-section of academic institutions, has on their software testing skills; (2) develop a theoretical framework of learning and engagement strategies that best support improvement of students' knowledge and skills in software courses for diverse student groups; (3) transform WReSTT-CyLE into a domain-independent cyberlearning environment for software and programming courses (SEP-CyLE) and repeat (1) above using SEP-CyLE for software courses; and (4) conduct biannual workshops to expose instructors to how SEP-CyLE may be used in the classroom to support pedagogy. The research in (1) will include mixed methods studies with both qualitative and quantitative components.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Outcomes of the Project Due to software's ubiquitous nature in the 21st century, there is a great demand for software developers and programmers in the US. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the number of software developers will increase by 22% from 2012 to 2022, much faster than the average for all occupations. Computer Science (CS), Information Technology (IT), and Software Engineering (SE) academicians and practitioners agree that a comprehensive strategy to improve the number and quality of the 21st century CS/IT/SE workforce is needed. This project scales up an NSF Transforming Undergraduate Education in STEM (TUES) to improve students' learning outcomes in CS/IT/SE by providing them access to a cyberlearning environment (SEP-CyLE &ndash; Software Engineering and Programming Cyberlearning Environment).  SEP-CyLE provides students and instructors access to vetted learning content (learning objects and tutorials) using a combination of learning and engagement strategies (LESs). These LESs include collaborative learning, gamification, problem-based learning, and social interaction. Collaborative learning - two or more people work in groups mutually searching for understanding and solutions to a problem. Gamification - uses game design elements to improve user experience and engagement in an educational context. Problem-based learning - an approach to learning and instruction in which students tackle real-world problems in small groups under a tutor's supervision. Social interaction - enhances knowledge acquisition through social activities, such as students establishing dialogue within student groups and teachers. The main goals of this project are (a) to determine the impact the LESs used in SEP-CyLE have on a cross-section of student groups (from multiple institutions) using appropriate research techniques, and (b) to apply the positive effects of the research to software engineering and programming using SEP-CyLE. To accomplish these goals, the project team:   Extended the cyberlearning environment developed in the TUES project.   Developed a framework to integrate LESs into learning activities in the classroom.   Hosted faculty professional development workshops.   Conducted research studies to determine the impact using SEP-CyLE, at a cross-section of institutions, has on students’ conceptual understanding and practical skills in software engineering and programming courses.   Cyberlearning Environment: SEP-CyLE (https://stem-cyle.cis.fiu.edu/) currently has 3,755 users (49 instructors and 3,702 students); 56 course shells &ndash; templates created for courses at different institutions; 160 courses were created using the course shells; and 2,472 students submitted a total of 34,901 learning object assessments that were graded.

These workshops are titled "LESSEP" - Using Learning and Engagement Strategies in Software Engineering and Programming Courses (https://stem-cyle.cis.fiu.edu/events).
