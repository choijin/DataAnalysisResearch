<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to understand and quantify hydrologic responses to long-term climate oscillations, such as the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), for 2733 individual watersheds across the conterminous United States.  These watersheds represent a wide range of terrain, land cover, land use, and climate conditions, and they include varying degrees of human disturbance.  With such an expansive dataset, the project will provide insight as to how and why watersheds respond differently (or not at all) to ENSO.  The study will improve scientific knowledge and understanding about climate impacts on the terrestrial water cycle, not only for multi-year climate oscillations but also for long-term climate change, which are both critical for managing water supplies, planning civil infrastructure, and preparing for natural disasters.  The project will also provide geospatially-oriented tools to improve hydrology education for K12 and university students while providing postdoctoral training for an emerging hydrologist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary analyses suggest that watersheds filter ENSO signals differently, even after accounting for variations in precipitation responses to ENSO across the country. Spatial characteristics associated with internal watershed organization are hypothesized to explain a significant amount of the observed variability in watershed responses to ENSO.  This hypothesis is rooted in geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH) theory, which links the spatial organization of watersheds to their hydrologic responses. This project builds on the GIUH framework and applies it to long-term climate phenomena such as ENSO, using statistical learning methods along with hydrological modeling to test hypotheses. Overall, the work seeks to improve scientific knowledge and understanding about climate impacts on the terrestrial water cycle by bridging the gap between mechanistic, watershed-scale studies of hydrological responses and large-scale studies of climate-streamflow interactions that are predominantly statistical in nature. This work acknowledges the so-called "big data" nature of many geospatial research problems in the hydrologic sciences and brings statistical learning methods, currently under-utilized in the field, to bear on large, publicly available datasets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hydrologic datasets are abundant, and they are growing in both number and record length.  Scientific agencies collect data from thousands of monitoring stations for streamflow, groundwater, and weather.  Models produce copious amounts of simulation data representing historic hydrologic conditions and future scenarios.  Machine learning techniques have the potential to leverage these types of datasets to answer basic scientific questions and to address broader societal issues surrounding water.  We brought some of these techniques to bear on questions related to the tendency of watersheds to act as filters for climate signals. Specifically, we applied tools such as gradient-boosted regression trees and deep neural networks to large hydrologic datasets to study streamflow responses to multi-year climate oscillations such as the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in watersheds throughout the conterminous United States. The watersheds represent wide-ranging climate, and cover, and other conditions.  We used machine learning techniques to identify climate factors - such as the timing of precipitation - and landscape factors - such as forest cover - that influence the ability of a watershed to transmit ENSO and other low-frequency climate signals. For many years, hydrologists have treated watersheds as signal filters in models and conceptual frameworks such as the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph, but this work broadens scientific discourse in this area by (1) exploring filtering of multi-year signals by watersheds rather than individual storm or snowmelt signals; and (2) bringing machine learning tools and "big data" analyses to bear on relevant scientific questions.  We also used machine learning techniques to help identify factors that affect the change in water stored within watersheds from year to year.  After computing storage changes for nearly 1,000 watersheds in the conterminous United States, we used a machine learning model as part of a larger analysis of spatial factors that influence yearly storage changes. The analysis revealed a strong relationship between forest cover and year-to-year changes in water storage, a result that has implications for plant-water (i.e., ecohydrologic) interactions and for the signal filtering nature of watersheds.  We disseminated our work to date via publications in Water Resources Research and presentations at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting.  The project‚Äôs broader impacts involved the training early career scientists (two postdoctoral research associates and one undergraduate student) and the development of hands-on teaching exercises that focus on the basic analysis and interpretation of time series datasets, including datasets used in the more advanced analyses described previously.  The exercises take advantage of freely available software and introduce students to basic coding.  We refined the exercises in hydrology courses at North Carolina State University, introducing approximately 60 students (advanced undergraduates and graduate students) to concepts such as stationarity, periodicity, and autocorrelation.  We published final versions of the collected exercises as a teaching unit in the Hydrology Education section of Carleton College‚Äôs Science Education Resource Center (SERC) website.
