<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Cyber-Human Systems Program in the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer Science and Engineering, the Gravitational Physics Program in the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the Office of Integrative Activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This innovative project will develop a citizen science system to support the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (aLIGO), the most complicated experiment ever undertaken in gravitational physics. Before the end of this decade it will open up the window of gravitational wave observations on the Universe. However, the high detector sensitivity needed for astrophysical discoveries makes aLIGO very susceptible to noncosmic artifacts and noise that must be identified and separated from cosmic signals. Teaching computers to identify and morphologically classify these artifacts in detector data is exceedingly difficult. Human eyesight is a proven tool for classification, but the aLIGO data streams from approximately 30,000 sensors and monitors easily overwhelm a single human. This research will address these problems by coupling human classification with a machine learning model that learns from the citizen scientists and also guides how information is provided to participants. A novel feature of this system will be its reliance on volunteers to discover new glitch classes, not just use existing ones. The project includes research on the human-centered computing aspects of this sociocomputational system, and thus can inspire future citizen science projects that do not merely exploit the labor of volunteers but engage them as partners in scientific discovery.  Therefore, the project will have substantial educational benefits for the volunteers, who will gain a good understanding on how science works, and will be a part of the excitement of opening up a new window on the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an innovative, interdisciplinary collaboration between the existing LIGO, at the time it is being technically enhanced, and Zooniverse, which has fielded a workable crowdsourcing model, currently involving over a million people on 30 projects.  The work will help aLIGO to quickly identify noise and artifacts in the science data stream, separating out legitimate astrophysical events, and allowing those events to be distributed to other observatories for more detailed source identification and study. This project will also build and evaluate an interface between machine learning and human learning that will itself be an advance on current methods. It can be depicted as a loop: (1) By sifting through enormous amounts of aLIGO data, the citizen scientists will produce a robust "gold standard" glitch dataset that can be used to seed and train machine learning algorithms that will aid in the identification task. (2) The machine learning protocols that select and classify glitch events will be developed to maximize the potential of the citizen scientists by organizing and passing the data to them in more effective ways. The project will experiment with the task design and workflow organization (leveraging previous Zooniverse experience) to build a system that takes advantage of the distinctive strengths of the machines (ability to process large amounts of data systematically) and the humans (ability to identify patterns and spot discrepancies), and then using the model to enable high quality aLIGO detector characterization and gravitational wave searches.</AbstractNarration>

Glitches are instrumental or environmental in nature (e.g., caused by small ground motions, or fluctuations in the laser) and come in a wide variety of shapes in time, frequency, and amplitude. These artifacts reduce the rate and clarity of GW observations by producing false-positive results in GW searches, reducing the significance of true GW signals, biasing astrophysical parameter estimation, and reducing the amount of analyzable data.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To minimize all of these effects, the causes of glitches must be identified and fixed within the detectors (in the best case) or the glitches must be distinguished from GWs and removed from the data set. Identifying which of the hundreds of thousands of glitches share a similar shape is an important first step toward this effort. Attempts to use machine learning algorithms have shown promise in glitch classification endeavors, however these techniques do not yet capture the full range of glitches present in our detector data. Human ability to recognize patterns is a proven tool for such diverse classification endeavors, but the high volume of data that LIGO and Virgo streams would easily overwhelm any small group of scientists.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To address this challenge, we developed Gravity Spy: an interdisciplinary project that combines the strengths of both humans and computers to create a superior classifier of glitches in GW detector data. The Gravity Spy project couples human classification with machine learning models in a symbiotic relationship: volunteers provide large, labeled sets of known glitches to train machine learning algorithms and identify new glitch categories, while machine learning (ML) algorithms learn from the volunteer classifications, rapidly classify the entire dataset of glitches, and guides how information is provided back to participants.

Glitches are classified into the known classes using a convolutional neural network. The ML provides a level of confidence for the classification which we use to guide training: images that the ML is relatively certain of are used to train new volunteers, while those with a high level of uncertainty are routed to more experienced volunteers. An analysis of volunteer accuracy showed that the ML correctness (as compared to human classification) does in fact fall off with lower ML confidence (as expected). New volunteers are exposed to new classes of glitches gradually, moving through a set of training levels in which additional classes of glitches are added. This training scheme improved volunteer accuracy and contributions compared with showing volunteers all known glitch classes at once.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">During the lifetime of Gravity Spy, we have classified 200,000 glitches in this manner. This valuable database of glitches, labelled by humans, our machine learning algorithm, or both, has enabled LIGO scientists to perform long-term studies on the properties of certain glitch families. For example, the Blip glitch, the most disruptive glitch for GW data analysis, has been tied to the level of humidity at the sites. The study concluded that periods of low humidity corresponds to a higher rate of the Blip glitches.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A second novel feature of Gravity Spy is that there are classes of glitches in the data that are not yet known by the LIGO and Virgo scientists.

The Gravity Spy volunteers have enabled the discovery of a number of new glitch classes that were previously unknown.
