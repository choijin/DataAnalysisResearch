<AbstractNarration>Workforce development and career pathways of non-faculty IT professionals, scientists, and engineers who are in the support role of the computation and data-enabled scientific research and development enterprises at various universities, supercomputing and other centers and national laboratories are issues of national importance.   This project proposes a workshop and related set of activities to explore and report on the status, career pathways, training, and growth opportunities of this community of "cyber-practitioners."  The workshop's results will impact the community itself, and those communities of faculty members, students, domain scientists and administrators it interfaces with.  This project will help map the contemporary landscape of cyber-practitioner skills and occupations, help identify professional development opportunities, and suggest better ways of integration into the university structures and other administrative units relevant to this community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together a diverse set of stakeholders including non-faculty IT and scientific professionals from universities, computing centers including supercomputing centers and programs such as XSEDE, campus champions, and from national laboratories, and representatives from faculty in computational sciences, and university administration.  The project will carry out a career-path analysis survey to document cyber-practitioner career progressions, and prepare a skills inventory of their soft and hard skills.  The workshop intends to define the cyber-practitioner profession and address questions pertaining to entry into and exit from the profession, career challenges, typical modes of training and preparations, and growth options and fit within university and other relevant administrative structures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project?s goal was to study the current state of the cyberpractitioner profession, addressing questions pertaining to entry into and exit from the profession; identification of the career challenges, growth options, and fit within universities and other relevant administrative structures; and an analysis of the typical modes of training and preparation for the profession.  The project?s objective was to formulate community-based strategies and recommendations for formalizing this group of practitioners into a recognized set of professionals. The workshop was held in July 2016 in Washington, DC.  Stakeholders included 38 attendees from 25 institutions and organizations in 19 states nationwide, one from the United Kingdom, and representatives from three federal agencies &ndash; NSF, DoD, and DoE.  The workshop included sessions addressing: Cyberpractitioner Community orientation including "lightning talks" by campus and regional network representatives; Career Paths discussion including career trajectories, professional preparation including purpose-built curricula and career progression; International perspectives including discussion with Simon Hettrick of the UK?s Software Sustainability Institute; and an NSCI panel chaired by Irene Qualters of NSF including discussion of federal agency perspectives; and the Future of the Cyberpractitioner Community.  Two surveys were conducted among workshop participants. The first addressed Cyberpractitioner career development pathways, barriers, and enablers; the second identified strengths of and support for Cyberpractitioner positions. The workshop yielded the following findings: 1) the need for the creation of a persistent community to further professionalize this group into a recognized profession; 2) the ideal blend of technical and interpersonal skills as ideal fits for the role; 3) the need for a defined, multi-track career path from technical to management to research; 4) the value of exploring a formalized certification or educational foundation to incorporate best practices for technical knowledge and interpersonal and communications skills; 5) the value of a formal professional designation and ongoing professional development to achieve professional recognition; 6) the inclusion of job descriptions and work plans to facilitate Human Resource divisions? ability to invest and enable cyberpractitioner careers; and 7) the need for outreach and development of a community-derived organization to advance cyberpractitioner careers and skill sets. The workshop resulted in recognition of:  the need for continuing dialogue to formalize this community, the creation of a basic taxonomy to establish a baseline for this career path, the acknowledgement of the role of research cyberpractitioners in facilitating research, and the role these individuals play in integrating cyberinfrastructure and research.  Discussion of these findings has continued through different conference presentations, including those at Internet2?s Technology Exchange, Educause, and Supercomputing gatherings in 2016.  The workshop?s intellectual merit was derived from the comprehensive and community-informed analysis of the current state of the cyberpractitioner community and its characteristic academic setting; its broader impact was reflected in the necessity and value of cyberpractitioners to the nation?s rapidly evolving research environment and its focus on data-intensive investigation.
