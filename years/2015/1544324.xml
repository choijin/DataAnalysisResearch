<AbstractNarration>A strong background in mathematics is expected of college graduates so that they can thrive in the workforce as science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) professionals, and professionals in other technical and non-technical fields, as well as citizens able to navigate the variety of information available through the media and other sources. To this end, there have been efforts in the mathematical sciences to improve the learning and teaching of undergraduate mathematics. A body of research on learning and teaching now exists that provides evidence pointing to effective strategies for teaching of mathematics to college students. This project will produce an instructional practices guide to emphasize evidence-based student-centered pedagogies. This  instructional practices guide will serve as a research-based resource for mathematics instructors, both faculty and graduate students, at all types of higher education institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) is the largest professional organization focused on undergraduate mathematics and is the leading source for mathematics faculty professional development as well as resources for teaching and learning undergraduate mathematics. As such, the MAA is the natural and optimal lead organization to produce a resource intended to infuse research-based pedagogies into the teaching of undergraduate mathematics. For each topic addressed, the instructional practices guide will include a summary and synthesis of current literature on that topic. In producing these summaries, the project team expects to discover areas of research in which the evidence-base is better developed than for others. Thus, the project will also address two primary research questions: (1) What general pedagogies and/or specific instructional practices have a well-established empirical basis demonstrating their effectiveness (or lack thereof)? (2) What general pedagogies and/or specific instructional practices are in need of further research to establish an empirical basis demonstrating their effectiveness (or lack thereof)?</AbstractNarration>
