<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of the microscopic response of strongly correlated electron systems to doping and pressure. By their very nature, these materials are highly sensitive to impurities, and dopants are frequently used to tune their properties.  However, little is known about the microscopic behavior in the vicinity of dopant atoms, and how the impurities collectively modify bulk properties. This research project employs Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to probe high quality single crystals using a state-of-the-art diamond anvil pressure cell. A key focus of this project is graduate education, and it incorporates educational outreach activities to a broad range of students. Outreach efforts to a local elementary school include science projects that actively engage children in the scientific method and a course on condensed matter science for adult and senior citizen students through the university extension office. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Strongly correlated electron materials hold tremendous potential for new technologies, but a fundamental understanding of their relevant many-body physics remains one of the greatest challenges in condensed matter physics. Chemical doping is widely used as a straightforward mechanism to tune the ground state of these materials, often revealing rich phase diagrams including unconventional superconductivity and non-Fermi liquid behavior.  At the microscopic level, however, dopants strongly perturb the electronic degrees of freedom, in some cases giving rise to non-universal behaviors such as phase segregation and inhomogeneous glassy dynamics. These strongly inhomogeneous responses can mask intrinsic phenomena, and complicate the interpretation of bulk measurements. This project addresses the differences between doping and pressure as tuning parameters through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance studies of two prototypical correlated electron systems: the iron pnictide and heavy fermion superconductors. The research team is developing advanced new equipment to explore the microscopic behavior using diamond anvil cells to achieve large hydrostastic pressures, and mechanical clamps to achieve uniaxial strain in single crystals. Both techniques enable the study of the microscopic response of materials under conditions that have never been investigated with magnetic resonance previously. The outcome of this research is a more complete understanding how strong correlations in the presence of disorder influence macroscopic properties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of several key materials that exhibit unusual correlated electron behavior, including both high temperature superconductors and heavy fermion superconductors.   One of the most intriguing results of the iron-based high temperature superconductors is that they are highly sensitive to lattice distortions and strain.  We carried out experiments on high quality single crystals to test both how the magnetic fluctuations respond to strain, and how the orbital, or lattice fluctuations may be connected to the emergence of the superconductivity.  These experiments were carried out by investigating the NMR response of different isotopes in the materials, such as As-75 and P-31.  To probe the response to strain, we developed a unique capability in which a crystal is subjected to a uniaxial pressure to stretch or compress it.   The level of strain can be carefully controlled over many hours, and the crystal can be cooled to cryogenic temperatures and placed in high magnetic fields.    The NMR properties of the crystal are highly sensitive to strain. In particular, the quadrupolar coupling changes, reflecting the re-distribution of charge within the unit cell as the crystal is compressed.  In addition, the spin fluctuation spectrum changes in response to the strain, giving rise to a form of piezomagnetism.  Our results suggest that with sufficiently large strain the orientation of the magnetic order can change direction.  This project also supported the education of several graduate and undergraduate students, many of whom have now moved on to high level technical positions in academia and industry.  In addition, two courses on condensed matter science were developed for the public and given to a large audience of non-specialists.
