<AbstractNarration>Changes in federal regulations present challenges to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees' (IACUCs) abilities to effectively meet their responsibility for the oversight of animal care and use programs at the nation's biomedical research institutions. Often IACUCs are unaware of new regulations or have a limited understanding of the extent of their authority---both of these factors can affect their institutional compliance with federal guidelines. Directed efforts to improve IACUC training are required so that all IACUC members are engaged, highly knowledgeable, and confident in their role in assuring compliance with animal welfare regulations. Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research (PRIM&amp;R), an educational nonprofit organization, will develop the Train the Trainer IACUC Institute (TTII) in which a large cohort of national IACUC trainers will be trained to incorporate active and peer-directed learning in their educational activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific activities of the TTII are to: 1) hold focused training sessions to teach existing IACUC trainers to practice effective instruction using active learning techniques that have been shown to increase knowledge transfer and to encourage IACUC trainers to incorporate these active and peer-directed learning methods into their own courses and educational sessions for IACUC members and staff; and 2) to develop and utilize meaningful metrics that enable assessment and improvement of IACUC training programs. The ultimate goal of the TTII is to improve oversight of animal care and use programs nationwide by ensuring that oversight activities by IACUCs accurately reflect current regulatory standards and equipping IACUC members and staff with the knowledge and confidence to reduce regulatory burden while maintaining compliance with federal laws and standards.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The goals of the original NSF award, to reduce regulatory burden through workshops to train IACUC trainers in active learning methods (the Train-the-Trainers Institutes, or TTIs), and to provide support for these trainers via online dissemination of training tools and resources, have been met.     PRIM&amp;R implemented a new development model in designing the curriculum for TTIs?backward design. The planning process started with a focus on the goals of the workshop; once those were finalized, planners discussed what participants should know and be able to accomplish by the end of the session. This information was then used to determine how the content should be delivered, i.e., the active learning methodologies that should be utilized during the module for the most effective knowledge transfer.     Intellectual Merit: Various active learning and adult learning methodologies were utilized for the TTIs, in place of transmitting content through traditional didactic lecture and PowerPoint. These methodologies included, but were not limited to, role-playing exercises, debates in which participants defended assigned positions, concept mapping, consensogramming, and online/text messaging-based polling. These approaches provided TTI participants with the information, understanding, and (most importantly), the experience needed to allow them to incorporate active learning methods into their own courses and educational sessions, thereby equipping IACUC members and staff to reduce regulatory burden while overseeing humane animal care and use programs in compliance with federal laws and standards.     In addition, during the TTIs participants discussed issues of concern raised in the 2014 NSF National Science Board (NSB) study and the 2014 USDA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) audit. Another goal, to facilitate harmonization of agency standards, was accomplished through the combined efforts of representatives from five federal agencies (NIH OLAW, USDA APHIS Animal Care, NSF, FDA, and the VA), who joined together to develop a consistent animal care and use training curriculum for the TTIs, to facilitate group learning and to provide harmonized feedback for training modules developed by participants.      The intellectual merit of the project was further enhanced by IACUC training modules developed by TTI participants, which incorporate a variety of active learning methods in the delivery of the modules, including scenario-based role playing, debates in which they had to defend assigned positions, concept mapping, consensogramming, and online/text messaging-based polling. These modules were demonstrated during the TTI and are now available online for IACUC trainers, and the general public, to download, adapt, and use for their own educational sessions.     ICARE TTI participants who have implemented active learning techniques into their own curriculum have shared that they have seen:  Increased participant engagement during their trainings; Increased positive feedback from trainees; Decrease in repeat noncompliance for teams who were re-trained using active learning methodology.      Broader impacts: PRIM&amp;R?as well as TTI participants?have implemented these methodologies in building new courses and in restructuring existing ones in a variety of settings: at national face-to-face and virtual IACUC trainings, including those sponsored by PRIM&amp;R; at the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS) annual conferences; in the IACUC 101TM series; at the Scientists Center for Animal Welfare annual meetings; at the post-Forum workshop held in conjunction with the American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine (ACLAM)?s annual ACLAM Forum; and in trainings they have conducted within their organizations. Through these vehicles, a wider audience within the research oversight community has been exposed to both active learning techniques and training on ways to implement these methods in their day-to-day work.     PRIM&amp;R requested a no-cost extension to use the remaining award funds to expand PRIM&amp;R?s www.primr.org/iacuced website to reach a much wider segment of the vertebrate animal care and use community and provide them  more extensive educational resources.
