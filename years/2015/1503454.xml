<AbstractNarration>Given the changes in instructional practices needed to support high quality mathematics teaching and learning based on college and career readiness standards, school districts need to provide professional learning opportunities for teachers that support those changes. The project will build a coherent and scalable plan for providing these opportunities in high school mathematics departments, a traditionally difficult unit of organizational change. Based on the TRUmath framework, characterizing the five essential dimensions of powerful mathematics classrooms, the project brings together a focus on curricular materials that support teaching, Lesson Study protocols and materials, and a professional learning community-based professional development model. The project will design and revise professional development and coaching guides and lesson study mathematical resources built around the curricular materials. The project will study changes in instructional practice and impact on student learning.  By documenting the supports used in the Oakland Unified School District where the research and development will be conducted, the resources can be used by other districts and in similar work by other research-practice partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project hypothesizes that the quality of classroom instruction can be defined by five dimensions - quality of the mathematics; cognitive demand of the tasks; access to mathematics content in the classroom; student agency, authority, and identity; and uses of assessment. The project will use an iterative design process to develop and refine a suite of tool, including a conversation guide to support productive dialogue between teachers and coaches, support materials for building site-based professional learning materials, and formative assessment lessons using Lesson Study as a mechanism to enact reforms of these dimensions.  The study will use a pre-post design and natural variation to student the relationships between these dimensions, changes in teachers' instructional practice, and student learning  using hierarchical linear modeling with random intercept models with covariates. Qualitative of the changes in teachers' instructional practices will be based on coding of observations based on the TRUmath framework. The study will also use qualitative analysis techniques to identify themes from surveys and interviews on factors that promote or hinder the effectiveness of the intervention.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "TRUmath and Lesson Study: Supporting Fundamental and Sustainable Improvement in High School Mathematics Teaching" is a collaboration between the University of California at Berkeley, the Oakland Unified School District, Mills College, and the Strategic Education Research Partnership (SERP).  The major goal of this project was to engage in design research to develop and implement a replicable model for a coherent, department-wide approach to professional learning focused on creating classroom environments that produce the powerful mathematical thinkers envisioned by the Common Core State Standards in mathematics.  The theoretical basis for the work is the Teaching for Robust Understanding of Mathematics Framework (TRU Math). The framework indicates that students will emerge from classrooms as knowledgeable and resourceful thinkers and problem solvers to the degree that instruction:  (1) offers engagement with rich and deeply connected mathematical content and practices;  (2) is situated so that students are challenged to grow, in ways that support ?productive struggle?;  (3) engages every student meaningfully with central content and practices,  (4) supports the development of student agency and positive disciplinary identities by providing opportunities to build individual and collective understandings; and  (5) keeps instruction accessible by use of formative assessment, making student thinking public and adjusting accordingly.  See the Figure, "TRU Mathematics Framework."   Using a model of lesson study grounded in the TRU Framework, the project engaged teachers in a range of professional development opportunities. It focused on building teacher community and teacher capacity, supporting collaborative work on teacher-defined problems using the TRU-Lesson Study model. The work was designed in ways that supported deeper understandings of student and teacher learning, resulting in a number of research papers that deepen the field?s knowledge; it produced a number of professional development tools that are available for use by mathematics departments and school districts, and other teacher learning communities. Papers and TRU-related tools are available at the TRU Framework website, https://truframework.org/; a set of materials that supports two full years of professional development for teacher learning communities is available at https://www.tru-lessonstudy.org/home.
