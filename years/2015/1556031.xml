<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in advanced manufacturing. This project will develop a low cost, small-footprint high-resolution nanomanufacturing platform for building optical devices that are traditionally manufactured using cleanroom microlithography. Compared with modern cleanroom approaches that require significantly more complicated and expensive facilities, this platform holds strong promise to build visible-to-infrared wavelength optical components that are both smaller and lower cost, in order to serve the fiber-optic sensor, telecommunications, and lens markets. If this platform can deliver optics components that meet specifications, demand could reach 8-figures for a single customer, thus transforming optics manufacturing across the entire spectrum of markets that use photonics: biomedical, energy, military, and consumer. If it meets the needs of the photonics sector, this platform could penetrate a much broader commercial marketplace such as information technology, nanoelectronics and personalized low-cost consumer devices. The scientific and technological understanding created by developing this platform could enable businesses to leverage low-cost US-based nanomanufacturing to address markets for advanced materials and components around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will commercialize an innovative nanomanufacturing platform for producing diffractive optical elements (DOEs) with potential to reduce component cost and size.  Recently fiber-optic communications has expanded beyond its traditional function of long haul or backbone communications. Reducing the size, cost and complexity of optical components could allow DOEs to further expand their reach. Ideally the functionality of these components could be built right onto the end of an optical fiber. The proposed technology could allow true fiber-to-fiber components at a cost equal to or less than currently available optical components. It could further allow for sensing capabilities of "lab on a fiber" with the lab incorporated onto the end-face of a fiber. The project will focus on scaling the nanomanufacturing capability demonstrated during Phase I for end product prototype demonstrations that incorporate the DOEs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focused on commercializing a transformative nanomanufacturing technological platform. Known as Pattern Transfer NanoManufacturing (PTNMTM), this platform produced prototype Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs) for specific end products. These product concepts were validated by assessing their performance with these prototypes in comparison with currently available alternatives. While developing and integrating these prototypes, PTNMTM was continuously optimized with regards to quality, volume, and tools required to scale manufacturing.  The intellectual merit of this project involved optimizing the PTNMTM platform for assembling magnetic nanoparticles into user-designed patterns onto the surface of magnetic field templates and subsequently transferring the nanoparticle patterns onto various substrates for manufacturing DOEs.  A number of project outcomes resulted from this project:  Prototypical DOEs including polymer phase gratings, fused silica phase gratings, blazed reflection gratings, PTNMTM logos, and arrays of pixelated filters were developed for manufacturing end products. End products including convex and concave gratings, UV-VIS spectrometers, tunable fiber-optic UV filters, fiber-optic pump and signal combiners and wavelength calibration standards were built and their performance was characterized and analyzed. The performance of instruments and systems used to record magnetic field templates was improved to increase the manufacturing productivity. New functionalities utilizing disk read heads to monitor recorded magnetic patterns were added in the recording systems to enhance the pattern quality. Two new methods were developed to improve the recording speed up to 1.2 mm/s while maintaining the recording quality. A new "pixel" recording approach was developed to custom make patterns, allowing for the creation of all kinds of patterns and rapid turnaround for rapid prototyping applications.  A new process was developed to assemble non-polar solvent-based nanoparticles on magnetic field templates. This offered benefits including fewer defects and cost reduction. An innovative methodology was developed to transfer nanoparticle patterns from the surface of templates onto various substrates with advantages including rapidness, wrinkle-free and crack-free transfer. In addition, this methodology removed limitations on materials selection and allowed for a great flexibility in choosing appropriate materials for manufacturing prototypes and products. Preliminary magnetic recording media with appropriate properties were grown toward developing media specifically designed for PTNMTM that provides precision control over the nanoparticles during the directed magnetic field self-assembly.      The broader impacts of this project include tremendous progress in optimizing PTNMTM platform and developing prototypes and products, showing great potential to provide fiber optics and optical sensors markets with low-cost optical components and end products while meeting current performance specifications. A tremendous opportunity exists to lower (increase) optical element manufacturing costs (output) without the cost and complexity of cleanroom microfabrication. In addition, more than 300 customers were contacted, 50 of them deemed high-value contacts, and more than 10 prototypes/end products were evaluated by customers. This customer discovery and prototype evaluation process has validated that optical elements made with the PTNMTM technology have a great market feasibility.
