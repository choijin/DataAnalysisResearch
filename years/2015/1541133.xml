<AbstractNarration>Neurons that are being formed in the brain of a developing animal send out electrical signals that spread like waves over large parts of the brain.  The waves are essential for normal brain development.  The goal of this project is to find out how this spontaneous electrical activity controls brain development.  Recently, a specific type of neuron has been identified as being the pacemaker, or trigger, for these waves. This project will study how these neurons trigger the spontaneous waves.  The project will take advantage of a mouse that allows these neurons to be stimulated using light.  The responses of the neurons to these stimuli will be monitored, and the results will be used to make computer models of the neurons.  These models will reveal the properties of these neurons that allow them to produce the waves.  The project will offer opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to be trained in interdisciplinary research that involves both theoretical and experimental biology, under the guidance of two collaborating principal investigators with unique expertise in these areas.  Emphasis will be placed on actively recruiting women into full participation in the computational aspects of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how the intrinsic electrical properties of developing GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex allow them to initiate spontaneous waves of electrical activity during early development.  Previous genetic and pharmacological data indicate that these neurons, which are excitatory during early development, are the primary pacemakers for waves of spontaneous activity in the mouse cortex between embryonic day 18 and and postnatal day 3.  The detailed input:output relations of GABAergic neurons will be determined by using calibrated optical stimulation in a dlx5/6 channel-rhodopsin mouse and by recording the outputs of the neurons with extracellular electrode arrays.  Conductance-based models of the neurons will be constructed that reflect the diversity of intrinsic properties that are encountered in the population.  The model neurons will be connected into synaptic circuits to determine whether the measured properties lead to pacemaking activity in the circuit.  By systematically varying the intrinsic properties in the model, aspects of the intrinsic properties that are critical for pacemaking function will be determined.  If successful, this project will provide a new high-throughput method for determining how the intrinsic properties of neurons determine circuit output in the brain.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are two general types of neurons in the cerebral cortex of the brain: excitatory neurons, which use synaptic transmission to increase electrical signaling in neighboring neurons, and inhibitory neurons, which do the opposite.  During early brain development, these two types of neurons arise from entirely different structures in different regions of the developing brain.  Both types of neurons migrate from these points of origin to similar final locations in the brain.  Despite their different points of origin, and the resulting difference in the lengths of their migratory pathways, excitatory and inhibitory neurons born on the same day find each other in the same location in the brain.  This implites some kind of communication between the two populations.  This project investigated whether that communication was carried out via electrical signals.  In the developing brain, waves of spotaneous, synchronized activity propagate over wide areas.  Our experiments asked whether the two populations of neurons participate differently in these waves, as opposed to non-synchronized electrical activity.  We found that inhibitory neurons tended to be recruited into waves near the end of their migration, but to participate in non-synchronized activity at earlier stages.  There is a reciprocal relationship between the two types of activity.  We proposed, based on those data, that recruitment of inhibitory neurons into wave activity by their neighboring excitatory counterparts was a signal for the inhibitory neurons to stop migration and thus find their appropriate final locations.  To test this hypothesis, we used a genetically altered mouse with a defect in a molecule that determines the positioning of excitatory neurons.  If the two neuronal populations communicate to determine positioning, then we predicted that inhibitory neurons in this mouse should adjust their positions to compensate for the altered location of the excitatory neurons.  We found that they did.  We then proposed that if spontaneous wave activity were part of this communication, then those waves should occur normally in this genetically altered mouse, despite the gross defect in positioning of excitatory neurons.  We indeed found that waves occurred normally in this mouse, in spite of its gross defects in cortical structure.  This work has led us now to begin to quantitatively measure information transfer rates between the two populations during early brain development.
