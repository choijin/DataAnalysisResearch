<AbstractNarration>The study of neural coding asks how the brain converts raw signals into usable information that allows us to see, hear and think.  Studying the mechanisms of neural coding is a persistent scientific challenge that has important implications for uncovering the workings of the brain.  This award supports fundamental research that will enable a new approach to studying neural coding from the perspective of engineering theory.  This perspective recognizes that networks in the brain can be modeled in terms of their physics and, thus, studied using many of the same tools that are used to study complex engineered systems such as aircraft and power grids.  However, the brain possesses a level of complexity that far exceeds those of typical engineered systems and, consequently, existing engineering approaches must be adapted and augmented to meet biological realities.  By addressing these gaps, this research will lead to new methods in engineering, advances in neural technology, and new ways of studying human brain function.  This research is highly multi-disciplinary, involving systems engineering, mathematics and neuroscience.  As part of the award, several new initiatives will be pursued to facilitate dialogue across these disciplines and to foster increased participation of underrepresented groups in engineering and science through the establishment of summer research internships for local high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award approaches neuronal networks through the lens of dynamical systems and control theory.  This approach is based on the premise that understanding the input-output relationships of neuronal networks, mediated by their dynamics, will shed new light on fundamental questions in neuroscience, including the link between neural dynamics and information processing.  In pursuit of this goal, the award focusses on two main objectives:  First, neuroscientifically-motivated adaptions of systems theoretic properties, such as reachability, will be formulated so as to understand how dynamics govern neural input-output relationships.  Since the connections in brain networks constantly adapt, emphasis will be placed on the notion of a brain state, which characterizes both the activity and the network structure at a given time.  Second, control methods will be developed for the modulation of such states.  To do so, a new class of objective functions will be defined in terms of the systems-theoretic properties conferred by the network.  For example, such objectives will involve using controls to expand a network's reachable space, rather than just controlling its activity.  The control input in this context may be quite general, and several specific scenarios, including neurostimulation, will be studied.</AbstractNarration>
