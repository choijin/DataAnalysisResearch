<AbstractNarration>Observations indicate that 80% of the matter in the Universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary "dark matter" particles that don't emit or absorb light. Remarkably, particle physics theories proposed for other reasons predict the existence of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with just the right properties to be this dark matter. If WIMPs are the dark matter, they may be detectable when they scatter in Earth-based detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding for this Syracuse group to collaborate on the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (now SuperCDMS) that has a track record as one of the world's most sensitive. The PI will lead his group to achieve better rejection of surface interactions and identify neutrons that multiply scatter within a detector, aided by detailed simulations of the detector response. The group will help develop and construct a detector to veto events caused by neutrons and measure the expected neutron background in SuperCDMS. The group will take part in SuperCDMS detector testing, including making key contributions to a unique deep facility, demonstrating the rejection capabilities of new detectors and providing critical feedback for detector fabrication and development. The long-term activities include additional cryogenic detector research, focusing on technologies that allow easier manufacturing and the possibility of a single cost-effective experiment to detect both dark matter and neutrinoless double-beta decay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Technological development of phonon-mediated detectors has widespread applications in astronomy and physics. The project will help train undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs in a multidisciplinary field using techniques at the leading edge of measurement technologies with applications in areas of societal interest.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided support for two graduate students at 50% time (Mr. Yu Chen and Mr. Michael Bowles), several undergraduates, and 60% of the salary of post-doctoral research associate Dr. Ray Bunker, for work on the multi-institution SuperCDMS experiment, which is attempting to detect the dark matter that is believed to make up 85% of Universe?s mass.  The group led or contributed to many key results, with Dr. Bunker coordinating analysis of the experiment data for the entire collaboration over the last year of this grant.  The group made strong contributions to an analysis of experiment data that set new limits on dark matter interactions, and to another that set limits on interactions of lightly ionizing particles.  Operation of 15 SuperCDMS "iZIP'' detectors demonstrated the detectors' excellent ability to distinguish possible dark matter interactions from those due to natural radioactivity.  A new method of operating the detectors, pioneered previously in part by the PI, demonstrated the ability to achieve sensitivity to extremely low energy deposits.  The combination of these two demonstrations indicates the power of this detector technology for future searches for dark matter.   Mr. Chen performed analysis and prototyping work for a future detector to help veto interactions that are due not to dark matter but instead to neutrons.  He also analyzed results from a detector that, for the first time, measured the rate of interactions from neutrons in the underground sites typically used by dark matter experiments.  The group performed research and development of a system to remove radon from breathable air.  Radon in the air is expected to cause events that may mimic dark matter interactions, so the ability to create low-radon spaces for detector assembly is critical to future experiments.  The radon-reduction system achieved the milestone of producing too low a radon concentration to be measured with any commercial detector, with the upper limit on this level the lowest achieved in the literature by a cleanroom-scale mitigation system in North America.  Since radon in air has significant impact on health, this system may also provide a spin-off technology.  The group also constructed and started commissioning a system to measure how much radon is emanated by detector construction materials.  The system promises to be very useful for future experiments.  Broader impacts of this project include the completion and installation of two interactive displays on dark matter at Syracuse's Milton J. Rubinstein Museum of Science and Technology (the MoST),  which attracts more than 220,000 visitors annually.  The MoST displays comprise the third phase of an exhibit called "Cosmic Connections,'' which conveys some of the excitement and breakthroughs in cosmology to the general public.  One display allows visitors to lift weights in proportion to the energy density of each of the major components of the Universe - 0.5% stars, 4% normal matter other than stars, 23% dark matter, and 73% dark energy - giving a visceral understanding that what we see is little of what there is.  The second display challenges visitors to infer the location and amount of dark matter causing gravitational lensing distortions in a live video feed.  Twelve undergraduates, one post-baccalaureate student, and two high school students gained useful research experience and training while  contributing to the research supported by the grant.
