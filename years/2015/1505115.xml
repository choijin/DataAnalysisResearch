<AbstractNarration>Usage patterns in large-scale datasets, such as linguistic corpora collected from digital social media, can provide insights into many aspects of communication. These resources have inspired new quantitative analyses and measures, some of which originated with computer scientists, mathematicians, and physicists and others with psychologists and linguists. The technology itself is also being transformed in order to communicate the social and emotional aspects of human behavior. Innovative lines of inquiry attest to the mutual influence between technology and behavior and the transformation that ensues as the relevant disciplines come into contact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will bring together a panel of psychologists, linguists and computer scientists at the 2015 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Jose, CA. The theme of the meeting is "Innovations, Information, and Imaging." The panel will describe research and analytic techniques for developing new insights into how individuals convey and understand emotions in dialog, speech, and text. More broadly, the panel will discuss how linguistic and non-linguistic coordination arise across individuals and groups as they communicate using new technologies.</AbstractNarration>
