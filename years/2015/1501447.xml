<AbstractNarration>The "InnovATE" project is increasing graduates in STEM disciplines, particularly underrepresented minorities and women, in response to demand for local, highly-skilled workforce needs in the power, aerospace, and manufacturing industries. Synergistic programs are increasing awareness of STEM in middle through high schools, strengthening math skills, and developing a pathway for pursuit of associate and baccalaureate high-tech degrees. These programs include: a STEM outreach program impacting 1680 middle and secondary students; a summer program for incoming students to complete the Production Technician Certification earning 15 college credit-hours; a contextualized Intermediate Algebra gateway course to improve math skills proficiency; intensive academic support through math/science Supplemental Instruction; and articulation agreements to baccalaureate degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit drivers of InnovATE are aligned with rigorous assessments to advance understanding of which tools and strategies aid successful completion of associate degrees in Electrical Power and Engineering Technologies. This includes developing assessment tools and activities for identifying key factors influencing enrollment in STEM programs, establishing instructional supports needed in Mathematics, studying the influence of mentors and industry partners have on students to induce willingness to succeed, and evaluating learning strategies to advance discovery of how STEM technicians learn, study, and train. InnovATE will address the need to diversify the STEM workforce by targeting Title I schools as the primary pipeline for students from underrepresented groups enrolling in the college to advance desired economic and societal outcomes. In addition, InnovATE's broader impacts will provide a transferable model to increase students pursuing degrees to join a highly-qualified STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>

Our numerous outreach events were designed to evangelize on the vibrancy and meaningfulness of STEM content and careers, and included STEM competitions where students worked not only on ecological challenges, but did so under the theme of gracious professionalism. We connected not only with students and teachers, but also with parents and guardians, community non-profits, working engineers, and in so doing created an ecosystem. Our team also collaborated closely with supportive industry to host student tours of local manufacturing and aerospace facilities, engaging our Business Development Board, the Palm Beach County School District, and local businesses and community groups tied to STEM, education, or both. An important component of the InnovATE grant was our opportunity to bring college and secondary school students to campus to touch and experience real-world technology, and to tour local industry sites to bridge the gap between classroom and the career.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The grant intended to create a pipeline between young people and industry, which has a high demand for technically trained individuals. Specific target populations included young women and Title I high school students, who traditionally lack opportunities in, awareness of, and support to pursue engineering technology degrees, a college education in general, and/or a STEM career. Engineering-related jobs can lead to a successful, stable financial future for those who take interest in certain technological tracks, and help fulfill a local talent gap. The Electrical Power Technology (EPT) and Engineering Technology (ET) Associate in Science degree programs at PBSC maintain strong relationships with area companies who regularly offer internships and jobs to students, and provided robust vocal and financial support of the grant?s goals. Industry partners were a key component of our success in that they willingly hosted tours, served as adjunct faculty, donated equipment, and shared their time with students. We are so proud of their commitment to STEM education and gratefully recognize that it extends far beyond the grant period.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to working at the middle school and high school levels, the grant team met the objectives of supporting existing and prospective EPT and ET college students by offering 1) a specialized Contextualized Intermediate Algebra course (MAT1033, 4 credits) that taught math skills via the lens of problems in engineering and physics, and 2) peer tutoring specific to the EPT and ET courses. Students who complete the ET program will be able to continue their education and complete a bachelor?s degree through articulation agreements.</p> <p>The grant team offered two years of industry recognized CPT (Certified Production Technician) training and test preparation to 35 students at significantly subsidized costs.&nbsp; CPT is a national exam from the Manufacturing Skill Standards Council (MSSC) that provides core training in safety, maintenance, and production processes.&nbsp; These numbers are low as we encountered some difficulty identifying qualified and committed instructors to teach CPT, as well as issues offering the program schedule.&nbsp; Success came once PBSC agreed to articulate 15 credits towards the ET Associate in Science degree for CPT completers.&nbsp; The articulation allowed students to save tuition funds and boost academic advancement by matriculating 15 of the 60 credits towards the degree.</p> <p>Significantly, the InnovATE grant also resulted in the hiring of the first female hispanic Engineering Technology full-time faculty member and Department Chair.&nbsp; She represents not only a role model for modern and future generations of engineers but also has brought her experience and vitality to the campus.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several infrastructure upgrades at the College as a result of the grant enabled increased student enrollment, along with the development of new engineering degrees.

Students who complete the ET program will be able to continue their education and complete a bachelor?s degree through articulation agreements.  The grant team offered two years of industry recognized CPT (Certified Production Technician) training and test preparation to 35 students at significantly subsidized costs.  CPT is a national exam from the Manufacturing Skill Standards Council (MSSC) that provides core training in safety, maintenance, and production processes.  These numbers are low as we encountered some difficulty identifying qualified and committed instructors to teach CPT, as well as issues offering the program schedule.  Success came once PBSC agreed to articulate 15 credits towards the ET Associate in Science degree for CPT completers.  The articulation allowed students to save tuition funds and boost academic advancement by matriculating 15 of the 60 credits towards the degree.  Significantly, the InnovATE grant also resulted in the hiring of the first female hispanic Engineering Technology full-time faculty member and Department Chair.  She represents not only a role model for modern and future generations of engineers but also has brought her experience and vitality to the campus.   Several infrastructure upgrades at the College as a result of the grant enabled increased student enrollment, along with the development of new engineering degrees. In summary, the InnovATE grant implemented numerous activities and commitments to growing engineering education not only within our own state college but also in partnership with industry, 4-year universities and community stakeholders.
