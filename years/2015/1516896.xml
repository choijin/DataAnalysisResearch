<AbstractNarration>Ribonucleic acid polymers (RNA) are similar to proteins in that they can fold into defined three-dimensional shapes that are important for their function. RNAs have many functions in the cell in addition to coding for protein synthesis, and some long non-coding RNAs are now known to fold into structures that possess protein-like functions. This project will develop novel methods that will allow researchers to understand the complex process of RNA folding in biology, and to control this process to produce designed RNA molecules with desired three-dimensional shapes for use in synthetic biology. The project has the potential to revolutionize the study of RNA folding, providing a better understanding of how RNAs fold in living cells. To bring an appreciation of such biomolecular structures to the general public, the project will expand the "Molecular Playground," a system that projects animated, architectural scale molecular images in public spaces, with which the public can directly interact through a simple wave of the hand (a passerby can, for example, "grab" and rotate the molecule to see it from all sides). Specifically, the project will facilitate installation of inexpensive exhibits in middle and high schools, including those serving groups underrepresented in science, with an aim towards exciting young people towards the exploration of STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequential, cotranscriptional folding of long noncoding RNAs (ncRNA), often accompanied by programmed RNA polymerase pausing, is now appreciated to be critical to proper ncRNA function. Current in vitro RNA folding studies do not mimic the resulting directed topological constraints. Using toehold mediated strand displacement this proposal will develop a novel system that allows controlled, sequential release of RNA from an unstructured RNA-DNA duplex, modeling sequential, cotranscriptional folding. Breaking the exogenous displacing DNA strand into two segments or introducing mismatches in it allows the introduction of controlled pausing in folding. Initial characterization of the system will follow folding of fluorescent aptamers, and later studies will be directed at understanding folding of the coenzyme B12 riboswitch, a system known to require polymerase pausing. Critically, perturbations will not be introduced into the RNA itself, but will be engineered only into the displacing strand, providing a native fold in all cases. This novel approach has the potential to revolutionize the study of RNA folding, providing a better understanding of how ncRNAs fold in vivo, and providing new tools for synthetic biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Outcomes Report (200-800 words)     RNA, the central molecule in life?s Central Dogma and primordial biomolecule in the evolution of life on earth, is of substantial current interest in fundamental science, applications in nanotechnology, and emerging genetic technologies. Synthetic RNA is an essential tool in fundamental basic research across all kingdoms of life. The study of RNA viruses, CRISPR technologies, and alternative splicing are just a few examples where pure, engineered RNA is essential.  Designer RNA is increasingly used in the development of diagnostic sensors, plant biotechnology, and genetic regulation and editing approaches broadly.      These researchers and applications require high quality, custom designed synthetic RNA, and the preferred enzyme for this synthesis is bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. While this enzyme is highly capable of the faithful synthesis of RNA from a DNA template, attempts at "high yield" syntheses often yield a mixture of intended and unintended products, requiring tedious, low yield, and generally imperfect purification protocols.     A primary outcome of this research is the confirmation of a model for the addition of undesired 3? RNA extensions during synthesis. What have previously been called "nontemplated additions" are shown to be templated, not by the DNA as intended, but by the RNA itself. Product RNA, accumulating to high concentrations in preparative reactions rebinds the polymerase to prime these extensions, which are shown to be highly heterogeneous in nature.     Based on this mechanistic understanding, a set of primary outcomes of this research includes the development of approaches to prevent these undesired off-pathway reactions, leading to higher yields of RNA that is enriched primarily in the desired RNA species. These developments yield a substantially improved approach towards the synthesis of RNA that will benefit a vast range of RNA researchers. As a result, it will have dramatic downstream impact on fields ranging from cell biology, to plant and animal biotechnology, to emerging nanotechnologies of the twenty first century.     Finally, of necessity for this work, a new application of RNA-Seq proved essential to understanding the underlying mechanism(s). RNA-Seq, a relatively new next generation sequencing tool used widely in cell biology, was applied as an analytical tool to characterize the undesired RNA reaction products. This approach holds the promise of broad impact in the functional study of polymerases generally, and will augment more traditional gel electrophoretic approaches.
