<AbstractNarration>Wireless networks have become ubiquitous and we have come to depend on wireless access for a wide-range of applications. However, current wireless networks are very unpredictable in one critical aspect: communication delay. It is well-known and widely observed that the delays incurred in accessing a wireless network, regardless of which flavor we choose, can vary widely. The issue of unpredictable and often high latencies precludes wireless networks from being used in mission-critical environments. Even common applications, such as real-time video-conferencing, suffer from poor performance due to the unpredictable nature of these delays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Providing consistent low-delay wireless access will further enable mission critical applications as well as a host of real-time applications such as video and audio. The workshop will bring together thought leaders in the wireless field and help shape the research agenda in this area. The proposed workshop will help identify key impediments toward low-delay wireless networks. In particular, given the huge leaps made in wireless communications over the past decade, the workshop will revisit foundational principles, identify gaps in existing architecture, design and practice of wireless networking systems to enable consistent low-delay wireless networks, and specify future research directions in this area.  The workshop will be inter-disciplinary, involving researchers and practitioners from the wireless space ranging from the macro-scale satellite/cellular networks to the micro-scale on-chip wireless networks, as well as experts in the theoretical and systems aspects of wireless networks and communications. The outcome of this project will be a set of key technical issues that will need to be addressed and research directions to pursue in order to ensure low-delay wireless access for a large number of wireless devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project supported two workshops on the topic of low-latency wireless networks.  Wireless networks have become a ubiquitous part of everyday life all around the world.  Yet, wireless networks are very unpredictable on one critical aspect: communication latency. It is well-known and widely observed that the latency incurred in accessing a wireless network can vary widely. The issue of unpredictable and often high latencies precludes wireless networks from being used in mission-critical environments.   Today?s communication networks are largely geared towards latency tolerant (web, chat, email) content. Thus, these networks have been typically engineered with a focus on improving network capacity, with little attention to latency.  However, in a range of domains, a wave of socially useful applications are emerging based on automated sensors and actuators operating in closed-loop or open-loop control systems. In these systems, including internet of things (IoT) applications, vehicular networks, smart grid, distributed robotics, and other cyber-physical systems, the requirements for latency could be two or three orders of magnitude more stringent than traditional applications. In addition, there are immersive services such as augmented reality that also require latency much smaller than what is achievable in today?s wireless systems.   The first workshop supported by this project was held in March of 2015.  The workshop outlined the technical challenges and opportunities for achieving end-to-end low latency over wireless networks.  A follow-on workshop was held in November of 2016 and focused on emerging applications of: Telesurgery/Telemedicine, Manufacturing, and Augmented/Virtual Reality  with the goal of understanding the critical requirements of these application domains, and developing feasible architectures and technological solutions for meeting these requirements.  Workshop reports described the findings of both workshop in detail and can be found at:  http://inlab.lab.asu.edu/nsf/             Last Modified: 12/06/2016       Submitted by: Eytan Modiano]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
