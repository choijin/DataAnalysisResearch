<AbstractNarration>In the earthquake-cycle, tectonic faults slowly accumulate stress, due to plate tectonic motion of Earth?s surface, and then fail catastrophically in earthquakes.  One of the keys to simulating the earthquake cycle are friction laws that can be applied to both the fast, dynamic motion of earthquakes, as fault rocks rub and slide past one another in frictional contact, and the slow processes of stress accumulation between earthquakes that can take hundreds of years. In this collaborative work between Princeton and Penn State Universities, unusually well-controlled measurements of frictional sliding will be conducted while collecting simultaneous ultrasonic data on the sliding interfaces and sheared layers of fault gouge. The proposed work has important societal implications for seismic hazard assessment, earthquake forecasting, and an improved, fundamental understanding of earthquake nucleation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rate-and-state friction laws represent the current state-of-the-art in the laboratory and for numerical simulations of earthquake physics, including nucleation, dynamic rupture and the complete seismic cycle.  However, our understanding of friction memory effects and slip velocity dependence remains primarily empirical, which limits our ability to apply laboratory measurements to earthquake faults and/or to address the problems associated with predicting the behavior of tectonic faults from laboratory measurements.  To address these shortcomings, recent advances in ultrasonic monitoring of sliding rock surfaces and sheared granular fault gouge will provide fundamental insights into the physics and micro-mechanical origins of frictional behavior of tectonic faults. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

And although friction has been studied for decades, the microscopic-scale physical and chemical processes responsible for it remain poorly known.  The current state-of-the-art framework for modeling frictional sliding is known as "rate- and state-dependent friction", the name signifying that the resistance to sliding depends upon both the current rate of sliding, and the more nebulous "state" of the surface, with the latter dependent upon the recent sliding history.  Although the source of the rate-dependence is thought to be reasonably well understood, this is not true of the state-dependence.  State reflects some combination of the true area of contact between two surfaces (generally a small fraction, say a few percent, of the macroscopic surface area that appears to be in contact), and the quality of chemical bonds across the points of contact.  In principal, each of these quantities, true contact area and contact quality, can vary with slip or with time.  And although the variation of frictional strength with sliding rate and "state" amounts to only a small fraction (say a few percent) of the average friction value, the rate- and state-dependence is nonetheless very important &ndash; for example, it determines whether faults slide stably at the plate tectonic rate, or instead spend most of their life locked, sliding only occasionally and unpredictably in damaging earthquakes.  Numerical simulations also indicate that the length and time scales over which earthquakes nucleate depend upon the details of how state evolves with time.  Not understanding the microscopic mechanisms of the time-dependence of frictional strength makes it very difficult to extrapolate the results of numerical models of fault slip to real faults in the Earth.  For faults to host repeated earthquakes, the faults must "heal" (the friction must increase) between earthquakes.  The general consensus since the mid-1990's has been that surfaces sliding very slowly in the laboratory heal with time, even when the fault is not sliding.  By performing new laboratory rock friction experiments and re-interpreting old ones, we have shown in this project that slowly-sliding laboratory fault surfaces are instead better understood as healing only with slip.  In so doing, we have also reconciled some inconsistencies in the ways that standard laboratory sliding protocols have been interpreted.  In addition, for decades the general consensus has been that the evolution of "state" is determined mostly by changes in contact area on the surface rather than contact quality.  Preliminary new experiments we have performed instead suggest that changes in contact quality are more important.  This work is suggestive of future experiments that should be done to explore this further.    Natural fault surfaces are filled with finely-ground grains of the surrounding rock termed "gouge", and thus it is important to understand how friction operates in granular systems.  Since its inception, the source of the rate- and state-dependence in "rate- and state-dependent friction" has been thought to be the time-dependent deformation or chemistry acting at microscopic points of contact.  But by running numerical simulations of a granular gouge layer sheared between parallel plates, as a model of fault friction, we have shown that the phenomenology of "rate- and state-dependent friction" arises in a granular system even in the absence of time-dependence at the contact points.  Moreover, preliminary indications suggest that this model matches laboratory rock and gouge friction experiments better than the existing, more empirical equations commonly used.  The reasons for this are not well understood, but because these are numerical simulations, their output can be analyzed to better understand the source of this apparent success.  This will be the topic of future research.  Our ultimate goal in better understanding rock friction is to improve models of fault slip and earthquakes.  However, there are many processes operating in the Earth in the decades between repeated earthquakes (for example, fluid flow and the formation of new minerals) that are currently not well represented in most laboratory friction experiments.
