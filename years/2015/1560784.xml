<AbstractNarration>Dr. Nicolas Zwyns, of the University of California-Davis, along with an international team, will investigate the impact of climate change on the dispersal of early modern humans in Central and Northeast Asia. Previous studies have underlined the potential of this region to document early dispersals of modern humans, Neandertals and perhaps Denisovans along the Eurasian steppe belt. It is assumed, however, that it was particularly challenging for incoming human groups to adapt to the Late Pleistocene environmental setting. Starting from about 120,000 years ago and until the end of the Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago, the climate became increasingly unstable with sharp changes in temperature and moisture occurring at an accelerating pace. Hence some scholars have suggested that the peopling of regions with continental climate, such as Mongolia, would be highly dependent on the global variation in temperature and moisture. Climate improvements would favor demographic increases among human populations and trigger range expansions into territories that remained out of reach during the coldest periods. Other scholars argued that humans have been able to cope with challenging environments in most regions of Eurasia before the Late Pleistocene and climate change would have only little effect on population dynamics. These different views illustrate a lack of consensus regarding the impact that climate change had on the peopling of regions such as Europe, Central and Northeast Asia where human responses to such constraints are still poorly understood. The research holds broad significance because it sets within a deep chronological context the interaction between human behavior and climate variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Zwyns and his research team will address this issue by building up a high-resolution archeological and environmental sequence for North Mongolia. The research includes targeted excavations and sample collection at Paleolithic sites located along the tributaries of the Selenga River. The Selenga flows to the Northeast and connects Mongolia with Lake Baikal. Its drainage system has yielded the highest concentration of relevant archeological sites in Mongolia and in Siberia and holds one of the richest records for Northeast Asia. Through the analyses of sediments, fauna and using radiometric dating methods, an international team of an archeologist, a geologist, a zooarcheologist, and two geochronologists, along with other specialists will reconstruct the environmental history in and around the Paleolithic sites to better understand the environment in which humans first settled. The goal is to correlate several archeological sites and to build a solid reference sequences for a region where changes in material culture and in the environment can be observed throughout the last 50,000 years. Because it exhibits an extreme continental climate, North Mongolia is suited for studies of human response to sharp changes in climate. Building up a high-resolution and high-quality environmental and archeological sequence will create field and laboratory training opportunities for students and young professionals from Mongolia and elsewhere.</AbstractNarration>

Through the use of spatial analyses, sedimentology, micromorphology, and dating methods, it would generate a major archaeological sites documenting the earliest evidence for human occupations in the region. The primary goal was to evaluate the impact of climate on the human settlement patterns: were hunter-gatherer movements conditioned by temperate climatic episodes, or do we observe a a continuous occupation starting from 45,000 years ago? These research questions were inspired by a pilot project at the site of Tolbor-16, which suggested that humans first occupied the valley during a temperate episode, before retreating in other regions during the subsequent cold and arid period. They would return 5,000 years later during another climatic improvement episode. A hypothesis of climate-dependent dispersal emerged with other major questions in mind: when did humans settled in the region permanently, and what was the key of their success?</p> <p>Following our work plan, we re-excavated the site of Tolbor-4, we sampled the site of Tolbor-15, and we conducted a full-scale excavation at the site of Tolbor-21 and Tolbor-17. We have now 43 radiocarbon dates from archaeological bones dated in the same lab, and collected as many samples for luminescence dating. We have collected several hundreds of sediment samples for geological analyses, using a systematic approach in all the sites we investigated. Several thousands of stone artifacts were uncovered and mapped, along with animal bones, rare evidence of ornament and bone tools. Potential combustion features are currently investigated using geological, geo-chemical and spatial analyses. Most of this material is still under study but ultimately, it will allow us to describe in details the site formation processes, to clarify the chronology of human occupations, and to address our research questions.</p> <p>At this stage, we propose three preliminary observations relevant to our research goals. First, at all the sites we worked on, early human occupations are buried in laminated geological deposits. The latter illustrate cyclic environmental changes with alternate wet and dry episodes. We are still trying to understand the timing of these changes, but it suggests that humans repeatedly visited a region under unstable climatic conditions, between 45 to about 20,000 years ago. The situation changes with the Last Maximum Glacial when the environment becomes increasingly arid, until the end of the Pleistocene. Second, we have discovered phases of human occupations that were previously unnoticed and we suspect that some peopling event, perhaps of lesser magnitude, are yet to be discovered. It means that early on, people were able to cope with rapid environmental changes, at least to some extent. Third, ornaments and bone tools document aspects of the regional hunter-gatherer lifeways that are poorly understood. They suggest a complex social organization within groups and the existence of large-scale contact networks between groups.

It brings together scientists and students from Mongolia, the United States, Russia, France, Belgium, Germany, Serbia, Japan, China, Australia among other nations. Overall, the cross-cultural contacts offer opportunities for valuable and equilibrated exchanges between scholars, students and local communities. All participants shared a commitment to document the early peopling of Mongolia; not only to preserve it from the constant and intense erosion, but also to raise public awareness for a period that is not as popular as others. For these reasons, we published regular reports in Mongol, English and Russian languages, but we also had the chance to invite local media during the excavation. We hope that these humble efforts will show the benefits of an international collaboration that would not have been possible without the generosity, kindness and cordiality of our host, the people of Mongolia.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/11/2021<br>      Modified by: Nicolas&nbsp;Zwyns</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560784/1560784_10411092_1620718513329_IMG_1169--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560784/1560784_10411092_1620718513329_IMG_1169--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Excavation at Tolbor-17"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560784/1560784_10411092_1620718513329_IMG_1169--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Excavation at Tolbor-17"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Excavation at Tolbor-17.
