<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds to convene a 3-day workshop aimed at defining 1) the critical scientific goals of the submergence community, 2) the technological directions that will be required to address these goals, and 3) the means by which federal, industry, and non-profit organizations might work in concert to enable activities and facilitate discoveries that might otherwise be prohibitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held in San Francisco, CA, during the week prior to the 2015 AGU fall meeting. This timeframe was chosen to allow the greatest number of participants.  The award will support the participation of approximately 45 to 65 individuals that will represent a diversity of sectors (academia industry and non-profits), have broad expertise, and have a depth of experience that will enable them to comment effectively on the current needs ?and future directions- in deep sea research and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the workshop will be a report on the most critical questions in areas of: critical scientific research themes in the next decade the capacities needed to help address them; define strategies needed to approach answers to these questions; and, define what technological approaches will be needed to carry out these objectives.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over the last fifty years, our awareness of the role that the ocean plays in the Earth system has grown remarkably. Through our research activities, often driven by technological advances, scientists have discovered an entirely new ecosystem (hydrothermal vents), found countless new animal and microbial species, produced high-resolution bathymetric maps of the seafloor that rival or surpass those created for land, and advanced our understanding of methane cycling in the deep-sea. Recent advances in genomics have led to a massive surge in sequencing of microbes and animals alike, which has literally redefined humankind&rsquo;s understanding of the origin and evolution of life on Earth.</p> <p>In 2015, with support from the NSF, members of the Deep Submergence Science Committee (or DeSSC, which is a committee of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System, or UNOLS), proposed a workshop in response to that recommendation. The DEveloping Submergence SCiencE for the Next Decade&ndash;2016 (DESCEND&ndash;2106) Workshop was held from January 14 to 15, 2016 in Cambridge, MA. (See <a href="http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/descend2.)">http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/descend2.)</a> The workshop involved scientists and engineers from the deep-sea research community tasked with <strong>A) identifying the technological and cultural innovations that will enable us to advance our understanding of the deep sea; and B) presenting guidelines that will facilitate government agencies, as well as industry and philanthropic partners, in developing new operational modes and funding&nbsp;</strong><strong>opportunities, as appropriate, to advance deep-sea research.&nbsp;</strong>The resulting report addresses how existing technologies that can be better deployed to help address the science questions, which new technologies are needed to answer long-standing questions, how we might alleviate major logistical or financial constraints that can limit scientific exploration and studies, and how we might bring together government and nongovernment entities to facilitate collaborative sponsorship and provide new opportunities for advancing deep-sea research. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p> <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <div> <p><strong>Key     Findings</strong></p> <p><strong><em>1) Federal agencies should promote     joint programs that bring different communities together to advance     technologies and address transdisciplinary questions, e.g. NASA     astrobiology and NSF Ocean Sciences.</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>1A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support advances and initiatives in robotics, automation,     sensor development, and big data management/analyses that will foster new     avenues for exploration and advance our understanding of geological,     geochemical, and ecological processes in the ocean, on the seafloor, and     within the Earth&rsquo;s interior.</p> <p>1B) &nbsp; Increase attention to, and support for, exploring and studying     underserved habitats such as the shallow shelf, midwater, sub-ice ocean,     abyssal plains, and trenches.

Concurrently, we are also aware of humankind&rsquo;s impact on the ocean and how the resulting changes in our ocean system damages and destroys habitats. Extreme weather events severely impact human populations who live near the ocean, and depend upon the ocean for their nutrition and livelihood.
