<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Huseyin Acan is "Counting Connected Combinatorial Objects." The host institution for the fellowship is Rutgers University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Jeff Kahn.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   One of the main goals during this fellowship was asymptotically counting various graphs with given properties, which is a subject that has attracted much attention in combinatorics for several decades.  Two important families of graphs are uniform hypergraphs, which are generalizations of usual graphs, and permutation graphs, which are obtained from permutations. In one project, the PI, with Nick Wormald and Cristiane Sato, studied connected uniform hypergraphs with a given number of edges. In a second project, the PI studied connected permutation graphs with given number of vertices and edges. As expected, and commonly observed for different types of graphs, almost all the dense uniform hypergraphs and permutation graphs are connected. This observation is enough to get asymptotic formulas for the number of dense connected graphs in question, so the interest is really in counting sparsely connected graphs.  In the case of uniform hypergraphs, the PI and coauthors followed an approach developed by Boris Pittel and Nick Wormald for counting connected graphs (2-uniform hypergraphs). In this ``inside-out'' counting approach, one first studies the connected 2-cores with a given number of vertices and edges, where a 2-core is a hypergraph with minimum degree 2. A connected hypergraph then can be obtained by attaching a rooted forest to a connected 2-core, where the roots of the trees lie in the 2-core. The added benefit of this approach is that it gives the connected 2-cores with given parameters, which is interesting in its own right. For connected permutation graphs, the the PI was able to find aymptotic formulas in some regimes for the number of edges. Connected permutation graphs correspond to indecomposable (or irreducible) permutations, which are well studied in combinatorics and algebra and which appear in other areas such as number theory and ergodic theory.  Another main goal for the fellowship was studying various random graph models and stochastic processes on these graphs. In fact, counting connected graphs with a given number of edges is important for at least two thresholds in the evolution of random graphs: the connectedness threshold and the threshold for the appearance of a giant (i.e. linear-size) component. Hence this is also related to the previous goal.  In a third study during the fellowship, the PI and Boris Pittel investigated the largest component of the intersection graph of a random chord diagram. There is no connectedness threshold for random chord diagrams due to the fact that a few isolated chords may be present even when the intersection graph is quite dense. On the other hand, this study showed that a giant component occurs when the ratio m/nlog(n) tends to a positive limit, where n and m denote the number of chords and crossings, respectively.
