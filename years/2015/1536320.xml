<AbstractNarration>Axial Seamount is a hotspot volcano and the most magmatically active feature on the Juan de Fuca oceanic spreading center. The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) cabled observatory at Axial provides a ground-breaking opportunity to capture volcano behavior leading up to, during, and following a seafloor eruption. Axial volcano erupted in 1998 and 2011 and, prior to April 2015, seafloor sensors showed that it was inflating with magma again. Over their first six months of operation, the cabled seismometers at Axial Seamount recorded increasingly high rates of small earthquake activity, supporting the inference that the volcano was in the late stage of its volcanic cycle. This was confirmed in late April 2015 when the volcano erupted. The researchers on this grant will work with both graduate and undergraduate students to analyze this first-ever seafloor volcanic event to be observed in real-time with seafloor sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will use the OOI cabled ocean bottom seismometer network to determine the pattern of earthquake activity at Axial Seamount to understand how stress at the spreading axis is partitioned spatially and temporally. The implications in terms of possible broad structures of hydrothermal flow will be assessed. Changes in the physical properties of the volcano through a volcanic cycle will be documented, with ultimate aim of advancing knowledge about how individual geologic events sum to produce long-term, steady oceanic spreading. Production of near-real time earthquake catalogs for the continuing OOI cabled seismic data stream will allow rapid identification of significant new events. Relocation analysis will yield relative earthquake locations accurate to within tens of meters, bringing structural features in the seismicity into focus. Focal mechanisms, repeating earthquakes, and shear wave splitting parameters will be obtained to further constrain the volcano's dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Axial Seamount is a hotspot volcano and the most magmatically-active feature on the Juan de Fuca mid-ocean ridge (Figure 1). The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) cabled observatory at Axial provides a ground-breaking new opportunity to ask research questions that require a long-term stable ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) network and complementary geodetic and hydrothermal observations, with the ability to respond to results in near-real time, check instrument performance, and capture all data leading up to, and hopefully during, a seafloor eruption. This study, in collaboration with William Wilcock at University of Washington, uses the OOI cabled OBS network to study earthquake activity at Axial Seamount in order to understand how stress is partitioned spatially and temporally; the broad structure of the active fault system; the changes in physical properties of the volcano leading up to an eruption; and ultimately how seafloor spreading takes places.</p> <p>Within the scope of this project we have developed and implemented high-precision, near real-time earthquake location algorithms that rapidly update and produce a catalog of fine-scale seismicity at Axial Seamount (Figure 2). The catalog images seismicity to within tens of meters resolution, bringing structural features into focus. We used this new catalog address several research questions related to the structure and dynamics of the Axial volcano, and the nature of the eruption itself.&nbsp;</p> <p>We demonstrated that Axial Seamount has a classic volcanic outward dipping ring fault caldera structure that was activated in a normal faulting direction during inflation (pre-eruption) and in a reverse fault direction during deflation (during eruption), consistent with deformation data (Wilcock et al, 2016; Figure 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper provided one of the highest resolution insights into earthquake activity through an eruption cycle, and thus volcano plumbing, not just on the seafloor, but terrestrially as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it provided the first ground-truthed evidence for a seismic signal associated with lava reaching the seafloor enabling us to provide unprecedented timing of the seismic, geodetic and eruptive processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The ground-truthing of the eruptive signal (referred to as impulsive events) at Axial enabled us to also revisit the 2006 East Pacific Rise (EPR) eruption, where similar signals were observed. In Tan et al. (2016) we demonstrated not only the timing of the EPR eruption with great fidelity, but also that the EPR erupts in a fundamentally different way from Axial Seamount and volcanoes in general (Figure 3).&nbsp;&nbsp;We demonstrate that, at least in the fast spreading case, mid-ocean ridges may behave more like tears in the crust than volcanoes, with extension stresses dominating the eruption rather than magma pressure. This study shows&nbsp;the unexpected utility of the data from the cabled array to answering questions in far away locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>By analyzing the size-frequency distribution of 60,000 earthquakes that locate along the ring fault of Axial Seamount, we found that periodic tidal loading (?20 kPa) causes stresses changes large enough to modulate b values in the earthquake distribution (Tan et al., 2019; Figure 4). We find that b-values are inversely correlated with tidal stress. The earthquake b value varies by ~0.09 per kPa change in Coulomb stress, indicating the potential use of b values to estimate small stress variations in the Earth?s crust. Our results provide a robust validation of the stress dependence of the earthquake b-values as previously observed in laboratory experiments.&nbsp;</p> <p>Using seismic noise interferometry, we observed an increase in seismic velocity in the southern part of&nbsp;Axial Seamount in three months before the volcano erupted in 2015, suggesting that compressional stresses dominated due to an inflating pressure source below the northern part of the caldera. A few weeks before the eruption, increased inflation rate of another pressure source below the southeastern part of the caldera resulted in the southern part of the edifice being subsequently dominated by extension. This resulted in a decrease in seismic velocity and an increase in seismicity rate that is concentrated above a region of the shallow magma reservoir previously inferred to have the highest melt content. These results suggest that the eruption was preceded by increased magma influx into a segmented shallow reservoir from which the erupted lavas were subsequently sourced. Our results highlight that fine scale segmentation of shallow reservoirs may&nbsp;be driven by variable influx of eruptible melt, but that interaction can occur during the same&nbsp;diking-eruptive sequence.</p> <p>These studies emphasize the importance of the Axial site as a unique seafloor laboratory, and the importance of continued high-precision monitoring of earthquake activity as the volcano prepares for the next eruption.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/06/2019<br>      Modified by: Felix&nbsp;Waldhauser</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1536320/1536320_10391076_1549492603653_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1536320/1536320_10391076_1549492603653_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1536320/1536320_10391076_1549492603653_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(A, B) Bathymetric map showing seismic network, lava flows for the 2011 and 2015 eruptions, 26,574 epicenters, seafloor explosions, caldera rim, and eruptive fissures.
