<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use cycles of design-based research to build new knowledge about how to facilitate teachers' interpretation and use of digital game-based formative assessment data. The research will also inform the revision and expansion of Playfully, an existing, online data-reporting dashboard that can be used with multiple digital games.  The project is a collaboration between researchers at Education Development Center Inc.'s Center for Children and Technology (EDC|CCT) and the assessment and game development teams at GlassLab. The research and development teams will engage in a three-year partnership with 60 middle-grade science teachers working in diverse school settings in different parts of the country. The aim of the project is to refine an online formative assessment platform that utilizes data from a video game designed to teach argumentation at the middle school level. It provides rigorous research on the design features of data tools and associated materials available to teachers to inform their ongoing instruction (i.e., formative assessment tools) when using game-based platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of the results of this project will include practical, evidence-based suggestions for supporting middle school science teachers' use of digital games for assessment, and for the design and implementation of data dashboards. Key audiences include educational game designers, game-based assessment developers, formative assessment experts, and leaders in middle grade science teaching and learning.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Overview.</em> This three-year study investigated whether an educative dashboard could be designed to help middle-grade science teachers make more effective use of video gameplay data for formative assessment. An "educative dashboard," a new concept based on this work, is a digital, teacher-facing dashboard with additional supports to help teachers view, sort, and interpret data, in this case from an educational video game. The dashboard supports also help teachers understand how a game's features enable students to build and practice targeted skills and practices. The game in this study, <em>Mars Generation One, </em>was designed to help middle grade students practice basic argumentation skills</p> <p><em>Background. </em>An important element of good teaching is responding to students' particular needs. In addition to using their content knowledge and pedagogical practices, teachers should be able to interpret and use data to monitor student progress and make instructional changes to meet the needs of all students. Increasingly, those two competencies also include using data produced through day-do-day activities in classroom learning. Digital games are one source of data that more teachers use for formative assessment.</p> <p>Most research in the area of game-based learning has focused on individual or groups of students to understand how they learn when interacting with game features. Games can also be used as a type of performance-based assessment, however, giving teachers data to quickly assess what students understand and where they may benefit from additional support. But for games to help teachers gauge student learning, teachers must understand how gameplay operationalizes targeted learning objectives.</p> <p><em>Playing with Data</em> was an NSF DRK-12-funded design-based research project (Award #1503255) that explored whether a digital teacher-facing dashboard with educative features would help middle grade science teachers use data from a video game about argumentation for formative assessment and differentiating instruction. During the project's first two-and-a-half years, we conducted several rounds of teacher interviews and classroom implementation pilots to iteratively refine the dashboard and educative materials. Three main research questions guided this work: 1.) Is there promising evidence that teachers who have access to the revised dashboard interface and the accompanying educative materials can improve one aspect of their data-driven decision-making practice, engage in differentiated instruction, compared to peers who did not have access to the educative materials? 2.) Is there promising evidence that students whose teachers have access to the revised dashboard interface improve their scientific argumentation skills? 3.) How do teachers make sense of and use the data, and what factors enable or limit their use of the data?</p> <p>In a three-week, randomized controlled study with 27 middle school science teachers in 22 schools across 12 states (and ~400 students), the study compared teachers who used the educative features to peers who did not have access to those supplemental materials. Treatment teachers outperformed comparison teachers on three of six sub-components of a measure of "data literacy for teaching," or the skills and dispositions needed to make instructional decisions based on interpretations of information about students and student learning. That is, teachers with access to the educative dashboard (with the exception of the "Gameplay Transcript," to which all participants had access) demonstrated greater facility in certain aspects of using gameplay data to inform instruction.

Our findings support that theory and advance knowledge about how to design digital dashboards to help teachers use gameplay for formative assessment. Our design recommendations can be implemented in other studies to further understanding of how teachers can use games. This work also adds to our understanding of data-driven decision making that happens at the classroom level.
