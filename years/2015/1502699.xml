<AbstractNarration>Microscopic fungi (microfungi) represent a diverse assemblage that is distributed worldwide and includes bread molds, plant pathogens, powdery mildews, rusts, slime molds, and water molds. A large percentage of these organisms are harmless or even beneficial, but some cause disease and death in animals, plants, and other fungi resulting in major economic loss and serious negative implications for human and ecosystem health. Despite their importance, little is known about their distribution, diversity, ecology, or host associations. This project is a collaborative effort involving 38 institutions in 31 states and aims to consolidate data from specimens housed in biodiversity collections for 2.3 million microfungi specimens and make these data available through online resources. The consolidation and increased accessibility of these data is critical to inform and promote new and innovative research, education and community engagement around this little-known but important group of organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specimen data generated by this project will be used to assess natural and human-induced environmental changes on microfungi distributions, and evaluate the impact of these changes on the function and health of ecosystems. This project fills a critical gap in the national digitization effort by contributing images, digitizing specimen label data, and linking associated ancillary data for over 1.2 million North American specimens of microfungi. Additionally, nomenclature and taxonomic information will be updated to reflect the newest practices as dictated by the International Codes for Nomenclature. These data will provide a foundation for making informed decisions by agribusinesses, educators, forest managers, government agencies, horticulturalists, policy makers, researchers, and the general public. The broader education goals of this project will be facilitated through the development and implementation of a teaching module for high school biology on the economic importance of microfungi. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Microscopic fungi (microfungi) represent a diverse assemblage that is distributed worldwide and includes bread molds, plant pathogens, powdery mildews, rusts, slime molds, and water molds. A large percentage of these organisms are harmless or even beneficial, but some cause disease and death in animals, plants, and other fungi resulting in major economic loss and serious negative implications for human and ecosystem health. Despite their importance, little is known about their distribution, diversity, ecology, or host associations. The project, "The Microfungi Collections Consortium: A Networked Approach to Digitizing Small Fungi with Large Impacts on the Function and Health of Ecosystems" is a collaborative effort involving 38 institutions in 31 states and aims to consolidate data from specimens housed in biodiversity collections for 2.3 million microfungi specimens and make these data available through online resources  The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) and its subcontract, the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) digitized their holdings of microfungal specimens and shared these through the Mycoportal for this project.  The New York Botanical Garden contributed 240,000 specimens and SUNY ESF contributed 15,000 records of digitized fungal specimens.  These data are also available through the iDigBio data portal and the NYBG data are also available through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.   Herbarium specimens hold data that researchers can use to re-create past landscapes and predict how vegetation will change over time.  Specimens also contain nearly limitless information about ecological traits, gene distribution, parasitic and mutualistic relationships and phenological patterns. All of these data are urgently needed to contribute to the solutions to four key societal needs, namely sustainable food production, ecosystem restoration, biofuel production and improvement in human health.  Solutions to these problems will require integration of as wide a range of biodiversity data as possible, along with other biotic and abiotic data sources. The addition of information from microfungi, which often live in intimate connection with plants, will be an important component of such studies  This project provided significant opportunities for the training of students.  Two postgraduate students at NYBG received postgraduate training in project management.  As project coordinators they has had the opportunity to learn supervisory and project management skills, as well as to deepen their knowledge of fungal taxonomy and curatorial techniques.  Both of these participants went on to other position at NYBG. Twenty five undergraduates or recently graduates served as paid interns on the project (eight at NYBG, 17 at SUNY ESF).  Additionally, a graduate student at SUNY ESF served as a coordinator of the digitization work there.    The digitization project was incorporated into three classes at ESF: EFB 440 Introductory Mycology (70 students), EFB 210 Diversity of Life I (191 students), and EFB 496 Microbial Consortia (18 students).  Data provided through this project are available through the Mycoportal to the large community of amateurs or citizen mycologists who are actively documenting the mycota not only of North America, but also in Europe and Australia.  This community uses this knowledge to prepare scientific publications and also training courses, demonstrations and shows for the general public, and for sharing information through social media platforms such as iNaturalist and Mushroom Observer.
