<AbstractNarration>This significant and important project will convene a group of prominent physicists from academia and industry to construct a report detailing what should be taught in undergraduate physics programs. The goal is to ensure that the next generation of undergraduate physics majors are well prepared for diverse careers in physics. When the report is finished it will be disseminated to all physics departments nationally.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) and the American Physical Society (APS) will convene the Joint Task Force on Undergraduate Physics Programs (J-TUPP) and produce and disseminate the report. These organizations have asked J-TUPP to prepare a report that will engage and inform physicists in answering the question: What skills and knowledge should the next generation of undergraduate physics degree holders possess to be well prepared for a diverse set of careers. The report will provide guidance for physicists considering revising the undergraduate curriculum to improve the education of a diverse student population. The report will include recommendations on content, pedagogy, professional skills, and student engagement and will emphasize the collection of documentable student outcomes. The results of J-TUPP's deliberations will add significantly to the knowledge base of critical core concepts and core physics practices that inform how undergraduate physics programs can best prepare students with wide-ranging career interests. The effort will focus on aspects of physics programs preparing students for immediate employment after receiving their bachelor's degrees. It directly addresses several critical STEM workforce issues including the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce and increased partnerships between undergraduate physics programs and industry. Particular attention will be paid to the structural features of undergraduate physics programs that promote the recruitment and retention of students from groups historically underrepresented in physics. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Undergraduate Education in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources and the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical &amp; Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ After two years of research and review, the Joint Task Force On Undergraduate Physics Programs (J-TUPP) has released Phys21: Preparing Physics Students for 21st Century Careers. Focused on the landscape confronting physics bachelor?s degree recipients, Phys21 offers new information for physics departments to better prepare their students for diverse employment paths beyond academics.   Members of academic physics departments have long prided themselves on preparing undergraduate students for careers in physics. For many faculty members, a successful physics career means an academic research and teaching position like the ones that they themselves hold. However, the overwhelming majority of people who receive a bachelor?s degree in physics are employed outside academia for all or part of their careers, and are engaged in a wide variety of work. About half of this work is in the private sector, and the remainder is in colleges and universities, high schools, the military, and national laboratories. Few physics programs are explicitly designed to prepare students for this likely career outcome.  This report is intended to help physics programs do that. It provides information about the skills and knowledge that employers of physicists are seeking, and describes ways in which physics departments can help students acquire those skills and that knowledge. Not only will departments that take up this challenge and provide the preparation their graduates need better serve all of their current students, they are also likely to attract a more diverse set of students with a broader range of career interests. In an era in which academic institutions are increasingly scrutinized regarding the return on investment that their programs provide to students (in the form of enhanced employment prospects), it is in physics departments? interest to recognize the importance of this challenge.  This report comprises an assessment of the employment landscape that physics bachelor?s recipients are entering; a compilation of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that graduates need for successful careers; a set of learning goals that physics departments can adopt to promote their graduates? success; and descriptions of ways that physics departments, perhaps with assistance from industrial partners, professional societies, and funding agencies, can ensure that those learning goals are met.
