<AbstractNarration>This project enhances cyberinfrastructure at Tennessee State University (TSU) with high-speed access to massive and complex datasets and distributed computing infrastructure via Internet2. The two-year project accelerates outcomes of ongoing astronomy, bioinformatics and cybersecurity projects with high speed access to: instruments, such as robotic telescopes and their streaming data; high dimension datasets, such as genomic datasets; and large scale distributed computing and networking platforms. TSU is adding a dedicated network for science and engineering research traffic, upgrading the backbone network connections to the research complex housing the astronomy, bioinformatics and cybersecurity laboratories, and providing high speed access to Internet2. The enhanced infrastructure will enable TSU faculty and students to effectively engage in science and engineering research and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new campus network capacity enables TSU to transfer large datasets and improves quality of computational research conducted by science and engineering faculty. Specifically, researchers can connect to TSU's state-of-the art telescopes located in Southern Arizona and perform daily analysis of images of several thousand stars. Bioinformatic researchers can conduct genomic sequencing service facilities to analyze massive and complex datasets of plant tissues at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomic, Cornell's Genomic Diversity Facility and national distributed computing platforms. Cybersecurity researchers can conduct at scale research experiments and take advantage of high speed access to computing servers and Openflow switches on the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) facility. The project also advances undergraduate research, allowing students to conduct data analysis with effective use of computational resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A new fiber optic connection between Tennessee State University and the University of Memphis has been created to link Tennessee State University to the Internet 2 through the University of Memphis' existing connection to the Internet 2.  The connection from Tennessee State University to the Internet 2 through the University of Memphis' existing connection to the Internet 2 has been used by faculty within the Department of Agriculture in the College of Agriculture and Natural Sciences at Tennessee State University to conduct scientific research in the field of Agriculture.  The connection to the Internet 2 at Tennessee State University has been connected to three buildings on campus at Tennessee State University to allow researchers to use the Internet 2 to conduct research requiring the high data rate bandwidth enabled by the new Internet 2 connection established at Tennessee State University.  Several Information Technology employees at Tennessee State University were supported by the grant funding from the NSF and its CC*DNI Campus Design program.  Tennessee State University partnered with XO Communications, who provided the commercial Internet 2 access.  Three cisco 2960X switches were received, configured and deployed to Research and Sponsor Research building room 015 to provide connectivity to users on that floor, including the InstaGENI rack. An additional switch was installed in room 127 of the same building to provide connectivity for users on first and second floor of building. A third switch was installed in Bioscience Technology room 108 to provide connectivity for users in that building.  An existing cisco 3750 fiber switch was installed in room 033 of the Humanities building and fiber was connected back from the 2960 switches to the 3750 switch.  A link was configured on both existing firewalls to connect to the 3750 switch and links to provide connectivity to internet 2 router were also added.
