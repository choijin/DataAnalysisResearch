<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating Full-Duplex (FD) technology to fill the need for efficient use of wireless spectrum resources in current and emerging wireless communication systems. FD technology is important because it allows wireless communication devices to receive and broadcast simultaneously, on the same frequency, thus effectively doubling spectrum utilization. The project will result in a prototype FD transceiver that can be easily integrated into current systems, leading to improved capacity and quality of service. By utilizing FD systems, spectrum assets worth billions of dollars can be redirected to create new opportunities for growth.  This FD transceiver has the following unique features: a) Fully digital signal processing, b) reduced cost and c) compact footprint. These features allow for rapid deployment of compact, low cost, FD wireless systems capable of operating at double the spectral efficiency of competing Half-Duplex systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By utilizing smart training heuristics that control a beam-steerable antenna and new digital cancellation transceiver architectures, a reduction of more than 100 dB of the self-interfering signal is achievable, thus allowing for FD communication. Technology gaps between research discovery and commercial application that will be addressed include developing new heuristics that are capable of adapting to the dynamic indoor and outdoor wireless channels, as well as novel robust channel estimation and non-linearity estimation and mitigation algorithms. Finally, new interference management and avoidance techniques will be designed to enable robust FD systems. The novelty of the proposed research is that it aims to bridge the gap between theoretical performance of FD systems and practical considerations that take into account the unique features associated with FD systems. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students affiliated with this project will receive structured innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through the University of California, Irvine, Institute for Innovation, which is a hub that connects a vibrant community of students, scholars, industries and entrepreneurs.</AbstractNarration>
