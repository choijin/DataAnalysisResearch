<AbstractNarration>The circulation of the Southern Ocean plays a prominent role in regulating Earth's climate, in particular connecting the deep ocean to the surface.  This connection holds particular importance for the Earth's carbon cycle as upwelling of waters from the deep ocean brings stored carbon of the deep to the surface, eventually entering into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.  Increased upwelling is thought to have brought about the initial rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the last deglaciation, caused by changes to the surface westerlies and resulting changes to the wind-driven upwelling.   This project investigates a recent hypothesis for how the westerlies changed during this time period affects Southern ocean circulation and carbon cycle, through the use of a state-of-the-art climate model.  The predictions of this hypothesis will be contrasted against those made by the "annular-mode" view for westerly changes that dominates current thinking, and both compared against available paleoproxy observations.  The research provides concrete tests&amp;#8232;to each hypothesis, and the process will help advance our understanding of how southern hemisphere westerlies affect the ocean climate and carbon cycle.  The project will also enhance collaboration between two US-based scientists with an overseas collaborator based in Taiwan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous studies have largely assumed that paleo-westerly changes were zonally uniform, analogous to the so-called "annular mode" behavior that dominates year-to-year variations in the southern hemisphere westerlies today.  However, in reality there are insufficient paleoproxy data to confirm this interpretation, and in a recent study one of the PIs proposed an alternative hypothesis for westerly changes through the modulation of the South Pacific Split Jet.   The Split Jet is a regional feature of the South Pacific whereby the core of the westerlies split into two around Australia, and this split extends across the Pacific.  Based on dynamical reasoning and comparison to paleoproxy records, the PI argued that the Split Jet feature weakened during Heinrich events, in particular Heinrich event 1 that preceded the last deglaciation.  In this study, the consequences for a weaker Split Jet on the Southern ocean circulation and biogeochemistry will be investigated through idealized simulations using the ocean component of the Community Earth System Model version 1 with a simple ocean biogeochemistry module.  Focus will be placed on understanding changes to the ocean surface temperature and frontal locations, changes to the upwelling and carbon fluxes.  These simulations will be compared and contrasted against simulations where annular-mode like westerly changes is imposed.  Through comparison between these simulations with available ocean paleoproxies, an assessment can be made as to which westerly configuration was more likely.  If the Split Jet hypothesis turns out to be more correct, it has strong implications for our conceptualization and understanding of Southern ocean climate and circulation changes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is an outstanding question on the nature of changes to the westerlies over the Southern Ocean in past climates.  This question is important for understanding the role that the ocean plays to changes in the carbon cycle, because those winds drive ocean upwelling that bring up carbon from the deep ocean.    The dominant hypothesis calls for a wholesale latitudinal shift of the westerlies,  analogous to the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) variation seen in today?s interannual variability.  However, modern-day variability also suggest another analog, namely variation in the strength of a split in the austral winter westerlies over the South Pacific.   In previous work, we proposed a persistent change in the strength of this South Pacific Split Jet to also occur in past climates.  Terrestrial paleoproxies - much of them concentrated in the South Pacific sector - cannot readily distinguish between the two types of southern hemisphere westerly changes. However, winds also drive ocean currents, and responds differently to persistent SAM or the Split Jet changes. The goal of this project is to find out what these differences are to the ocean circulation and climate, and illustrate how they can be used to distinguish between the two proposed westerly changes.  We used a state-of-the-art computer ocean model - developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in conjunction with the National Center for Atmospheric Research - to make this assessment.  Given today's forcing on the ocean surface - namely the winds, and the exchanges of heat and water - the ocean model realistically simulates the global ocean currents and ocean climate.  The ocean model also simulates the biogeochemistry of the ocean, allowing us to infer changes to the ocean carbon cycle due to the different westerlies.                 We found that three ocean responses distinguish the Split Jet from the SAM impact on ocean circulation. First, the western boundary currents hugging the eastern coastline of Australia and New Zealand strengthens for a weak Split Jet, making the ocean surrounding New Zealand warmer.  Second, SAM winds are effective at weakening or strengthening the ocean flow through the Drake Passage, but not the Split Jet.  Third, the two wind patterns alter the formation of different intermediate waters - the Subantartic Mode Water for the Split Jet, and the Antarctic Intermediate Water for the SAM.  Both a weaker Split Jet and positive SAM lead to increased Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation, though it is more pronounced for the latter.  We also found an increase in the movement of carbon out of the deep ocean to the surface from a weaker Split Jet; however, the inferred increase to the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration turned out to be small in part because of compensatory effects from changes in how soluble carbon dioxide is in the surface ocean.  The modeled ocean circulation and climate changes can be used for future comparison with available and new proxies.  As an illustration, we compared the inferred ocean changes to available proxy records during a key period in Earth's climate history when the it just started coming out of its last ice age.  We found that proxy changes to be consistent with both a weaker Split Jet and a positive SAM (southward-shifted westerlies).To facilitate future comparisons by others, the model output has been archived and made available in a data publication service.
