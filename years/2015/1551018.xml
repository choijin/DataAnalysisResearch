<AbstractNarration>This renewal collaborative research project supports an ongoing US-Turkey pilot program.  Investigators from the City College of New York (CCNY) in the U.S. and Istanbul Technical University (ITU) in Turkey will investigate and compare the potential for, and impacts of, using RCA in concrete in both countries. The project plan includes reciprocal visits by the U.S. and Turkish PIs to each other's laboratories as well as a six month graduate student exchange during the life of the project. The close working environment will expose individuals in both teams to very different cultural and scientific environments and foster closer relations between US and Turkish researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A main goal of the research project is to develop, based on scientific findings, a systematic procedure for producing reliable structural RCA concrete that will be cost-competitive with conventional NA concrete and will reduce the environmental impact of concrete production. Experimental facilities needed to study materials at the micro-scale are at CCNY while facilities for full-scale macro-scale structural testing are at ITU. Working with recycled concrete aggregate producers and manufacturers of structural concrete in these two markets will provide a unique opportunity to develop solutions across a wide spectrum of real-life conditions and constraints.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Main outcomes of the research:  (1)    There exist a concern that a downside of using recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) in new construction is the variation in the quality of RCA. Our research revealed evidence that recycling plants can adopt processing techniques that significantly reduce the variation in aggregate quality.  (2)    A technique was developed to account for the opportunity cost (both environmental and economic) of recycling construction and demolition waste for use in concrete. Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies revealed that there can exist conditions in which the opportunity cost exceeds the benefits of recycling for use in concrete.  (3)    Comprehensive LCA studies for New City area was conducted to compare the environmental impacts of using natural and recycled aggregates for producing concrete in the area. The study used the real locations of recycling plants, aggregate quarries, concrete production facilities and the producers of other raw materials used in concrete production.
