<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to address intrinsic alignment systematics in weak lensing studies, which are used along with galaxy surveys to assess the large-scale mass distribution of the universe (including dark matter). The results will be important in the future for studies by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Broader impacts of the work include training of a graduate student, engaging in research projects that incorporate women in physics and summer students from high schools, and workshop talks for high school teachers and general public talks on cosmology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will addresses systematic errors that arise from a variety of intrinsic alignments in weak lensing studies. The aim is to develop and analyze 2-pt and 3-pt intrinsic alignment measures from theory, simulations, and from actual measurements from the CFHTLenS and VIPERS galaxy surveys.</AbstractNarration>

However, intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies act as a contaminant to the lensing signal and have been recognized as one of most serious systematic effects facing this probe. Intrinsic alignment signal must be extracted and removed from gravitational lensing to allow it to reach its full potential.

IA can arise when physically close galaxies are aligned by the gravitational field of the matter surrounding them (known as II-type of correlations), or when a matter structure links the orientation of a galaxy close to it to the lensed image of a galaxy far behind it (known as GI-type). While II-type can be minimized by using galaxies in different redshift bins, this does not work for the GI-type since this occurs between galaxies at different redshifts and large separations.  It has been shown in the literature and confirmed in this investigation that if the IA contaminants are ignored, the determination of the dark energy equation of state from lensing is biased by 50% and the matter power spectrum amplitude is biased by up to 30%. Thus, it is important to isolate the IA signal. Furthermore, the extraction and understanding of galaxy alignments, which reflect the formation and evolution of galaxies in their environments, provides valuable information on structure formation.  There has been active work to search for methods to remove the GI-type and the self-calibration method has been recognized by the lensing community to work the best since it does not throw away part of the lensing signal.
