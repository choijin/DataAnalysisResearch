<AbstractNarration>Counterfeit electronic components create risks when incorporated into critical systems and infrastructures since they are often below specification and/or of substandard quality. There are several different counterfeit types in the supply chain today: recycled, remarked, overproduced, out-of-spec/defective, cloned, forged documentation, and tampered.  Most of the counterfeit components in the market today are chips that are not equipped with mechanisms to aid in detection of each counterfeit type. Thus, detection relies mostly on physical inspection and electrical testing. &lt;br/&gt;In this work, the main objective is to improve the effectiveness of physical inspection tests which appears to be the most promising way of detecting all types of counterfeits. In this project, exhaustive characterization of counterfeit and authentic ICs is being performed in order to develop targeted defect taxonomies and a database of defect measurements for the research community. For the first time, counterfeit defects are quantified in order to develop algorithms that automatically classify suspect ICs as counterfeit or authentic In addition the PIs are developing novel non-destructive characterization techniques which shall reduce test time significantly.&lt;br/&gt;Artifacts that will be shared include sample images and measurements of all defects found as well as aggregated information related to frequency of defects, mapping of defects to counterfeit type, etc. Since the proposed methods will be able to detect counterfeits of all types of microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), and analog devices, many critical applications within automotive, military, medical, and transportation systems will benefit from this research. Finally, benefits for society include trustworthy electronics for healthcare and dependable computing platforms for intelligence, weather forecasting, financial transactions, military systems, cyber physical systems, and so forth.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Counterfeit electronics are a prevailing supply chain issue that create risks when incorporated into critical systems and infrastructures since they are often below specification and/or of substandard quality. Most of the chips in the market today are not equipped with mechanisms to aid in detection of each counterfeit type. Thus, detection relies mostly on physical inspection and electrical tests. Electrical tests involve taking measurements from suspect components and comparing them to expected (authentic) measurements. Physical inspection is the most widely used approach in industry and has the potential of detecting a wide range of counterfeits. Physical tests extract defects related to the exterior, interior, and material composition and, thus, are widely extendable to many different electronic component types (analog, digital, mixed, large, small, etc.).</p> <p>Physical inspection and electrical tests are challenging for a multitude of reasons. First, there is a wide spectrum of different counterfeit types in the supply chain today- recycled, remarked, overproduced, out-of-spec/defective, cloned, forged documentation, and tampered- all of which have their own unique features. Second, the equipment used for physical inspection are generic and not custom designed for detecting counterfeit parts. Thus, detection often requires multiple measurement sessions with most of the equipment, resulting in high test time and costs. Many of the physical inspections are also destructive and cannot be applied to all parts. Third, electrical tests require golden measurements, which are often unavailable. Fourth, counterfeit testing is performed without automation and decisions rest in the hands of subject matter experts (SMEs). This approach is time consuming, results in inconsistent results, and is difficult to adapt. &nbsp;Fifth, counterfeit detection is done today in an ad-hoc fashion with no metrics for quantification against a set of counterfeit types, anomalies and defects. This makes it difficult to evaluate, compare, and improve the capabilities of different tests/equipment for counterfeit detection as well as provide automation and adaptation to new trends. Finally, many researchers in this domain do not have access to either counterfeit samples or the equipment needed to perform counterfeit detection. &nbsp;</p> <p>In this project, we have systematically dealt with the above challenge and developed a suite of approaches for counterfeit detection that improve costs, speed, destructive nature, and understanding of test effectiveness. Major outcomes include</p> <ol> <li>A book written by the PIs which discusses the current state-of-the-art, limitations, challenges, and future roadmap for work in counterfeit electronics detection and avoidance.&nbsp;<span>This can have a significant impact on public knowledge, decision-making, and policies in this area;</span></li> <li>A counterfeit IC repository (www.counterfeit-IC.org) which is the first ever to host images and associated metadata from hundreds of counterfeit electronic components.
