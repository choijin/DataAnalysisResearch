<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on understanding the digital security and privacy needs of journalists and their sources to evaluate and design communication technologies that better support the fundamental operations of a globally free and unfettered press. Journalists -- along with their organizations and sources -- are known to be high-risk targets for cyberattack.  This community can serve as a privacy and security bellwether, motivated to use new technologies, but requiring flexibility and ease-of-use.  Many existing secure tools are too cumbersome for journalists to use on a regular basis.  Moreover, these tools may lack important security and privacy-protecting features that are needed not only by the large and diverse community that is part of journalistic activity, but by other individuals and groups that may have a harder time recognizing and articulating their needs. By learning about the needs and constraints of the journalism community, this project will identify both technical and training interventions that can improve the daily security and privacy of journalists, the many communities with which they interact.&lt;br/&gt;      &lt;br/&gt;The researchers will perform in-depth interviews and usability tests with journalists and their sources.  The insights gained will illuminate both the conceptual and technical issues they encounter with respect to cybersecurity.  Using the specific risk- and resource-models relevant to these populations, the researchers will propose, prototype, and begin evaluating novel technical solutions to issues like communications metadata, as well as data management, syncing, search and permission controls, and the possibilities of trusted distributed key servers and "disappearing data." The results of this work will lay the groundwork for future technical advances, not only for journalists but also for use by researchers and organizations interested in implementing and testing these tools and processes for other communities.</AbstractNarration>

Through both quantitative and qualitative research with key stakeholder groups involved in the production of journalism -- including reporters, newsroom leaders, their organizational security personnel and even the many regular people who act as journalistic sources -- this project has offered insight into the many competing factors that influence why and how these groups make the security decisions they do.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>One key set of findings from this work revealed both how journalists reason about their information security risks, and how they adapt their behaviors to cope with these risks. For example, we found that many professional journalists did not report taking special precautions to protect their communications or data, unless they covered highly sensitive topics like national security. At the same time, however, further research revealed that these self-reports may obscure behavioral adaptations journalists have already made to working with largely insecure communications technologies. In follow-up work we found that many journalists simply declined to communicate or store certain information digitally, because they already recognized the privacy and security limitations of their existing tools. These adaptations, while reasonable and even necessary given current technologies, severely limit the potential benefits of an information technology-enabled workforce; improved usable security technologies are needed to allow journalists and others to reap these benefits.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>This project also revealed some of the cultural and institutional concerns that may influence communities' information security practices.

This deference may also influence professionals' behavior in other sectors -- such as health and assistance organizations -- where the less-expert partner in an exchange often has final say over how it is conducted. At the institutional level, moreover, we found that journalistic organizations -- like many others -- can suffer from an &nbsp;"us-vs-them" mentality between technology teams and journalists.
