<AbstractNarration>This CAREER grant explores the basic biological phenomena that underlie displays of the psychological states of elevation and altruism.  Elevation refers to the emotional response experienced after witnessing acts of great virtue or moral beauty.  When people witness these acts, they too can be uplifted and inspired to improve their own character and perform altruistic acts.  The research is particularly novel in that it incorporates a multi-method and cross-sectional approach by including measurements of elevation, altruistic behavior, oxytocin secretion, autonomic regulation of the heart, and genetic and epigenetic profiles of the oxytocin receptor.  The investigator will investigate how elevation and altruism are mediated by individual differences in the neuropeptide system of oxytocin. The 5-year CAREER project focuses on understanding how naturally-occurring variations in oxytocin influence the experience and expression of elevation and altruism in young children, young adults, and older adults.  The series of experiments will reveal the biological processes underlying the brain-body coordination of elevation and subsequent altruism as well as how these profiles compare and contrast across the lifespan.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project enhances the investigator's educational goals including teaching and encouraging scientific inquiry and prosocial behavior in community groups ranging from children to the elderly.  An integral component of this plan involves the formation of a partnership with the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) and the Cross-Cultural Mentorship Program at the Oregon State University (OSU) in order to introduce underrepresented and first-generation college students to a variety of scientific research opportunities on campus. Another educational endeavor includes the investigator's involvement in the NSF-funded Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program, which is designed to facilitate and encourage diversity in students who wish to pursue a career in health psychology research on the topic of healthy aging.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was instrumental in the implementation of impactful research, mentorship, and outreach. The intellectual merit of the research objectives is multifaceted.  This study explored the biological mechanisms underlying prosocial behaviors and the wellbeing in mother-infant-grandmother triads.  We used a multimethod approach to apply modern techniques to address age-old questions about the human condition with a focus on the constructs of moral elevation, compassion, resilience, coping, and post-traumatic growth.  Methodologies included measures of life experiences, personality, psychosocial profiles, autonomic physiology, and an array of biomarkers.  These biomarkers include measures of oxytocin and cortisol levels, oxytocin genetic and epigenetic variations, and cytokines.  This intergenerational and biopsychosocial model provides unique illustrations of the diverse family dynamics, social bonding, and divergent mental and physical health outcomes.  Moreover, a parallel stream of survey research was conducted on the emotional and prosocial backgrounds of adults with an investigation of how identities play a role in strategies employed during stress.  This comprehensive battery provides richness and complexity to each unique individual in our study to allow for thoughtful population research.  The educational and outreach objectives were significant and wide-reaching.  Many undergraduate women from underrepresented minorities, and a postdoctoral scholar, were provided professional development through this project.  This includes training in scientific techniques, data collection and analyses, and the presentation of findings at national conferences and in peer-reviewed publications.  In addition, outreach included many presentations to local and national organizations and conferences that centered on the neurobiology of trauma and the healing powers of prosocial connections.  Furthermore, university and community partnerships included working with groups devoted to supporting marginalized and vulnerable populations on campus, with a focus on clubs and events devoted to mental health, Black Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC), and sexual and gender minorities.  This project also helped support offerings dedicated to intergenerational BIPOC trauma, coping humor, grief and loss, advocacy for survivors of sexual violence, anti-racist trainings, raising compassionate children, and other very timely topics to provide care to our community.    Altogether, this award supported the execution of transdisciplinary, intergenerational research and the facilitation of meaningful mentorship and outreach centered on the neuropsychology of trauma, resilience, and nurturance.
