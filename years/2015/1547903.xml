<AbstractNarration>A variety of human activities result in the transportation of different types of particles into the atmosphere.  These particles, known as aerosols in the atmospheric science community, have been shown to impact clouds and precipitation.  This project will study three different tropical cyclones to determine whether aerosols affect the weakening or strengthening of these storms, and whether it depends on when and where the aerosols interact with the storm.  The research is important because it will help to determine whether aerosol impacts on tropical cyclones should be included as a priority investment area for improving weather and climate models.  The project will also contribute to the training of the next generation of scientists through the inclusion of a graduate student in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers plan to address the impact of pollution aerosols on tropical cyclone intensity.  Prior observational and modeling studies have come to differing conclusions on whether these aerosols weaken or strengthen a storm.  The researchers hypothesize that a key factor is the location in the storm where the enhanced aerosols are introduced.   The planned work will consist of joining the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry model to the Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Model (OLAM) and performing a number of simulations on three well-observed storms:  western Pacific typhoon Nuri (2008), hurricane Sandy (2012), and hurricane Humberto (2007).  The main hypotheses of the proposal are:  1) The response of a mature tropical cyclone to anthropogenic aerosols depends on the distribution of aerosols within the tropical cyclone with more aerosols entering the outer rainband region of the storm contributing to storm weakening whereas more aerosols entering the eyewall and inner rainband region contributing to storm intensification, 2) Anthropogenic aerosols ingested in a tropical disturbance, or a tropical storm, have the potential to contribute to the intensification of a storm, perhaps leading to the formation of a tropical cyclone, 3) Pollution aerosols entering a tropical cyclone undergoing transition to a cold-core system are unlikely to contribute substantially to storm intensity change, but are likely to contribute to enhanced rainfall.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project is to investigate whether high concentrations of pollution aerosols in the atmosphere that are generated by human activity can either strengthen or weaken hurricanes and typhoons, alter their paths, and/or influence the amount of precipitation they produce.  The reason why aerosols are important is that when water vapor condenses to form new cloud droplets, an aerosol particle must be present for this process to get started.  When more aerosol particles are present, more cloud droplets form and are slower to grow in size by condensation because more of them are competing for water vapor.  The slower growth delays their conversion to larger rain drops that might fall to the ground and instead may help them to reach greater heights in the hurricane where they freeze.  When water vapor condenses to liquid and when liquid freezes to become ice, large amounts of heat are released that provide the energy that maintains the hurricane.  Thus, the abundance of aerosol particles can potentially have a significant impact on the strength of the hurricane.  Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas in 2017 and dropped record amounts of rain on Houston, ingested a large amount of aerosol from metropolitan regions in southern Texas and was therefore chosen as a case to focus on for this study.  We simulated Harvey using the Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Model (OLAM), which is a complex computer program that represents all of the important physical processes that we know about that govern atmospheric motions, temperature, pressure, humidity, clouds, and precipitation.  Using OLAM as a tool enables us to experiment with the simulated hurricane by removing all of the human-generated aerosol particles and leaving only ones produced by natural processes to be ingested into the hurricane.  We then compare what happens in this case with the original (control) case with all types of aerosol particles present and in the process we see how the change in aerosol abundance impacted the simulated hurricane.  We can also test whether this result is just a random occurrence or something that happens as a general rule by repeating the pair of simulations in other circumstances, such as for other hurricanes or typhoons, or for the same hurricane but under somewhat difference circumstances such as warmer or cooler ocean water temperatures, higher or lower abundances of both natural and human-generated aerosols, high aerosol concentrations being located in different sectors of the hurricane, etc.  This enables us to evaluate the statistical significance or robustness of our results.  Using a model like OLAM to simulate hurricanes also enables us to closely examine how and why aerosols have the effect on the hurricane that they do.  OLAM is a type of model that replicates complex systems like hurricanes by subjecting them to the same fundamental physical processes that occur in nature and therefore produces and maintains hurricanes for the same physical reasons that they happen in nature.  Because of this, we can watch all these physical processes unfold step by step as the model simulation proceeds and gain an understanding of all the mechanisms involved.  However, hurricanes and typhoons are very complicated systems, and it often helps to first look at simpler convective systems to undersand the role of aerosols at the most fundamental levels.  To this end, we have also used OLAM to simulate the effects of high and low aerosol concentrations on ordinary summertime convection in the tropical environment of south Florida.  We found the very interesting, and somewhat unexpected, result that when environmental concentrations of aerosols are not excessively high, such convection can remove all or nearly all aerosols from some regions in the convective cells, which prevents new cloud droplets from forming.  In turn, this prevents or delays the release of condensational heating and leads to weakening of the convective cell.  When more aerosol are present in the environment, total depletion of aerosol is less common and convection is more energetic.  Thus far in our study, the sensitivity of Hurricane Harvey to aerosol abundance has proven to be much weaker than what we saw in simulations of Florida tropical convection.  We are running more simulations in order to understand the details of why this is the case.  The final results of this investigation will be reported in the Colorado State University Project Outcome report, which is collaborative with this report and will be submitted at the time the entire project is completed.
