<AbstractNarration>Both the current wireless communication networks and the electricity grid infrastructure are on the verge of a major paradigm shift. The traditional cellular architecture is evolving into heterogeneous networks (HetNets) consisting of densely deployed macro/micro/pico-cell base stations (BSs). In such HetNets, coordinated transmissions are advocated to perform energy-efficient green communications. At the same time, the current power network infrastructure is also migrating toward a so-termed smart grid that promises unprecedented levels of monitorability and controllability. It is expected that all future communication systems will be powered by a smart grid. Integration of smart-grid technologies into system designs then holds the key to fully exploiting the potential of green communications in next-generation HetNets. This highlights the clear need for fundamental understanding and systematic exploration of smart-grid powered green communications in HetNet deployments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this end, the present project is centered on transformative analytical and algorithmic tools for smart-grid powered green communications. The vision is to establish a comprehensive framework based on state-of-the-art optimization approaches to jointly design green HetNets along with critically relevant smart grid operations. By cross-fertilizing ideas between these two fields, the ultimate goal is to set forth a unified treatment for modeling, analyzing, and designing resource management schemes for smart-grid powered HetNets. The engineering outcome of the proposed research is a suite of protocols for distributed, real-time implementation of basestation activation, coordinated beamforming in HetNets, as well as renewable energy harvesting and storage, demand response, and unit commitment operations for smart grids. Creating energy-efficient, distributed, real-time algorithms will greatly enhance the performance of emerging wireless cellular networks while reducing carbon emissions and enhancing the green communication solution to climate change and global warming. This project also addresses the broader impacts of improving undergraduate STEM education, increasing participation of under-represented minorities, and promoting a scientifically literate public.</AbstractNarration>

Previous Outcome Reported: 1) Robust smart-grid powered cooperative multipoint systems    A framework is introduced to integrate renewable energy sources (RES) and dynamic pricing capabilities of the smart grid into beamforming designs for coordinated multipoint (CoMP) downlink communication systems. To this end, novel models are put forth to account for harvesting, storage of nondispatchable RES, time-varying energy pricing, and stochastic wireless channels.

Leveraging pertinent tools, this task is formulated as a convex problem. A Lagrange dual-based subgradient iteration is then employed to find the desired optimal energy-management strategy and transmit-beamforming vectors. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the merits of the proposed robust designs.   2) Cooling-aware energy and workload management in data centers    While the quest of end users for fast and convenient Internet services grows steadily, energy-hungry data centers correspondingly expand in both numbers and scale - a fact that raises global warming and climate change concerns. In addition, high penetration of renewables, development of energy-efficient cooling facilities, and flexibility of distributed storage units, all call for a system-wide energy and workload management policy for future sustainable data centers.

Numerical results further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm works well not only for i.i.d. processes, but also in real-data scenarios, where the underlying randomness is highly correlated over time.   3) Robust workload and energy management for sustainable data centers     A large number of geo-distributed data centers begin to surge in the era of data deluge and information explosion. To meet the growing demand in massive data processing, the infrastructure of future data centers must be energy-efficient and sustainable. Facing this challenge, a systematic framework is put forth in this paper to integrate RES, distributed storage units, cooling facilities, as well as dynamic pricing into the workload and energy management tasks of a data center network.
