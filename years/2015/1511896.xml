<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1511896&lt;br/&gt;PI: Millett, Paul&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses experiments and numerical simulation to examine the dynamics of thin films of phase-separating polymers that contain nanoparticles.  When phase separation occurs, the nanoparticles segregate to the interfaces between polymer phases, which locks the configuration of the phases into place.  To control the spatial morphology of the thin film, an electric field is applied to align the phases and the particles perpendicular to the film.  Then, one of the polymer phases can be dissolved away, leaving a membrane-like structure containing channels that are lined with the particles.  The particles can be made on the scale of nanometers and they can be made catalytic, which gives rise to a variety of technological capabilities, including using the resulting membranes for chemical separations, catalysis, and in energy-related devices such as photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to understand the microstructural morphology of melted, phase-separating polymer blends containing particles in thin films and how its evolution can be controlled by an electric field.  The project will use a polymer film apparatus that can simultaneously impose elevated temperatures and out-of-pane electric fields.  Experiments will be integrated with Brownian Dynamics/Cahn-Hilliard simulations to model the evolution of the thin film morphology. The experiments and simulations will combine to identify parameter ranges that optimize the desired thin film morphology.  Parameters that will be investigated include the strength of the electric field required to align phases and particles, volume fractions of the polymer phases and the resulting channel dimensions, particle size and volume fraction, and film thickness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the duration of this project, the PI and co-PI conducted research to understand how to control the internal morphology of thin films composed of two immiscible polymer species as well as a dispersion of solid microparticles or nanoparticles.  The immiscibility of the polymer species was chosen intentionally to induced a phase separation process within the film.  The solid particles were tailored to segregate to the polymer-polymer interfaces within the film and eventually jam the internal morphology at a chosen length scale dependent on the particle volume fraction.   Hence, the morphology is multi-phase, kinetically stable, and often referred to as a Bicontinuous Interfacially Jammed Emulsion (bijel).         The intellectual merit of this project centers on our utilization of an electric field to orient the polymer phases and solid particles within the film. We applied electric fields oriented in the out-of-plane direction with respect to the film (i.e. perpendicular to the major plane of the film).  As each phase within the film exhibits a unique dielectric constant, the electric field induces an electrostatic pressure on the internal interfaces that leads to a re-orientation of both the polymer phases and the dispersed particles in the out-of-plane direction.  Our research represents the first direct observation of electric field orientation within a bijel material.    The experiments we conducted first utilized polystyrene (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as the polymer species and silica particles with 170 nm diameter.  The silica particles were treated with PS-r-PMMA copolymer brushes to induce a neutral chemical surface with the two-phase polymer matrix.  We found that indeed the particles segregated to the polymer-polymer interfaces and induced a jamming effect to create a thin-film bijel.  With the application of an electric field, the phases were aligned in the vertical direction in the form of long, columnar domains, decorated with particles along the interfaces.  Subsequent experiments were conducted with different material components, namely polystyrene (PS) / poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME) with clay nanofillers. Again, we observed vertical alignment with electric field application.  A critical question we wished to answer was whether an electric field will detach the particles from the interfaces.  In all of our experiments, we did not observe this phenomenon.  In addition, we also conducted computer simulations of bijel alignment in thin films due to electric fields.   In the simulations, we were able to independently modify the dielectric constant of the two polymer domains as well as the solid particles.  The aligned morphologies displayed particle chain strings along the polymer-polymer interfaces and within the bulk of each phase, in agreement with our experiments.     The broader impacts of this project are both technical and human-resource related.  On the technical side, we have developed methodologies for fabricating thin multi-phase polymer films with dense nanoparticle layers attached along the internal polymer-polymer interfaces.  These films can be applied to a wide variety of technologies including filtration membranes, light-emitting diodes, and energy-related devices including solar cells and battery electrodes.  We have published four (4) journal articles and one book chapter directly from this project.  On the human-resource side, we have trained and graduated two (2) PhD students within this project, one from the University of Arkansas and the other from the University of Akron.  We have also supported a PhD student at Purdue University (where the co-PI moved to from the University of Akron during the project timeline).  The PI?s and the co-PI?s facilities were provided to students in NSF REU programs at each university.               Last Modified: 08/12/2019       Submitted by: Paul C Millett]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
