<AbstractNarration>#1511721 / #1511333 / #1510929 / #1511996&lt;br/&gt;Costello, John H. / Dabiri, John, Colin, Sean / Gemmell, Brad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed study is to investigate the mechanisms by which different swimming animals propel and maneuver themselves in order to identify common flow characteristics. Results of this work will be applicable to the engineering of vehicles that can bend and twist, mimicking efficient swimmers from nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efficient swimmers in nature appear to exhibit common traits in the bending and twisting of their bodies. While the effects of other morphological characteristics of swimmers have been explored, this is an area that we do not have a good understanding. The basic hypothesis is that the bending kinematics among various species are similar, and these unifying characteristics need to be discovered. Validation of the hypothesis to the broader animal kingdom will be tested using animal informatics. The proposed work focuses on the study of the propulsion of three different model animals (jellyfish, pteropods and lamprey), so that the common swimming traits can be identified, characterized and theoretically analyzed. State-of-the-art experimental techniques (such as 2D and 3D particle image velocimetry and holographing imaging) will be used to quantify the flow, the forces, the torque and the pressure fields generated during bending by these animal models.  The final goal is to provide  not only quantitative but also predictive evaluation of the fluid dynamic effects of propulsor bending.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Propulsion through fluids is generally thought to rely upon momentum transfer from a body to the surrounding fluid.  This ?push? on the fluid generates an equal and opposite force that acts on the body to move it forward.  Rigid propulsive structures such as oars or paddles illustrate this process well. However, natural propulsors, such as fins, wings or even jellyfish bells, are not rigid but, instead, bend while generating movement.  Is there some advantage to flexible natural propulsors that conventional rigid designs have neglected but that might benefit human engineering?  Research supported by this award demonstrated that flexible propulsive structures of animal swimmers rely upon a previously undescribed propulsive component termed suction thrust.  Suction thrust arises from vortex interactions generated along a structure bending in an inertial fluid (see accompanying illustration).  The placement of these vortices at bending sites creates low pressure regions adjoining the concave bending surface that, in concert with high pressure regions on the opposite convex propulsor surface, result in strong ?pull? forces across the propulsor surface.  Similarly to the pressure gradients that generate lift across a wing surface, these strong ?pull? forces move the body and complement conventional ?push? forces.  Importantly, for animals as different as jellyfish and lampreys, the ?pull? of suction thrust is the dominant component of overall thrust during steady state swimming. So, in response to our initial experimental question, yes, rigid propulsors lack the advantage of suction thrust that has been independently evolved across diverse lineages of animal swimmers.  Additionally, we have found that the location and magnitude of bending patterns are consistent across a wide variety of sizes, animal taxa and even fluid type (air compared to water).  These results help explain the high energetic efficiency of natural swimmers compared to rigid designs and can provide design criteria for developing novel biomimetic vehicles.
