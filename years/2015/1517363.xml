<AbstractNarration>Understanding the growth and evolution of structure in the Universe is a key component of developing an accurate model of the Universe as a whole.  In order to do this, large surveys of galaxies are needed.  The goal of this research is to develop new analysis/interpretation tools for current and future large-scale cosmological galaxy surveys such as HETDEX (Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment) and eBOSS (Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey). Broader impacts of the work include training of two graduate students and a postdoc, and development of a new presentation focusing on the large-scale structure of the Universe for the outreach program of the Department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics at Penn State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will emphasize the galaxy bispectrum, the Fourier transform of the galaxy three-point correlation function, to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity and the non-linear physics of structure growth.  Three projects are proposed, including an investigation of the accuracy of theoretical predictions based on many different forms of advanced perturbation theory compared to N-body simulations, a detailed analysis of survey window functions, and analytic approximations for covariance matrices.</AbstractNarration>
