<AbstractNarration>Non-axisymmetric components, components which are not symmetric about their center, are prevalent in many engineering applications. Examples of these components include engine camshafts and piston heads. Manufacturing of these components requires multiple extremely precise and expensive cutting and grinding processes. Combining these processes into one machine would greatly reduce the cost of producing these parts both in terms of time and money, and decrease errors caused by the need to switch machines for different phases of processing. Recently, Professor Yoshitaka Morimoto of the Kanazawa Institute of Technology in Japan has created a new machine capable of producing these non-axisymmetric components using traditional cutting tools called Non-Axisymmetric Curved Surface Turning (NACS-Turning). NACS-Turning is capable of producing the desired geometry, but leaves undesired cutting marks on the workpiece. In order to correct this condition, this project proposes the combination of Professor Morimoto?s machine with a Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (MAF) tool designed by the PI to remove the cutting marks and smooth the surface of the workpiece. This will create a single machine capable of cutting and smoothing components to the desired specifications. As a result, creation of these essential, but difficult to manufacture, components will be significantly faster and cheaper. Travel to Professor Morimoto?s laboratory in Japan is necessary because NACS- Turning does not exist anywhere else in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NACS-Turning is accomplished with the use of a machine which features a unique computer aided machining (CAM) program found only in Prof. Morimoto?s laboratory. MAF can be applied to components machined with NACS-Turning through the use of a newly developed hybrid-tool. The hybrid-tool utilized a binder to create a fixed abrasive tool capable of performing grinding operations. As the tool wears and mixes with the applied lubricant, the binder breaks down. This allows the MAF particles to move freely in a loose abrasive phase, and polish the surface of the workpiece to nanometer level surface roughness values. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

This will allow for non-axisymmetric components, such as internal combustion engine cams, to be machined more efficiently. Background Currently, the machining of non-axisymmetric components is limited to grinding machines. These machines are more costly and inefficient than traditional machine tools such as mills and lathes. The invention of NACS-Turning allows for non-axisymmetric components to be machined using the more traditional setup of a lathe. This allows these components to be machined much faster than was previously possible with grinding machines. However, this process leaves unwanted cutting marks on the surface of the workpiece. MAF is a polishing process capable of removing these cutting marks and improving the overall properties of the surface. MAF machines a surface by manipulating abrasive particles using magnetic particles and magnetic fields. Polishing with MAF has been shown to extend component life and functionality by removing marks from previous machining processes as well as removing surface defects inherent to the material. Combination of NACS-Turning with MAF will create a single machine capable of cutting and polishing non-axisymmetric components such as engine cams without changing machines. The creation of a combination NACS-Turning and MAF machine was explored in this project through the polishing of tool steel engine cams. This workpiece is shown in Figure 1. The tool mount created in order to integrate MAF onto the NACS-Turning machine is shown in Figure 2. Integration of MAF into the NACS-Turning machine occurred at the Kanazawa Institute of Technology, in Kanazawa Japan. This is the location of the only NACS-Turning machine in the world, and the location of the laboratory of the machineÆs creature, Professor Yoshitaka Morimoto. Results In order to observe the effect of MAF on the workpiece surface, scans were taken at 12 points along the surface both before and after polishing using a scanning white light interferometer. Figure 3 shows one such point. Figure 3a shows the initial surface. Note that the feed marks from the initial machining are visible. Figure 3b shows the polished surface. The cuts from the polishing process are clearly visible and the feed marks are no longer visible. Observation of the 11 other measuring points showed similar results. Conclusions Observation of the results shows that MAF can be applied to the tool steel cams to remove feed marks using the NACS-Turning apparatus. This supports the combination of NACS-Turning and MAF a viable alternative to grinding machines for the machining of non-axisymmetric components. Future Work Collaboration with Professor MorimotoÆs laboratory will continue in order to optimize the application of MAF. New experimental conditions will be tested in the PIÆs laboratory at the University of Florida using tool steel workpieces. Once conditions such as the optimal abrasive and magnetic particle size are determined, further tests will be run by Professor MorimotoÆs laboratory in order to perfect the combination of NACS-Turning and MAF. The results of this collaborative research will be submitted for publication to the International Academy for Production Engineering (CIRP).
