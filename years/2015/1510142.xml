<AbstractNarration>1510142 (Law)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to better understand how burning of fuel-air mixture takes place under high-pressure and very turbulent conditions, similar to those in an engine.  The Principal Investigator has recently developed an experimental method that enables obtaining data with very high resolutions that was not previously available.  The data can help explain the behavior of combustion and potentially help design energy-efficient combustion devices.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the proposed research and the knowledge gained will be published and taught in the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study is aim to differentiating the effects due to hydrodynamic and diffusive-thermal instabilities, especially under high pressures (60-80 atmospheres).  Because of the reduced flame thickness with increasing pressure, hydrodynamic instability is relevant to high-pressure reciprocating and gas turbine combustion engines. The interest to increase the compression ratio and thereby combustion efficiency of these engines further accentuates the preponderance of the hydrodynamics instability.  The PI designs the laminar flame conditions for investigation, but these conditions will impact, with possible revisions to, the classical turbulent premixed regime diagram.  Newly developed diagnostic tools with high temporal and spatial resolutions will help to obtain high-quality data that allows validations of the proposed hypothesis.</AbstractNarration>

Broader Impact  Flame front instability is unavoidable in high-pressure flames, specifically in practical applications, such as those within internal combustion reciprocating engines and gas turbines. To model the burning characteristics in these complex high-pressure systems, in which the interplay of turbulence, instability and chemistry are omnipresent, fundamental understanding of each of the building blocks is critical.

The extreme augmentation of flame propagation in turbulence through preferential diffusion is a pivotal result for turbulent combustion, in which we show the pertaining influence of molecular diffusivity even at high turbulent Reynolds numbers. Moreover, by achieving high burning speeds for a mixture with adiabatic temperature lower than 900K, we have "extended" the flammability limit, suggesting that practical engines can actually operate in extremely lean condition, leading to substantially reduced emission.  Determination of the role of flamefront instability on turbulent flame is an important and realistic problem in high-pressure turbulent combustors, such as IC engines and gas turbines. Our results provide a scaling analysis of cellular instability and turbulence interaction and identify a regime diagram.
