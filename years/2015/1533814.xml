<AbstractNarration>Driven by discoveries, and enabled by leaps in technology and imagination, our understanding of the Universe has changed dramatically over the course of the last few decades. The fields of astronomy and astrophysics continue to create new connections to physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science. Realizing these scientific opportunities is contingent upon maintaining and strengthening the foundations of the research enterprise. With the decadal survey  New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics as a basis, the Mid-Decadal Committee, formed with this award under the auspices of the Board on Physics and Astronomy and the Space Studies Board at the National Academy of Sciences, will identify issues of concern to the astronomy and astrophysics community and provide guidance to federal agencies regarding their astronomy and astrophysics research programs in order to encourage the field?s scientific progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities of the Mid-Decadal Committee serve to disseminate information from the supporting agencies into the broader scientific community and the public, as well as provide the agency officials with community-based input. The committee will gather input from the astronomy, astrophysics, and physics communities. Additionally, members of the committee will engage with agency officials, congressional staff, and other members of the astronomy and astrophysics community on topics relevant to the study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This activity, conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and supported by awards from NSF, NASA, and DOE, brought together leading astronomers and astrophysicists over the course of 10 months and involved four in-person committee meetings, more than two dozen teleconference meetings, and numerous public talks.  The study committee?s objective was to review the responses of NASA?s Astrophysics program, NSF?s Astronomy program, and DOE?s Cosmic Frontiers program to the 2010 New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics (NWNH) decadal survey.  The resulting report, "New Worlds, New Horizons: A Midterm Assessment," describes the most significant scientific discoveries, technical advances, and relevant programmatic changes in astronomy and astrophysics over the years since the publication of the decadal survey, and assesses how well the Agencies? programs address the strategies, goals, and priorities outlined in the 2010 decadal survey.  The report also makes recommendations to the government stewards of U.S. astronomy and astrophysics to help them better position their programs for the future of the field and continued scientific advances.  The chair, Jacqueline Hewitt (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), briefed the study?s outcomes and recommendations to NSF, DOE, NASA, OMB, OSTP, Congressional staff, and several advisory committees? upon the report?s release in August 2016.  Following the report?s public release the report was professionally edited, designed, laid out, and published by The National Academies Press (NAP).  Several hundred copies of the fully-published report were printed and made available to the community and public for free.  The PDF of the report is available for free from NAP?s website in perpetuity and has been downloaded over 3,500 times to-date from www.nap.edu.  As with many National Academies studies, this project contributes to the cross-training of researchers. In this case, the committee members come from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. Through the report writing process, members become informed about the breadth of astronomy and astrophysics and develop a deeper understanding of the forefronts of and challenges facing the fields. Equally important, committee members gain an understanding of the policymaking process of Washington.  National Academies staff also gain in-depth experience and knowledge from working with the committee members and Washington policymakers.
