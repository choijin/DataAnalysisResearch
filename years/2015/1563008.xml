<AbstractNarration>Surface coatings are widely used to protect materials from degradation, inhibit fogging and fouling, or regulate interactions with cells and micro-organisms. However, current methods to produce coatings are slow, multi-step batch processes. This award supports fundamental research into the development of universal thin film coatings that can be synthesized with nearly limitless functions and applied to a wide variety of surfaces. The research involves the use of brush-like polymeric materials and integration with low-cost techniques for deposition on metal, glass, and plastics. This work has the potential to impact a broad range of commercial processes in semiconductor manufacturing, packaging, transportation, and medical treatment. Graduate students and REU students at both institutions will receive interdisciplinary training that includes polymer synthesis, polymer processing, and surface science. The PIs and their groups are involved with community outreach through the Children's Museum of Houston, and they will design a new module that demonstrates 3D printing of plastic parts with functional surfaces (hydrophobic and hydrophilic).  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research project will establish scalable and universal approaches to prepare functional polymer brush coatings. Current methods to produce brush coatings are slow, multi-step batch processes. The PIs plan to generate functional coatings using bottlebrush polymers, a class of macromolecules that have "built-in" brush structures. Bottlebrush polymers can be synthesized with nearly limitless chemistries and functions, and they can be processed into coatings from solution or melt states. Significant anticipated outcomes include: i) Design rules for flow coating thin films of reactive and responsive bottlebrush polymers, which leverages a bio-inspired cross-linking chemistry (dopamine) to ensure film stability and adhesion on any surface; ii) Development of surface-active bottlebrush polymer additives for commodity or advanced plastics, which enables the spontaneous formation of brush-like surfaces during solution deposition (flow coating, electrospinning) or melt extrusion (3D printing).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Coatings are used in a wide range of products and applications, including to reduce or inhibit surface fouling, control wettability, reduce oxygen and/or water permeability, and protect against ultraviolet light. This collaborative research program developed new materials for surface coatings based on molecules known as bottlebrush polymers. Bottlebrush polymers are molecules that have the shape of bottle brushes, and this unique molecular shape or architecture leads to a number of unexpected and potentially useful properties. The most significant and notable finding of our work was that bottlebrush polymers spontaneously formed surface coatings when blended with linear polymers. By simply blending bottlebrush polymers with conventional, low-cost linear polymers, the bottlebrushes migrated to the film surface during casting, enabling applications where bottlebrushes are used as additives to modify or tailor the properties of a surface. We studied the spontaneous modification of surfaces using bottlebrush additives that were hydrophobic or hydrophilic, chemically compatible or incompatible with the linear polymer, and that either had low or high surface energy. Our work showed that in all of these cases, bottlebrush polymers could be designed to migrate to the surface and generate an almost uniform surface coating. We produced multi-dimensional image maps of the bottlebrush additives using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS), an advanced imaging and mass spectroscopy technique that enables us to determine the distribution of bottlebrush polymers in very thin films. We compared these measurements against simulations, and demonstrated that entropic effects rather than energetic effects were responsible for driving bottlebrushes to the film surface. We also developed a rapid method to crosslink bottlebrush coatings using UV light, which produced stable solvent-resistance films on a variety of surfaces. Finally, we found that damage to the surface of these coatings could self-heal due to diffusion of bottlebrush polymer to the damaged site. These results were shared with the scientific community through peer-reviewed publications, presentations at scientific conferences, and departmental seminars at universities. A 2019 publication provided an overview of the field on tailoring surfaces and interfaces of polymeric films. This project involved the contributions of three graduate students, two of which have received their PhD and one who was a visiting graduate student from Gifu University in Japan. This work also involved the contributions of undergraduate students and K-12 teachers from Houston-area schools. The teacher participants produced learning modules for use in their classrooms, and some of these modules have been posted online for wide distribution. We participated in a number of outreach activities, including an activity at the Children?s Museum of Houston which featured a variety of hand-on activities for the general public. We also participated in a science outreach activity at the Lighthouse of Houston in which we presented interactive science-themed activities for the blind and vision-impaired. Future work in this area will focus on understanding kinetic and processing effects that can drive bottlebrush additives to surfaces during casting and potential applications of bottlebrush segregation, including for separations, patterning, and the preparation of ordered nanocomposites.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/09/2020<br>      Modified by: Rafael&nbsp;Verduzco</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607516688435_Picture1a--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607516688435_Picture1a--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bottlebrush Coatings"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607516688435_Picture1a--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bottlebrush Coatings"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Example of a patterned bottlebrush coating and a schematic showing the UV-induced crosslinking mechanism</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rafael Verduzco</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rafael&nbsp;Verduzco</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bottlebrush Coatings</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607516319241_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607516319241_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bottlebrush Additives"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607516319241_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bottlebrush Additives"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic and representative ToF-SIMS image showing that bottlebrush additives spontaneously migrate to film surfaces and interfaces</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rafael Verduzco</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rafael&nbsp;Verduzco</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bottlebrush Additives</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607535325682_Picture3a--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607535325682_Picture3a--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Group Photo and Project Participants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607535325682_Picture3a--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Group Photo and Project Participants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Group photo taken in March 2020 and graduate student participants in the project: Dr. Hao Mei, Dr. Stacy Pesek, and Mr. Kazuma Miyagi</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rafae Verduzco</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rafael&nbsp;Verduzco</div> <div class="imageTitle">Group Photo and Project Participants</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607535436933_Picture5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607535436933_Picture5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Photo of RET Participants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607535436933_Picture5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Photo of RET Participants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photos of RET participants Chinyere Enemchukwu and Kaitlin Bartuska</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rafael Verduzco</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rafael&nbsp;Verduzco</div> <div class="imageTitle">Photo of RET Participants</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607535856438_HaoMeiDefense--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607535856438_HaoMeiDefense--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hao Mei thesis defense"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563008/1563008_10417194_1607535856438_HaoMeiDefense--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hao Mei thesis defense"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photo taken during Dr. Hao Mei's virtual thesis defense, including of Dr. Hao Mei and Committee members Profs.
