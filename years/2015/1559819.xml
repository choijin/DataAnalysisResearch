<AbstractNarration>This renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), entitled, "Integrated Bioengineering Research, Education, and Outreach Experiences for Females and Minorities at WPI", will engage a diverse cohort of students in research projects within the intellectual theme of Bioengineering with a focus on systematic strategies for problem solving and mentoring. The proposed integrated training experience will guide undergraduate students, recruited from underrepresented groups from non-research-intensive schools, through a research project; while also helping them understand how they could pursue an engineering career. Further, by working as mentors to middle school girls in a week-long Bio-Design Program, they will appreciate how their involvement in engineering can benefit the next generation of students - building confidence in their abilities and encouraging them to continue to postgraduate studies in engineering. For the middle school students, participation will increase their interest in engineering and enhance their ability to succeed in math and science courses that are essential for engineering careers. The programs' research results will be disseminated broadly by the PIs, participating faculty, and students via scientific publications, conference presentations, and internet-accessble materials.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Each undergraduate student will conduct research over a ten week summer experience on a project that is specifically designed for his/her abilities, under the mentorship of both a faculty member and graduate student. The ten participating REU faculty span multiple engineering departments and have a strong history of involving undergraduates in research, manuscript development, and conference presentations. To foster a strong, shared experience for the students, the program will begin with a "Boot Camp" activity. Weekly workshops that address communication, ethics, mentoring, and the nature of research will help the students gain professional skills and personal confidence that are critical for their success. All of the research will be conducted in a new multidisciplinary research center.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Engineering is not attracting women and underrepresented minorities in numbers commensurate with their proportion of the population, and this lack of representation means that it is even harder for new students in those groups to envision themselves as engineers in the future. Our goals at WPI were to use our REU program to create opportunities for these students to gain confidence in their engineering skills, present them with exciting learning opportunities to keep them engaged in engineering, and create relationships with personal mentors who can motivate the students to see themselves as future engineers, too.</p> <p>To pursue these goals, we focused on a few key areas such as: recruiting a diverse cohort of students from academic institutions where research opportunities in STEM are limited; encouraging confidence in technical knowledge by teaching problem solving using a non-linear engineering design process; and facilitating long-lasting mentor-mentee relationships. Our program was designed around these pillars to provide diverse research opportunities in areas of bioengineering to undergraduate students during a 10-week summer program at WPI.&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit:</span> During the program, trained faculty advisors and graduate student mentors worked individually with each student, to aid them in gaining skills, knowledge, and confidence in bioengineering, laboratory techniques, data analysis and professional presentation. Each undergraduate was also then given the opportunity to mentor a middle school girl for a week of STEM camp, to provide representation for those younger students that it was possible for them to enter engineering as well, and to gain confidence and practice their own skills at the same time. It was particularly important to us to reach out to middle schoolers because studies show that students? attitudes towards engineering are formed at an early age, and that exposure to live role models increases participants' knowledge of - and interest in - science careers.&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impact</span>: As this WPI Bioengineering REU program comes to a close, it has impacted a total of 35 undergraduate students: 92% of whom identify as women, and 40% of whom identify as members of racial groups other than white. 47% of students were rising Seniors, followed by Juniors (33%), Sophomores (13%), and Freshman (7%). Of the 26 home universities attended by REU students, 65% were institutions with limited graduate-level research opportunities.</p> <p>Each cohort of students had successful research experiences and the opportunity to present their findings to their peers, improving their confidence in their engineering skills. REU participants also found their graduate mentors to be especially helpful and supportive, and many shared that they used some of the strategies experienced with their mentors in their own mentoring experiences with the middle school girls. In yearly evaluations of our program?s impacts, the data provide evidence that each cohort of students gained the experiences and knowledge needed to make ?next step? decisions in their academic and career plans, with 90% rating the program as ?Good? or ?Excellent.?&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition, our REU students mentored more than 75 middle school girls&nbsp;in research projects during the one-week STEM summer camps. This gave each student the opportunity to be the 'expert' in the room, improving their confidence while simultaneously providing the middle schoolers with diverse role models in STEM, which could help them envision themselves in the same role.</p> <p>One specific example of the impact of our program is of a Black student from a local community college who had no prior research experience and limited knowledge of biomedical engineering. &nbsp;Although her graduate mentor was concerned that she lacked the confidence to be successful at this level, his ongoing commitment to help her feel successful led him to exclaim, ?She?s going to get a PhD and be a researcher!? at the end of the program. Today she is successfully completing her degree in bioengineering at Cornell.&nbsp;</p> <p>She, like all of our other REU participants, left the program prepared to continue on a career path that includes a STEM focus in some type of research-based work or study.
