<AbstractNarration>This project exploits an early concept of a flexible, low-cost, and drone-carried broadband long-distance communication infrastructure and investigates its capability for immediate smart-city application in emergency response. This effort is to support the Smart Emergency Response System (SERS) cluster to participate in the Global City Teams Challenge. This project will have an immediate impact in firefighting and other smart-city emergency response applications by quickly deploying a broadband communication infrastructure, thus improving the efficiency of first responders and saving lives. This communication infrastructure expands the capability of individual drones and enables broad new multi-drone applications for smart cities and has the potential to create new businesses and job markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project addresses the following technology issues: 1) development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) technology that enables robust long-range drone-to-drone communication infrastructure; 2) practical drone system design and performance evaluation for WiFi provision; and 3) a systematic investigation of its capability to address smart-city emergency response needs, through both analysis and participation in fire-fighting exercises, as a case study. The project team includes an academic institution, technology companies and government planners, each of whom provides complementary expertise and perspectives that are crucial to the success of the project. The project also provides exciting interdisciplinary training opportunities for students and the community to learn CPS technologies and the Global City Teams Challenge efforts.</AbstractNarration>

The intellectual merits of this <em>high-risk, high-payoff</em> interdisciplinary project include the following: 1) development of an innovative cyber-physical systems (CPS) technology that enables robust communication infrastructure, a feature that is radically different from existing exploratory research on airborne networking; and 2) a systematic investigation of its capability to address smart-city emergency response needs, through both analysis and participation in fire-fighting exercises, as a case study.

From 2014 to 2018, we developed four versions of the prototype. The 2014 version uses Arduino, PID controller, and requires GPS. The 2015 version improves the system with a compact PCB and pluggable communication platform design. It also designs an automatic antenna alignment algorithm based on A2A low-rate GPS and control channel. The 2016 version adopts a FPGA design, and initial scan that does not require GPS. It also includes a mechanical 360 degree rotation redesign to reduce weight and power consumption. LQG and wind disturbance rejection are added to the control system. The 2017 version uses Beaglebone Black as main controller and Raspberry PI3 as server for optical camera and thermal camera. It also adopts the ROS and a unified communication and control channel through the directional antennas. It also includes an interface design with map and remote performance monitoring capabilities. The 2018 version uses Nvidia Jetson TX2 as server for optical camera and thermal camera. It also comes up with a water proof design and enhanced interface design with more comprehensive controllability.</p> <p>In addition, we successfully conducted a series of disaster drills for testing and technology transfer with collaborators from the following agents: 1) Emergency Preparedness Department (EDP) of North Central Texas Council of Government (NCTCOG), 2) Robotics Emergency Deployment (RED), Austin Fire Department, 3) Tarrant County Fire Service Training Center, and 4) Denton Fire Department.
