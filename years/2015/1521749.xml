<AbstractNarration>This project will develop new techniques and algorithms for analyzing high-resolution high-sensitivity magnetic field maps of geological samples. Such maps are built from scanning magnetic microscopy (SMM) data. This research, which involves a collaboration of mathematicians and geoscientists, will help advance scientific knowledge in several significant ways, such as unlocking the earliest records of the Earth's magnetic field by analyzing ancient zircons; accessing high temporal resolution records of variations in the geomagnetic field that may be preserved in cave formations; and improving our understanding of the evolution of the solar system and planet formation processes by analyzing magnetization records preserved in primitive meteorites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigation will allow paleomagnetic studies to be conducted on geological samples that are currently inaccessible due to lack of sensitivity and spatial resolution of conventional instrumentation and techniques. The computation of magnetic moments from field maps is generally an ill-posed inverse problem. The multi-pronged approach to such problems under study in this project will use different analytical and numerical strategies (e.g., new sparsity and regularization methods) that will ensure the development of tools applicable to a variety of specimens. Given the similar mathematical framework, it is expected that the associated analysis will prove useful for the analysis of data from aeromagnetic surveys and satellite magnetic observations.</AbstractNarration>

This magnetization distribution within a rock provides records of the intensity and orientation of the ancient magnetic field that can be preserved for extremely long periods of time provided that the rock does not experience strong magnetic fields or major metamorphic or melting events after formation.   Scanning magnetic microscopy (SMM) has greatly expanded the capability to analyze such samples owing to its high spatial resolution and high sensitivity. In this technique, measurements of the magnetic field generated by the sample’s magnetization are taken on a grid of positions external to the sample. The focus of this project is on the recovery of the magnetization distribution in a sample from SMM data.  This recovery is complicated by the existence of `silent’ magnetizations that generate no magnetic field.   The main outcomes of this project include fundamental theoretical results and algorithmic development and applications to SMM samples provided by our MIT collaborators.       The theoretical outcomes of this project include results concerning magnetizations modeled as vector valued measures (and thus allowing for point sources and other irregular distributions). In particular, we establish the fundamental result that total variation regularization allows for the recovery of  two classes of magnetizations important for geoscience applications, namely (a) piecewise uni-directional magnetizations such as occur when samples consist of individual parts that were formed in a uniform field and (b) a large class of 'sparse' magnetizations that include finite superpositions of point dipole sources.  We further developed and provided analysis of a novel method for estimating magnetic moments of samples based on an L2 regularized inverse problem.     We further developed and implemented algorithms based on the theoretical results obtained in this project.  These algorithms have significantly expanded the range of SMM data samples, both for non-unidirectional samples and for significantly higher-resolution measurements, for which magnetization recovery is feasible. Here we adapted and implemented "in-crowd", FISTA,  and SALSA algorithms (matlab) for SMM magnetization recovery.      The grant provided support for building collaborations with geoscience researchers at MIT and mathematics researchers in France and these collaborations are continuing past the grant.   The training of two PhD students in the Vanderbilt University Department of Mathematics benefitted from these collaborations with one writing a dissertation on material central to this project.
