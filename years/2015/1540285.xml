<AbstractNarration>Computational molecular biology has developed dramatically over the last two decades, and is by now an established discipline providing many insights into the mechanisms of disease and the functioning of living cells. Network Biology aims to understand the web of interactions among cellular components, which affect all activities and disease. Only by understanding these interactions (among genes, proteins, RNAs, complexes and other molecules) can a higher level of understanding of organismal function, dynamics and development be achieved. Further, cellular networks provide a holistic framework within which to interpret other high-throughput heterogeneous measurements (e.g., expression levels, mutations, chemical modifications, etc.) that are being collected across organisms, individuals, cell types and conditions, and increasingly at the level of individual cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this workshop will enhance communication among biologists, medical scientists, computer scientists and mathematicians interested in network biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together a diverse set of scientists focused on inferring and analyzing cellular networks, using a wide range of techniques including wet-lab experiments, graph algorithms, combinatorial optimization, machine learning and statistics. This activity can be of great benefit both to theoretical computer science, via the exposure to and infusion of new problems, and to computational biologists, who will be exposed to state of the art theoretical developments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The final workshop of the Simons Institute program on "Algorithmic Challenges in Genomics", entitled "Network Biology" and co-organized by Roded Sharan (Tel Aviv University), Mona Singh (Princeton) and Donna Slonim (Tufts), took place the week of the 11th-15th April, 2016. The workshop was devoted to algorithmic questions arising in network biology.  Broadly speaking, network biology aims to understand how webs of interactions amongst cellular components give rise to cellular activities and, when they malfunction, can lead to disease. Only by understanding these interactions (among genes, proteins, RNAs, complexes and other molecules) can a higher level of understanding of organismal function, dynamics and development be achieved. Further, cellular networks provide a holistic framework within which to interpret other high-throughput heterogeneous measurements (e.g., expression levels, mutations, chemical modifications, etc.) that are being collected across organisms, individuals, cell types and conditions, and increasingly at the level of individual cells. This workshop brought together a diverse set of scientists focused on inferring and analyzing cellular networks, using a wide range of techniques including wet-lab experiments, graph algorithms, combinatorial optimization, machine learning and statistics.  The workshop took place over the course of five days, and participants included invited speakers along with contributed talks in response to a broadly distributed call for abstracts.  There were 31 talks in total, and two moderated discussions.  An opening keynote talk by Trey Ideker gave a broad overview of some issues in the field and discussed approaches for inferring the hierarchical organization of cellular function directly from data. He further described a novel approach for harnessing the resulting functional ontology for developing models and algorithms to predict phenotype from genotype.   A number of talks addressed the question of how to propagate information through biological networks.  Information here may represent a disease state or molecular function; information propagation allows us to infer the function or disease relevance of additional proteins or other molecular entities. Several talks demonstrated the advantages of replacing the originally common "hop distance" &ndash; the minimum number of edges separating two nodes in the graph &ndash; with methods that better represent the distance in relation to the local neighborhood structure.  A variety of random walk based approaches, estimating hitting times or diffusion rates, were shown to be more effective than traditional distance measures.   One of our moderated discussions focused on the relationships amongst these methods, and their advantages and disadvantages for the various applications at hand.   Another related theme that emerged at the workshop was the utility of networks for improving our understanding of diseases such as cancer. Vigorous debate ensued in our second moderated discussion regarding how to best test the relative advantages of various formulations and algorithms in the absence of true gold standards in the disease setting, as much is not known, and the potential pitfalls of benchmarking in this context.  A final major theme that arose was how network-based analyses should be extended to better model cellular systems.  For example, hypergraphs better capture multiprotein complexes, but as yet, algorithm development in bioinformatics has largely ignored this direction.  Further, existing information not considered in most biological network analyses includes the concentrations of various molecules, and the logic of their connections.   A major success of the workshop was that while the participants ranged from graduate students and postdocs to very senior faculty, there was an open and welcoming environment, with lively and significant discussions amongst all participants.   Informal attendee feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with participants praising the quality of the work and the wide range of approaches taken within a focused research area.  Several of the participants expressed interest in organizing this workshop again one or two years in the future.
