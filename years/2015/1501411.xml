<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Tin whiskers are long filaments that grow spontaneously out of coatings and solders used in electronics manufacturing.  They are a critical reliability problem because they create short circuits that have led to satellite crashes, a nuclear power plant shutdown and a medical pacemaker recall, among many other failures.  The risk from whiskers has become worse because the element lead (Pb) has been restricted from manufacturing for environmental reasons.  In the past, addition of this element helped to suppress whisker formation. The research is focused on understanding the causes of whisker formation as well as developing and testing methods for suppressing them.   The work uses a unique system that enables the surface of the coating to be monitored for whisker formation at the same time as the stress in the coating is measured.  Since stress is believed to be the reason for whisker formation, this allows the connection between stress and whiskering to be directly measured.  In addition to fundamental studies, there are collaborations with industrial partners to study issues related to whisker prevention.  In science and technology education, a major problem has been the retention of first generation and underserved students in these fields.  The principal investigator is improving this through team-based mentoring efforts to support new students and exposing them to laboratory research early in their academic careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Although stress is believed to be the driving force for whisker formation, it is not understood why whiskers form from specific sites (nucleation) and what controls their volume evolution (growth).   This research builds on the development of a unique system to simultaneously measure the whisker density and the stress (induced by thermal expansion when the sample is heated).  Measurements show how the stress changes the nucleation rate and how much it decreases the barrier to nucleation.  These studies further suggest a potential nucleation mechanism that is based on stress-induced grain boundary migration.  In situ transmission and scanning electron microscope studies that monitor the grain structure under stress can capture the nucleation process to explore this mechanism further.  Electron microscopy measurements of the whisker volume evolution show that the growth rate is proportional to the average stress, as long as it is above a critical threshold value. Calculations are being developed that use finite element methods to model the balance between stress relaxation due to rate-dependent plasticity and stress-driven diffusion.  These model predictions can be compared directly with the growth measurements to refine the model parameters and allow prediction of whisker growth rates.  In collaboration with industrial researchers, the experimental capabilities are being extended to measure the effect of corrosion/humidity on whisker nucleation and growth.   A new technique for using mechanical pressure to induce whiskers is being developed to study new solder formulations to determine their ability to suppress whiskering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit of this project focused on understanding the growth of whiskers from tin coatings used commonly in microelectronics manufacturing.  These whiskers can grow to lengths of millimeters and cause short circuits so they pose a significant risk in high reliability systems.  We would like to understand how they grow to be able to predict them and develop effective strategies to prevent them.  The driving force for whiskers is believed to be stress in the tin layer.  To study this, we want to apply a controlled stress to the layer and measure the corresponding whisker formation.  This was done by heating the samples so that the difference in thermal expansion between the tin film and the substrate creates stress in the layer. The resulting stress in the tin layer is monitored in real-time by monitoring the curvature of the sample using an optical technique.  At the same time, an optical microscope is used to measure the density of the whiskers.  This provides a unique capability that enables the stress and density to be measured simultaneously.   An example of these measurements is shown in figure 1.  The straight line in the top graph shows that the sample was heated to a final temperature of 55 oC  and then held there.  The bottom graph shows that the stress became increasingly negative (compressive) as the sample was heated.  After the final temperature was reached, the stress started to relax.  The corresponding density of whiskers is shown by the symbols in the top graph.  The density was zero until the sample temperature was near the final value and the stress was significantly negative.  This shows that stress is needed to induce the whisker nucleation.    Based on data such as these, we developed a model for whisker nucleation.  Nucleation theory explains that nucleation requires the system to overcome an energetic barrier in order for the system to transform.  In the case of the whisker formation, we found that nucleation occurs faster when the stress is larger. This suggests that the barrier to whisker nucleation is stress dependent.  We developed a model for nucleation that includes a stress-dependent barrier and then used a fitting program that showed the model could explain the data.  The symbols in Figure 2 show the measurements of nuclei density as a function of time at different final temperatures.  The model predictions for the nucleation using the measured stress are shown as the soli lines in the figure.  The good agreement shows that the model is able to explain the measurements.  The evolution of the whisker volume with stress was quantified by using shorter intervals of heating and then measuring the feature size in the SEM.  An example of such a measurement is shown in figure 3.  The graphs show the sequence of heat cycles and the corresponding measurement of the stress evolution. Measurements of one of the surface features after each cycle is shown in the micrographs at the top.   Multiple features were tracked to obtain the average volume as a function of annealing time in figure 4.  The data shows that the growth rate is proportional to the stress above a critical valuethat depends on the grain size  The results of an FEA model that includes stress relaxation processes via power-law creep and whisker growth is shown by the dashed line.  The agreement indicates that the measured growth kinetics can be explained by stress-induced diffusion to the base of the whisker.  The broader impacts of this work were facilitated by disseminating the understanding of whisker formation gained in this program to the broad community of users of tin coatings through industry telecoms, webinars, symposium organization, conference presentations and publications.  This work also trained undergraduate and graduate students in thin film technology and model development.                 Last Modified: 11/13/2019       Submitted by: Eric Chason]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
