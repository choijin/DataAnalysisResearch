<AbstractNarration>The design and manufacture of microchips are a multi-billion dollar business. There is hardly any electronic device that does not contain microchip. These microchips are interconnected to the printed circuit board with solder joints which are hidden between the chip and the board. Often times these solder joints have manufacturing defects which are difficult to inspect because they are hidden from the view. These defects must be detected early before the board is fully assembled. However, traditional inspection tools to detect these defects are very unsatisfactory. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports fundamental research to provide the knowledge to enable the development of a low cost and efficient inspection tool that is superior to the existing tools. This new tool has the potential to, (1) significantly increase the yields of chips, (2) reduce new product development cycle time, and (3) reduce the costs of devices that use chips. Commercialization of this tool will create employment and wealth, and generate tax revenues for governments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective is to establish the relationship between the strength of the ultrasound generated by the laser array bundle and the number of fibers in the bundle, length of the fibers, and laser energy carried by each fiber. Another objective is to establish the effects of each solder defect (such as crack, open, head-in-pillow, and pad cratering) on the generated ultrasound (in terms of energy of the received time domain signals). In order to accomplish these objectives, a finite element analysis method will be developed and used to predict the strength of the ultrasound (longitudinal, shear, or Lamb waves) generated by the array when the number of fibers, fiber length, and energy density are varied. The model predicted results will be used to guide the experimental set-up of the array sub-system for generating ultrasound in the chip. The measurement system will include an array sub-system, pulse laser which feeds laser energy into the array bundle, and laser interferometer for picking up the vibration signals on the chip surface. The vibration signals picked up by the interferometer at different points on the test chip surface will be correlated to the reference signals which are obtained from a defect-free chip to determine the presence of solder or chip defects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ GOALI: Assessment of Solder Joint Quality in Microchip Packages Used in Printed Circuit Boards by means of Laser Generated Sound Waves   PI: I. Charles Ume   Awardee: Georgia Tech Research Corporation   Award Number: 1536342  Outcomes:  Laser array delivery system using dual laser beam probes have been developed and following goals have been achieved:  Higher total energies were delivered to the chip?s surface without exceeding the thermo-elastic regime and causing damage to inspect larger and thicker packages. Administered high laser power as high as 400mW when compared with previous possible 100mW with single beam system. Peak to peak amplitude of the generated ultrasound is three times that of ultrasound generated from a single laser beam. Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of 8:1 is achieved on the CISCO FCBGA package with double excitation point sources as compared to SNR of 1:1 that was obtained with a single excitation point source.   Following studies/Experiments were carried out successfully:  Study of strength of induced vibrations with the incident laser power  Comparative study of results from single excitation point vs double excitation points  Studies of system throughput and resolution/sensitivity. Large FCBGA package of size 52.5mm x 52.5mm supplied by CISCO subjected to four-point bend reliability testing and drop testing were successfully inspected and the results were validated with SEM analysis and FEM analysis. Throughput of the dual fiber array system is calculated as 15sec (approximately) per inspection point. (Throughput depends on several parameters such as laser repetition rate, number of signals to average, alignment time, number of inspection points, speed of the stages, time for autofocusing/local searching, and speed of data acquisition and analysis. In order to test a family of chips, the initial setup time can take minutes. But, once this initial setup is completed for a particular chip package, testing of other chips in the same family is very fast and can take less than 15sec per inspection point). It is estimated that the system has potential to detect defects such as micro-cracks (Intermetallic crack or pad cratering) below 5&mu;m size. The use of the fiber array allows for smaller bend radius and a more compact system that can easily be adapted for assembly line inspection.         Publications:  V. V. B.
