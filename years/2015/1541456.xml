<AbstractNarration>The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) over the last several years has developed innovative and productive research groups exploring topics in bioinformatics, nanosciences, security analytics and biotechnology. One challenge that continues to confront all research groups and projects at UAPB is that of the limited ability of the campus network to support large science data movement between research laboratories, national and global research partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to enhance the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff's campus network infrastructure to enabled dynamic network services for research activities in two interwoven ways, first it will enhance existing large-scale research activities to take advantage of new network capabilities. In particular by separating research network traffic on the campus, and among partners onto a specialized local dedicated research network (DRN), this will enable faculty, postdoctoral researchers, students who have appropriate knowledge to make great and immediate strides in their research activities. Secondly, the dedicated research network will serve to provide an education and training ground for a new generation of researchers and majority minority student population from a Historically Black/College University (HBCU), in cutting-edge research disciplines within Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CC*DNI Campus Design project was instrumental in turning individual research communities of interest into communities of practices around campus cyberinfrastructure to support research.  A Campus Cyberinfrastructure Research Committee (CCRC) was formed to examine current research activities and develop a catalog of the research activities on campus which leverage network services with their associated network requirements. Developing this catalog, the Campus Research Facilities and Assets Cyberinfrastructure catalog (CRFA-CC) not only helped in the development of the new Cyberinfrastructue Plan, but also provided a comprehensive view of all the research activities on campus leading to greater collaboration among researchers at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB).     Based on findings from the CCRC and CARFA-CC, a new UAPB Cyberinfrastructure Plan was developed to create a Scientific Research Network at UAPB.  As a result of this plan, network speeds were increased from 1-4 Gbps to 10 Gbps connections allowing for more efficient data sharing around campus and with off-campus collaborators.  Faster data transfer rates combined with dedicated data transfer nodes (DTNs) enables UAPB to serve as a globus endpoint for transferring research data between interstate collaboratives.     The CC*DNI Campus Design project also provided new training and research opportunities for students and faculty at UAPB. Students and faculty researchers received training in distributed, High Performance Computing (HPC), network analysis and performance monitoring using perfSONAR, and high-volume data transfer using globus endpoints.  Students and faculty attended several workshops and presented at meetings and research conferences as part of this project. UAPB research collaboration has improved on campus as well as between campuses within the state, region and nation.
