<AbstractNarration>On the summit of Mt. Wilson overlooking Los Angeles sits a Y-shaped array of six 1-m aperture telescopes. Unlike telescopes located on other mountaintops, these six are not used independently of each other, but are instead used in unison to effectively form a single larger telescope, an interferometric array, in which the optical and near-infrared light from each of the telescopes is combined with the light from its neighbors. Operation of the six 1-m telescopes as an interferometric array results in the ability to detect finer details (spatial resolution) in astronomical sources than would be possible if the 1-m telescopes were utilized individually. With physical separations between the six 1-m telescopes ranging from 33 to 331 meters, spatial resolutions better than 1 milliarcsecond are achieved. This far exceeds the resolution of the largest ground-based and orbiting telescopes, and is even an order of magnitude better than will be possible with the extremely large telescopes (ELTs) currently under development. Since construction of the Mt. Wilson array was completed in 2005 by Georgia State University's Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA), the Mt. Wilson interferometric array has yielded the first direct detection of gravity darkening on a single star, the first angular diameter for a halo population star, the first image of a single, main-sequence star, the first direct image of an interacting binary, and first images of the expanding fireball around a nova just 15 hours after its discovery. The funded work will significantly improve the interferometric array's ability to detect faint targets (sensitivity) and scientific throughput by completing an adaptive optics upgrade for each of the six 1-m telescopes. The sensitivity will be improved by 0.5 to 3 magnitudes, depending on the seeing conditions, and the scientific throughput will be enhanced by a factor of 3-5.  Access to the Mt. Wilson interferometer is afforded to consortium members but also to the general astronomical community through an open allocation process managed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO). Through the array, CHARA is training the next generation of scientific and technical experts in the field of interferometry, and scientific results emerging from the facility are incorporated in undergraduate courses as well as public outreach activities. Funding for completing the Mt. Wilson optical/near-IR interferometer upgrade is being provided through the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program of the NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funded work will complete the first major facility upgrade of the CHARA array since initial construction. Georgia State's Dr. T. ten Brummelaar and collaborators have carefully considered the most cost-effective approaches to enhance the sensitivity of the instrument. The principal goal of the funded work is to add deformable mirrors (DM) to each of the six 1-m telescopes, completing the development and implementation of full, fast AO capabilities at each telescope. Together, these modifications should yield sensitivity increases 0.5 to 3 magnitudes at H band, and increase the number of nights of high-quality data by about a factor of 3 in the summer and 5 in the winter, with the integration time required to reach a specific SNR reduced by a factor of up to 3. New important areas of study include the study of highly reddened targets such debris disks around young stars, T-Tauri disks, and accretion flows onto YSOs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>There has always been a strong desire to build bigger and bigger telescopes for two main reasons. First of all, a larger telescope can collect more light and enable you to see much fainter objects. Secondly, a larger diameter telescope allows you to see more detail in an image, rather like having more pixels on a digital camera. The largest single telescopes in the world are 8 meters across, and there are plans to build telescopes as large as 30 or 40 meters across. There is, however, a limit to how large a single telescope can be, and for some science goals one would like a telescope many hundreds of meters across and this simply is not possible. What can be done instead is to build an array of smaller telescopes spread out over many hundreds of meters, &nbsp;and then bring the light from those telescopes together in one place. One can then create an image with the same resolution (or pixel size) as a single large telescope. This technique is called interferometry. The CHARA Array (See figures 1 and 2), is an interferometer partially funded by the NSF and built on Mount Wilson Observatory north of Los Angeles by Georgia State University.</p> <p>All telescopes built on the ground, including telescopes that are part of interferometers, must look through the atmosphere, and the atmosphere is constantly moving and changing the beams of light passing through it. It is rather like trying to see into a swimming pool: the images are distorted. This is what causes stars to appear to twinkle, as well as mirages on hot days, and is called seeing. For large single telescopes this severely reduces the quality of the images, while for interferometers it largely impacts on the sensitivity of the instrument. In both cases a solution exists called Adaptive Optics or AO. An AO system consists of a Wave Front Sensor (WFS), a device that can measure the distortions imposed on the incoming light beam, and a Deformable Mirror (DM), a mirror that can change shape in real time and correct for those distortions. These measurements and corrections must be performed many hundreds of times per second.</p> <p>The primary goal of this project was to build six AO systems, one for each of the six telescopes of the CHARA Array, and improve the quality of the light reaching the beam combination laboratory. This has two goals: to increase the sensitivity of the interferometer; and to make nights with poor seeing more scientifically productive. These systems have been built and installed in all six telescopes of the CHARA Array and are now in regular use for scientific observations. Figure 3 shows a picture of one of these systems installed on one of our telescopes.</p> <p>The AO systems work as predicted and are able to correct the images blurred by the atmosphere. This means that most of the light from a star falls within what is known as the diffraction limit of each telescope, as shown in Figure 4. The diffraction limit is the theoretical smallest pixel that can be created by a telescope. With all the telescopes in the CHARA Array producing almost perfect images we are able to study much fainter objects than was possible before the addition of Adaptive Optics. Furthermore, on nights with poor seeing we are able to observe just as well as if there was excellent seeing for the night and this more than doubles the available observing time. This significantly increases the amount of objects we can study and adds new science opportunities. These include studying young stars which are just starting to form planetary systems, faint disks around distant objects, image star surfaces, study stars that are hosts to nearby planets, and even the center of nearby active galaxies.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/05/2019<br>      Modified by: Theo&nbsp;A&nbsp;Ten Brummelaar</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1531856/1531856_10390341_1572993893931_01_CHARA_AO_Array_Layout--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1531856/1531856_10390341_1572993893931_01_CHARA_AO_Array_Layout--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CHARA Array Layout"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1531856/1531856_10390341_1572993893931_01_CHARA_AO_Array_Layout--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CHARA Array Layout"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: The layout of the telescopes and other facilities of the CHARA Array.
