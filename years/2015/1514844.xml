<AbstractNarration>Astrochemistry is the study of the types of molecules and their chemistry throughout the universe.  Molecules in far-away regions are interesting in themselves and as probes of the physical conditions in various regions, especially regions known as dense interstellar clouds.   Stars and planets form in these clouds, which are full of molecules, some quite exotic by terrestrial standards.  The investigators will study the chemistry that occurs as interstellar clouds collapse and warm up.  They will determine which chemical reactions are most important and simulate the changes in the chemical composition of these regions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final products of the cloud collapse are low-mass stars, like the sun, as well as high-mass stars, which are far brighter than the sun.  The synthesis of organic (carbon-containing) molecules is of special interest, since these molecules can become part of nascent planets and are often associated with life.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One critical aspect of astrochemistry is the use of chemical simulations to reproduce observational studies of molecular abundances in the gas and on dust particles, and so learn about source lifetimes and physical conditions in the interstellar and circumstellar media.  The chemical simulations involve the solution of so-called coupled kinetic differential equations, which yields columns, abundances, or even spectra of many molecules as functions of density, temperature, and degree of heterogeneity.  Our primary interest will be to study star formation.  Given current and future interferometers, emphasis will be placed on studying the dynamics and heterogeneity of sources undergoing star formation, both the low-mass and high-mass categories.  In particular, three-dimensional hydrodynamics will be combined with chemical simulations with the initial goal of understanding the chemistry that occurs during the formation of protoplanetary disks in  low-mass sources, and infrared dark clouds, high-mass protostellar objects (HMPOs), and hot cores in high-mass sources.    A detailed understanding of the chemistry should yield much information about the details of star formation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The project concerns research in the field of astrochemistry, which is a subject that is interdisciplinary between astronomy and chemistry.  The subject exists because astronomers can detect molecules in space mainly through their characteristic  emissions and absorptions of radiation at specific frequencies, which are different for each molecule.  For example, the emissions from water molecules are different from those of carbon monoxide molecules.  Although molecules are found in many diverse regions in the universe, our interest concerns their presence in interstellar clouds, which are large regions of gas and tiny dust particles located among the stars in galaxies such as our own Milky Way.  Interstellar clouds are most important as the birthplaces of new stars and planets, and the presence of molecules in these birthplaces can tell astronomers much about the physical conditions leading to these stars and planets. The evolution that leads to new stars and planets involves the collapse and warm up of portions of clouds known as cores.  Molecules, as seen mainly through radio telescopes, are excellent probes of evolving physical conditions of the cores because the chemical reactions that produce them depend on the density and temperature of the collapsing portion of an interstellar cloud as well as its lifetime.   In addition to their use as probes of physical conditions, the molecules are interesting both because of their often exotic nature and because the larger molecules detected will play a role in the eventual formation of pre-biotic molecules, which are necessary for the formation of life on planets.  This project consists of a number of individual studies directed both at what molecules can tell astronomers about the evolution of stars and planets and the chemical processes that lead to the production of large "organic" molecules.  In the realm of large molecule formation, a totally new process was studied for the first time. In this process, cosmic rays, which are energetic particles traveling near the speed of light, bombard dust particles in interstellar cloud cores and produce very energetic ions and electrons, which then react to form larger organic molecules.  Although work on this process started several years ago, research is still continuing to determine its full extent.  Another process, known as radiative association, in which two smaller molecules in the gas collide and literally stick together to form a larger species, is being studied using the methods of quantum mechanics, a field of theoretical physics.  Yet another project concerns the formation of large molecules in shock waves that periodically run through cold cores leading to transitory high temperatures and molecule formation.  All of these processes have been or are being incorporated into our detailed computer studies of the production of molecules in cold and warming cores.  Research is continuing on what chemistry tells us about regions in which star formation is taking place. One problem concerns sources in which the spatial extents of different molecules are different from one another, indicating that some dynamic and/or chemical processes, not yet fully understood, have separated these molecules.  Another project is concerned with new observations in which exotic molecules, previously observed only in cold regions of the interstellar medium, are now being found in regions of active star formation.  To add to the complexity, terrestrial-type molecules previously observed in warm regions, have also been found in very cold regions that are only starting the process of star formation.  These observations require a more detailed understanding of the chemistry, which will lead to a better understanding of physical conditions.  The broader impact activities and outreach connected with this project can be divided into several different areas.  The principal investigator (PI) continues to speak widely about astrochemistry in venues ranging from groups attached to the University of Virginia, to local groups in the Charlottesville area, to statewide groups, and to audiences of mainly undergraduates at colleges without graduate programs.  A radio program on molecules in space with the PI was run on stations throughout the state of Virginia.  Senior students in the PI's research group are encouraged to get involved in outreach, including programs in under-served areas, including elementary schools.  In order to help make astrochemistry more popular in the US, the PI has taken a position as associate editor for a new journal - Earth and Space Chemistry - which is proving to be popular. The PI continues to be active in COSPAR, an international organization in space research, which emphasizes science in developing countries.      .
