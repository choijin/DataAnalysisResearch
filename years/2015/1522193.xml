<AbstractNarration>This project will support strategic planning by the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL).  RMBL is a private, non-profit research institution that has hosted 142 scientists in the last five years. Funding will allow Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory's Planning Committee, consisting of four board members and the Executive Director, to visit larger, independent research institutions to explore how other research institutions manage operational revenue streams, fundraising, government contracts, marketing, branding, and endowment.  The committee will also explore how organizations use metrics to track institutional effectiveness.  The committee will provide a report to RMBL's Board as part of setting priorities for RMBL's strategic planning and developing a financial plan for RMBL that increases our ability to support research and research training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of creating RMBL's next strategic plan, a planning committee will visit a number of other independent research institutions to better understand their funding models, examining fundraising, branding/marketing, operational revenue streams, and branding and marketing.  Additionally, we will father information on how these institutions use metrics to track performance.  A written summary of the findings will be made through the Organization of Biological Field Stations so that other similar institutions will have access to the information. For more information about the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab, see their website at http://www. rmbl.org.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) created case studies of eleven education and research institutions operated as independent 501c3, or similar, organizations.  These case studies were conducted as part of a strategic planning process conducted by the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory.  We visited organizations related to, but separate, from the field station community in order to generate ideas about the sustainability of independent field stations, as well as to better understand our position within the larger research and educational landscape.   The case studies involved a combination of website research, tours of  facilities, and onsite interviews with key staff of 11 institutions:   Aquarium of the Pacific (the Aquarium), the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean  Sciences (Bigelow), the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (Broad),  Forsyth Institute, the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology  (LJI), Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL), Salk Institute  for Biological Studies (Salk), San Diego Zoo Global (the Zoo), Walking  Mountain Science Center (Walking Mountain), the Whitehead Institute for  Biomedical Research (Whitehead), and the Wyss Institute for Biologically  Inspired Engineering (Wyss).  They were conducted from the spring 2015  (starting with Walking Mountain) through the spring of 2016 (ending with  the Aquarium).          T  Visits ranged from relatively short one-hour discussions to full-day tours.  There was a similar range in how much time we spent researching institutions before the visits.  The variation in the amount of time we spent on each institution does not reflect anything about the institutions; it was simply a matter of scheduling, time limitations, and what issues we focused on.  For reasons of cost effectiveness and time, we focused on institutions in four geographic areas:  Maine, Boston, San Diego/LA, and Colorado.   The representatives from RMBL on each trip varied, but at different times included RMBL Board Members: Cindy Carlisle, Kurt Giesselman, and Kailen Mooney (also a RMBL scientist); RMBL staff Ian Billick (Executive Director), Sarah Oktay (Director of Institutional Advancement), and Amy Ellwein (Director of Science Communications and Engagement); and consultant Robert Forrester.  Billick and Giesselman participated in all visits.  Billick produced a summary of the case studies and distributed them through the Organization of Biological Field Stations.  This information will improve the ability of field stations to communicate their scientific value to the public, as well as enhance their ability to support transformational research.
