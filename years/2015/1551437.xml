<AbstractNarration>Earth's first few hundred million years remains one of the last frontiers for fundamental discovery in the earth sciences but lacks a rock record.  Grains of the mineral zircon deposited in younger sediments are the best known resource for investigating this period.  Zircons from the Jack Hills locality in Western Australia have yielded great insights into the character of Hadean (i.e., &gt;4 billion years ago, or Ga) magmas through investigation of both their trace chemistry and exotic phases trapped within the zircons as they grew (i.e., mineral inclusions).  However, fully exploiting the information recorded in these zircons and their inclusions has been hampered by a lack of foundational studies.  This project constitutes a series of investigations into various aspects of zircon trace element chemistry and inclusion character, which will allow for better understanding of the geologic processes acting on Hadean Earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental observations on the trace element chemistry and mineral inclusion character of the Hadean Jack Hills zircons have revealed several aspects of the chemistry and mineralogy of the magmas from which they grew.  Quartz and muscovite dominate thelikely primary inclusion assemblages of the zircons, suggesting shale-like precursors. The zircons also contain rare oxide, sulfide, and carbonaceous phases relevant to various under-explored aspects of their host magma chemistry, especially volatiles. However, questions remain as to how to distinguish primary inclusion assemblages, their relationship to magma chemistry, and the relevance of various aspects of host zircon trace chemistry to magmatic volatile contents.This project constitutes several allied investigations of Hadean zircon trace chemistry and inclusion character which can reveal important aspects of source melt chemistry and define objective criteria for distinguishing primary versus altered mineral inclusions. The discovery of carbonaceous inclusions in Hadean zircons allows for the documentation of carbon isotopic variations during the Hadean and early Archean.  In addition, the relationship of source magma trace element content and redox conditions with zircon chemistry and inclusion assemblages will be investigated using a suite of ~400 million year old granitoids of known composition and origin, and the results applied to better understand the last dark age of Earth history.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ If there is a true Dark Age on our planet, it is surely the Hadean - the first half billion years of Earth history - as we presently know of  no rock preserved from that eon.  We are not, however, entirely without a lithic record.  Grains of zircon from Australia, no bigger than the width of one of the hairs on the reader's head, have been found to be as old as nearly 4.4 billion years, or almost as old as our 4.53 billion year old planet itself.  Their enrichment in radioactive parent uranium (U) relative to daughter product lead (Pb) permit them to be dated with better than 0.1% accuracy and their resistance to alteration by weathering and dissolution make them robust travelers through geologic time.    While highly valued in this role, the trace element and isotopic compositions of zircon have also become recognized as valuable probes of environmental conditions experienced during their crystallization. Even in cases where zircon has been removed from its original rock context (such as a grain of sand on a beach), the mineral inclusions within zircon and their trace element and isotopic signatures can yield important information regarding source conditions if that record has remained undisturbed.  Thus care must be taken to ensure that effects of post-crystallization alteration are not mistaken as primary features.  We undertook a variety of investigations over the past three years to couple new analytical methods with laboratory-derived calibrations that provide new insights into early Earth processes. We developed a trace element index that permits rapid and robust determination of which zircons have retained their primary elemental signatures and which have been altered in nature.  We also found that the aluminum, chlorine, fluorine and sulfur contents in zircon are good proxies for the chemistry of the melts from which they crystallized and found that some Hadean zircons were derived from magmas that formed from melting of sedimentary rocks.   Together with colleagues we found that uranium isotope variations in Hadean zircons show no evidence of early Earth natural nuclear reactors, such as that documented much later in Oklo, West Africa.
