<AbstractNarration>Microglia are cells of the immune system that act as the first defense of the brain against infection and disease. Traditionally, these cells have been thought to be inert unless activated by a pathological event. Recently, it has been discovered that microglia are in fact very active, even in the absence of pathology, and that they can actively participate in important functions in the healthy brain, such as the rewiring of neuronal networks during neurodevelopment and learning. How microglia can sense the activity of neurons is currently unknown, but understanding such a mechanism is critical to unraveling how microglia perform their physiological functions. The experiments proposed determine how neuronal activity affects microglial signaling and physical contacts with neurons by monitoring both neurons and microglia in the living mouse brain. The results will give a wealth of knowledge about how microglia behave in the physiological brain and also give insights into how their functions could impact neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. In the process of doing the experiments, young scientists are trained for a future in academic and non-academic science, and participate in outreach activities that teach K-5 children about the brain. Additionally, scientists from upstate New York with research programs that focus on glial biology come together to share their new results to build a new vision of how these cells act together with neurons to perform computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand physiological microglial function, it is necessary to study these cells with minimal perturbation in the living brain. Two-photon microscopy allows the monitoring of signaling within cells in the intact brain, and in this project the investigator images calcium signals in neurons and microglia of anesthetized and of awake mice. Neuronal calcium signaling indicates levels of neuronal activity in a dendrite-specific manner, and the behavior of microglia with respect to more and less active dendrites can be tracked. However, little is known about the function of calcium signaling in microglia. The imaging experiments provide information on whether intracellular calcium is responsible for directed movements of microglial processes and interactions with neurons in vivo. The experiments address how such activity influences microglial contacts with synapses, synapse elimination, and microglial signaling. Taken together, the studies allow for deeper understanding of how microglia and neurons interact in physiological conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award allowed us to explore the neuronal mechanisms that regulate microglial dynamics and the ability of microglia to interact with and physically contact neuronal structures. We found that the movement of microglial processes, the tendrils that come out of the cell body of the microglia, was modulated by the state of the animal. When mice were awake the movements stopped. When mice were anesthetized the microglial processes moved rapidly and explored the brain, physically interacting the neurons. The inhibitory action of wakefulness was mediated by the release of norepinephrine, a neuromodulator which signals arousal and the release of norepinephrine was detected by specific adrenergic receptors on microglia. When these receptors were removed from microglia, norepinephrine no longer stabilized microglial processes and could not inhibit microglia-neuron interactions. Additionally, activation of these receptors on microglia inhibited synaptic plasticity, a process thought to be closely associated with learning and memory. These results indicate that microglia are a critical part of the normal brain machinery that implements learning paradigms and that these cells are exquisitely tuned to the state of the animal (awake vs. anesthetized). Thus these findings give us a fundamental insight into microglial biology as well as into the mechanisms that affect learning and memory. Additionally, this award supported an outreach program that sent volunteers into local schools to teach K-12 students about the brain. The volunteers also worked in the local science museum and participated in presentations to girl and boy scouts and other members of the lay public.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/24/2020<br>      Modified by: Anna&nbsp;K&nbsp;Majewska</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
