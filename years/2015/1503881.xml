<AbstractNarration>Homes, smartphones, electronic devices and vehicles are equipped with a variety of sensors to detect temperature, humidity, pressure, air-quality, medical diagnostics, touch, light, water-level, hot-surface, and oxygen levels. A cost-effective, highly sensitive platform with versatility to be incorporated into diverse systems for sensing different stimuli is important. This I-Corps team has built a cost-effective, high-sensitivity sensing-element with functionalized single-atom-thick graphene, which can be applied to produce a wide variety of sensors. Further, the team also developed a process to produce graphene based high frequency electronic devices via the same mechanism. The technology is expected to have a significant economic impact in the sensors and semiconductors industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphene is an ultrasensitive, ultrathin substrate with the ability to detect a single molecule. To incorporate this property into working sensors, the graphene functionalization is important. However, this is a major challenge since to preserve the superior electronic properties of graphene, its functionalization must retain its planar lattice (for high mobility) and its carbons' sp2 hybridized state (for high carrier density). To achieve these goals, the I-Corps team has developed a sensor base where the ?à?{conjugated system of graphene is functionalized, while retaining its lattice integrity and superior sensitivity. Further, the group has developed a process to grow graphene directly on a dielectric substrate. Functionalized graphene will benefit from enhanced specificity and will facilitate atomic layer deposition of gate-oxide (currently a major challenge) for fabrication of high speed field effect transistors.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Every year there are about 80,000 incidents of CO exposure which lead to approximately 400 deaths. This high death-rate from CO exposure in-part indicates the need for development of better sensors with high CO sensitivity (ppm range). Via the NSF-ICORP project and with the help from teaching faculty, and industrial mentor, a systematic study was conducted to understand the market forces that guide the commercialization path for CO sensors and other toxic gas sensors. More than 100 interviews were conducted to determine the market space for toxic gas detectors and a partial business model was developed. The main driving forces were identified as Insurance companies, technology advances, and government regulations. The customer segments have been identified as the industries and home owners/builders for CO gas monitoring and toxic gas detection. The current commercial CO detectors have low specificity with a tradeoff between sensitivity and detection speed. Customers interviewed (Industrial Workers, Hazadous Materials Response Teams, and residential home builders) indicated the need for fast speed (&lt;30 seconds), high specificity and high sensitivity (ppm, regulated by OSHA, ACGIH, NIOSH). Based on this information, a minimum viable product (MVP): a sensor element with high sensitivity to CO was fabricated by the PI&rsquo;s group. This MVP is an ultrasensitive detection technology for toxic gas molecules based on a single-atom-thick graphene sheet with a unique functionalization to achieve sensitive and specific detection at fast pace.
