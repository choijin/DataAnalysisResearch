<AbstractNarration>Gyroporus is a genus of ectomycorrhizal fungi with representatives on every major continent except Antarctica. These fungi mutualistically associate with an array of plant species around the world, including members of the pine, beech, and myrtle familiesThese symbioses are essential ecosystem features; understanding their origins and geography is crucial given accelerated species extinction and range shifts. In addition to functioning as  symbionts in forests worldwide, Gyroporus species are important as wild edible mushrooms. Though most of the species are edible, at least one is currently known to be toxic, underscoring the need for careful systematic studies in this group. Despite a long history of formal recognition, significant details within Gyroporus have yet to be elucidated. This is primarily because many of the taxa represent widespread species complexes, harboring semi-cryptic lineages. To address this problem, a combined taxonomic and phylogenetic approach will be used to examine species limits and infer relationships within the group. Japan is an ideal landscape for this research, as the country harbors a diverse set of Gyroporus species, including poorly known and endemic species. Field, laboratory, and herbarium work will be conducted with advisement from Dr. Kentaro Hosaka, mycologist at the National Museum of Nature and Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morphotaxonomic data will be drawn from original study of specimens collected from the field and those already housed in Japanese herbaria. Protein-coding loci will be emphasized for phylogenetic studies. Namely, the nuclear gene rpb2 and the mitochondrial gene atp6 will be utilized. The nuclear gene tef1 will also be used for select specimens to allow for divergence time estimation. These data will be analyzed in tandem with any publicly available DNA sequences and preliminary data already generated by the principal investigator. Phylogenetic analyses will further elucidate Gyroporus diversity and facilitate the assessment of species limits. Phylogenies will also aid in the evaluation of biogeographic hypotheses, such as proposals regarding the temporal and geographic origin of Gyroporus, the evolution of ectomycorrhizal partnerships, and dispersal-vicariance scenarios. Additionally, select exemplars of other ectomycorrhizal Boletales will be included in these analyses for comparative study. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

DNA sequencing of appropriate specimens was conducted at the Department of Botany of the National Museum of Nature and Science. During the project period, over 30 specimens were sequenced across two loci (atp6 and rpb2). These sequences have been added to an existing Gyroporus sequence database. Additional sequencing of specimens is ongoing.  The project facilitated major opportunities for scientific and cultural exchange. The insights of my mentors and collaborators in Japan, especially of the EAPSI host scientist, maximized my experience of Japan's ecology, cultural landscape, and research infrastructure.
