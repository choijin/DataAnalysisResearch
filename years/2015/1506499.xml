<AbstractNarration>Significant advancements in 21st century physics have relied on the discovery that properties of atoms are not fixed, but can be changed by interactions with laser light.  The ability to understand and control these sensitive interactions is also the key to the creation of new atom-light based technologies.   Some atom-light interactions are sensitive to the surrounding magnetic field.  As an example, an atom is extremely selective about the precise colors of light it absorbs, but when it is placed in a magnetic field, the atom's color choices will shift depending on the strength of the field.  Such interactions can be used as the foundation of a device, called an "atomic magnetometer," that can measure unknown magnetic fields.  This investigation studies interactions between laser light and a specially prepared gas of atoms that is sensitive to small variations in the surrounding magnetic field.   The special preparation uses two lasers and a controlled magnetic field to temporarily but dramatically change how laser light travels through a gas of atoms.  As a result, the laser light's brightness fluctuates, or flickers, in ways that are not yet fully understood.  These fluctuations not only carry information about the atoms, but they are also especially sensitive to magnetic field variations.  This research will further our scientific understanding of atom-light interactions, which is of broad interest for many technological applications.  Simultaneously, the research will produce new techniques for detecting small, unknown magnetic fields, like the magnetic fields emitted from the human heart.  The new detection methods will potentially impact a broad range of medical and scientific fields, and because they make use of low-cost and potentially portable laser systems, any resulting technological applications will be widely accessible and suitable for use outside of the laboratory environment. Undergraduate students will be involved at all stages of this research agenda, preparing them for careers in research science and other STEM-related fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Light intensity fluctuations derived from atomic coherence can encode valuable information about coherence dynamics in an atomic vapor.  Furthermore, they provide a platform for a new class of compact and simple atomic magnetometers.  This research agenda uses low-cost, free-running diode lasers with inherent frequency noise that is converted into information-rich intensity noise near an atomic resonance.  The amplitude and phase of the intensity fluctuations are particularly sensitive to small magnetic field variations near an atomic coherence between Zeeman sublevels.  Hanle effect Electromagnetically Induced Transparency will be induced in rubidium vapor and used to prototype and optimize a novel magnetometry technique relying on coherence-derived light fluctuations.  The converted laser intensity noise will be studied using self-correlations and spectrum analysis.  The findings will deepen our understanding of the relationship between the light fluctuations and the underlying atomic coherence, as well as give us the tools to build a new atomic magnetometer. Moreover, the results will provide useful insight for mitigating noise from imperfect lasers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The interaction of light and matter is a topic of fundamental scientific interest and one of significant technological interest.  For example, lasers, which are a specialized light source, have become ubiquitous in common household items like CD players. The same type of common everyday laser was used to advance the understanding of a phenomenon known as Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT).     EIT is an astounding effect where a material that is normally opaque (i.e., it absorbs light) becomes transparent when some other light is shone onto the material.  The EIT effect, and fluctuations in that effect, are very sensitive to any magnetic fields that are present near the material in which the EIT effect is taking place.  Most experiments in EIT are carried out using expensive, stable and sensitive lasers (intended for laboratory use). Because ordinary lasers are much less expensive and already have inherent intensity fluctuations, that type of "noisy" laser was used in experiments to detect very small magnetic fields by measuring the fluctuations in the observed EIT.  The results of this research provide a better understanding of how the magnetic fields affect the properties of the light that is sent through a gas of Rubidium (the atomic system that undergoes EIT in the experiment).  An important finding of this work is that fundamental properties of the fluctuations in laser light intensity are incredibly sensitive to very weak magnetic fields.  By measuring exactly how these noise properties are affected, it may be possible to use the results to measure the strength of magnetic fields with unprecedented accuracy.  The research also discovered new methods for investigating the quantum mechanical properties of polarized photons, which allows for more rigorous tests of the theoretical models of EIT.  In summary, these results have applications in the development of a magnetometer (a device to measure magnetic fields) and in the basic understanding of how different magnetic effects and optical effects change the properties of the observed EIT.    The experiment for this project took place at an entirely undergraduate institution.  In addition to the scientific results, this project has also provided valuable and specialized scientific training for six undergraduate students.  These students were all trained in the procedures and practices for conducting research with lasers and other optical systems.  There is no classroom substitute for the hands-on training that these students received.  These students are now better prepared for a variety of research, industrial, and educational positions.           Last Modified: 11/30/2017       Submitted by: Stephen L Tufte]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
