<AbstractNarration>According to the Pew Research Center, results from the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which measures every three years the reading ability, math and science literacy among 15-year-olds, placed the U.S. an "unimpressive 35th out of 64 countries in math and 27th in science." Compared to the 34 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.S. ranked 27th in math and 20th in science.  Given the important contribution that the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines make to U.S. innovation and competitiveness, there have been several high level reports calling for improved STEM instruction in our nation's schools.  Research studies on effective practices for teaching and learning about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines have documented the significant impact made when these subjects are taught using pedagogies that emphasize hands-on, inquiry-based learning. These tactics help students gain not only the scientific content knowledge, but also a greater understanding of the process of scientific inquiry.  Even better learning outcomes can be achieved if problem-based or place-based approaches are incorporated, because linking the science to issues that are relevant to people, their communities, and society in general, helps to reach both the cognitive and affective domains of the learner. Indeed, new national standards for STEM teaching clearly emphasize the integration of scientific practice within classroom instruction as being a best practice. Preparing teachers to use these pedagogical methods effectively is essential for successful implementation, but difficult to provide at a national scale.  The challenge, then is to identify model programs for professional development that can be scaled up, in order to transform STEM teaching throughout the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports a pilot effort to create six regional science fairs for K-12 students whose projects are designed around the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program protocols and campaigns. The GLOBE program, now celebrating its 20th year of operation, is a global, hands-on science and science education program that engages students and teachers in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting authentic environmental data.  There are now 114 countries using GLOBE in the classroom, with several tens of thousands teachers trained in the GLOBE protocols.  Working with a leadership team of 16 GLOBE partnerships (2-3 per region), this project is  recruiting an additional 44 partner-teacher-student teams in the U.S. to participate in the regional 1.0-1.5 day events.  As part of this effort, experienced GLOBE partners are providing monthly webinars and blogs in order to mentor teachers, to promote higher quality implementation of GLOBE research in the classroom. The goal of the science fairs is to foster a stronger community connection among the U.S. GLOBE partners, promote GLOBE as a model program for effective science teaching on a national and international level, and provide opportunities and resources that motivate teachers to implement authentic research projects in their classrooms. The six regional competitions serve as a venue for honoring outstanding teams who are unable to attend other GLOBE student conferences, annual partner meetings, or GLOBE Learning Expeditions.  It is anticipated that these regional science fairs will become an annual event, should the pilot effort prove successful.</AbstractNarration>

The goals included: firmly establishing the GLOBE Student Research Symposia as an annual event; supporting teachers engaged in GLOBE-related research with their students through professional development and resources; increasing student confidence in science content and practices; increasing the visibility of the Symposia to gain outside funding for sustainability; and, engaging U.S. GLOBE Partnerships to build capacity for continued success.</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Over the grant period, the project provided 583 students with the opportunity to share science research at Symposia events where they met GLOBE students from other states, discussed research with scientists and visited STEM venues (NASA centers, science museums, colleges and universities) to envision themselves in those locations pursuing a STEM career. One hundred thirty-five (135) teachers received support in conducting research with their students through in-person mentoring by a GLOBE Partner, webinars, blog posts, email communications and on-site professional development. Forty-six (46) students and 29 teachers attended more than one year. Funding support for travel expenses was provided to teachers who do not already carry out research with their students, have never brought students to a science fair, science olympiad or other similar event and for teams from underserved and underrepresented communities and/or schools where there is a high number of students receiving free or reduced lunch. Due to recruitment efforts and these criteria, the majority of the participants were from underrepresented groups in STEM and low-income rural, suburban and urban districts from 30 states, many who had never left their state or even their hometown before the event. </span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.globe.gov/web/united-states-of-america/home/resources">GLOBE Partnerships</a> from across the country supported student-teacher teams.

This was assessed through a student survey where they rated their ability in the science practices before and after attending. The science practices include: asking good research questions, analyzing and interpreting data, constructing a scientific argument, and conducting peer review. The majority of teachers (86%) felt that participating in the Symposia improved their ability to integrate science research into their classroom. These teachers felt that the project opened up curriculum options, allowed more accessible data collecting for all students and that they were better able to help students carry out scientific processes and practices. For some teachers, attending resulted in bringing new science activities and skills to the classroom, such as having students peer review quarterly projects. </span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Student research was showcased through Facebook, Twitter and the <a href="https://www.globe.gov/web/united-states-of-america/home/student-research-symposia/media">website</a>.

Due to recruitment efforts and these criteria, the majority of the participants were from underrepresented groups in STEM and low-income rural, suburban and urban districts from 30 states, many who had never left their state or even their hometown before the event.  GLOBE Partnerships from across the country supported student-teacher teams. The 45 Partners participating in the project and attending the events connected with each other to increase their own knowledge and build a stronger network to better support GLOBE students and teachers.  All the resources developed under this grant are readily accessible through the U.S. GLOBE Symposia webpage, including Science Practices webpages.  Webinars on each of the science practices are posted on the YouTube U.S. Regional Student Research Symposia playlist.  A list of 292 subscribed teachers and Partners receive(d) email updates every two to three weeks containing information about upcoming webinars, deadlines, logistics and resources.  The Teacher Hotline was created to answer teacher questions regarding the Symposia logistics and experience. The Hotline team is composed of experienced GLOBE teachers willing to provide support through a brief phone call or email.  Students' self-efficacy (belief in his/her ability to do a task) increased for the science practices after attending the Student Research Symposia. This was assessed through a student survey where they rated their ability in the science practices before and after attending. The science practices include: asking good research questions, analyzing and interpreting data, constructing a scientific argument, and conducting peer review. The majority of teachers (86%) felt that participating in the Symposia improved their ability to integrate science research into their classroom. These teachers felt that the project opened up curriculum options, allowed more accessible data collecting for all students and that they were better able to help students carry out scientific processes and practices. For some teachers, attending resulted in bringing new science activities and skills to the classroom, such as having students peer review quarterly projects.  Student research was showcased through Facebook, Twitter and the website. News stories highlight students' research projects and a series of feature stories about teacher-student teams and their relationships with the local GLOBE Partner were posted and distributed through social media. These stories featured teams from Arkansas, California, Michigan, New Jersey, Texas and West Virginia.  The Symposia are now in the fourth year. The third year, 2018, was supported primarily by a grant from NASA (Grant #80NSSC18K0135) and the 2019 Student Research Symposia will be partially funded by the NASA grant, with the balance supported by a non-profit organization, Youth Learning As Citizen Environmental Scientists (YLACES). The non-profit has agreed to take on the primary role of fundraising and supporting the events into the future.
