<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to commission a polarization-sensitive radio receiver and build a digital backend for the CO Mapping Array Pathfinder (COMAP) experiment, as well as observe for two years using this equipment on a 10m-diameter radio telescope. The COMAP program is part of a much larger effort by the astronomical community to understand the origin and evolution of the universe and the formation of stars and galaxies. Broader impacts of the work include mentoring of undergraduates and research training of graduate students in instrumentation development. The COMAP team will communicate their results via public lectures, web pages, and activities at the telescope. Students and early-career researchers will be trained in a variety of cutting edge techniques in radio frequency design, technology development and analysis of large data sets. Personnel funded by this proposal will participate in an education and outreach program at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, bringing the excitement of scientific research to a diverse community that includes a Native American population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMAP aims to measure emission from both the CO J=1-0 transition at redshifts 2.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.8 and the J=2-1 transition at 5.8 &lt; z &lt; 6.7, probing the 3D power spectrum of CO, which acts as a tracer for star formation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As part of humankind's quest to understand the universe, the COMAPexperiment is designed to probe the formation of stars and galaxiessome 10 billion years ago.  This is a particularly interesting time inthe history of the universe, as it seems to be the time that stars andgalaxies were forming most rapidly.  COMAP takes its name in part fromthe carbon monoxide molecule, or CO, which is composed of carbon andoxygen.  While the Big Bang left the universe filled almost withentirely hydrogen and helium, carbon and oxygen are produced bynuclear fusion deep within massive stars, and they (and other heavyelements) are released by the explosion of these stars as supernovae.The COMAP experiment therefore traces massive star formation early inthe history of the universe.  Such observations put strong constraintson theoretical models of the evolution of the universe.   While we have samples of this period from observations of a fewhundred galaxies -- collections of tens of billions of stars -- moremassive than our own galaxy, the Milky Way, we are missing informationon the smaller galaxies that theory tells us combined to make largergalaxies. COMAP is sensitive to such galaxies by measuring the totalintensity of emission from whole clusters of galaxies; hence, thephrasing of "integrated intensity mapping."   To do this, the experiment measures the spectrum -- power versusfrequency -- of CO molecules across large regions of the sky.  Bymeasuring the bunching in frequency of the radio waves emitted by themolecules, we see the clusters of galaxies at different ages.  This inturn reveals the amount of stellar activity over time.   COMAP itself consists of 19 independent sensitive radio spectrometersthat operate at centimeter wavelengths, or about 30 GHz.  For maximumsensitivity, the 19 receivers are cooled to 20 kelvins, or 20 degreescentigrade above absolute zero, in an insulating vacuum vessel calleda cryostat.  Highly integrated receiver electronics amplify theincredibly weak cosmological signals, shift them to lower frequencies,and sends them into high-speed digital electronics analyze the signalsand produce the spectra.   The University of Maryland contribution to COMAP -- a collaborationled by Caltech, with contributions from Maryland, Stanford, and theUniversity of Miami -- has been to design and build the electronicsthat power, control, and monitor the receivers and parts of the signalprocessing path.  Powering the amplifiers in the receivers requires 72stable, low-noise power supplies in a compact package that allows eachvoltage to be individually tuned under computer control.  In addition,the system's computer must monitor all voltages and currents inaddition to the cryostat's vacuum pressure and an array of temperaturesensors. The system also controls and monitors microwave amplifiersand their environments that are housed on the cryostat.  A separatecomputer and set of electronics power, control, and monitor 38 modulesthat perform further microwave signal processing.   COMAP has started operation on a 10.4-meter diameter telescope at thehigh desert site of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory in California.Detailed mapping of the CO emission from selected parts of the skyover the next year will reveal the signature of star, element, andgalaxy formation, providing a new view of this key period in thedevelopment of our universe.
