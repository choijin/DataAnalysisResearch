<AbstractNarration>Earth scientists agree that the regulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere over geological timescales is an essential part of our planet's suitability for life. The essential ingredients of this long-term carbon cycle, which regulates the availability of carbon for the biosphere and the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, are release of CO2 from volcanoes and return of CO2 return to the mantle along with old oceanic crust at subduction zones. In geochemistry, our ability to understand how a compound like CO2 will behave in such environments depends on identifying what mineral or fluid carries the carbon at each stage. Some information about this can be gained from natural observations and some from experiments, but there are key stages of the carbon cycle where calculation is the best tool at our disposal. This project will carry out a detailed computational study of the structure, thermodynamics, and stability of carbonate minerals under terrestrial mantle conditions, in order to constrain their role in storing and transporting carbon during subduction and melting processes. The approach combines tools from computational mineral physics, materials science, and classical thermodynamics to make predictions about complex solid solution phases at elevated pressure and finite temperature. Such a comprehensive approach is highly unusual in Earth science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on their success in predicting a new dense structure of CaMg(CO3)2 dolomite that is more stable than any observed experimentally, and in computing the phase diagram of end-member dolomite composition, the team has four goals for this project: (1) to determine the kinetics of transition among the pure dolomite phases; (2) to determine the influence of Fe2+ in the dolomite structure on phase stability, thermodynamic properties, and phase relations in Ca(Mg,Fe)(CO3)2 system; (3) to compute phase diagrams governing decarbonation in the CaO-MgO-FeO-SiO2-CO2 system; and (4) optimistically, to compute phase diagrams governing redox exchange between C and Fe in an extended system including reduced carbon and ferric iron. Their approach begins with prediction of stable crystal structures from first principles using a combination of evolutionary crystallography and density-functional theory. Thermodynamics of stable structures are characterized by a static equation of state and a fully anharmonic treatment of temperature effects and vibrational entropy via a highly efficient molecular dynamics approach. Solid solutions and configurational entropy are treated through detailed consideration of ordering phenomena and Boltzmann weighting of populated configurations. Finally, multicomponent phase diagrams are computed from the chemical potentials of components in relevant phases. This proposal will fund the stipend and computational resources required by a female graduate student being trained in an unusual combination of experimental and computational mineral physics approaches. Their workflow for computing the stability of novel carbonate phases relative to free CO2 has the possibility to connect to novel materials approaches to carbon sequestration.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>There is a great deal of public and scientific attention currently focused on the Earth's shallow carbon cycle, which regulates exchanges between organic and inorganic carbon in sediments, the atmosphere, and the ocean. This is the cycle that modulates ice ages and that fossil fuel burning has perturbed. But Earth has a much larger, slower carbon cycle commonly called the "deep carbon cycle", which regulates exchanges between all the shallow reservoirs and the Earth's deep interior, the mantle. This cycle controls the long-term (tens of millions of years and longer) climate and regulates the habitability of the Earth. In studies of this cycle, one of the key questions is the fate of subducted carbon ... carbon in the form of limestone that is carried down through ocean trenches and into the mantle. Is it shallowly recycled, coming back out of volcanoes as CO2 gas? Or are the carbonate minerals that make up limestone stable enough to carry their cargo of carbon into the deep mantle for long-term storage? That is the fundamental problem addressed by this work.</p> <p>The approach we have taken is quantum mechanical simulation of the stability of various carbonate minerals, in order to identify which is the most stable and therefore which has the best chance of being able to hold onto carbon through the subduction process. In particular, we focused on the mineral dolomite, whose chemical formula is CaMg(CO3)2 (though it can also hold significant amounts of other elements, notably Fe). Previous expectations held that dolomite would break down at high pressure to simpler Ca and Mg carbonates. But experiments have hinted at the existence of dense, high-pressure forms of (Fe-bearing) dolomite that might extend its stability. Conflicts among the details of those experiments motivated us to use simulation methods based on the laws of quantum mechanics as an alternative approach.</p> <p>Our first result showed, unexpectedly, that when we allow the simulations to search over all possible crystal structures we reliably settle on a new crystal structure different from that seen in any of the experiments and yet unquestionably more stable, at least in the pure CaMg(CO3)2 case. We detailed the structure of this new phase, showed what it might look like if observed experimentally, and speculated that either the kinetic barrier to making it is quite high or the effect of Fe changes the stability fields.</p> <p>Next, then, we turned to the much more difficult and involved calculations to include Fe in the structure. There are many technical issues with quantum mechanical calculations involving Fe and we attempted to do the best and most careful treatment yet done to obtain confidence in our result. The answer is, in fact, that additional Fe stabilizes our newly discovered most stable structure even further. In fact, it becomes not only the most stable phase of dolomite, but over some pressure range it makes dolomite more stable than the combination of Ca, Mg, and Fe carbonates separately.</p> <p>Timely completion of this aspect of the work enabled us to explore several other avenues. We studied the temperatures at which exposures of mantle rock can be converted to the carbonate mineral magnesite (MgCO3), which is a natural (and possibly artificial) means of sequestering carbon from the atmosphere.

We studied the unusual phenomenon of submarine explosive eruption of mid-ocean ridge volcanoes, which is driven by CO2 gas bubbles, and whose occurrence may be linked to cycles of increased and decreased magmatic activity triggered by sea level changes during formation and melting of continental ice sheets.
