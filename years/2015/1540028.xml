<AbstractNarration>The IUCRC for Next Generation Photovoltaics (NGPV) is a two-site I/UCRC entering its second Phase of operation. The center comprises personnel and facilities at The University of Texas at Austin and Colorado State University. Energy sustainability represents one of the grand challenges facing modern society, and solar power provides an important source of renewable energy. Sunlight can be converted directly to electricity using a photovoltaic (PV) device, or solar cell, and the vision and long-term goal of the Next Generation Photovoltaics (NGPV) IUCRC is to help establish PV electricity as a major source of energy in the United States and the world.  The NGPV IUCRC is at the forefront of PV research. The goals of this project are for the Center to bring technological, engineering, educational and policy advances to enable a significant increase in the use of PV and make solar electricity a major source of energy.  The research program focuses on advancing PV materials and devices, seeking to improve device efficiencies while lowering cost, as well as other key issues facing the PV industry, including challenges associated with balance of systems (BOS), maintenance and operations (M&amp;O), deployment strategies, policy and education.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NGPV IUCRC provides a collaborative environment between the PV industry and university researchers to enable ground-breaking advances in PV. To enable solar to be a major source of energy, the Center is working to introduce a number of technological, engineering, educational, and policy advances.  During Phase I of the NGPV IUCRC, working in close collaboration with industry, new strategies have been developed to lower the cost of power generated by solar cells. For instance, key technologies have been created within the I/UCRC research program and translated into industry for commercial use by PV module producers and has resulted in the formation of three startup companies. Nearly 40 students at all levels have been trained in the center. To address the needs of the Industry, new research sites at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) and the Colorado School of Mines are being created.  Recruitment and training of students among under-represented groups will continue to be a focus effort of the NGPV IUCRC with the aim of significantly increasing the diversity of the workforce in both academia and the PV industry.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p> <p>The vision and long-term goal of the IUCRC for Next Generation Photovoltaics has been to help establish PV electricity as a major source of energy in the United States and the world. This remains our primary focus and we continue to strive towards improving the efficiency of our devices while working to reduce their cost. In addition to this ongoing goal of developing new solar technologies, we realized that to better represent the industry as a whole we needed to expand the research capabilities of the Center. With this in mind, we worked with the experts at Texas A&amp;M University to assist with the component of solar referred to as &ldquo;balance of system&rdquo; or BOS. BOS&rsquo; focus is on the soft costs associated with installing and maintaining the solar panels once they&rsquo;re operational.</p> <p>Much of the research at UT Austin has been focused on the development of inks that can be deposited to yield inorganic semiconductor layers for the PV devices. UT Austin is a leader in this approach and has inspired many research groups around the world to follow a similar path towards low cost PV devices. In addition to these inks, UT has recently placed a strong emphasis on an educational component and improving outreach about solar. We worked closely with Naval Postgraduate School to prepare learning materials for larger audiences to assist the DOD with deployment of solar. In addition to NPS, we have been able to utilize the Research Experiences for Teachers program to help develop curriculum about solar and have made it available to anyone who is interested on our web site. Teachers of students from a variety of age groups have spent time in our lab to help ensure that the knowledge base that is being developed is broad and relevant across a wide spectrum. As a Center, we understand the importance of educating students from a young age about solar energy as they develop to become key drivers.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impact:</strong></p> <p>Since 2015, our Center has operated a web-based Distinguished Lecture Series on a variety of topics within the solar industry including hosting numerous speakers from the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL), the Department of Energy and major corporations like First Solar and SunPower. The talks are recorded and posted on YouTube for the public to view and all told over 3,250 hours, or 54 days, of content have been viewed since the series started.</p> <p>We view our Lecture Series as a key component to our Center and see it as playing an important role going forward in educating individuals of all walks of life about the industry. The viewing statistics have shown us that only about 10% of the views of our videos have come from a combination of our own channel and our sharing the content directly with others. The vast majority of views are coming from people who are not necessarily aware of our Center and come across our content organically. We&rsquo;re reaching a new audience with important information about solar on topics as varied as the health and history of the solar industry, to the utilization of solar on native lands, to energy poverty and its effects or on how you can teach solar curriculum to high school students.</p> <p>Outside of the Lecture Series, our research on solar paper was featured in CEP Magazine and our team holds the record efficiency for PVs on this type of substrate. It is a new area that we are continuing to focus on improving and it continues our site&rsquo;s goal of finding and improving upon the next generation of photovoltaics. Each of our research sites has strong capabilities that complement one another and the UT site continues to explore more unique opportunities to drive the solar industry forward.</p> <p><strong>Summary of Activity:</strong></p> <p>During the first 3 and a half years of our Phase II award, we have expanded the overall scope of our Center by working with Texas A&amp;M University to get their site up and running and incorporated into our Center as a whole, explored new ways to teach people about solar and have continued to make strides in research on new and exciting solar technologies. Additionally, our Center has graduated over 20 students, published over 40 publications and given over 40 presentations as well. The solar industry is constantly evolving and we view our Center as a key touchpoint for both the industry members and the public at large. Whether it be through our Distinguished Lecture Series or our work with the RET program, we will continue to educate the public about the solar industry to help strive to meet our goal of helping to establish PV electricity as a major source of energy in the United States and the world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/10/2019<br>      Modified by: Brian&nbsp;A&nbsp;Korgel</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540028/1540028_10375508_1554925097602_10-13-15IABMeetingGroupPhoto--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540028/1540028_10375508_1554925097602_10-13-15IABMeetingGroupPhoto--rgov-800width.jpg" title="NGPV IAB Meeting"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540028/1540028_10375508_1554925097602_10-13-15IABMeetingGroupPhoto--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="NGPV IAB Meeting"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Group photo at Colorado State University during the Center's Fall 2015 IAB Meeting</div> <div class="imageCredit">NGPV</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brian&nbsp;A&nbsp;Korgel</div> <div class="imageTitle">NGPV IAB Meeting</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540028/1540028_10375508_1554925423754_IMG_E3483--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540028/1540028_10375508_1554925423754_IMG_E3483--rgov-800width.jpg" title="IAB Poster Session"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540028/1540028_10375508_1554925423754_IMG_E3483--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="IAB Poster Session"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Poster session during the Fall 2018 IAB Meeting at UT Austin</div> <div class="imageCredit">NGPV</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brian&nbsp;A&nbsp;Korgel</div> <div class="imageTitle">IAB Poster Session</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540028/1540028_10375508_1554925818941_IMG_7781--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540028/1540028_10375508_1554925818941_IMG_7781--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Explore UT"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540028/1540028_10375508_1554925818941_IMG_7781--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Explore UT"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">NGPV researchers of all distinctions (undergraduate, PhD and post-doc) speaking to young students at the 2016 edition of Explore UT.</div> <div class="imageCredit">NGPV</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brian&nbsp;A&nbsp;Korgel</div> <div class="imageTitle">Explore UT</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540028/1540028_10375508_1554926428156_KantaandBobi--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540028/1540028_10375508_1554926428156_KantaandBobi--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Kanta and Bobi"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540028/1540028_10375508_1554926428156_KantaandBobi--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Kanta and Bobi"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Visiting student Kanta Yamaguchi of Tohoku University is pictured in the clean room at UT Austin.
