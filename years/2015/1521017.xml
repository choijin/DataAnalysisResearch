<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Matthew B. Kleban at New York University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some contemporary theories of fundamental physics predict the existence of a so-called "multiverse" containing many distinct bubble universes. These bubbles collide, and collisions with our own bubble produce "cosmic wakes" that travel across our universe, creating specific patterns that are potentially observable with cosmological data from satellite- and ground-based observatories. The detection of such a collision would be a transformative discovery, demonstrating that our observable universe is a tiny part of a vastly larger whole populated by bubbles containing regions of highly exotic physics. It would confirm a prediction of string theory, provide crucial evidence for the nature of "dark energy", and permanently alter our view of the big bang. Professor Kleban will advance a program of research focused on those aspects of string theory and quantum gravity that predict effects --- like bubble collisions --- that can be tested with cosmological observations. Professor Kleban's ongoing research seeks to determine the microphysical origin of cosmic inflation, a period of explosive expansion that took place in the very early universe.  As such, Professor Kleban's research advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.   Professor Kleban's work will also continue to have broader impact in the form of public lectures and interviews, and in inspiring undergraduate and graduate physics students at NYU. On another front, Prof. Kleban will also train and assist in the professional development of a postdoctoral researcher who will participate in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, Prof. Kleban will attempt to realize a model known as "unwinding inflation" in a consistent, stabilized string theory compactification.  This model has a number of notable advantages that might make it a plausible explanation for inflation, particularly the fact that it begins spontaneously from a generic meta-stable de Sitter phase in the string landscape.  He will also continue his work on inflationary signatures of bubble collisions, tunneling, and other initial-state effects, as well as dynamical features produced during inflation that might indicate its microphysical origin.  Lastly, he will continue to study string theory in strongly time-dependent settings, such as cosmology and relativistic brane scattering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the PI, Matthew Kleban, together with several postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, in pursuing a program of theoretical research in fundamental aspects of gravity and particle physics, focusing in particular on the intersection of high energy physics with cosmology.  The discipline of cosmology has come into its own as a modern science.  Ever more powerful earth-bound telescopes and satellite observatories, coupled with major advances in computational data analysis, has enabled measurements of the parameters of the current and early universe with increasingly high precision.  This data brings into sharp focus a profound and long-standing question:  how did our universe begin?  Cosmological observations have shown that the universe is extraordinarily smooth and homogeneous on large scales.  This observation is very difficult to account for unless the universe expanded very rapidly and by an enormous amount in the tiny fraction of a second just after the big bang, a period known as cosmic inflation.  We do not know what mechanism was responsible for this explosive growth.  Whatever it was, it took place at a very high energy scale, when quantum effects and gravity both played a crucial role, and it involved new forces or particles that remain to be discovered.  In the late 1990s cosmologists discovered that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating:  distant galaxies are moving apart from each other at a rate that increases with time. Gravity is an attractive force that tends to pull things together, slowing the expansion.  The exception is if there is a positive energy density associated to the vacuum, to otherwise empty space.  In fact, this observed accelerated expansion is a form of cosmic inflation, but occurring over a time-scale of billions of years instead of tiny fractions of a second.  Explaining the nature and origin of dark energy is known as the cosmological constant problem.  I believe these two great mysteries - the microphysical mechanism responsible for cosmic inflation, and the cosmological constant problem - are deeply intertwined.  A major goal of my research program is to connect these two fundamental mysteries.  A major result of this research project was the discovery of previously uknown, hidden symmetries in theories of multiple axion particles.  Axions are hypothetical particles whose existence could resolve many mysteries: the strong CP problem of the standard model of particle physics, the nature of dark matter, the origin of cosmic inflation, and the solution to the cosmological constant problem.     The discovery of these novel hidden symmetries in multi-axion theories provided a powerful computational tool that allowed the PI, along with several postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, to analyze what had previously appeared to be completely intractable complex scenarios.  We studied theories of hundreds of axions particles with randomly chosen parameters.  We were able to show that a broad class of such theories have the astonishing capability to produces universes that look remarkably similar to the one we inhabit.  These universes begin with a big bang like the one we observe, undergo a period of cosmic inflation, followed by an epoch of radiation and then matter domination.  Eventually, at an age of billions of years, these expanding universes become dominated by the residual dark energy of the axion fields and begin a period of slowly accelerated expansion.  This discovery and the investigations of its implications constituted much of the work on this grant.  A notable unrelated result was the discovery that a long-standing proposal that the horizon area of black holes should be quantized in units of the Planck area could have observable effects on the gravitational radiation emitted during the merger of two black holes and measured by the LIGO observatory.  In a different direction, the PI conjectured that the only possible stable solutions of quantum gravity with negative vacuum energy must posses a property known as supersymmetry.  If this conjecture is true, it has wide-ranging implications for string theory, holography, and a class of quantum theories known as conformal field theories.  Finally, the PI and collaborators achieved a major breakthrough in long-standing work on a stochastic statistical system known as the Brownian Loop Soup.  This breakthrough allowed the PI to calculate exact correlation functions for this system, which will open up a new area of investigation in the study of this class of models.  Two images - one showing two overlapping Brownian loops, and another showing the same two loops with their interiors shaded - are attached.
