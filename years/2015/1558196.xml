<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project will examine how the changing nature of sea ice influences marine sociolegal dynamics, with special attention given to disputes regarding maritime boundaries and resources in the Beaufort and Bering Seas.  The doctoral student will explore how the law could potentially recognize sea ice as a flexible entity that is incorporated into multiple legal spaces and systems.  The project will broaden theoretical understandings of linkages among human systems, climate and environmental change, and spatial dimensions of the ocean and law in the greater Arctic region.  The project will advance conceptualizations of sea ice in a way that recognizes that sea ice is not a stationary object, because it moves through time and space in response to the physical forces of wind, ocean currents, and heating.  Furthermore, sea ice is neither terrestrial nor marine, just as it is neither purely solid nor liquid.  Project findings will expand knowledge about the relationships between this dynamic physical element and the political powers that govern a complex ocean environment.  The project will provide new insights regarding how the law can recognize sea ice as a flexible entity that is attached to and integrated into multiple legal spaces and systems.  These insights will be of value to those charged with overseeing activities in regions where sea ice occurs.  Among those organizations is the multinational Arctic Council, which the United States chairs from 2015 to 2017.  Project findings will help address two of the focus areas of the U.S. chairmanship (the impacts of changing climate and environmental conditions and Arctic Ocean safety, security, and stewardship) by expanding knowledge about the role that changing spatial sea ice patterns have in the many political debates of this region.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changes to the spatial extent of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean simultaneously permit and endanger maritime operations, and those changes impact current debates over maritime boundaries, presenting an interesting challenge for international law.  In conducting this project, the doctoral student will combine perspectives from the fields of legal geography and ocean-space studies to assess how dynamic and changing sea ice shapes the marine social-environment, particularly in terms of legal and political contestations in ocean-spaces of the greater Arctic region.  The student will use three data-collection strategies:  legal archival analysis to gain a base understanding of all relevant laws and agreements; document analysis of reports and other official documents to understand and contextualize the broader environmental, social, political and economic issues in each of these regions; and semi-structured interviews with policy experts, operational experts that work in sea-ice areas, and sea-ice researchers.  The interviews will focus on participants' experiences with boundary issues in sea-ice waters, their perceptions of sovereignty, their experience with resource extractive operations in sea-ice waters, and their perceptions of change in an already dynamic Arctic marine environment.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>My research explores the relationship between sea ice, law and living marine resources in the dynamic spaces of the Bering and Beaufort Seas. Sea ice is a dynamic physical element of the marine ecosystem, as it is a mixture of a hard substrate and a fluid substance; it is moved and altered by a multitude of physical forcings in the polar marine environment, such as ocean currents, wind, and surface heating. Its dynamic physicality impacts a variety of socio-cultural processes in ocean-space, particularly commercial fisheries operations in the Bering Sea. The management of fisheries resources in the Bering is carried out through various levels of governance at seasons that coincide with the seasonal onset, persistence and break up of sea ice. Sea ice has a presence in this system, as well as a relationship between the rules that govern this space, however latent that they may be. Sea ice influences, changes, and impacts the various ways in which humans use, go through, transit and even conceptualize movement in ocean areas. Sea ice provided me with an interesting and unique intellectual point of engagement with a central question that has recently begun to be explored within the discipline of geography: In what ways does the physical environment impact more stationary notions of law? Some of my key findings regarding fisheries governance in the Bering Sea have been to highlight the limitations of laws that focus only on fish species and their habitat, in lieu of considering broader dynamics that <em>shape</em> or <em>create</em> that same habitat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Habitat&rdquo; is far more relational and flexible than the bounded, fixed notion of the law.&nbsp; Sea ice is a very specific, and illustrative, example of gaps within the governance of marine spaces.
