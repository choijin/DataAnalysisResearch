<AbstractNarration>Global climate change is having significant effects on areas of the Southern Ocean, and a better understanding of this ecosystem will permit predictions about the large-scale implications of these shifts. The haptophyte Phaeocystis antarctica is an important component of the phytoplankton communities in this region, but little is known about the factors controlling its distribution. Preliminary data suggest that P. antarctica posses unique adaptations that allow it to thrive in regions with dynamic light regimes. This research will extend these results to identify the physiological and genetic mechanisms that affect the growth and distribution of P. antarctica. This work will use field and laboratory-based studies and a suite of modern molecular techniques to better understand the biogeography and physiology of this key organism. Results will be widely disseminated through publications as well as through presentations at national and international meetings. In addition, raw data will be made available through open-access databases. This project will support the research and training of two graduate students and will foster an established international collaboration with Dutch scientists. Researchers on this project will participate in outreach programs targeting K12 teachers as well as high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Phaeocystis antarctica</em> is an alga that forms intense phytoplankton blooms in the Southern Ocean. Such blooms occur in the open waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current but mostly in the ice-enclosed polynyas that border the Antarctic continent. It is not well understood what factors drive bloom formation and why <em>Phaeocystis</em> dominates such blooms. We use DNA and RNA technologies to study the role of heterotrophic bacteria in promoting both the intensity and persistence of <em>Phaeocystis</em> blooms. It was found that 5-6 bacterial taxa associate with <em>P. antarctica</em> colonies and they are most likely localized in the colony interior. Metagenome analysis indicates that these bacteria play essential roles in the iron acquisition, fatty acid degradation, vitamin B12 production, dimethyl-sulfoproprionate (DMSP) metabolism of <em>Phaeocystis</em> blooms. It was also found that not only do cells multiply within the colony matrix, colonies themselves divide.
