<AbstractNarration>The focus of the project is the integration of computer science and mathematics concepts in a middle school course. The project's goal is to explain students' learning of four concepts that are part of both mathematics and computer science: variables, expressions, loops and abstraction.  The project will design a middle school computer science course to incorporate the mathematics concepts. It will explore technology-based dynamic representations that are part of an interactive computer-based system. The research results and product development are potentially transformative to mathematics, science, and computer science teaching and learning in light of the expansion of computer science courses nationwide and current national mathematics and science standards. The project has strong potential for impact because it focuses on signature concepts from mathematics and computational thinking that are both areas of overlap and foundational concepts across a range of grade levels and courses. The STEM+Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program seeks to advance multidisciplinary integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning through applied research and development across one or more domains; integration of STEM in computer science; and broadening participation in computer science. Investments are made in critical areas of pedagogy, pre-service and in-service teacher professional development. The ECR program contribution to the funding of this project, emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments in ECR are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considering the concepts dynamically is a significant and potentially transformative departure from current practice in mathematics and computer science. The research questions examine learning outcomes for students and a theory of action for engaging computational thinking in diverse classrooms. The project will begin by creating assessments of students' conceptual understanding. Then, it will employ a design-based research study for creating technology platforms and activities for students. Finally, it will refine the theory of action for implementing the course. The data collection and analysis includes case studies of students' learning to support the research results and to refine the curriculum materials. Teachers and school district leaders are involved with the design and implementation of the materials. Teachers will be interviewed about their implementation of the course and about students that have been identified for deeper case study analysis.</AbstractNarration>

Programming is a key ingredient not only in computer science (CS) learning but also in the context of STEM and Computing (STEM+C) integration.

However, these concepts are hard to grasp by novice learners of programming as students harbour several misconceptions related to how these foundational concepts work.
