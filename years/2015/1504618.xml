<AbstractNarration>This research seeks to identify what faculty in engineering and related STEM fields do that causes students to feel more supported.  The literature tells us that students who feel more supported by faculty and interact more with them engage more, feel better, and do better academically. Yet, we lack an understanding of the impacts of faculty behaviors that is detailed enough to give faculty and other instructors specific strategies for success to apply to diverse students in a range of settings and classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without this knowledge, faculty attempts to support students can be diluted or fail altogether. This project's goal is to take the randomness out of the equation so that faculty can effectively help and strongly support students. This project adopts both quantitative and qualitative data collected in both course-level case studies and longitudinal research designs over short (quarter-long) time scales. A wide range of instruments including surveys, interviews, faculty/TA reports, and observations will be used. The overall goal is to capture a rich picture of particular courses with the goal of understanding how students become highly engaged or when they do not engage, what appears to limit or hold back their engagement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project was to understand better what it takes to engage students in large classes that contain a lot of math, problem solving, science, and critical thinking skills development at both an abstract and an applied level.  Since a large majority of undergraduate classes in electrical (EE) and mechanical engineering (ME) contain all of these elements, seven large, sophomore/junior EE and ME classes were chosen to dive deeper and understand more comprehensively how what faculty and teaching assistants (TAs) do is related to how engineering students pay attention, participate, put forth effort, and feel (both positively and negatively) in their classes.  Instructors in engineering and many related physical science majors in college continue to offer a large portion of their teaching via lecture (as opposed to more student-centered teaching approaches).   While lecture is predisposed to less student engagement, understanding what TAs and faculty can do even while relying heavily on lecture can make a difference in how well and how often students engage and in turn, how well they perform and how long they persist in these challenging fields of study.     Not surprisingly, our study showed that what TAs do and what regular faculty do in lecture sessions and other learning environments (quiz sections, recitations, office hours, and laboratories) is related to how students engage in different ways.  Students view faculty as the authoritative masters of their engineering courses and expect what the faculty member offers to be very well organized, delivered in a way that connects to the student's experience, transparent, and fair.   In contrast, students are more forgiving of TAs and expect the TA to be more of a companion or peer in the journey toward learning.   Students expect that TAs will come alongside of them and persist with them, asking questions and navigating difficulty until they understand a concept, complete a problem or project successfully, or otherwise achieve a learning outcome for a course.   Particularly in larger classes of more than 40 students, student engagement is more strongly linked to TA behaviors than faculty behaviors.   Given that TAs have far fewer professional development opportunities and experience than regular faculty, this study has highlighted the need to not only train more TAs but to do so in specific techniques that are likely to be successful in the subjects and in the learning environments in which the TA will teach.  Broad, generalized instruction on teaching is unlikely to benefit the TA as much as more discipline specific training that emphasizes both how to speak well and engagingly through lecture but also how to develop relationship, rapport, and trust with students.     Further, different students respond to the behaviors and teaching patterns of faculty and TAs in different ways.   This study also explored whether strong faculty support or strong TA support was linked to student engagement in different ways for different students.   Results from analysis of our data show that for under-represented minorities including women, black and other non-Asian, non-white students, and international students, faculty and TA support appears to more strongly influence students' decisions to engage in the learning process.  While what TAs and faculty do matters to all students, their choices appear to make even more of a difference to under-represented students in engineering. Our results imply that the decisions that both faculty and TAs make in supporting and interacting with students often have a disproportionate (stronger) effect on students who are under-represented in the classroom. The one exception is transfer students who seem less influenced by faculty support than their native (non-transfer) peers.    Why do these results matter?  At an intellectual merit level, our data contribute to better understanding of the complicated ways in which faculty and TA behaviors influence students' choices to engage and in turn, students' performance and persistence.  The broader impact of the research speaks to how important it is to invest in both faculty and TA training, not just in general teaching practice but in specific techniques to reach and engage students who are chronically under-represented in engineering and other STEM fields.     Students don't just go to class with a predisposition to engage or not. They appear to be highly influenced by not only what their instructors (faculty and TAs) do to prepare for class but also by how instructors interact with them on a weekly basis.  This study has highlighted the important and unique roles that faculty and TAs play in student engagement in engineering and related STEM fields.
