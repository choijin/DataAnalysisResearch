<AbstractNarration>Galaxies are the birthplace of stars and planets, and act as cosmic signposts for the invisible dark matter.  The shapes and colors of galaxies provide important insight into how and when galaxies formed their stars and merged to become larger galaxies.  Dr. Lotz and team will devise innovative software tools to measure the structures of thousands of nearby galaxies, and compare the distribution of shapes of today's galaxies to distant ones observed as they were ~10 billion years ago.  By tracking the metamorphosis of galaxy shapes over cosmic time, and by comparing with simulations of galaxy evolution, the project will illuminate the physical processes governing the evolution of galaxies like our own Milky Way.  The tools developed by this project will help to fully exploit future astronomy surveys with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and  James Webb Space Telescope.  Besides its scientific significance, the project will support the training of a postdoctoral fellow, and the education of a graduate student and a Baltimore-city high school student.  The broader public will be engaged through a related citizen science project to study galaxy images.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stellar and gaseous structures of galaxies provide direct insight into their most recent assembly events, as well as longer timescale internal secular processes, both of which drive galaxy star-formation and quenching.  However, the existing coarse structural classifications fail to capture the complex assembly processes responsible for the morphological transformation of galaxies over the past 10 billion years.  Building upon working currently being done for redshifts 0.5&lt;z&lt;3, this project will develop new non-parametric, quantitative measures of galaxy structure, identifying galaxy mergers and classifying galaxy morphology, and apply this approach to nearby galaxies in the Pan-STARRS Optical Galaxy Survey.  This low-redshift baseline will be compared to high-redshift observations by the Hubble Space Telescope to track the emergence of spheroidal galaxies and the frequency of different types of galaxy mergers over time.  In concert with this observational analysis, the investigators will statistically compare cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from Illustris to the distribution and evolution of morphologies of observed galaxies at redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;3; this will provide physical insights into the measured structural quantities and distributions,  and place constraints on the viable modes for galaxy assembly and evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The growth of galaxies through galaxy-galaxy mergers is a cornerstone of our current theoretical model of galaxy evolution. With ground based and Hubble Space Telescope surveys, now we have a broad-brush picture of how the shapes, star-formation rates, and  masses of galaxies have evolved over the past 10 billion years. But we do not understand yet the underlying physical processes connecting observed galaxy structures to their star-formation histories and masses.  Understanding these processes requires tracking galaxy mergers in detail and tracing their impact on galaxy star-formation and structural evolution.  We used machine learning algorithms, trained by mock images of galaxy simulations,  to identify galaxy mergers in deep Hubble Space Telescope images of distant galaxies.   We find that the galaxy merger occurred more frequently 10-11 billion years ago, with galaxy merger rates about twice that predicted by theoretical models.   It is not clear if the discrepancy between our measurements and the predictions are genuine, or if the difference are the result of imperfect training images.  Using a large sample of local galaxies in combination of the distant galaxies observed by Hubble,  we track the evolution of galaxy shapes and star-formation properties over the last 10 billion years.  We compare these distributions to the predicted distributions from two large cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution &mdash; Illustris and IllustrisTNG.   Although we find reasonable agreement between the observations and simulations,  both sets of simulations fail to reproduce the morphology-color relationship for red and spheroidal galaxies.   Neither simulation produces enough red and spheroidal galaxies,  suggesting that the simulations don’t adequately describe the halt of star-formation associated with the merger-driven formation of spheroid-shaped galaxies.
