<AbstractNarration>This award supports the travel of US participants, in particular students and early career researchers, to attend a graduate student workshop (Introduction to Relative Aspects in Representation Theory, Langlands Functoriality and Automorphic Forms, May 16-20, 2016) and/or a conference (Relative Trace Formula, Periods, L-Functions and Harmonic Analysis May 23-27, 2016) at the Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques (CIRM) in Luminy, France.  The workshop will consist primarily of four series of four lectures given by some of the leading experts in the area of automorphic representations and is aimed at graduate students. The conference will include 10-15 invited talks by leading researchers. In addition to the invited talks there will be ample opportunities for young researchers to present and discuss their work in both formal and informal settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automorphic forms and Langlands functoriality are active and important areas of research that involve applying the methods of representation theory to classical problems in number theory and harmonic analysis.  The workshop and conference focus especially on matters that involve periods of automorphic forms and harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces.  Much of the impetus for the workshop is derived from work related to relative trace formulas and the associated theory over local fields.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Centre International de Rencontres Math&eacute;matiques (CIRM) in Marseille Luminy, France held a special semester, entitled "Relative Aspects in Representation Theory, Langlands Functoriality and Automorphic Forms," from January to June of 2016.  This grant supplied NSF support for U.S. participants, mainly doctoral students in mathematics, to attend the May 16-20 "Doctoral School" workshop "Introduction to Relative Aspects in Representation Theory, Langlands Functoriality and Automorphic Forms" and the May 23-27 conference "Relative Trace Formula, Periods, L-Functions and Harmonic Analysis."  There were 199 participants at the workshop and conference.  Of these, 21 participants were from the US, and 13 of these participants were funded.  All 10 US graduate students who requested funding received the full amount of the approved expenses they requested.  The workshop was directed at graduate students and it involved four minicourses by leaders in subareas related to the theme of the special semester.  Two of these minicourses were filmed and the videos are available on the conference website.  The main conference focused more on the latest developments in the field, and it was attended by both graduate students and more senior scholars.  Beyond the lectures, students and scholars were provided opportunities to forge more personal connections with other scholars, via nature walks, visits to neighboring towns, sharing meals, and so forth.  The latter settings allow extended conversations about mathematics, and greatly increase the likelihood of future communications once the conference is over.  More details about the conference and its outcomes are available at http://prasad-heiermann.weebly.com/.          Last Modified: 05/11/2017       Submitted by: Jeffrey L Hakim]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
