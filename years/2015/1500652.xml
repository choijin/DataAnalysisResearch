<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the "Boot Camp" preceding the American Mathematical Society (AMS) Summer Institute in Algebraic Geometry on July 6-10, 2015 at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City. The algebraic geometry community has developed the now longstanding tradition of running an institute every ten years with the purpose of convening a majority of practitioners in the world to overview the developments of the past decade and to outline the most pressing and far-reaching problems for the next.  The next AMS Summer Institute in Algebraic Geometry will take place at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, on July 13-31, 2015. Increasingly, algebraic geometry has become so diverse and technically demanding that it is daunting for graduate students and postdocs to master the techniques and wide range of activity that occurs in the field beyond their immediate areas of study. It has thus become imperative to run a "boot camp" in the week preceding the institute designed exclusively for advanced graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The purpose of the boot camp is threefold:&lt;br/&gt;1) To familiarize the participants with a broad range of developments in algebraic geometry in an informal setting, thus increasing their ability to follow discussions and participate at the institute.&lt;br/&gt;2) To introduce young algebraic geometers to their peers and the previous generation of experts in order to increase collaborations and form a support group for young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;3) To introduce young researchers to new techniques and questions in order to make them more effective researchers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The boot camp will focus on several subjects in algebraic geometry that have seen significant advances in the last decade, including birational geometry, Bridgeland stability, the Hassett-Keel program, p-adic Hodge theory, Shimura varieties, perfectoid spaces, the tautological ring of the moduli spaces of curves, Boij-Soderbeg theory, and singularities in characteristic p. The choices of topics are results of coordination with the organizers of the AMS Summer Institute in Algebraic Geometry. The boot camp will have wide-ranging broader impacts as it will introduce the most dynamic and brightest young algebraic geometry graduate students and postdocs to each other. It is expected that many new collaborations will result from this interaction. In addition to the scientific benefits, young researchers will form a support network of their peers, which can significantly improve retention and success in the STEM disciplines.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This past summer at the University of Utah, in Salt Lake City,  the algebraic geometry community continued the tradition of running a  `bootcamp' for graduate students and postdocs in the week proceeding the decenniel Summer Institute.  With the help of funding from NSF and NSA we ran a very successful program in which 15  top early career algebraic geometers gave talks and ran working groups for  the next  generation of students and postdocs centered around the most exciting developments of the last decade. Our aims were focused on training and community building, namely to: (1)  familiarize participants with a broad-range of developments in algebraic geometry in order to prepare them to benefit from activities which would take place at the institute and in their work;  (2) generate interractions between participants as well as with those leaders from the previous generation of algebraic geometers; and (3)  introduce young algebraic geometers to new techniques and questions in order to make them more effective researchers.   To plan the program, we began by selecting  15 subjects in algebraic and arithmetic geometry that have seen major advances in the last decade. These topics were chosen in coordination with the organizers of the Utah Algebraic Geometry Institute to better prepare the young researchers in the topics of the plenary lectures. We then identified top pre-tenure  researchers who were considered by many experts we consulted to be top  contributors and rising stars with track records of giving good talks.  The list of the group topics and the mentors were: Ben Antieau  (Homotopy theory and  applications in algebraic geometry), Barghav Bhatt  (Perfectoid spaces, p-adic Hodge theory), Ana Caraiani  (Shimura varieties), Dawei Chen (Birational geometry of moduli spaces),  Angelica Cueto  (Tropical geometry, tropicalization),  Daniel Erman (Boij-Soderberg theory),  Jack Huizenga  (Bridgeland stability and moduli spaces of sheaves), Brian Lehmann (The minimal model program), Aaron Pixton (Tautological ring of $M_g$), Colleen Robles (Hodge Theory), Guilia Sacca (Differential geometry and algebraic geometry, $K$-stability), Orsola Tommasi (The geometry of the moduli space of curves and abelian varieties), Kevin Tucker (Singularities in characteristic $p$ and invariants defined via Frobenius),    Yu-Jong Tzeng (Gromov-Witten theory, applications to Gottsche's conjecture); and Bianca Viray (Brauer groups and  arithmetic of del Pezzo surfaces).      Finally, we note that 7 out of the 15 mentors chosen to lead the bootcamp were female--a significant improvement over the past decades.  During the bootcamp we  held an evening poster session where many of the students and postdocs were able to feature their research.  We also had an evening set aside for a professional development session, where we had a panel of our mentors who had recently gone through job searches field questions from the audience and discuss career planning.     At the end of the program, we sent out an anonymous electronic questionnaire to get feedback on our activities, and of the approximately 140 participants, we had 93 respondents.     All of the respondents reported that they had a good experience. Most people (and almost all of those who attended) found the professional development session helpful. Almost everyone seems to have made new connections and a good chunk of them seem to have started talking about new projects. The complaints seem to be mainly about food, housing and that the poster session was cramped.  We did learn that we could have done a few things differently, which we include here for the next people who plan this event: (1) It would have been better to have the poster session earlier (Monday or Tuesday) so that the participants would interact sooner; (2) We could have obtained funding to record and post the morning lectures, which were so well done.     We are currently putting together a vollume from the bootcamp to be published in...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
