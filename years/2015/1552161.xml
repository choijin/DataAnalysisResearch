<AbstractNarration>In this project, features in the Earth's ionosphere called traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) will be studied by analyzing ground- and satellite-based measurements. The ground-based measurements include total electron current (TEC) measurements collected by a few hundred ground-based GPS receivers distributed across South and Central America and the Caribbean region in the LISN network (Low-Latitude ionospheric sensor network). It also includes ionosondes, Fabry-Perot Interferometers, and the incoherent scatter radars at Jicamarca and Arecibo. The outcomes of this research will be a better understanding of the variability and characteristics of medium-scale TIDs (MSTIDs) and TEC depletions during different ionospheric and thermospheric conditions. The study also aims to resolve whether there exists a link between tropical storms and the formation of MSTIDs. The occurrence of plasma irregularities poses a prominent natural hazard to communication, navigation and high precision pointing systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conjugate properties of MSTIDs and plasma structures seen at mid-latitudes under a variety of different ionosphere and thermosphere conditions and for magnetically quiet and active conditions will be investigated. Specifically, the following questions will be addressed: What is the control that the latitudinal variability of the plasma conductivity and the propagation direction of atmospheric gravity waves exert on the MSTIDs? What is the initiation mechanism of mid latitude depletions? Do MSTIDs map to conjugate locations during disturbed conditions? Can MSTIDs or TIDs influence the latitudinal (and then altitude) extension of equatorial plasma bubbles? During special events, such as large magnetic storms, TEC values collected by the majority of GPS receivers that exist in North America will be also be used to study poleward expansions of TEC depletions and MSTIDs. Electric fields and density observations gathered with several instruments on-board C/NOFS, DMSP and SWARM satellites will complement the observations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project's main goal was to study the effect of a geophysical process called traveling ionospheric disturbances (TID).  TIDs consist of waves in the plasma density produced by periodic wavy motions of the underlying neutral atmosphere that reach altitudes as high as 300 km. The need to understand the behavior and the characteristics of these waves is due to their ability to initiate plasma instabilities at low latitudes.  TIDs can seed and accelerate the onset of plasma bubbles in which secondary processes create plasma irregularities that have harmful effects on the operation of radio satellite links.  Data analysis conducted under this grant revealed that the TID disturbances typically create electric fields and form mirror images in the opposite hemisphere.  We found that the TID velocity is between 100 and 400 m/s, their scale size up to 1000 km, the periodicity between 10 and 120 minutes, and quite a variable occurrence pattern. It was discovered that TIDs with different scale sizes coexist and transit at different altitudes.  Two additional studies allowed us to search for the dependencies of total electron content, named TEC, to build a low-latitude ionosphere forecasting capability. These two studies included investigations on the total electron content statistics and its relationship with several geophysical parameters that influence its evolution and spatial distribution. We also applied regression analysis and artificial intelligence algorithms to unravel the total electron content's dependencies on several solar, magnetosphere, and ionosphere parameters.  The project's broad impact includes the participation and education of a graduate student in some parts of this investigation.  It is also indicated that a full assessment of the characteristics of TIDs will get us closer to a forecasting capability of plasma bubbles.
