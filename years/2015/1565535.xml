<AbstractNarration>Atmospheric flow through complex terrain is difficult to simulate due to the small scales of mountains and hills and the dependence of wind on a variety of factors, such as the temperature structure of the air near the ground.  This award will allow a group of researchers the opportunity to join a large field campaign in Portugal and to supplement the experiment by deploying a large number of instruments.  The project should result in a data set that will be used by numerical modelers for many years to come, with impacts on understanding boundary layer flows important to wind energy, air pollution, aviation, contaminant dispersion and alpine warfare.  In addition, a number of students will have the opportunity to participate in the campaign and interact with international colleagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Perdigao field campaign is part of a large European effort to improve the efficiency of wind energy production.  This award will bring a basic research component to the effort, with a focus on studying interactions between flows of different scales, effects of topographic and diurnal thermal forcing, valley/slope boundary layers and turbine wakes.  Instrumentation provided by this project will include multiple Lidars, a Tethered Lifting System, ceilometer, radiosonde system, anemometers, and the OU CLAMPS integrated mobile profiling system.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A grand challenge from the wind energy industry is to provide reliable forecasts on mountain winds several hours in advance at microscale (less than 1 km in spatial and second to hours in time) resolution. This requires better microscale wind energy physics included in forecasting tools, for which field observations are imperative. While mesoscale (on the order 1-100 km in spatial and hours to days in time) resolution measurements abound, microscale processes are not monitored in practice nor do plentiful measurements exist at this scale. After a decade of preparation, a group of European and US collaborators conducted a field campaign during May 01 ? June 15, 2017 in Vale Cobr?o in central Portugal to delve into microscale processes in complex terrain. This valley is nestled within a parallel double ridge near the town of Perdig?o with dominant wind climatology normal to the ridges, offering a nominally simple yet natural setting for fundamental scientific studies. The dense instrument ensemble deployed covered an approximately 4 x 4 km swath horizontally and ~ 10 km kilometers vertically, with measurement resolutions of tens of meters and seconds. A lone wind turbine on one of the ridges provided opportunities for turbine wake studies. Meteorological data were collected continuously, capturing multiscale flow interactions from weather to microscales, diurnal variability, flows driven by heating and cooling of the ground (thermal circulation), turbine wake and acoustics, internal waves and turbulence. Particularly noteworthy are the extensiveness of the instrument array, space-time scales covered, use of leading edge multiple-lidar technology alongside conventional tower and remote sensors, fruitful cross-Atlantic partnership, and adaptive management of the campaign. &nbsp;The project being reported was a part of the overall US-EU Perdig?o project contributed by University of Notre Dame, which was the lead academic institution of the US research enterprise. It included studies of flow through an approximately 100m gap in one of the ridges under stably stratified conditions. The study illustrated that siting of wind turbines in topographic gaps may not reap advantages. In another investigation, the breakup of thermally driven nocturnal (colder) valley flows by overlying pressure-driven flows were investigated. This study allowed establishment of a criteria for the breakdown of such flow systems, causing ventilation of the valley whereby (polluted) air in the valley is mixed with cleaner air aloft. The mammoth amount of data collected also allowed development of new artificial neural network (ANN) methodologies relevant to wind speed estimation at wind-turbine hub heights based on low-level measurements, leading to disclosure of an invention. The ANN portion of the project has opened up new avenues for commercialization of basic research. The project led to a series of archival journal publications, conference presentations, MS and PhD theses research, human resources development and additional partnerships with US government laboratories and industry. All data are being archived for public use.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Harindra&nbsp;J&nbsp;Fernando</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1565535/1565535_10418124_1590680155424_Figure1-location--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1565535/1565535_10418124_1590680155424_Figure1-location--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project location"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1565535/1565535_10418124_1590680155424_Figure1-location--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project location"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Project location on a map and a photo of the Vale Cobrï¿½o</div> <div class="imageCredit">Fernando et al.
