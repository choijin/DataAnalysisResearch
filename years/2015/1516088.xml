<AbstractNarration>Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the microscopic theory of the strong interactions and allows us to understand how hadrons, such as the proton, neutron and pion, are formed through partons, the building blocks of QCD. High-energy scattering processes can be used to explore how partons (quarks and gluons) that come out of a high-energy scattering make a transition into hadrons. While various aspects of these processes are well understood, many striking puzzles remain. Transverse single-spin asymmetries (SSAs) represent one such puzzle. Early QCD calculations predicted basically vanishing effects, but experiments revealed huge SSAs up to 40%. Despite decades of research, the detailed understanding of single-spin asymmetries in QCD is still missing. In this context, this project will explore the role played by the fragmentation of partons for different single-spin asymmetries. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be involved in this very active field at the frontier of current hadronic physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make possible extensive numerical studies of transverse SSAs for single-hadron production in proton-proton collisions, where one of the incoming protons is polarized perpendicular to the reaction plane. These studies will make use of existing analytical results that were developed previously by the investigator and one of his graduate students. Not only is this investigation expected to clarify if parton fragmentation can indeed explain the huge SSAs observed experimentally, but also whether a simultaneous description of SSAs in hadronic collisions and in lepton-induced processes can be obtained. This project is closely related to experiments conducted at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and other accelerator facilities worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ High-energy scattering processes can be used to explore in detail Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the generally accepted microscopic theory of the strong interaction.  They allow us to understand how hadrons are formed through partons --- quarks and gluons, the "building blocks" of QCD.  They also reveal the complex dynamics underlying the fragmentation of partons, i.e., how partons that come out of a high-energy scattering make a transition into hadrons.     The project has been mainly dealing with various quantities which characterize the parton structure of hadrons.  Arguably the most important outcomes in that regard are the following four results:  (1) Wigner functions for quarks:  Wigner functions are well known in quantum mechanics.  They are the counterpart of classical phase space distributions and contain the same information as the wave function of a system.  Partonic Wigner functions were introduced about 15 years ago.  They describe the most general two-parton structure of hadrons.  We identified the first process in which Wigner functions of quarks could be measured.  (2) Parton fragmentation functions:  For many scattering processes the transition from partons to hadrons is described through fragmentation functions.  Different fragmentation functions exist, depending on the parton type, the number of detected hadrons, and the final-state kinematics.  The PI co-authored a review of this important, broad and active research area.  (3) Relations between parton correlation functions:  Many observables in high-energy collisions involve higher-twist parton distributions and/or fragmentation functions.  For several such observables we found an unexpected (apparent) frame-dependence of the analytical expressions for the cross section.  We were able to resolve this puzzle after using (newly derived) Lorentz-invariance relations between certain higher-twist parton correlation functions.  This development not only puts the analysis of higher-twist observables for inclusive and semi-inclusive reactions on safer ground, but it can (and should) also be extended to other cases such as exclusive processes.  (4) Partonic quasi-distributions:  Recent developments allow one to compute parton distributions in lattice QCD by using so-called quasi-distributions.  This field is very active, and other related methods are currently explored as well.  However, so far quasi-distributions were only used for the (simplest) forward parton distributions.  We studied for the first time the usefulness of the quasi-distribution approach for generalized parton distributions, which play an important role for 3D-imaging of hadrons.  Generally, our results showed that this can be a very promising field.  They actually helped initiating exploratory lattice calculations, for which preliminary results were shown very recently at meetings.        The broader impact of the project has been primarily in the training of postdocs and graduate students.  Specifically, one postdoc and three students were involved in the activities.  The main goal of their training has been to prepare them for careers in areas such as continued work in fundamental physics research, work in industry, or administrative positions at the borderline of research and industry.  The young researchers participated in (a number of) publications, and gave presentations at national and international conferences.  One student even gave two invited seminars at other institutions.  The PI helped to promote the field of 3D-imaging of hadrons via parton distributions through a lecture series at the HUGS (Hampton University Graduate Studies) Summer School and informal presentations for incoming graduate students at Temple University.
