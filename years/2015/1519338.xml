<AbstractNarration>This award supports on-site lodging, subsistence, and operational expenses for a diverse group of U.S. doctoral students and distinguished faculty mentors to participate in a doctoral colloquium (workshop) on information science research. It will be co-located with the 2015 iConference hosted by the University of California-Irvine and held in Newport Beach, California on March 24-27, 2015. The iConferences, the annual meetings of the iSchool community, are a leading forum that brings together faculty, students, research staff, and industry practitioners with a common interest in supporting and augmenting human engagement with information and technology. Open to broad participation, the iConferences have been successful in building a sense of community around the information field, bringing together people who otherwise might rarely interact with one another, and helping promote their interdisciplinary research. More information about the iConference may be found online at http://ischools.org/the-iconference/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2015 iConference Doctoral Colloquium will be a meeting of 27 selected Ph.D. candidates studying all aspects of information science, along with approximately 9 distinguished faculty mentors. Colloquium activities will be woven throughout the conference, starting with an orientation on March 25th and culminating in an all-day event on 27th. The core of the event will be mentor-led, peer-critique sessions of dissertation research projects held in small four-person teams. The primary objective of the Doctoral Colloquium is to help train the next generation of information science researchers. To this end, it will provide the student participants with an environment in which they can share and discuss their goals, methods and results at an early stage of their research. By participating in the doctoral colloquium, students will gain feedback on their work both from the mentors and from other students, which should allow them to enhance their research. Students will also develop a better understanding of the different research communities engaged in the study of information science, and learn how to position their work within the community. In addition, the colloquium will provide students with opportunities to make new professional connections beyond their own disciplines and institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The iConference doctoral colloquia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of researchers in information science, allowing them to develop a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Participation is encouraged from a broad range of relevant disciplines, thereby expanding attendees' perspectives on their topics of study and promoting advancement of the field. The organizers will proactively work to maximize diversity along such key dimensions as institution type, research topics, methodological approaches, disciplinary traditions, gender, ethnicity, and national or cultural backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>

From sixty-eight applicants, twenty-seven participants were selected by a team of senior faculty mentors. The students were evaluated based on career readiness, ability to contribute to the colloquium, and a host of diversity dimensions (e.g., gender, ethnicity, institution type, research topic, methods used, etc.) to ensure that we had a dynamic gathering. The colloquium itself involved three key events. Firstly, there was a kick-off meeting where junior scholars met a senior scholar mentor and three other peers. This cohort raised themes about their research that were then explored together throughout the week-long conference. &nbsp;Secondly, there were spotlight sessions where the cohort met for at least one hour per student to provide a detailed critique of their dissertation project. Lastly, there was a half-day workshop including two interactive panels (&ldquo;finishing well&rdquo; on completing their degrees, and &ldquo;starting out&rdquo; on launching their careers) and networking events. This award provided onsite logistical support for these events, but did not cover travel expenses. The intellectual merit focused on the discussion of a wide diversity of cutting-edge information and computing research. These deep discussions enabled a cross-fertilization of ideas that is rare in conference events where there is limited time to discuss research in progress. The broader impacts were engaging scholars across a range of diversity dimensions and helping to improve the pipeline of future information scientists.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/06/2016<br>      Modified by: Wayne&nbsp;G&nbsp;Lutters</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1519338/1519338_10345805_1454798605923_2015_Doctoral_Colloquium_Cover--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1519338/1519338_10345805_1454798605923_2015_Doctoral_Colloquium_Cover--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Doctoral Colloquium Cover"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1519338/1519338_10345805_1454798605923_2015_Doctoral_Colloquium_Cover--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Doctoral Colloquium Cover"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cover image from the doctoral colloquium proceedings distributed at the 2015 iConference.</div> <div class="imageCredit">UC-Irvine</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wayne&nbsp;G&nbsp;Lutters</div> <div class="imageTitle">Doctoral Colloquium Cover</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
