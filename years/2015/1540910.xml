<AbstractNarration>The proposed workshop will bring together researchers who have contributed both theoretically and empirically to the concept of innovation as a search of combinatorial possibilities.  From a variety of disciplines (biology, economics, engineering, management science, archaeology, anthropology, physics, mathematics) scholars have seriously engaged with the origins and dynamics of innovation in human societies and organizations, across time and across scale (from cities to firms to national economies) informed by complexity science The objective is to assess how useful the concept has been, and whether a general and formal framework of innovation as search can be built that would be useful to policy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The two workshops funded by this grant explored the possible links between theories of invention/innovation in a number of different disciplines. Its goals included a better mutual understanding of these perspectives and the development of common framework for understanding invention/innovation.     Historians of technology have traditionally made a distinction between invention and innovation, a distinction that has been adopted by some biologists and anthropologists. Invention, in this sense, is the creation of something new: a new object, product, process, or artifact that previously not known. (Many inventions are of course just slight variations of existing objects, rather than fundamentally new creations. Others are new combinations of pre-existing components, perhaps modified for a different purpose.) In contrast, innovations are successful inventions: successful in the sense that they are actually put into production, become widely used or become economically profitable.  Human invention, and specifically technological change, are processes which are combinatorial, recursive and cumulative in nature. While "discontinuities" do occur, gradual modification and recombination are the norm. Human invention and specifically technological change, are evolutionary processes which is not to say that human invention is simply biological evolution but in a different setting. (Much like cultural evolution is importantly similar and importantly different from biological evolution.)  The widely used analytical metaphor of "innovation as a search process" is not that useful as the process of search in a combinatorial space fails to identify how novelty (for example, new dimensions in the space) arises.      Understanding of biological evolution and of socioeconomic-cultural-technological evolution confronts a similar challenge:  selection (a fundamental ingredient of any evolutionary process) can preserve inventions and turn them into innovations but it cannot generate them. Thus, the common question across domains: what types of systems, what sorts of environments, what kinds of regulatory mechanisms facilitate the generation of novelty? The bulk of the discussions during the workshop touched on how to advance towards constructing an answer to this question.     The discussions also centered around a specific instance of novelty generation, namely technological change.  The group?s deliberations were greatly informed by the work and perspectives of Brian Arthur and Rob Boyd, and several common characteristics of technological change in the modern and pre-modern eras were identified (recursiveness, combinatorics, gradual, cumulative, modular). A major difference in the process generating technological novelty in the modern (17th century onwards) and pre-modern eras was the role of science in guiding experiments and trials generating new or improved technologies. A significant challenge was identified: how to integrate insights gained from a variety of methodological, empirical and conceptual approaches (historical case studies, archaeological investigations, patent data, experience curves, technology landscapes) into a historically rich and general explanatory framework.     Whether a general framework covering invention (generation of novelty) spanning both the biological and socioeconomic-cultural realms can be built presupposes that there is a robust framework for explaining invention in biology which does not seem to be the case.  As a result discussions about similarities between how invention occurs in the two domains remains suggestive but lacking in formality.     Based on these insights two standing working groups were established within the ASU-SFI Center for Biosocial Complex Systems to further pursue these questions. In addition, a number of new collaborations were established that are already yielding results.          Last Modified: 02/11/2018       Submitted by: Manfred Laubichler]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
