<AbstractNarration>Fossils provide our only direct evidence of past biodiversity and how individual organisms to ecosystems have responded to past and long-term environmental change. This project fills a major gap in the documentation of past environmental change, making available digitized data from the especially rich fossil record of the eastern Pacific marine invertebrate communities of the Cenozoic, the 66 million years that have passed since the extinction of the dinosaurs. Digitization and integration of these data will foster increased accessibility, efficient analysis to understand past change, the identification of factors involved in that change, and enable predictions for how current biodiversity may be impacted by future change. Development of virtual fieldwork experiences will assist stakeholders and educators in understanding how field data and fossil collections are used to infer past ecosystem and environmental conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data currently exist as a vast collection of fossil specimens and printed materials distributed among multiple natural history collections: this project involves 7 primary institutions, one small collection and one federal institution and will integrate this digitized specimen data with the other two ongoing fossil networks through the web portal iDigPaleo, expanding the resource for fossil invertebrate information by spanning over 500 million years. This wealth of data will provide resources not only to researchers, but will be made available to K-16 educators, government, industry, and the general public. Through the national resource (iDigBio) these data will be integrated with information on modern organisms providing the means to understand important questions on niches, environmental change, transitions in sea levels, etc. Additionally, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in the modern uses of natural history collections. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overarching goal of this Thematic Collections Network project is to make information (specimens, data) available, in a digital format, about fossil invertebrate specimens from the Eastern Pacific over the last 66 million years (Cenozoic). These specimens are held in major US museum collections, including the University of Alaska Museum in Fairbanks, where this part of the project is based. Our contribution to this project is to provide specimen data on fossils primarly from the northern East Pacific, along the margin of what is today Alaska. While our holdings are not as extensive as those in our partner institutions, they are important in adding critical geographic coverage not available in other collections. During the project we digitized nearly 4,000 specimen records (each record may include 1 to dozens of actual specimens) from nearly 900 different localities. In total, this project helped us recognize that our original estimate of holdings was not 6,500 specimens, rather, it is almost 11,000 specimens. Our work allowed us to physically rehouse the specimens in archival  quality trays and to barcode specimens for better object tracking. Part of our digitization process was also to photograph these specimens - approximately 10,000 photos were taken - and then make these images available, along with geographic data and identifications, on our publically accesible database, Arctos. Thus, this work is freely available to citizens and researchers alike. Information derived from this project contributes to our broader goals of sharing information on fossils of Alaska with the public at our museum, through exhibits, lectures, public programs and online.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/31/2019<br>      Modified by: Patrick&nbsp;S&nbsp;Druckenmiller</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503613/1503613_10377490_1572548327772_IMG_2419--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503613/1503613_10377490_1572548327772_IMG_2419--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Specimen drawer."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503613/1503613_10377490_1572548327772_IMG_2419--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Specimen drawer."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Newly digitized, barcoded, relabeled and rehoused fossil invertebrate specimens in the UA Museum Earth Sciences Collection.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Patrick Druckenmiller</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Patrick&nbsp;S&nbsp;Druckenmiller</div> <div class="imageTitle">Specimen drawer.</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
