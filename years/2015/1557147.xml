<AbstractNarration>Ancient lakes are biodiversity hotspots, home to thousands of unique species with an extraordinary diversity of body forms and functions. With more than 1,500 species found nowhere else on the planet, Lake Baikal is an ideal environment to study the processes that resulted in creation of new species. The Baikal biodiversity hotspot is also a geographical anomaly, because global species diversity normally declines near polar regions. Despite Baikal's renown as the world's oldest, deepest, and largest lake, the evolutionary history of its unique species diversity remains poorly understood. This project examines the evolutionary history of sculpins, a group of primarily bottom-dwelling cold water fishes that colonized Baikal within a relatively short period of the lake's history. Baikal sculpins are uniquely adapted to life in an ancient lake, having evolved multiple open-water and deep-water forms. This project is focused on identifying the molecular basis for such variation, including gene sequences that evolve through generations and gene-expression changes that occur during development. New information gained from this study can be compared to ongoing research on fishes from other ancient lakes, in order to identify unifying processes that explain adaptation in these unique ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baikal sculpins represent the world's northernmost vertebrate radiation within an ancient lake ecosystem, with at least 33 species estimated to have evolved within the past two million years. Rapid diversification of skeletal morphology and body composition suggests that this clade has undergone ecological release from a stream-living ancestor, but phylogenetic analysis has thus far been limited to a single genetic locus. A genomic inventory of Baikal sculpins will be generated through systematic surveys of all lake habitats and the surrounding watershed. Tributaries to Baikal will also be sampled in the search for a putative ancestral sculpin population. A time-calibrated species tree will be generated from sequence variants at presumed neutral (RADseq) and functional (RNAseq) loci. Gene expression phenotypes will be mapped on the phylogeny to infer relative rates of phenotypic and ecological change. If a putative ancestral population is discovered in the tributaries to Lake Baikal, this system will offer an unprecedented opportunity to understand the genetic factors that predispose certain groups to adaptive radiation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award funded an investigation of the evolutionary relationships of an adaptive radiation of sculpins endemic to Lake Baikal; the oldest, deepest, and largest (by volume) lake in the world. Our project team included faculty, students, and collaborators from four American academic institutions (UWA, CSULA, Harvard, Oregon State), the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute, and the Limnological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. During expeditions in the summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018, the project team logged approximately 100 person-days aboard large scientific research vessels used for trawling the bottom of Lake Baikal. Appended with traditional sampling of streams and rivers, this effort produced over 1,000 fish specimens preserved for scientific study, accompanied by tissues preserved for whole genomic DNA analysis. All specimens and tissues are either cataloged in natural history collections or accessible from the principal investigators. Over 800 specimens were imported the United States, which represents the largest accession of Baikal sculpins in history. Our team successfully extracted DNA and barcoded more than 700 tissue samples. We also generated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 400 specimens. This dataset includes over 100,000 genomic variants sampled from nearly random sites across the genome. This data was used to infer the first well-supported phylogeny of interspecific relationships of the Baikal Sculpin Radiation. In order to better understand the functional components of this genomic variation, we also generated full exome sequence data that contains every gene known to occur in fish genomes. We used a new target-capture approach customized to work on sculpins and closely related species, and this method produced high coverage data for 98% of the (ca. 300,000) targets, on average. This information is being used for ongoing investigations that help us understand the rate and degree of change for every gene in the sculpin genome, so we can identify the genes that are most important for generating the extensive phenotypic diversity exhibited by Baikal Sculpins. In addition to understanding evolution of each gene, we are investigating changes in the structure of sculpin chromosomes, including gene rearrangements and chromosome fusions. We have completed full genome sequencing and assembly for two Baikal sculpins (<em>Comephorus baicalensis</em> and <em>C. dybowskii</em>), and are currently working on two additional genomes for comparison. This ultimately will contribute to improved understanding of the diversity of vertebrates at large. Toward this end, our project team collaborated with researchers at Oregon State University and Friday Harbor Laboratories to scan the skeleton of each species in three dimensions using x-ray microtomography. The scans produced through this collaboration are hosted on public servers and are free for use by researchers worldwide, including our collaborators in Russia. The scans are also able to be printed using 3-D printers, and we are using the plastic models in elementary school outreach, to demonstrate the reduction in bone density and eye size observed among the deepwater sculpin lineages. We have communicated our research findings through three published manuscripts and we have prepared three additional manuscripts for submission in 2020. We expect that this initial round of papers will inspire additional collaborators to take advantage of the morphological and molecular resources made available by this award, and to add to the growing community of scientists investigating the mysteries of Lake Baikal.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/27/2020<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;W&nbsp;Sandel</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1557147/1557147_10462467_1581358271227_IMG_3181--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1557147/1557147_10462467_1581358271227_IMG_3181--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fat Sculpin"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1557147/1557147_10462467_1581358271227_IMG_3181--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fat Sculpin"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A recently collected Fat Sculpin (Batrachocottus nikolskii) from the depths of Lake Baikal.
