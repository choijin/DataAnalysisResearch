<AbstractNarration>Researchers at Tennessee State University will study the role of professional, social, and cultural identities on career choice and commitment among underrepresented minorities. They will expand the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) by examining factors such as problem solving, decision making, goal setting, and managing goal pursuit that are not articulated in the current model. As critical as self-efficacy is in the process of developing one?s interests, making career choices, and preparing for career entry, it is not clear how lower levels of these skills may limit one?s commitment to, ability to enact, and  self-efficacy about engaging in  the chosen career.  The research will provide valuable insights for students and career development practitioners on tactical measures for successful careers in STEM fields. The knowledge gained by understanding the interplay of the sophistication of career skill level and career development could alter the design of interventions to recruit and retain underrepresented persons throughout the STEM pipeline. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will use a mixed methods longitudinal design to investigate three questions: (1) What is the relationship among STEM career development measures, basic career skills, and social class and developmental complexity? (2) How do these variables change over time in both STEM persisters and non-persisters? and (3) How do these variables explain persistence among African American and women STEM majors? The sample will include a stratified, proportionally representative sample of 400 STEM majors. In addition to the primary variables of interest (career-related problem solving, decision-making, goal setting, and managing goal pursuit), STEM career development, professional identity, social class, and developmental complexity will be studied. Collecting data on grade-point average, changes in majors, internships, employment/graduate student interviewing, and progress toward career goals will provide the opportunity for examining the link between the previous variables and more traditional measures of success and persistence. They will use structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear modeling to analyze the relationship between and among the variables and growth curve modeling and profile analysis to provide additional data regarding the longitudinal change in the variables of interest. The research will result in a clearer understanding of the role of problem-solving, goal- setting, and planning skills in the development of a STEM vocational identity and persistence in STEM careers; the role of professional, racial/ethnic, and social class identities on commitment and retention in STEM majors; and the role of cognitive complexity in facilitating STEM career development, commitment, and retention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in three thematic areas: STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation, and STEM workforce development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report for:  Broadening Participation in STEM:  Career Commitment and Retention in STEM:  Building the next generation STEM Workforce (Award #1623145)   The goal of this 3-year longitudinal, mixed methods project was to revise and examine the impact of an abbreviated version of the culturally-appropriate STEM career management intervention (NSF Award #1238778). The revised career management intervention for African American STEM students is grounded in recent meta-analytic research documenting the most effective, evidence-based career intervention components to enhance career development (Brown &amp; Krane, 2000; Brown &amp; Rector, 2008), in culturally-appropriate career development models (Bingham &amp; Fouad, 1995), social cognitive career theory (Brown &amp; Lent, 1996), change processes (Barclay, Stoltz, &amp; Chung, 2011; Hammond, 2014), growth mindset (Dweck, 2012), and productive persistence (Yeager &amp; Walton, 2011). This project is unique in attempting to examine the overlapping effects of these different variables on the outcomes of interventions with African American STEM students.  Data was gathered from over 600 STEM students across the grant period, including students from agricultural sciences, biology, chemistry, computer sciences, engineering, mathematics, and psychology.  Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the intervention had an immediate impact on students perceptions of their career path through their degree.  In contrast, participants in the control group members did not change in career management skills, knowledge, or actions across the intervention period.  Furthermore, the largest impact of the intervention was assisting STEM students in recognizing the available supports, becoming familiar with some of the barriers to persistence in STEM, and recognizing how to use the former to cope with the latter in order to persist in reaching their STEM goals.  In a comparison of Agricultural Science and Biological Science students, the results suggest that, while the focus of study may be similar, students in these two majors differ significantly in goals, self-efficacy, interest in technology, and coping skills.  These differences may arise due to differences in career trajectory and access to careers post- bachelor's degree completion versus after completion of a doctoral degree.  Also, this project addressed a lacuna in the methodological literature by analyzing the procedures used for data linking in longitudinal research and identified best practices to increase the accuracy and completeness of data linking between complex datasets.   The broader impacts of this project have manifested in a number of ways.  As TSU faculty members and student services personnel have become aware of the work that we are doing, there has been an increase in programmatic activity focused on supporting TSU's STEM students.  This includes both funded and non-funded efforts to provide scholarships, mentoring, research experience, and improve advising efforts.  Second, one department is already working to incorporate the modules into their curriculum. Third, our efforts to use evidence-based methods to improve data management for this study has resulted in the publication of a "best practices" guide for research in education, psychology, and other fields that conduct longitudinal studies with humans, as the literature had preiviously provided little guidance in this area.
