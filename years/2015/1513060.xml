<AbstractNarration>This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging in hands-on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and mentorship experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twin Cities Public Television project on Gender Equitable Teaching Practices in Career and Technical Education Pathways for High School Girls is designed to help career and technical education educators and guidance counselors recruit and retain more high school girls from diverse backgrounds in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) pathways, specifically in technology and engineering. The project's goals are: 1) To increase the number of high school girls, including ethnic minorities, recruited and retained in traditionally male -STEM pathways; 2) To enhance the teaching and coaching practices of Career and Technical Education  educators, counselors and role models with gender equitable and culturally responsive strategies; 3) To research the impacts of strategies and role model experiences on girls' interest in STEM careers; 4) To evaluate the effectiveness of training in these strategies for educators, counselors and role models; and 5) To develop training that can easily be scaled up to reach a much larger audience. The research hypothesis is that girls will develop more positive STEM identities and interests when their educators employ research-based, gender-equitable and culturally responsive teaching practices enhanced with female STEM role models. Instructional modules and media-based online resources for Minnesota high school Career and Technical Education programs will be developed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul and piloted in districts with strong community college and industry partnerships. Twin Cities Public Television will partner with STEM and gender equity researchers from St. Catherine University in St. Paul, the National Girls Collaborative, the University of Colorado-Boulder (CU-Boulder), the Minnesota Department of Education and the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will examine girls' personal experiences with equitable strategies embedded into classroom STEM content and complementary mentoring experiences, both live and video-based. It will explore how these experiences contribute to girls' STEM-related identity construction against gender-based stereotypes. It will also determine the extent girls' exposure to female STEM role models impact their Career and Technical Education studies and STEM career aspirations. The study will employ and examine short-form autobiographical videos created and shared by participating girls to gain insight into their STEM classroom and role model experiences. Empowering girls to respond to the ways their Career and Technical Education educators and guidance counselors guide them toward technology and engineering careers will provide a valuable perspective on educational practice and advance the STEM education field.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><em>SciGirls Strategies</em></strong> was led by Twin Cities PBS with St. Catherine University, The University of Minnesota, CU-Boulder and the National Girls Collaborative. Project staff developed and taught an accredited course in research-based gender equitable teaching strategies (GETS) for 49 CTE and STEM teachers and counselors from 2016-2018. The project was successful in changing teachers mindsets and their pedagogical practices. Teachers were proactive in providing STEM experiences that engaged girls through the use of the <em>SciGirls Strategies</em>:</p> <p>Connect STEM experience to girls lives.</p> <p>Support girls as they investigate questions and solve problems using STEM practices.</p> <p>Empower girls to embrace struggle, overcome challenges, and increase self-confidence in STEM.</p> <p>Encourage girls to identify and challenge STEM stereotypes.</p> <p>Emphasize that STEM is collaborative, social, and community oriented.</p> <p>Provide opportunities for girls to interact with and learn from diverse role models.</p> <p><strong><em>External Evaluation. </em></strong>Teachers reported feeling more confident in using the strategies. They reported their mental models of how to teach girls had shifted to being more focused, supportive and explicit. In observations, all teachers were using at least one method for each of the strategies. Counselors were more actively and explicitly talking with girls about STEM/CTE classes and careers. Teachers and counselors used role model videos and in-person role models. The course contributed to teachers growth mindset for gender equitable teaching with a framework, tools, resources and network to continue to evolve their practice.<strong><em> </em></strong>All teachers reported that the changes they made as a result of training affected the girls in their classes. They were committed to increasing female enrollment in STEM/CTE classes and helping girls to see themselves as capable in those fields. They observed very clear results from their efforts. They saw more confidence and interest in girls. Girls were more communicative and engaged.</p> <p>The project recruited 52 industry role models who hosted field trips and visited classrooms. Role models were trained in best practices as outlined in the&nbsp;guide<em> Role Model Strategies: Encouraging Girls to Consider STEM Careers</em>. The project created 12 role model videos of women in non-traditional STEM and technical careers. These featured diverse women at work and at home, describing challenges and successes. They were compiled into a special that won a Regional Emmy Award in 2016 for Best Teen Show. In 2019, the special was disseminated to all PBS stations.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>Research Findings. </em></strong>Quantitative findings<strong> </strong>showed a significant impact within seven components of STEM identity: personal relevance, agency, emotional connection, content confidence, enjoyment of science, and science and math career interest. This indicated a multi-dimensional growth of girls STEM identity after exposure to gender equitable teaching strategies introduced by their teachers, a definitive success of the program. Especially compelling is the significant growth found in science concepts over comparison groups.</p> <p>Qualitative findings with six case study girls depended upon<strong> </strong>the validation they received for being capable of doing STEM, including a sense-of agency, teacher support, scores and grades; social ties to close friends within STEM contexts; and the risk involved in taking a CTE/STEM class, a function of low agency and the resulting anxiety upon deciding to try anyway.</p> <p>Through videos, interviews and journals, the researcher gained insight into STEM identity development. For these girls positive STEM identity was a fragile thing. Forging a positive STEM identity is to <em>swim against the stream</em>&nbsp;especially for girls in fields where they are going against traditional gender norms. These findings were supported by the results of the quantitative study which revealed personal relevancy, agency and emotional connection as significant components to the development of a positive STEM identity.</p> <p><strong><em>Evaluation of the Train the Trainer.</em></strong>&nbsp;Ten trainers were prepared to teach the GETS&nbsp;course in their school/district through a 2019 supplement.&nbsp;Teachers (n=41) in these courses reported that they benefitted from their locally delivered course. They reported changes in their practice and mindsets and positive effects on their students. Most teachers (91% in 2020; 100% in 2021) felt they had adequate support for their individual growth. Participation affected teachers personal practice by increasing their awareness, helping them elevate female voices, being intentional in their efforts, selecting resources more carefully, connecting material to girls lives, connecting concepts to careers, having books in the classroom to showcase women and people of color, emphasizing learning over grades and that it is okay to make mistakes.</p> <p>Teachers (100%) reported statistically significant (p&lt;0.01) changes in how they used the <em>SciGirls Strategies</em> in their classroom, including empowering girls, encouraging them in class and emphasizing that STEM is collaborative, social, and community oriented. Teachers also reported statistically significant changes in their confidence (p&lt;0.01) from before to after the course in the <em>SciGirls Strategies</em>. Most teachers (95%) would recommend the course to another teacher. Trainers were, and are, all committed to the <em>SciGirls Strategies</em> for their own use and plan to bring it to other teachers in the future.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/25/2021<br>
