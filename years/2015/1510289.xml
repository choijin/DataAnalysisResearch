<AbstractNarration>Advanced manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printing, are transforming design and several fields of engineering. This innovative project will use 3D technology to help students learn about science and engineering through the history of inventions in the United States. As part of science and engineering classes, middle and high-school students will use 3D printing technology to recreate historically significant inventions, using digitized versions from the Smithsonian Institution (e.g., the Wright brothers' airplane - http://3d.si.edu). The project will create modules that will connect these significant inventions from the past with contemporary technologies, science, and engineering.  Student teamwork will help participants understand the collaborative process of invention. The project will develop supporting materials for middle school science and engineering teachers. This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The module development will address calls in recent national reports and standards for the integration of engineering in science teaching and learning. The research questions and data collection/analysis will examine how the modules impact student knowledge of the concepts and if teachers can successfully implement them in classrooms. Data to be collected include students' work on the modules, interviews and focus groups with students, interviews with teachers, and classroom observation. Using comparison classrooms, the study will also use pre-tests and post-tests of students' content knowledge to understand the impact of the modules in the treatment classrooms on students' knowledge of science and engineering. The goal will be to document the impact of the modules on students' learning in science and engineering courses and to understand how historical inventions can be used to engage students in how scientific and engineering innovation happen. The implementation will include school districts with diverse populations of students in two states, providing a range of test sites for the materials.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><div class="WordSection1"> <p>The University of Virginia, the University of North Texas, James Madison University, and the Smithsonian partnered in a large collaborative grant entitled, "Collaborative Research - American Innovations in an Age of Discovery: Teaching Science and Engineering through 3D- printed Historical Reconstructions<strong>."&nbsp;</strong>For their role in the partnership, the University of North Texas (UNT) examined the impact of implementing a newly developed solenoid curriculum unit that emphasized engineering at the 7th grade level in a rural school district in Texas. A solenoid is a coil of wire usually in cylindrical form that when carrying a current, acts like a magnet. A solenoid can be used as a switch or control for a mechanical device such as a valve.</p> <p>The Solenoid Invention Kit curriculum (<a href="http://www.maketolearn.org/)">http://www.maketolearn.org/)</a> contains five lab activities, two "make" activities, and one "invent" activity. These lessons are scaffolded to lead the learners from a baseline toward full mastery of the content and the processes involved (intellectual merit). Each lab activity is guided by essential questions and teaches key concepts and skills that are utilized in the ?make? activities. The culmination of the unit is the "invent" activity, where students reconstruct a replica of a historical invention (solenoid) with pedagogical support involving four phases to promote student learning:</p> <ol> <li><em>Eliciting </em>students' knowledge of phenomena related to classic inventions and their ideas about related science and engineering concepts underlying the inventions;</li> <li><em>Introduction of new knowledge </em>that may support, expand, or even conflict with students' ideas through the use of pivotal cases grounded in historic inventions;</li> <li><em>Comparison of students' science and engineering concepts </em>with observed phenomena, to determine how students' existing ideas may conflict with, or extend the new ideas related to newly introduced phenomena; and</li> <li><em>Reflecting and refining </em>students' science and engineering knowledge to address gaps and discrepancies between anticipated results and actual outcomes, thus, allowing students to successfully reconstruct and potentially modify the historical invention.</li> </ol> <p>Using quantitative and qualitative data collected prior to and after teaching the solenoid instructional unit, the UNT partners sought to determine if the solenoid curriculum was an effective means of increasing knowledge for rural 7th graders as well as determining if the curriculum was effective across various subgroups of diverse students typically encountered in a 7th grade classroom. Subgroups examined included males, females, high-performing students (gifted) and low-performing students (special education placement or 504 plan). Data examined included not only an assessment of knowledge of the solenoid but also visual perceptual ability and affinity towards a STEM career. To provide a comparison group, another rural school district served as a contrast group. The two districts were matched on variables such as free and reduced lunch status, rurality, school size and ethnic composition. For the solenoid group, 180 students completed the pre- and post-intervention instruments and surveys. Data collected included: Trends in Mathematics and Science Survey (Limited), the Student Attitudes toward STEM Survey, Assessment of Solenoid Knowledge, the Shapes Test, and student responses to demographic and unit effectiveness. For the contrast group, 240 students completed the pre- and post-intervention instruments and surveys.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Research Questions:</p> <p>Do the achievement scores differ among 7th grade students who are high-performing, students who are low-performing, and students who are served in a general classroom environment only?</p> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Do the achievement scores differ among 7th grade male and female students participating in the solenoid unit of instruction?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Do the affinity towards STEM scores differ among 7th grade male and female students participating in the solenoid unit of instruction?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Overall, the analysis of achievement data obtained from solenoid unit participants compared to the contrast group indicates that achievement scores increased for solenoid unit participants. No significant differences between the pre-test scores and post-test scores of low-performing students in the solenoid group were noted. In addition, no differences in pre-test and post-test scores were noted in achievement for high-performing students. In other words, the data indicates that although the general population showed an increase in knowledge of the solenoid, subgroups of low- performing and high-performing students demonstrated no gains.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The achievement and affinity towards STEM scores were compared between male and female students participating in the solenoid unit of instruction. When achievement scores were compared, both males and females obtained similar scores to the general classroom participants.</p> <p>The analysis of affinity towards STEM data obtained from solenoid unit participants indicates a significant difference in affinity towards math with male students demonstrating greater affinity towards math when compared to female students. On additional subtests measuring affinity towards STEM, no difference in science technology, engineering, and career interest scores were noted.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Clearly, the data collected in this study indicates that it is important to note the impact of instruction on not just the general classroom participants but also to note the impact of instruction on various subgroups participating in a new intervention (Broader Impacts).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/15/2019<br>      Modified by: Tandra&nbsp;L&nbsp;Tyler-Wood</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div

Subgroups examined included males, females, high-performing students (gifted) and low-performing students (special education placement or 504 plan). Data examined included not only an assessment of knowledge of the solenoid but also visual perceptual ability and affinity towards a STEM career. To provide a comparison group, another rural school district served as a contrast group. The two districts were matched on variables such as free and reduced lunch status, rurality, school size and ethnic composition. For the solenoid group, 180 students completed the pre- and post-intervention instruments and surveys. Data collected included: Trends in Mathematics and Science Survey (Limited), the Student Attitudes toward STEM Survey, Assessment of Solenoid Knowledge, the Shapes Test, and student responses to demographic and unit effectiveness. For the contrast group, 240 students completed the pre- and post-intervention instruments and surveys.     Research Questions:  Do the achievement scores differ among 7th grade students who are high-performing, students who are low-performing, and students who are served in a general classroom environment only?      Do the achievement scores differ among 7th grade male and female students participating in the solenoid unit of instruction?     Do the affinity towards STEM scores differ among 7th grade male and female students participating in the solenoid unit of instruction?     Overall, the analysis of achievement data obtained from solenoid unit participants compared to the contrast group indicates that achievement scores increased for solenoid unit participants. No significant differences between the pre-test scores and post-test scores of low-performing students in the solenoid group were noted. In addition, no differences in pre-test and post-test scores were noted in achievement for high-performing students. In other words, the data indicates that although the general population showed an increase in knowledge of the solenoid, subgroups of low- performing and high-performing students demonstrated no gains.     The achievement and affinity towards STEM scores were compared between male and female students participating in the solenoid unit of instruction. When achievement scores were compared, both males and females obtained similar scores to the general classroom participants.  The analysis of affinity towards STEM data obtained from solenoid unit participants indicates a significant difference in affinity towards math with male students demonstrating greater affinity towards math when compared to female students. On additional subtests measuring affinity towards STEM, no difference in science technology, engineering, and career interest scores were noted.     Clearly, the data collected in this study indicates that it is important to note the impact of instruction on not just the general classroom participants but also to note the impact of instruction on various subgroups participating in a new intervention (Broader Impacts).
