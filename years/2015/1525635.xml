<AbstractNarration>Improving Interdisciplinary Data Access and Communication: Through professional development and the creation of data tools, the PIs will reduce the logistical costs of bringing polar science to students and educators. The PIs propose to provide opportunities to build the capacity of polar scientists for communicating and engaging with diverse audiences. They will also create scalable, in-person and virtual opportunities for educators and students to engage with polar scientists and their research through data visualizations, data activities, educator workshops, webinars, and student research symposia. The desired product is a set of data rich instructional materials and customized professional development trainings that virtually expand access and opportunity to engage more educators and their classrooms in polar science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over three years, the PIs will: 1) Conduct three communication and diversity workshops for a total of 60 polar scientists and provide opportunities for scientists to practice and apply the information presented; 2) Develop a social media/web program dedicated to promoting polar research and education and outreach programs; 3) Develop activities that engage students with real polar data and a set of adaptable data visualization tools that allow students to interact with these data; 5) Develop and implement 10 online educational webinars and 3 in-person half-day educator workshops; 6) Conduct 4 weeklong educator professional development workshops; 7) Run 4 symposia nationally for approximately 1200 students to present their polar research investigations to polar scientists; 8) Foster the use of real polar data in undergraduate teaching through the Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative (CCURI) to increase students' data skills and knowledge of polar science; and 9) Create an asynchronous e-course that highlights polar science research and uses data in teaching for science educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will improve the communication capacity of the polar science community. It will help bring real-world datasets, models, and simulations into the classroom and make scientific data from the poles and information about polar research widely available and useful to various audiences. The project will engage under-represented and underserved students in polar scientific research and many of the materials created and connections between scientists and educators are likely to be sustainable. This effort supports NSF/PLR goals to diversify the research community and improve access to information on polar research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For most people, the Polar Regions are distant locations seemingly unconnected to everyday life. However these important biomes are very much connected to people all over the planet as they serve a major role in regulating the Earth’s climate.  As the Polar Regions continue to warm (air, land, and ocean), the Earth’s climate, and people all over the planet are feeling the impact. It is vital that every person on the planet becomes aware of this connection and the increasing fragility of the Earth system.     The Polar Interdisciplinary Coordinated Education (Polar-ICE) program (https://polar-ice.org), which was funded by the National Science Foundation (PLR #1525635), was designed to engage students in understanding how Polar Regions influence our lives through the research experiences, data, and stories of polar scientists. Our partners included Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), Rutgers University, California State University Monterey Bay, Eidos Education, and Indiana University. Our goal was to serve as a connection to students and educators to help understand these critical polar environments and the global climate system.     Over the course of the project the need emerged for a unified set of messages that identify the "big ideas" all people should know about the Polar Regions. Inspired by the Ocean Literacy initiative, we created a consensus document we call the Polar Literacy Key Concepts and Principles. The polar science research and education community is using these principles to construct effective NSF Broader Impacts projects and improve polar science communication, education, and outreach.       Polar ICE developed an effective science storytelling model for polar researchers resulting in increased confidence in communicating  their research to a wider audience.  These workshops focused on how to tell compelling science stories, and to bring data driven, critical analysis to undergraduate classrooms. This model is being successfully replicated in other NSF funded work, including the NSF funded Center - Advancing Research Impacts in Society (ARIS).       We were able to develop several data stories with polar researchers that are broadly and very actively being utilized by educators and students during this difficult switch to online learning during the 2020 pandemic.     Finally, we developed a viable model for student investigation of large polar data sets through the Sci-I program.  Forty-one educators participated in a Sci-I workshop with representation from different states including California, New Jersey, Ohio, Missouri, Utah, and Colorado. Of the middle and high schools that participated 73% were Title 1, meaning that at least forty percent of their student enrollment is considered low-income.  Thirty-seven percent of students who were enrolled in participating schools (n=841) were classified as "non-white minority."       Teachers participating in this program are incorporating data into classroom activities with more frequency (consistent with the teachers’ reports) and students are being exposed to data activities with more frequency.  Students participating in Polar ICE increased their confidence in data usage as well as their ability to identify themselves as "scientists." Overall evaluation results indicate educators increased their use of authentic polar data in the classroom; students increased in positive attitudes toward scientific inquiry; and most importantly, students increased in self-efficacy around authentic data usage and STEM in general.     The growing realization that our planet is warming has profound implications for future generations, as they will be forced to adapt and respond to the changes. Polar ICE was focused on entraining, educating, and enabling students to become science literate and active in public policy and decision making about these serious environmental concerns around climate change          Last Modified: 10/23/2020       Submitted by: Janice Mcdonnell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
