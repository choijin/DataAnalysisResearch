<AbstractNarration>The greatest challenges humans currently face - climate change, poverty, epidemics, financial meltdowns - are the result of humans acting within enormously complex systems without the  ability to fully understanding how these systems work. Many have argued that people will make better decisions under these circumstances if they can engage in systems thinking. Systems thinking is a way of conceptualizing reality and making decisions that emphasizes enhanced understanding of relationships and interdependencies. This research identifies simple and scalable methods of increasing systems thinking and enhancing everyday decision making that do not require extensive training or cognitive resources. In particular, this research examines whether metaphors and conceptual models that encourage people to think about the broader system can shift the way people think about a problem, and improve their ability to identify effective solutions. For example, do diagrams and maps that help people to situate themselves and visualize their relationships to ecological, social or economic systems help them make choices that benefit the community around them? Do some metaphors (describing a national park as the "backbone" of the park system, as opposed to a "pearl") help people see the relationships between that park and the larger ecological system? The most important facet of this research from a practical point of view is the possibility that relatively simple metaphors and conceptual models have the potential to improve decision making among large groups of people every day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In eight studies, this research project identifies metaphors and conceptual models that promote systems thinking, and test the contention that systems thinking improves decision making. Two experiments identify systemic metaphors and test their psychological effects, as well as their effects on risk assessment and decision making. Two experiments test whether valuing the system in question is a prerequisite for systems thinking to result in better decision making. Four field studies will test the impact of systemic metaphors on conservation behavior (electricity use) and political action (involvement in social media-based campaigns orchestrated by the non-profit communications firm Resource Media). These studies are important because none of the existing work on systems thinking is grounded in psychological processes, nor has it fully evaluated the effects of systems thinking on decision making and behavior. The research program proposed here will use psychological theory, empirical measurement, and experimental techniques to address these large gaps in knowledge.</AbstractNarration>

Many have argued that people will make better decisions under these circumstances if they can engage in systems thinking. Systems thinking is a way of conceptualizing reality and making decisions that emphasizes enhanced understanding of relationships and interdependencies. This research sought to identify simple and scalable methods of increasing systems thinking and enhancing everyday decision making that do not require extensive training or cognitive resources. It also sought to provide causal evidence that systems thinking does in fact improve decision making. In particular, this research examined whether metaphors and conceptual models that encourage people to think about the broader system can shift the way people think about the problem of climate change.    We tested the effects of 17 different metaphors for describing humans’ relationship to the earth, and identified the earth as "home" to be the most effective, with both a lay sample as well as climate experts (Thibodeau et al. 2016).  The metaphor "common home" shifted policy preferences in favor of taking action on climate change, and did so more effectively than other frames commonly in use in the mainstream media. It also seemed to work particularly well with climate skeptics (Thibodeau et al. 2017).  In one study, the metaphor "common home" seemed to improve performance in a public goods game, particularly among climate skeptics. However we were unable to replicate this effect.  We also examined the metaphor "common home" embedded in facebook ads encouraging public action on environmental issues.  One study suggested that the metaphor "common home" outperformed a comparable facebook ad (Frantz et al., 2017), but two follow up studies failed to find this effect.  None of these studies confirmed directly whether the metaphor’s positive impacts were due to increasing systems thinking.  Further experiments tested other ways of increasing systems thinking and shifting decision making, including brief videos showing a zoom in from outer space to a particular community; an animated graphic of water and electricity systems in a small town (Petersen et al, 2018); a video describing a system in ways that emphasizes interconnections between its elements; and common signs such as "these come from trees" on a paper towel dispenser.  Results were once again mixed.   We also worked with public school teachers to develop lesson plans using real time displays of resource use in school buildings.  These lesson plans had a demonstrable effect on systems thinking among 4th and 5th graders (Clark et al., 2017); the lesson plans are available for public use.  We draw several conclusions from this research:  Metaphors have potential to shift how people think about climate change, but they are also highly context- and audience-dependent. Systems thinking may not be as easily influenced as we hypothesized. A compelling, causal test of the impact of systems thinking on decision making is still needed.
