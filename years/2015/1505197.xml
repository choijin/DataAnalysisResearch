<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM junior faculty at HBCUs who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who may have returned to the faculty ranks after holding an administrative post or who needs to redirect and rebuild a research program. Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Paine College will conduct research to develop bio-fouling resistant surfaces. The project will enhance the research capabilities of the PI as well as teaching and learning at Paine College. The project will provide undergraduate students with research opportunities and advance skills in chemistry. This experience will help to build the competency of the undergraduate students and support the nation's efforts in building a robust STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will investigate an approach that will allow thiol-terminated surfaces to be used and re-used by attaching molecules with antifouling functional groups via a disulfide bond. The specific objectives are to: 1) engineer silicon-based thin films for antifouling functionalization; and 2) confirm antifouling function of chemically modified substrates. Findings from this project will provide new knowledge on silicon surface modification. This approach may be used for the modification of surfaces of other materials, such as carbon-based materials. The development of techniques for surface modification also can be used for building protein arrays with nano-sized features on silicon or carbon surfaces. The results of this project may be transferable to the shipping and biomedical industries, and become a solution to reduce the costs associated with fouling. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Marshall University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the completion of this research project, we have had new knowledge in thiol-terminated silicon surface preparation. By employing a similar strategy, the modification of other materials, such as carbon-based materials, can be conducted. In addition, our method provides a rational design for generating antifouling coating that is able to be regenerated, once the coating becomes aged, without damaging the substrate.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our research work could be applied to the development of antifouling coatings to prevent biofouling on surfaces exposed to marine environments such as ship hulls and pipes. Antifouling surfaces have the potential to reduce energy consumption, as in the case of the ship industry, and to reduce biocidal use in aqueous environments. This project&rsquo;s results therefore could make positive contributions to energy saving and environmental protection.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The research activities of this project have been designed and committed to the purpose of increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Three minority undergraduate students have been involved in this research. Student participants present their work in different conferences such as National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR), Southeastern Regional Meeting of the American Chemical Society (SERMACS), Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS), Emerging Researchers National (ERN) <em>et al.</em>, in different states such as North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Florida, and Washington, D.C. <em>et al</em>. These activities offer the opportunities to practice student participants&rsquo; presentation skills, enrich their overall research profiles, and disseminate our work.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By participating in this research work, students have received award for participation and research effort in the Georgia-Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program, travel awards, such as ABRCMS Student Travel Award, ACS-SR Travel Grant, and other award such as ACS Scholar. Some of student awards had been reported by social media.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through this research project, the PI and the student participants had taken advantages of the research capacity and facilities at Marshall University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Kentucky, and Eastern Kentucky University, and established research and education collaborations between Paine College and above research-oriented universities. In 2016, two student participants and PI traveled to Marshall University, WV, for two weeks. Student participants received trainings of manipulating Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) which are not available at Paine College.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results of this project have been published on prestigious journals in this field. The published articles are open access online which means they are freely available online to anyone, anywhere. It is anticipated that one more paper regarding the antifouling properties of our prepared chemically modified substrate to be published. This project had significantly enhanced PI&rsquo;s research capabilities. With the support from the HBCU-UP RIA, PI receives one course release for each academic semester and summer support each year. &nbsp;Because of that, PI is able to perform more research duties and pursue new research fields at Paine College; several research papers regarding determination of organic compounds in water samples using various analytical methods and investigating interfacial properties of ionic liquid had been published thereafter.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, the grant also enables PI with time for community services. In addition to judge science fairs held by local schools (eg. Wheeless Road Elementary School, Spirit Creek Middle School), PI also serves as judge and reviewers for international and national meetings such as The 3<sup>rd</sup> Annual International Conference
