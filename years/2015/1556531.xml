<AbstractNarration>This award supports a 4-day workshop that will addresses the historical experiences of groups under-represented in U.S. scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical (or, STEM) disciplines in June 2016. During the workshop the invitees will reflect on the question of how enhanced historical coverage of biographies in STEM may or may not alter patterns of minority participation in those fields. This biography-focused workshop will support the emergence of new historical projects on persons of minority background among researchers. In addition the workshop activities will include an oral history project with high school students and undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will gather post-doctoral scholars, junior faculty and more senior scholars in the History of Science, Technology and Medicine (HSTM) to re-frame the historical study of people historically marginalized in STEM disciplines and in the historical records of those fields. The workshop will provide an opportunity to inquire into the nature of perceptions of individual capacity, epistemic commitment, and institutional aims historically circulating throughout both STEM and HSTM disciplines.  The goal of the workshop is to recast the possible function of biography as social critique by considering the perpetually low representation of persons of minority background in organizations such as the History of Science Society, the Society for the History of Technology, and the American Association for the History of Medicine.  By probing the relational character of history/history-writing the workshop will identify exclusionary patterns, the routine marginalization of STEM aspirants, historical subjects and HSTM scholars of minority identity in order to increase participation and awareness of under-represented groups in the production of histories of science, technology and medicine. The results will contribute to an enhanced critical pedagogy and the testing of the critical potential of biography in confronting inequitable social relations that will be disseminated at professional societies serving the STS community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Workshop: Biography in Science, Technology, and Medicine brought together 27 scholars in the fields of the history of science, history of technology, history of medicine, biology, US history, science studies, economics, women?s studies, and journalism for a two and &frac12; day meeting at Harvard University.  The workshop focused on the role and status of historical research on the experience of groups under-represented in U.S. scientific, technological and engineering and mathematical (or STEM) disciplines.     The overarching goal of the workshop was to move forward the historical study of persons of color, those of LGBTQ identities, persons with intellectual and physical disabilities, persons of low income, and others marginalized both within STEM disciplines and in the historical records of those fields.  We posed to the group questions about how such records have come to be written with so little attention to non-majority actors in history, even through decades during which legal and customary concern with discrimination supposedly became commonplace in the nation.  We reflected as a group on the issue of how enhanced historical coverage of identity experiences in STEM may or may not alter patterns of minority participation in those fields, given the widely held (and to us problematic) belief that celebrating such historical figures naturally encourages and even appropriately constitutes "diversity" in STEM occupations. At the same time we examined how biographical projects may hold important new potential for critical scholarship on the historical role of identity in STEM fields.  We discussed whether and how life stories help us better understand what has historically counted as diversity in the powerful institutions of science, engineering and medical teaching and research, and how such metrics might best be changed.     The workshop consisted of four sessions:  Session 1 &ndash; "Established Biographical Models and Resources"  Session 2 -  "Questioning Boundaries of STEM Communities"  Session 3 &ndash; "Expanding ideas of Identity, Attainment and the Functions of             Biography"  Session 4 -  "Summation:  What Can be Done? What Must be Done?"     Over the two days we addressed the following questions:  In session 1 we asked how have established approaches to the historical study of identity in STEM supported critical inquiry?  Where do existing individual and group biographies provide guidance? Presentations at the session included scholars who had written well-received studies of the African American biologist, Ernest Everett Just; a new study of the African American agricultural scientist George Washington Carver; a sociological analysis of African American chemists; a study of the contributions of African American inventors including Louis Latimer; and a study of the African American women mathematicians at NASA. In session 2 we discussed how historical understandings of scientific, technological or medical inquiry shaped participation in those sectors? Where do/can historians and social scientists seek explanations for the production and maintenance of those boundaries.  Presentations included a review of the role of African American female physicians in the history of medicine; a review of how gender and sexuality shape women?s participation in computing; and a discussion on the role of the concept of ?intersectionality? in science studies.  Session 3 focused on questions about the ways in which identity categories produce and reproduce cultural, political and geopolitical distributions of privilege and penalty.  We had presentations on the historical role of African Americans in technological innovation in the U.S.; a review of the connections between disability studies and historical studies in STEM fields; an update on current work on the science of broadening participation; and a review of diversity in the history of technology. In our last session, we had a robust discussion of next steps. The group consensus was that this multidisciplinary exchange of ideas should continue and be expanded to the many scholars who wanted to attend the workshop but who could not be accommodated due to space and resource constraints. The workshop participants agreed that we needed to create a ?community of practice? that would allow scholars working on issues related to the workshop themes to exchange ideas, resources and scholarly references that could promote the development of new ways of exploring the historical experiences of underrepresented groups in STEM fields.
