<AbstractNarration>There is a growing body of evidence that informal learning environments focused on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines cultivates an interest among young people in STEM careers and promotes understanding of STEM content knowledge and the scientific process.  This project centers on the creation and validation of a theoretically grounded and empirically derived framework for professional growth and learning within the informal STEM learning (ISL) field ("Framework"). The Framework will be useful to ISL practitioners at any stage of their education or career by laying out the necessary skills, knowledge, and dispositions to guide their professional growth. While the immediate beneficiaries of the project will be ISL professionals themselves, the ultimate beneficiaries of the work will be the children, youth, teachers, and general public that engage with STEM experiences designed and implemented by a skilled and knowledgeable ISL professional workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Association of Science-Technology Centers, Oregon State University's Center for Research on Lifelong STEM Learning, Pacific Science Center, University of Washington Museology Department and the Lifelong Learning Group of the Center of Science and Industry in Columbus, OH (COSI Columbus) will collaborate to develop the ISL professional framework.  The Framework will be built from qualitative and quantitative empirical analyses of actual practices used by staff of science centers and ISL institutions, assessing perceived and actual needs at various career stages, as well as an analysis of the creation and use of similar learning frameworks in other professions. The project will be conducted in three phases: (1) Literature review, research synthesis, and "Developing a Curriculum" (DACUM) workshops to develop a preliminary framework; (2) Stakeholder review and feedback in order to improve the preliminary framework; and, (3) Creation of an online platform to share the final framework draft and conduct iterative testing for utility and ISL community acceptance.  The project will address two current and pressing issues: (1) Ensuring that professionals working in science center-type settings have the necessary knowledge and skills to apply the substantial and growing evidence base in ISL, and (2) Understanding and supporting the needs of the full range of ISL professionals during their basic education and at particular points throughout their careers. Effective support for ISL professionals requires, at the most basic level, a fundamental understanding of the knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed by working professionals at critical points along their career pathway if they are to use evidence-based practice in their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Informal STEM Learning (ISL)Professional Competency Framework (www.islframework.org/) identifies the skills, knowledge, and capabilities that are associated with successful ISL work across most types of jobs and institutions. The Framework was developed by a collaboration of researchers, academics, and professionals, motivated by the belief that a shared, coherent, and transparent understanding of ISL professional competencies will support diverse learning paths, ultimately advancing the capacity and the impact of the field. The competencies were identified through research with a range of professionals working at  diverse STEM-based institutions across the country. After several years of iterative research, testing, revision, and a validation study with 1000 professionals across the field, the resulting Framework describes the suite of competencies that are associated with successful practice across the ISL field.  The Framework is organized to be useful and useable with the competencies organized into four domains.  Two of the domains focus on understanding the ways institutions work in the informal STEM learning field and two focus on the ways individuals work within their institution or organization. Each domain includes four categories of competencies, described at three levels of achievement. Institutional Operations - Competencies related to the policies, operations and functions of ISL organizations such as creating and maintaining budgets or advancing mission and vision. Institutional Impact - Competencies related to understanding, advancing and assessing the impact of the institution on audiences, communities and society. General Expertise - Competencies useful in any position such as intrapersonal skills or the ability to communicate effectively. These competencies are sometimes referred to as "soft skills." Job-Specific Expertise - Competencies related to specific jobs or area of work within ISL institutions. These competencies are sometimes referred to as "technical skills" or "hard skills."  A website and associated resources were developed to engage the field with the Framework and were shared through regional and national workshops, conference presentations, and publications.  Broader Impacts: The ISL Framework has the potential to advance the effectiveness, efficiency, stability, and professional agency of individuals who are pursuing or engaging in ISL work by focusing their learning on specific competencies. By providing transparency and guidance, the Framework also has the potential to connect and catalyze the mutual efforts of universities, professional organizations, institutions, and field-wide projects and initiatives focused on professional practices, ultimately advancing the capacity of the field. Individuals can use the ISL Professional Competency Framework to understand their current status and their desired status, based on their circumstances, their aspirations, and the role they want to play within the field. Institutions and organizations can use the framework to plan professional development for staff or to align organizational capabilities with strategic goals. Academic programs can use the framework to shape internships, consider curriculum, or to mentor alumni. Encouraging and supporting the development of a highly skilled, committed, and diverse workforce can propel innovation, community engagement, and STEM learning across the field.  Intellectual Merit: The Framework was informed by emerging conceptions about professions and the process of becoming a professional in the context of the 21st century global, digital, and diverse workplace. The Framework supports self-directed and personalized learning paths that respond to the needs of individuals, institutions, organizations, and academic programs, potentially advancing the professionalization of the field without compromising the values and practices of informal learning. While each job and each institution is unique, the competencies in this Framework cut across most functions.
