<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the interface between two very different systems: two-dimensional materials (2DMs, e.g.: graphene, single monolayer of carbon; phosphorene, a single layer phosphorus; monolayer molybdenum disulfide) and liquids (e.g.: water, biofluids, ethanol). The project pursues two main scientific goals. First, interactions between electrons in 2DMs are modified and studied by controllably changing the chemical composition, dielectric constant and flow velocity of liquids in contact with 2DMs. This line of investigation is expected to reveal the approaches to suppress electron scattering in 2DMs. Better understanding of carrier scattering, in turn, should advance potential applications of these materials in future electronic devices.  The second thrust of the project employs 2DMs as ultrasensitive probes of chemical composition, flow velocity, and nanoscale structure of liquids. Better understanding of these parameters can pave the way towards more efficient water filters and biosensors capable of recording electrical activity of individual neurons. The project includes a significant educational component. The PIs continue their participation in the Bridge program, one of the most successful efforts in the nation to involve underrepresented minorities in cutting-edge research leading to the PhD degree. The PIs continue to involve undergraduates and high school students in their research through their participation in Vanderbilt's Research Experience for Undergraduates and Vanderbilt's Summer Science Academy programs. Finally, the multidisciplinary nature of the project spanning the fields from condensed matter and computational physics to chemistry, biology, and imaging helps preparing PhD students for successful careers in science and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the interface between two-dimensional materials (2DMs, e.g. graphene, MoS2, phosphorene) and liquids (e.g. water, hexane) to (i) study and engineer the effects of the microenvironments of 2DMs on their properties, and (ii) understand the behavior of nanometer-thick interfacial liquid layers. To tackle these problems, the PIs developed a flexible setup that allows placing electrically contacted suspended 2DMs into liquids with controlled chemical composition, electrical potential, ionic concentration, and flow velocity. The 2DMs are interrogated via electrical transport, Hall effect, and optical measurements and studied through state-of-art electron microscopies and computational modeling.  In the first part of the project, the setup is used to controllably "tune" multiple parameters in the Hamiltonians of 2DMs. The effective strength of interactions between electrons in 2DMs is tuned by controlling the dielectric constant of liquids surrounding the devices. Hitherto unattainable carrier densities up to &gt;1015 cm-2 are achieved by applying an electric potential between ionic liquids and 2DMs suspended in them. Defects are induced in 2DMs by applying large electric potentials between devices and the liquid. These approaches are expected to reveal multiple exotic phenomena in 2DMs including gate-controlled superconductivity and excitonic collapse. In the second part of the project, the 2DMs are used as ultrasensitive sensors to study properties of a nanometer-thick interfacial layer of liquid in contact with a solid. By measuring the current induced by the Coulomb drag between ions in the flowing liquid and electrons in graphene, the "slip" velocity of the interfacial layer is determined. By measuring the 2DM/liquid capacitance, the dielectric constant of the interfacial liquid layer is probed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Two-dimensional (2D) crystalline materials, such as graphene, black phosphorus and transition-metal dichalcogenides, have extraordinary optical and electronic properties that promise to revolutionize many conventional technologies once it is possible to connect them either to each other or to other materials and devices. But that also requires that we understand the origins of their unusual properties and learn how to modulate and control them.     Intellectual merit.  The intellectual merit of this proposal derives from its ambitious exploration of the interface between the 2D materials and liquids, and building laboratory tools needed to handle material systems that are only a few atomic layers thick, measure their electronic and optical properties without damaging them, and in some cases to see the arrangement of atoms in the crystals. Just as in modern silicon technology, the properties of the 2D materials can be modified by selectively doping them to achieve desired responses to heat, electric and magnetic fields, and light ? which in turn enables them to be deployed as sensors.  The project also seeks to study what happens when liquids are intercalated into multi-layered 2D films to modify either the properties of the 2D materials themselves or create entirely new functionalities that involve the combined liquid-2D material structure.  Using computer models of these structures, the behavior of these complex 2D structures can be simulated, understood and then used in turn to predictively design other combinations of materials with desirable functionalities.      Broader impact. The push for ever smaller, lighter and thinner electronic devices drives a world-wide search for smaller, lighter and thinner battery materials. The 2D crystals studied in this project range from one to only a few atoms thick; when liquid or solid material is intercalated between sheets of the 2D materials, this is the ultimate form factor of an ultrathin battery.  Thus, the project has contributed to the basic science underlying this crucial 21stcentury technology.  More generally the interface between semiconductors and liquids is a critical element of many kinds of sensor technologies, especially in the life sciences. On the other hand, interfaces between metals and 2D semiconductors will be essential parts of electronic technology using ultrathin materials.  By using minimal amounts of materials and operating power, devices based on 2D materials also contribute to the goal of energy and environmental sustainability.      Accomplishments.  In our studies of intercalation, we used scanning-transmission electron microscopy to visualize with atomic-scale resolution how iron chloride molecules arrange themselves when they are drawn in between two sheets of graphene by an electric field.  (Figure 1). The big surprise was finding that although iron trichloride was intercalated, once drawn in between the two sheets of graphene, structures of both iron trichloride and iron dichloride were observed.  (Figure 2). Electrons that scatter from the atoms in the array and pass straight through the sample can be captured in a detector that measures their energy ? which is correlated with the atoms from which they scattered ? thus enabling us to identify the materials in the field of the microscope atom by atom.   The critical role of theory and simulation is highlighted by the comparison between the experimental data from the microscope and the simulation that identifies the crystal structure of the various forms of iron chloride (Figure 3).
