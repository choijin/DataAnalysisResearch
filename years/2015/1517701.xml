<AbstractNarration>This project will study two closely-related species of howler monkey in order to improve our understanding of the genetics of speciation in a primate model. When two closely-related species reproduce with one another, they produce hybrid individuals that have a mixture of genetic characteristics of both species. However, there are likely to be certain genetic regions in those hybrids that are not randomly mixed and that may play be important for local adaptation, reproductive isolation, and speciation. Studying genetic mechanisms that underlie reproductive isolation in a primate hybrid system can serve as a living model to understand the mechanisms involved in shaping our own genome, in the face of recent evidence of the occurrence of hybridization between modern and archaic human populations during hominin evolution. This project will also increase diversity in science by supporting the researchers and students who are underrepresented minorities and by promoting the conservation of natural populations of primates through educational activities for school-age children in local communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies of patterns of introgression (the movement of alleles from one gene pool to another through hybridization) provide an outstanding opportunity to improve our understanding of the number, distribution and function of differentiated genomic regions during the process of speciation. To explore the genetic mechanisms that underlie reproductive isolation in primates, the proposed work will analyze pure and admixed populations of two species of howler monkeys that hybridize in Mexico. Analyses of genome-wide data will be used to first determine the number and distribution of genomic regions that have higher than expected levels of divergence between non-hybridizing populations of parental species. In addition, genomic cline analyses will be performed to determine whether or not these divergent loci in allopatric populations also show reduced levels of introgression in the hybrid zone (as expected for loci involved in reproductive isolation). Levels of linkage disequilibrium will be estimated for loci with reduced introgression and the loci will be mapped to publicly available reference genomes to determine whether they are clumped or scattered throughout the genome. Sequences will also be annotated through comparison with the NCBI non-redundant protein and nucleotide databases to determine the association of these regions to genic regions with known functions and/or to regulatory regions. Finally, the proportion of non-introgressing loci located in the X chromosome relative to loci located in autosomal regions will be estimated to test the hypothesis that loci involved in reproductive isolation have accumulated in the X chromosome.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The formation of new species involves the evolution of traits (and their underlying genetic bases) that restrict reproduction between individuals of different species, either by preventing their mating or by producing offspring that are unfertile or less capable to survive than individuals of the parent species. Our understanding of the genetic components that produce these barriers to reproduction (called reproductive isolating mechanisms) in animals is still minimal, and is an active area of research. Laboratory studies of model organisms have provided important insight on some of the areas of the genome that are particularly important in this process, such as the X-chromosome in mammals and fruit flies (a chromosome that is only inherited through the mother). However, it is not known if the genomic elements that prevent successful reproduction between species of model organisms prevent interbreeding of other, non-model species. In this study we aimed at identifying genomic regions and general evolutionary mechanisms involved in the reproductive isolation of two howler monkey species. Our analyzes included individuals of each species sampled in areas where the other species does not exist, as well as individuals in an area where the two species co-exist, mate, and produce some offspring (a &ldquo;hybrid zone&rdquo;) in southern Mexico. We produced the first genomic dataset of thousands of genetic markers across the genomes of the two species. Through statistical analyzes we investigated whether genomic regions surrounding these markers were exchanged between the two species through interbreeding, with the expectation that areas not exchanged may be involved in reproductive isolation. We found that while a large part of the genome is exchanged between the two species, some regions are not exchanged or have reduced levels of exchange in comparison to other regions. We also determined that regions that are not exchanged are located throughout the genome, but a large proportion of markers located on the X-chromosome showed this lack or reduction of exchange between species, implying that the X-chromosome contains genes that are particularly important for preventing successful interbreeding between these species. We mapped these regions onto marmoset and human genomes (because there is no annotated howler monkey genome available) to detect specific genes contained in these regions and found several candidate genes that may be involved in preventing interbreeding between species. We also observed that genomic regions that have no or reduced levels of exchange in the hybrid zone, also have higher differentiation between species than the rest of the genome, implying that these regions have become more different in each species during their evolution and are likely involved in preventing interbreeding between individuals of the two species. Although this is an intuitive expectation, very few studies have provided evidence to support this assumption in natural populations. Furthermore, we found that the genomic regions that have no exchange or reduced levels of exchange in the hybrid zone, are even more distinct in the hybrid zone than in areas where individuals of the two species are not in contact. This is a pattern consistent with &ldquo;reinforcement&rdquo;, a process that prevents the mating of individuals of different species because is disadvantageous for individuals to mate with individuals of a different species. Finally, when we analyzed the patterns of exchange across the X-chromosome, we observed one region that mapped to a region of the human X-chromosome that also was not exchanged during hybridization of our human ancestors with Neandertals or Denisovans (two species of archaic humans) during our evolutionary past. We conclude that this region likely contains genes that are important in preventing interbreeding across primates. Our findings provide empirical evidence that 1) the genomic regions associated with reproductive isolation between these howler monkey species are located across their genomes, but are particularly enriched in the X-chromosome, 2) the genetic differences acquired by these species throughout their independent evolution are important for preventing interbreeding when they came back into geographic contact, and 3) reinforcement is operating between the two species. Furthermore, our results offer new and exciting venues of research to understand the genetic underpinnings of reproductive isolation among primates. Besides the scientific findings, our project allowed us to give back to the local community where these howler monkeys live in Mexico by providing educational opportunities for middle-school age children. We designed and implemented a workshop in which students learned about the biology, ecology and behavior of these primates, recognized local threats to their survival, and identified ways in which they could help to conserve them.
