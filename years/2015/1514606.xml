<AbstractNarration>This project provides graduate students with tools needed to recognize opportunities for development of mathematical approaches to challenges related to global environmental change, from physics to biology to society, using as the common denominator the subject of water.   These environmental and societal challenges involve many complex factors, and students will be trained to apply and implement mathematical strategies that effectively address these complexities.  Essential to the training will be opportunities afforded by visits to important European policy centers, such as the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (Austria) and the Stockholm Resilience Center, where policy issues are articulated and integrated with scientific analyses. The overarching goal of this project is to offer an avenue to train talented mathematical scientists to contribute substantively to the understanding of the interactions between society and nature and to formulate well-founded strategies to manage these interactions to assure a sustainable future. This project has received co-funding from the Global Venture Fund of the Office of International Science and Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical modeling of the problems addressed in this project involves a variety of tools, from game theory and network theory to deterministic and stochastic partial differential equations.  The application of powerful analytical and numerical methods to the challenges of modeling water as a societal resource promises significant advances in policy and planning.  On the other hand, the questions raised by societal challenges related to water will require new directions of research in game theory and stochastic and deterministic partial differential equations, contributing to advances in mathematics. The interactions among mathematicians and scientists in this project will bring to bear powerful new mathematical perspective and techniques to societal problems surrounding the crucial resource that is water.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project is aimed at exposing and involving graduate students in activities that offer a broad perspective on major issues impacting nature and society in connection with water.     The students visited international centers devoted to the study of areas of societal impact in broad connection with issues of water, ecology and economics. While at these centers, the students interacted with researchers in diverse areas, distinct from their own, and participated in the institue activities (conferences and workshops). The students submitted and published research papers on the subjects related to the project.  The dissemination of their activities is supported by a webpage dedicated to the project, https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/graduate/graduate-training-opportunities/2015-2019.  Back at the University, the students organized, presented and participated in a special  regular bi-monthly student lead seminar, in which they reported across disciplines about their findings. A multidisciplinary graduate research community emerged, reaching beyond narrow traditional research boundaries.  The project resulted in the education of  graduate students in science who have a broad view of their role as scholars and researchers, and have the exposure and the tools to influence rational decisions of societal importance.     The education of a broadly informed and engaged  graduate workforce is the most valuable outcome of the project, and is deemed of potential impact on society.
