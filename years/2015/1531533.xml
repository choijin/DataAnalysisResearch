<AbstractNarration>The importance of entrepreneurship and innovation is becoming more widely recognized. Recently, higher education institutions have recognized their responsibility in creating a more entrepreneurially minded workforce and have begun to broaden entrepreneurship education beyond the traditional business school model of business fundamentals, case studies, and start-­up companies. In doing so, new approaches to teaching entrepreneurship have been developed, encouraging students to take a more active role in and outside of the classroom. How these aspects of entrepreneurship education influence women's engagement and involvement has yet to be studied. In many instances, these approaches involve a combination of competition and problem-based, team-­oriented learning. Integration of these approaches may influence students in different ways, and there may be differential effects based on gender, race, culture or socioeconomic class. Educational programs are relying on students to self-­select into these highly competitive non-­traditional learning environments. The purpose of this grant is to explore the influence of these new learning environments on student engagement, particularly for women. Results from this research are critical as the nation moves to find ways to develop a diverse, innovative workforce for the 21st century. These results will help higher education institutions understand how women choose to engage in entrepreneurship educational programs and how programs influence women to become involved in innovation after graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will engage in a mixed methods study to examine relationships between entrepreneurship pedagogy and women's engagement in entrepreneurship education and innovation post-­graduation. This study will leverage UM Learning Analytics student learning data. Four research questions will drive the work: 1) Who are the students that choose to engage, or not, in particular entrepreneurship educational opportunities and how do these choices differ with gender?; 2) Why do students choose to engage, or not, in particular entrepreneurship educational opportunities, and how do these choices differ with gender?; 3) What are the benefits to students of particular entrepreneurship education activities, and how do these benefits differ with gender? This includes how students perceive their fit within the entrepreneurship program as well as their general perceptions of the program; 4) How do particular entrepreneurship educational opportunities impact the current work of former students, including development of entrepreneurial skills and mindsets, and how do impacts differ with gender? The unique ability to use institutional learning analytics data and large scale alumni surveys to inform targeted in-­depth interviews will offer the most comprehensive look at the impact of engineering entrepreneurship education on gender to date.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The economic impact of entrepreneurship and innovation is becoming more widely recognized. In recent years, STEM educational institutions have begun to leverage entrepreneurship education to create a more entrepreneurially minded technological workforce.  This growth has broadened entrepreneurship education beyond the business school model of business fundamentals and firm-creation.  Recent innovations in entrepreneurship education stem from engineering entrepreneurship programs that have recognized the need to move beyond the classroom for effective entrepreneurship education, leveraging newly developed entrepreneurship content, evidence-based engineering experiential pedagogies and more informal co-curricular opportunities.   While the growth of entrepreneurship programming is becoming widespread, it is important to recognize that entrepreneurship education has the potential to influence different communities in different ways.  The purpose of this work was to explore student engagement in entrepreneurship education programing and build a conceptual framework for exploring why students choose to participate or not participate in entrepreneurship education. The framework was based on key theories in entrepreneurship assessment and adult learning.  We were also able to validate and revise the model definitions based on student interview data.The findings demonstrated that student decisions are a complex interplay of internal (entrepreneurial self- efficacy, entrepreneurial intent, desirability) and external (life transitions, information and resources, opportunities and barriers) influencers. Further analysis also indicated that student decisions to participate in entrepreneurship education programming differs between males and females.   The resultant framework serves as a framework for exploring student engagement and disengagement in entrepreneurship education programming across diverse audiences. These findings can help inform administrators and faculty in the thoughtful and cost effective creation of technology focused entrepreneurship educational programs that attract and develop a diverse entrepreneurial workforce.
