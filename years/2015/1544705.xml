<AbstractNarration>Power systems have seen many changes over the last decade including the increased penetration of renewable generation, electric vehicles and new technologies for sensing, communication and control of a Smart Grid. The most significant impact of these changes are being felt at the consumer level. The ability for consumers and end devices to buy and sell energy and related services in a dynamic and interactive manner is expected to create a transactive energy market as highlighted in the Dec 2014 report of GridWise Alliance.  Modeling and preparing the physical system to respond to the somewhat unpredictable  behavior  of  active  consumers over  a  cyber-infrastructure  will  be  critical  for maintaining grid reliability.  Understanding the impact of such active consumers on the operational and business policies of the distribution utility requires advances in core system science that spans the areas of power engineering, economics, statistical signal processing, game theory, distributed control, multi-agent systems and cyber security. In conjunction with industrial partners, Westar Energy (the largest electric company in Kansas) and Kansas City Power and Light, the PIs plan to develop an architecture that requires little change to the existing investment in power distribution systems while allowing for the  dynamic,  adaptive  control  required  to  integrate  active  consumers  with  current  and  future combinations of high-variability distributed power sources, such as Photo-voltaic (PV) generators and storage batteries.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast to prior related efforts that primarily focus on demand response and distributed generation management with a single home/user centric approach, the proposed approach takes a holistic system perspective that includes cumulative modeling of multiple stochastic active consumers and the cyber infrastructure over which they may interact.  Specific research thrusts include: (1) a general, extensible, and secure cyber architecture based on holonic multi-agent principles that provides a pathway to the emerging area of transactive energy market in power distribution systems, but also provides foundation for  other  engineered  systems  with  active  consumers;  (2)  new  analytical  insights  into  generalized stochastic modeling of consumer response to real]time price of electricity and the impact of such active consumers on grid reliability and security, and (3) novel methodology for comprehensive distributed control and management of power distribution systems with active consumers and high penetration of distributed renewable resources.  Active consumers are an integral part of the Smart City vision where cyber systems are integrated into the transportation, energy, healthcare and biomedical, and critical infrastructure systems. Successful completion of this project will result in modeling, control, analysis and simulation architectures for all such active consumer driven CPS domains. The resulting gains in operating efficiency, economics, reliability and security will result in overall welfare for the society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With increasing penetration of rooftop solar generation, the ability of "active consumers" and end devices to buy/sell energy and related services in a dynamic and interactive manner is expected to create a "transactive energy" (TE) market presenting new opportunities and challenges for distribution system operations. This project uncovers fundamentally new approaches to understand the impact of penetration of active consumers (with renewable energy generation) and a transactive energy market on the distribution grid.  Intellectual Merit  The project has advanced the state of the art in multiple dimensions including:   Novel stochastic approaches to model behavior, preferences and possible irrational actions of active consumers and their effect on the physical grid. By leveraging concepts from prospect theory and stochastic hybrid modeling frameworks, the project has developed new insights into understanding the effect of active consumer penetration and cyber impairments in a transactive energy environment. For the first time, the project lays out guidelines on designing and analyzing cost-setting auction based energy trading market at the distribution side. A techno-socio-economic approach to implementing these auction algorithms is a unique outcome of this effort.  A holonic multi agent simulation (HMAS) test bed was developed and used to demonstrate the cost setting auction algorithm at work among active consumers. The HMAS test bed can be extended to other applications as well.     These and other significant outcomes are captured in numerous refereed journal and conference publications that have directly resulted from this project.  Broader Impacts  The proposed architectures for market design, operation and its analysis under the umbrella of the holonic multiagent framework will provide a new approach to engineer smart distribution grids. Together with situational awareness tools and active consumer models, the research findings from this project will be critical in facilitating large scale integration of renewable energy sources at the grid edge. The 6 graduate students (including 1 female PhD student) who worked on the project over 4 years were able to benefit from multiple professional development opportunities through this effort. The research results were systematically disseminated at top technical venues through the course of the project and via the project website. The HMAS simulation software is available for download to other research groups at the project website http://ipds.cs.ksu.edu/ .
