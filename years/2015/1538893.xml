<AbstractNarration>Non-technical description&lt;br/&gt;This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR* Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) award to Brown University is for a collaboration with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Rhode Island College.  The project focuses on the development of solar cells using compounds called perovskites (the name perovskite derives from their crystal structure).  The project includes materials research to understand structural, electrical, and optical properties of perovskites, development of non-toxic perovskite materials for use in solar cells, experimentation to enhance power conversion efficiency, and exploration of scale-up processes for low-cost, high efficiency perovskite solar cells.  The collaboration provides mentoring for junior faculty and the critical mass effort is expected to enhance research capacity, infrastructure, and train skilled workforce in both Rhode Island and Nebraska. The educational training for graduate student includes courses on entrepreneurship; undergraduates from 4-year colleges (including Tougaloo College in Mississippi) and high school teachers are engaged in summer research/camps.  SciToons for YouTube will be developed in partnership with Rhode Island School of Design to increase the scientific awareness of solar cell research for clean energy production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses scientific and technological challenges in the development of hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) including: (1)  Understanding of solution-deposition mechanisms and effects on nano-/micro- structure of hybrid perovskites; (2) development of solution-processing methods and scale-up of processes for high throughput fabrication and potential commercialization of solar cells; (3) experimentation of electrode materials and solar cell efficiency enhancement through plasmonic concentrators and tandem devices; and (4) exploration of lead-free materials for use in low-cost, high-efficiency PSCs through computational and experimental validation.  The work involves synthesis of hybrid perovskite materials in the form of thin films, bulk polycrystals, and single crystals; characterization using a variety of spectroscopic, microscopic and crystallographic methods; and studies of optical and transport properties and the interplay between ferroelectricity and photovoltaic response with an aim to improve the stability of PSCs.  The project team will explore technologies such as roll-to-roll printing and doctor-blade coating for scalable manufacturing as well as carbon-based electrodes, plasmonic concentrators, and tandem devices to improve the power conversion efficiency of PSCs.  The team will also pursue the discovery and studies of lead-free perovskite systems (methylammonium tin iodide, metal halide, potassium platinum chloride, and bismuth-based perovskites) to develop environmentally-safe materials for use in PSCs. The project involves ten faculty members, 16 graduate students, 17 undergraduate students and one high school teacher in research, as well as 12 teachers in summer camps on solar energy. The K-12, public outreach activities leverage ongoing programs and are focused on renewable/solar energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research</AbstractNarration>
