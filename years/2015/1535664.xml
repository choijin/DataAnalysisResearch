<AbstractNarration>There are 2.3 million mixed-status families in the US, in which the uncertain legal status of some members influences opportunities and resources for all, including permanent residents and US citizens. A focus on individuals in US law and policy largely overlooks cumulative ripple effects on families, although individuals are always embedded within these complex social units. This study examines how mixed-status families experience specific policies related to health care and education, and seeks to understand how they collectively navigate opportunities and obstacles. It is necessary to understand the experiences of these families -- including and especially the impacts on some 4.5 million US citizen children -- in order to ensure equitable application of policy and to reduce disparities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using mixed-status families as a primary unit of analysis, this project advances scholarship on how juridical categories shape socialization to identities within the domestic sphere as well as in relation to public institutions such as health care and education. This ethnographic study examines how families actively negotiate institutions by employing a longitudinal, three-year design. Data from multiple members of 40 mixed-status families will be examined across two points in time. This will be contextualized through participant observation and interviews with 50 service providers and community experts. This study seeks to transform theories of migration and law by shifting the focus from individuals to families, better revealing social impacts and how difference are shaped at the family level. Bridging experiences at the micro-familial with those at the policy level will result in advances for understanding the contemporary migration experience and theoretical concerns in the social science of law.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project concludes that novel theoretical contributions to the study of migration and practices of citizenship can be made through the analysis of mixed-status family dynamics. It illustrates how juridical categories of legal status stratify resources and shape members’ socialization in relation to institutions such as education and health care, as well as within the domestic sphere. The project addresses theoretical concerns central to studies of law, cultural anthropology, and sociology, including the (re)production of families, the character of negotiations between individuals and state regimes, citizenship and belonging, and "illegality." This research finds that the construction of "illegality" for some members in a family influences opportunities and resources for everyone, including spillover effects for legal residents and U.S. citizens. Bureaucratic disentitlement is one way by which individuals may be deprived of their statutory rights or entitlements; this involves unnecessarily complicating processes, withholding information, providing misinformation, or isolating individuals.
