<AbstractNarration>A longstanding problem in astrophysics is to understand how galaxies form and develop throughout their lifetimes.  Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to study quasars and other active galactic nuclei.  They are also interesting astrophysical phenomena in their own right and serve as a probe of relativistic physics.  They co-evolve with their host galaxies and trace the evolution of cosmic structure.  However, most of the methods for quasar discovery are based on the properties of their broadband spectral energy distributions, and nearly all known quasars and quasar candidates come from samples that use some type of flux ratios or just the presence of a non-thermal emission.  Variability offers a spectrum-independent method for quasar discovery.  Although variability has been much studied on the basis of individual or a few objects, variability-based quasar surveys have so far been limited to small dedicated regions of sky with at most a few thousand objects and/or poor time resolution.  This study of quasar variability employs the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) data set, which covers about 80\% of the sky over a baseline greater than 9 years. Its 500 million object data set currently holds about 250,000 known quasars, 500,000 photometric quasar candidates and an estimated 1,000,000 new variability-selected quasars.  This will form the largest quasar data set to date.  In keeping with the CRTS Open Data policy, all quasars (and other classified objects) identified in this project will be released to the community.  This will form a major new resource for both quasar and more general variability studies.  The statistical methods to be used are also applicable to any irregular-sampled time series, and the combination of these with machine-learning techniques is a case study for data-intensive science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaboration with a primarily undergraduate institution and directly enhances the STEM education of two undergraduates.  Working with scientists at the Center for Data-Driven Discovery (CD3) at Caltech, they will be exposed to cutting-edge techniques in data science, including high level usage of data mining and extracting meaningful results from these large data sets.  Data products from this project also form the basis for student projects at the joint US-Chile-funded La Serena School for Data Science, training the next generation in applied tools for handling big astronomical data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, this project will focus on (i) the correlation of quasar variability features, particularly characteristic timescales, with physical parameters, such as luminosity, black hole mass, and the Eddington ratio; (ii) periodic variability as possible evidence for supermassive black hole binaries; (iii) variability as a probe of obscuration in young dust-enshrouded red quasars; and (iv) quantifying wavelength dependencies of variability to improve quasar selection and constrain different models of physical processes.  The study will employ modern statistical techniques that can work naturally with irregularly-sampled gappy time series without the need for reprojection or smoothing.  In combination with machine-learning methods, these will produce optimal ensemble-based results, such as new variability-polychromatic methods for quasar selection.  This project will be a key study on optical quasar variability well into the LSST era.  It is at least two orders of magnitude larger than any previous study in terms of sky coverage and number of quasars and an order of magnitude better in terms of time resolution (number of observations / baseline).  It will also substantially increase the number of high likelihood quasar candidates known, particularly in the regions of the sky not covered by SDSS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quasars are extremely luminous objects, powered by super-massive black holes in the centers of galaxies.  They help us probe the distant universe, the physics of black holes, and their evolution is closely related to the evolution of their host galaxies.  Their central regions where all of the observed activity originates are far too compact to be resolved even by the most powerful telescopes.  Thus, one important observational probe that can give us insights into their physics is their variability: their brightness fluctuates in time in a complex fashion.  These fluctuations may be caused by the changes in the accretion of the material onto the black holes, which is what is responsible for their enormous luminosity; to changes in their inner structure; to a variable obscuration along the line of sight; to the presence of binary supermassive lack holes orbiting each other; to the jets of relativistic particles emerging from the "central engine"; and possibly other causes.  Variability can provide some insights into these mechanisms, and their implications for the physics and evolution of these extreme objects.  In this project we used data from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS), which was supported by the NSF, as well as other surveys.  CRTS monitored hundreds of millions of astronomical objects over the period of 10-12 years, including a couple of million quasars, both known and as yet unknown.  This is a unique data resource for a systematic exploration of the temporal variability of quasars.  In order to do that, we had to devise novel methods of data analysis, that use data-intensive computing, machine learning, and statistics, and that can have applications in other fields beyond astronomy.  We also made use of several observational facilities, especially Palomar and Keck Observatories, for the follow-up studies of the most interesting objects.  A number of interesting results have been obtained, including the following:  - We discovered a population of quasars that show a periodic variable signal superposed on their normally stochastic variability..  They are interpreted as a signature of orbiting binary supermassive black holes, that can modulate the observed signal in several different ways.  The existence of this population is expected from our theoretical understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies: as galaxies merge, their central black holes also merge, after a long period of spiraling in, while emitting gravitational waves.  - We found a large number of quasars where their spectra (indicative of the physics of the central engine and its environment) also vary, in a correlated manner with the brightness fluctuations.  Several different physical mechanisms may be responsible, and studies of this population will give us a better understanding of the central regions of quasars and their host galaxies.  - We found a number of cases where the brightness of the quasar increases dramatically (compared to the normal brightness fluctuations) and then decreases over a period of a few years.  They appear to be a mixed population: some may be due to a gravitational lensing along the line of sight, some may be due to ultra-luminous supernovae (exploding massive stars) in the disk surrounding the black hole, and some may be due to some new cataclysmic events in these disks.  - Finally, we devised a novel method for quasar discovery that combines their variability and infrared colors, that is more efficient than any quasar search technique so far.  This will result in at least a million of previously unknown quasars, essentially doubling their numbers.  This project has already yielded some new insights into the nature of qusars, but also posed some new questions to be answered by the future studies.  The methodology we developed may also be used in many other situations where there is a need to extract useful information form irregular, spare, and noisy time series of measurements.
