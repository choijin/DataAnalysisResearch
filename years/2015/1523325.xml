<AbstractNarration>The process of electrification of convective clouds involves collisions of large ice precipitation particles that are growing by collecting supercooled cloud droplets (graupel) with ice crystals that grow by vapor deposition.  The negatively charged graupel fall and lower whereas the positively charged crystals ascend with the updraft, thus separating the charges and increasing the electric field until its breakdown in the form of lightning flashes.  The existence of supercooled cloud droplets and strong updrafts that are required for the process can be ascribed to both thermodynamic and aerosol properties of the air mass. Disentangling the dynamic and aerosol effects is a long-standing question, because the aerosol and thermodynamic properties are often not independent. This study addresses this challenge with a new combination of observational tools that are applied to this problem for the first time.  The cloud microstructure is retrieved by the new NPP/VIIRS satellite measurements that will provide retrieved cloud properties at a resolution of 375 m.  Ground-truth aerosol measurements will be continuously available. The Houston Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) and the central Oklahoma LMA will provide accurate 3-dimensional mapping of the lightning sources and their polarity. The new polarimetric radars will provide the evolution of the precipitation in the clouds. These measurements will be conducted over the Houston area, which has refineries and other sources of air pollution. Similar clouds in and outside of the Houston pollution plume will be examined for separating the aerosol from thermodynamic effects on cloud microstructure, precipitation forming processes and electrification, including charging polarity. Similar studies will be conducted in central Oklahoma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to the education of several undergraduate and graduate students who will directly participate in the research, which will include their sharing in data acquisition and analysis. Included in this study is support for students who will write theses and dissertations and present their results at seminars and professional meetings.  Research results will be incorporated into courses on cloud physics and mesoscale phenomena.  The research team will continue to inform, engage, and disseminate information and data to the wider scientific community through the project website.  Access to the LMA real-time lightning display is provided at no cost to the Houston community and surrounding areas.</AbstractNarration>

Isolating the effects of CAPE and N<sub>CCN</sub> on cloud properties has been an unresolved challenge. Tracking the time-height evolution of a large number of individual summer convective storm cells in the Houston area under various CAPE and N<sub>CCN</sub> shows their relations to the storm's dynamics, precipitation, and electrification processes. The results show that increased N<sub>CCN</sub> invigorates the convection, produces larger hydrometeors, and enhances lightning. Variability in N<sub>CCN</sub> was found to be more important than variability in CAPE, cloud base height, and wind shear in explaining the variability of the vigor and electrification of deep convective clouds in the study area.</p> <p>An example (Figure 1) is selected on June 11, 2016<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">,</span> near Lubbock, TX (KLBB radar). The cell id is 1790 and was initiated at 33.77<sup> </sup>N 101.03<sup> </sup>W, at 20:18 UTC, 74 km from the radar station with an azimuth angle of 80. The first-echo height of cell 1790 is detected near 7 km and continues to grow for 30 minutes until the echo top reaches 18 km (Figure 1a). The supercell echo top quickly increases to over 18 km in 30 minutes with a strong reflectivity core (e.g., Z &gt; 60 dBZ). The dissipation begins after 55 minutes of cell 1790s detection and lasts for 70 minutes (Figure 1a).&nbsp;</p> <p>The lightning panel (Figure 1b) shows that lightning initiated right after the hail/graupel became evident (15 min) and intensifies once the hail shaft is obvious (25 min). During the mature stage of this supercell (t=25 min to t = 55 min), the maximum height of the lightning activity is close to the echo top height, and the base of lightning activity practically reaches the surface. As the supercell dissipation starts, the top height of the lightning activity descends to about 10 km while the echo top height remains at 15 km.&nbsp; At the same time, the base of the lightning activity rises to a height of ~5 km, indicating a decrease of cloud-to-ground lightning activity and more stratiform cloud-to-cloud lightning during the supercell?s dissipation stage. The lightning height top descends with the 25 dBZ reflectivity contour line at nearly the same rate (Figure 1a and 1b around 3m/s), which is likely due to the descent of large hydrometeors as a result of the weaker updraft characterizing the weakening cell. The fall speed is estimated by the mean height of the descending 25 dBZ contour. This pattern of lightning reaching the radar echo top during the active convective phase of a cell and descending as the cell starts to decay was also observed in other thunderstorms that were tracked through their decaying stages.</p> <p>The ambiguity between the roles of N<sub>CCN</sub> and CAPE (i.e., the thermodynamic impact) on lightning occurrence was addressed in this study by classifying the tracked cells into low and high N<sub>CCN</sub> groups occurring in low and high CAPE environments, which allows us to better separate the role that N<sub>CCN</sub> and CAPE have on lightning occurrence. Fig 2 shows time-height composites of the LMA source counts under different N<sub>CCN</sub> and CAPE combinations. On the left-hand side of Fig 2 (LHS, Fig 2a and 2c), the CAPE values of sample convective cells are limited to less than 3000 J/kg with either low N<sub>CCN</sub> (i.e., less than 500 cm<sup>-3</sup>; Fig. 2a) or high N<sub>CCN</sub> (i.e., greater than 500 cm<sup>-3</sup>; Fig. 2c) concentrations. The right-hand side (RHS) of Fig 2 (Fig2b and 2d) has the same N<sub>CCN</sub> partition but is valid for cells occurring in environments of CAPE &gt; 3000 J/kg. By comparing the LHS and RHS of Fig 2 vertically, the enhanced lightning associated with increasing N<sub>CCN</sub> concentration (mean N<sub>CCN</sub> increases from 360 cm<sup>-3 </sup>to 924 cm<sup>-3</sup> from Fig 2a to 2c for example) is apparent, though it should be noted that mean CAPE decreased slightly from 2604 J/kg (Fig 2a) to 2376 J/kg. These observations support the idea that increasing N<sub>CCN</sub> enhances mixed-phase precipitation and affects lightning.</p> <p>On the other hand, comparing Fig 2 panels horizontally (i.e., Fig 2a vs 2b or Fig 2c vs 2d) elucidates the CAPE effect on lightning. For instance, Fig 2a and 2b have similar mean N<sub>CCN</sub> (360 cm<sup>-3</sup> for Fig 2a and 373 cm<sup>-3 </sup>for Fig 2b), but Fig 2b has about 1000 J/kg higher mean CAPE. The lightning enhancement is not obvious with higher CAPE when keeping the N<sub>CCN</sub> similar; the evidence that higher CAPE enhances mixed phase process and the resultant charge separation and lightning is not seen in these data.&nbsp;</p> <p>This project&nbsp;uses a unique combination of polarimetric radar, LMA, and newly developed satellite retrievals of N<sub>CCN</sub> makes it possible, for the first time, to evaluate quantitatively the observed effects of N<sub>CCN</sub> on cloud microphysical, dynamic, and electrification properties.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/06/2019<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;Rosenfeld</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1523325/1523325_10393973_1567733922359_fig_7--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1523325/1523325_10393973_1567733922359_fig_7--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1523325/1523325_10393973_1567733922359_fig_7--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Composite time height evolution LMA source count in radar tracked convective cells under different NCCN and CAPE conditions.The NCCN classes are a and b less than 500 cm-3, c and d larger than 500 cm-3.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Deep convective clouds are propelled by rising air currents and are composed of cloud droplets that nucleate on CCN aerosols. Isolating the effects of CAPE and NCCN on cloud properties has been an unresolved challenge. Tracking the time-height evolution of a large number of individual summer convective storm cells in the Houston area under various CAPE and NCCN shows their relations to the storm's dynamics, precipitation, and electrification processes. The results show that increased NCCN invigorates the convection, produces larger hydrometeors, and enhances lightning. Variability in NCCN was found to be more important than variability in CAPE, cloud base height, and wind shear in explaining the variability of the vigor and electrification of deep convective clouds in the study area.  An example (Figure 1) is selected on June 11, 2016, near Lubbock, TX (KLBB radar). The cell id is 1790 and was initiated at 33.77 N 101.03 W, at 20:18 UTC, 74 km from the radar station with an azimuth angle of 80. The first-echo height of cell 1790 is detected near 7 km and continues to grow for 30 minutes until the echo top reaches 18 km (Figure 1a). The supercell echo top quickly increases to over 18 km in 30 minutes with a strong reflectivity core (e.g., Z &gt; 60 dBZ). The dissipation begins after 55 minutes of cell 1790s detection and lasts for 70 minutes (Figure 1a).   The lightning panel (Figure 1b) shows that lightning initiated right after the hail/graupel became evident (15 min) and intensifies once the hail shaft is obvious (25 min). During the mature stage of this supercell (t=25 min to t = 55 min), the maximum height of the lightning activity is close to the echo top height, and the base of lightning activity practically reaches the surface. As the supercell dissipation starts, the top height of the lightning activity descends to about 10 km while the echo top height remains at 15 km.  At the same time, the base of the lightning activity rises to a height of ~5 km, indicating a decrease of cloud-to-ground lightning activity and more stratiform cloud-to-cloud lightning during the supercell?s dissipation stage. The lightning height top descends with the 25 dBZ reflectivity contour line at nearly the same rate (Figure 1a and 1b around 3m/s), which is likely due to the descent of large hydrometeors as a result of the weaker updraft characterizing the weakening cell. The fall speed is estimated by the mean height of the descending 25 dBZ contour. This pattern of lightning reaching the radar echo top during the active convective phase of a cell and descending as the cell starts to decay was also observed in other thunderstorms that were tracked through their decaying stages.  The ambiguity between the roles of NCCN and CAPE (i.e., the thermodynamic impact) on lightning occurrence was addressed in this study by classifying the tracked cells into low and high NCCN groups occurring in low and high CAPE environments, which allows us to better separate the role that NCCN and CAPE have on lightning occurrence. Fig 2 shows time-height composites of the LMA source counts under different NCCN and CAPE combinations. On the left-hand side of Fig 2 (LHS, Fig 2a and 2c), the CAPE values of sample convective cells are limited to less than 3000 J/kg with either low NCCN (i.e., less than 500 cm-3; Fig. 2a) or high NCCN (i.e., greater than 500 cm-3; Fig. 2c) concentrations. The right-hand side (RHS) of Fig 2 (Fig2b and 2d) has the same NCCN partition but is valid for cells occurring in environments of CAPE &gt; 3000 J/kg. By comparing the LHS and RHS of Fig 2 vertically, the enhanced lightning associated with increasing NCCN concentration (mean NCCN increases from 360 cm-3 to 924 cm-3 from Fig 2a to 2c for example) is apparent, though it should be noted that mean CAPE decreased slightly from 2604 J/kg (Fig 2a) to 2376 J/kg. These observations support the idea that increasing NCCN enhances mixed-phase precipitation and affects lightning.  On the other hand, comparing Fig 2 panels horizontally (i.e., Fig 2a vs 2b or Fig 2c vs 2d) elucidates the CAPE effect on lightning. For instance, Fig 2a and 2b have similar mean NCCN (360 cm-3 for Fig 2a and 373 cm-3 for Fig 2b), but Fig 2b has about 1000 J/kg higher mean CAPE. The lightning enhancement is not obvious with higher CAPE when keeping the NCCN similar; the evidence that higher CAPE enhances mixed phase process and the resultant charge separation and lightning is not seen in these data.   This project uses a unique combination of polarimetric radar, LMA, and newly developed satellite retrievals of NCCN makes it possible, for the first time, to evaluate quantitatively the observed effects of NCCN on cloud microphysical, dynamic, and electrification properties.
