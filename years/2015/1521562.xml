<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;1521562 (Gonsior)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports international travel and registration for the workshop "NOM 2015 - 6th IWA Specialist Workshop on Natural Organic Matter in Drinking Water" (NOM 6) for six early-career faculty, one post-doctoral scholar, and 10 students. The NOM 6 workshop is an important international meeting that brings experts together to discuss recent research efforts focused on the impact of natural organic matter (NOM) on drinking water systems and is jointly organized by the International Water Association (IWA) and the Swedish water utility Sydvatten. It will be held in September 2015 in Sweden. At this workshop, experts in NOM join with environmental engineers to foster new collaborations and to advance the scientific understanding of NOM and its impacts on drinking water treatment processes. The travel team members span a large research area of NOM and how it relates to drinking water treatment. All members of the travel team will give an oral or poster presentation. The travel team will collaborate on a review article focused on the fate and effects of NOM during drinking water treatment; that manuscript is to be submitted by March, 2016. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOM affects drinking water treatment processes around the world, but specific regions face unique treatment challenges due to differences in source water quality and regulatory framework. The travel team represents geographically diverse regions of the United States (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, West, and Southwest regions) that each have important differences in water resources and NOM signatures; therefore, the NOM 6 workshop will provide a means for the six faculty participants and a post-doctoral scholar to build new collaborations with each other and international participants. This workshop brings researchers, consultants, and drinking water utility representatives together and allows for exposure to different NOM challenges and solutions from around the world. Knowledge transfer between biogeochemists and environmental engineers is crucial to advance understanding of NOM and its complexity with water treatment processes, so that emerging drinking water treatment challenges are approached with full utilization of contemporary analytical tools and fundamental understanding.</AbstractNarration>
