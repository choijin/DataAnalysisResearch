<AbstractNarration>Frog species worldwide are experiencing rapid declines and extinction. While habitat loss and disease threaten many species, the processes that have led to some declines are unknown or poorly understood. In order to identify the causes of these declines, and develop effective conservation efforts, a deeper understanding of frog ecology and behavior is necessary. This project will investigate ecological tradeoffs of a unique mating behavior of the Asian grass frog, Fejervarya sakishimensis. By analyzing the tradeoffs of natural selection (from predators) and sexual selection (from mates), this behavior can be understood in the context of the ecological community. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Shizuko Hiryu and Dr. Ikkyu Aihara at Doshisha University in Kyoto City, Japan. The collaboration will allow for access to natural F. sakishimensis populations, as well as recently implemented technology essential for understanding frog behavior on a community level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the tradeoffs between selective pressures imposed within communication networks is key to understanding signal evolution. Animals producing mating signals are faced with a compromise between increased attractiveness to mates at the cost of increased detection by unwanted receivers or ?eavesdroppers? such as predators and parasites. Male frogs produce conspicuous mating signals at high intensities and the function of male advertisement calls has received considerable focus in the scientific literature. In contrast, females rarely vocalize, presumably to prevent the exposure of females to eavesdroppers. In a handful of species, however, females give calls in response to male vocalizations.  It is likely that these calls evolved independently of male vocalizations, but their function remains relatively unknown. This project will investigate the response of different receivers (predators and male frogs) to female reciprocal calls in order to understand the ecological pressures constraining or reinforcing this rare behavior. This EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ General Overview  In this project we investigated the behavioral ecology of Buergeria japonica, a stream breeding tree frog found in the Ryukyu Archipelago and Taiwan. This species exhibits unique mating behaviors including synchronized and unsynchronized acoustic signals, and visual signals in the form of leg stretching and arm waving. These unique behaviors make this species an ideal system to begin addressing deeper questions in the fields of animal behavior and animal communication. The major goal of this project was to understand how tradeoffs between fitness related selective pressures drive the evolution and maintenance of B. japonica signaling behavior. We focused mainly on the behavior of signal synchronization and conducted a series of experiments to test the selective pressures imposed on this behavior by the eavesdropper (predator) community and the acoustic environment. This study was conducted on Iriomote Island of the Okinawa prefecture, Japan, from June 18th to August 1st, 2015.  The experiments included:  -Observing male frog responses to acoustic playbacks of different call types.  -Collection of spatio-temporal data of natural chorus behavior.  -Recording advertisement call synchronization to acoustic playbacks.  -Classification of the eavesdropper (predator) community.  -Classification of the acoustic environment of this system.  Intellectual merit  In breeding aggregations, acoustic signals are subject to high levels of intraspecific interference from competitors. Given that interfering signals are more difficult for potential mates to detect, localize, and discriminate, neighboring males time their signals against one another, alternating signal production to avoid overlap. This signal timing pattern is commonly observed in avian, insect, and anuran choruses. In a few anuran (frogs and toads) species, however, males actively overlap their signals, resulting in a synchronized calling pattern between males. It is unclear what selective pressures lead to the evolution and maintenance of this seemingly non-optimal female attraction strategy. Previous studies have suggested that signal synchronization is an adaptation to reduce predation pressure from eavesdroppers, but empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis has, until now, been lacking. We found that, although calling males in this system can be subject to predation from eavesdropping frog-biting midges (Corethrella spp.) and mosquitoes (Uranotaenia spp.), eavesdroppers did not impose any substantial selective pressure on B. japonica calling behavior. Our results suggest an alternative hypothesis, that call synchronization can be an adaptation to signaling in environments with high levels of abiotic background noise. We propose that by overlapping their signals, signaling animals can increase the signal-to-noise ratio of their signals through constructive interference.    Broader impacts  This research was conducted as a collaborative effort between Dr. Ikkyu Aihara and Dr. Shizuko Hiryu of Doshisha University, and Henry Legett, a graduate student at Purdue University. This collaboration allowed for training in a novel research methods used to study anuran chorus dynamics and chorus structure. Sound-to-light devices ("Firefly") have recently been used to directly assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of a chorus. The Fireflies are designed to emit a light in response to nearby sounds. When dispersed throughout a chorus of frogs, the Fireflies create a visual representation of the calls produced within the chorus. By video recording the lights from the Fireflies, patterns of calling behavior between multiple individuals can be identified. Implementation of this method is a massive step forward in our understanding of how communication works in large social groups of animals. The success of this project has lead to further collaborative research between Henry Legett and Dr. Ikkyu Aihara investigating anuran chorusing behavior.                Last Mod...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
