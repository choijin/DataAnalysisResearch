<AbstractNarration>This research is at the interface of geometry and representation theory. Geometry is the mathematical study of shapes and properties of space, and representation theory uses algebraic techniques to study symmetries. Several research projects in geometry and representation theory that enhance the unity of mathematics by connecting algebraic and geometric ideas will be completed. Among them is a project to use a novel representation-theoretic approach to solve a long-standing conjecture about counting the number of Latin squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the proposed projects are summarized as follows: The first project is to answer of a well-known question of Kostant to describe the decomposition of the tensor product of two irreducible representations of a semisimple Lie algebra with the same highest weight; the second project is to extend the celebrated  Parthasarathy-Ranga Rao-Varadarajan theorem to a new setting; the third project is to find an analog for more general groups of the classical fact about the general linear group that the cup product structure coefficients in the cohomology of Grassmannians coincide with the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for tensor products of representations; and the fourth project is to solve a combinatorial conjecture of Alon and Tarsi counting the number of Latin squares of a certain type.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Out of this 2015 grant proposal, there has been substantial progress on three projects:  (1)  Cup product versus tensor product coefficients: A connection between representation theory of certain (so called Levi) subgroups and the cohomology of  partial flag varieties was obtained. This vastly extends the known classical work in the case of the representations of special linear groups and the cohomology of Grassmannians.  (2) Decomposition of V(rho) \otimes V(rho): Kostant's conjecture on the decomposition of the tensor product of two specific representations was almost proved, therby giving the decomposition of the exterior algebra of  a semisimple Lie algebra. This was done jointly with R. Chirivi and A. Maffei from Italy.   (3) Self-contained book on ``Verlinde formula, its complete proof and consequences": This book is nearly complete and final touches are being given before submitting it.   The other two projects Analog of the PRV conjecture for the fusion product and Proof of Alon-Tarsi conjecture on Latin squares have made only modest progress.  Apart from these projects,  some important work has been completed on a `positivity' result for the product in the T-equivariant K-theory of flag varieties associated to Kac-Moody groups (which is a certain class of infinite dimensional groups). Part of this work was done jointly with my student Seth Baldwin.     (a) I have given invited research talks in 12 national and international conferences since 2015.   (b) I have given 3 mini-courses on different topics since 2015 in Lyon (France), Mumbai (India) and Bad Honnef (Germany).   (c) One student Seth Baldwin completed his Ph.D. degree under my supervision in April 2018 and one other student Sean Rogers is finishing his Ph.D. degree later this summer.    (d) I spent a month at the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Sweden as a Visiting Professor during April-May 2015; and a semester at the University of Sydney (Australia) as a Visiting Professor during Fall 2015.  (e) Since 2015 I have coorganized three conferences  in Athens (Georgia), Nashville (Tennessee) and Cambridge (Massachusetts).  (f) I have served as an editor of two International Journals and also as an editor of a Birkhauser book series.
