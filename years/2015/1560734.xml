<AbstractNarration>Approximately 1 in 5 people who are hospitalized receive a urinary catheter. In the US alone, there are over 30 million urinary catheters used annually, and they are the #1 source of hospital-associated infections. Not only are these infections painful for the patient, the infections are not covered by insurance and are expensive for the hospital to remedy. Furthermore, the necessity to treat these infections has contributed to the rise of antibiotic-resistant organisms. The proposed ground-breaking, antifouling catheter  technology is a new approach to battle infections that on-demand "squeezes" out bacteria that grow inside of the catheter (without   affecting the external dimensions of the catheter or patient comfort). This mechanical approach is new, avoids the pitfalls of ineffective previously attempted chemical and biologic approaches, and is poised to revolutionize the long-stagnant catheter market. The technology takes advantage of current materials and manufacturing capabilities, which is important since urinary catheters are typically a low-cost, high-volume product. Overall, demonstrating that this new antifouling catheter is clinically effective would reduce the total cost of home care and be a "big win" for acute care of patients, clinicians, hospitals, long-term care facilities and insurance agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the United States, approximately $15 billion are spent annually tomanage and remove biofilms. While the antifouling approach in this project has general utility, the proposed specific application, an antifouling urinary catheter, represents a particularly important problem to address. This I-Corps team has developed an anti-biofilm technology that uses inflating elastic chambers (like those of soft robotic machines) in the walls of the catheter to selectively generate surface deformation on the inner (urine-carrying) lumen of the catheter to remove biofilms and thereby reduce infection. The team plans to develop clinical feasibility data using silicone-based multi-lumen antifouling catheter prototypes in a pilot study (funded by the Duke Coulter Translational Program) to establish the efficacy of our catheter technology, enhance the value of the related IP, and advance towards commercialization. The team has already generated compelling proof-of-concept in vitro data demonstrating that to-scale silicone catheter shafts remove almost all of a model mixed-bacterial community biofilm from the interior surface of the catheter. This team has also received intense interest from catheterized patients as well as from catheter manufacturers. During the I-Corps program, customer interviews will allow a better market understanding of defining advantages, high impact areas (e.g., intensive care vs. long term care), specific catheter type&lt;br/&gt;(suprapubic vs. Foley catheters), and also allow the team to evaluate other potential applications for this platform technology. This project will aid in developing a startup commercialization plan as well as in negotiating with potential licensee catheter manufacturers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are over 30 million urinary catheters used annually in the USA, and they are the #1 source of hospital and health care facility associated infections. The proposed antifouling catheter technology is poised to revolutionize the long-stagnant catheter market by avoiding the pitfalls of recent, but still ineffective, chemical and biologic approaches. The technology utilizes current materials and manufacturing processes to achieve a new catheter design that mechanically removes infectious biofouling from the previously inaccessible interior of the catheter. The utilization of current materials is important from a manufacturing and regulatory standpoint and since urinary catheters are typically a low-cost, high-volume product and are well known to the FDA. Demonstrating that our new catheter prototype is clinically effective, this technology will reduce the total cost of hospital and home care and be a "big win" for both acute and chronic care.  This NSF I-Corps project focused on medical device translation via the creation of a commercialization roadmap.  In order to develop the market understanding and commercialization roadmap, the team embraced the customer-focused I-Corps course based on the methods of Steve Blank (Stanford) to directly understand the customer perspective and desired product features. The team comprised a Principal investigator: Dr. Gabriel Lopez, Professor at Duke University and Vice Provost of Research at University of New Mexico that had originally developed the antifouling technology; an entrepreneurial lead, Dr. Vrad Levering, the graduate student that developed the antifouling catheter technology for his PhD research with Dr. Lopez; and an industrial mentor, Dr. Wayne Beyer, a longtime collaborator and experienced engineer in medical device commercialization.   The team coordinated and conducted over 106 interviews of "customers" throughout the catheter supply chain; including clinicians, nurses, patients, purchasing agents, distributors, manufacturers, prototypers, hospital CEOs, large teaching hospital representatives, small regional hospital representatives, infection control staff, catheter engineers, professors, and thought leaders in the field.  In addition to developing a thorough knowledge of the variety of reimbursement and cost constraints, we honed in on our target market opportunity and market fit.   Our product market fit is that there is an unmet need for reducing infection in chronic (&gt;7 day) indwelling catheter patients.  Our urinary catheter removes biofilm to reduce the number of change-outs (which patients and nurses like), reduces infection rate by 20-50% (which infection control nurses like because it saves the hospital direct costs on treating CAUTIs), improves public perception of hospital, and improves CMS refunds by up to 2%/yr.  It would also save 2-3 hospital visits/year for "frequent flyer" patients with chronic indwelling catheters.  The antifouling urinary catheter could therefore target a market of &gt;$95M while helping a community of patients struggling with the seemingly intractable problem of recurring infections and potentially significantly reduce the $500 million spent every year on managing CAUTIs.  The team is moving forward with the antifouling urinary catheter technology development.  Additionally, this project can facilitate the adoption of the antifouling technology in a host of other medical devices that suffer from biofilm-related infections, such as central venous catheters and dialysis shunts, where the consequences of an infection are severe.
