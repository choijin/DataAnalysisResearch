<AbstractNarration>Electronic circuits degrade during operation. Eventually, the degradation is so large that it causes the circuits to no longer function properly. Customers of electronic devices expect a 10 year lifetime. Manufacturers currently check lifetime using manufactured samples of prototype circuits.  Failures of lifetime tests are very costly and entail additional re-design engineering costs and the cost of re-fabrication (hundreds of thousands of dollars). This project will develop software to estimate the lifetime of electronic devices. The toolset that will be developed will check if a design can meet lifetime requirements prior to the manufacturing of prototypes and will provide guidance on the components of a design that need to be fixed so as to improve the lifetime of the full system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop software to enable semiconductor design companies to improve the lifetime of their products and to detect the components of a design that can limit the products' lifetime. This will be done with simulation tools that estimate the lifetime distributions of circuits while taking into account a wide variety of wearout mechanisms and operating conditions. The software will compute activity and temperature profiles of full systems. These are linked to the physical layout and transistor models to compute feature/transistor-level wearout statistics. The feature/transistor-level wearout statistics are combined to identify vulnerable blocks/components and to estimate the lifetime distribution of the full electronic system. The team will conduct customer dicovery to gain further insights further insights into the problem and to validate the proposed hypotheses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ RelMaster aims to develop lifetime simulation tools for semiconductor design companies.  The simulation tools will (a) predict product lifetime distributions, (b) identify vulnerable blocks and limitng wearout mechanisms, and (c) suggest fixes for circuit lifetime problems.  RelMaster is based on 15 years of research at Georgia Tech by Dr. Linda Milor and her team.  The Icorps grant enabled Dr. Milor and her team to conduct 100 industrial interviews in preparation for company formation and a potential SBIR application.   The RelMaster project was received well in industry.  A Senior Director of Product Marketing at Global Foundries told us that "If you have a qualification failure, then you never want it to happen again."  We also heard that one company lost 100 million dollars due to a one year delay in time-to-market because of not understanding bias temperature instability.  A Senior VP told us that "I have far too many experiences of qual failure.  My worst experience was with a Vth shift that interacted with PVT, creating a race condition in the logic and causing the chip to fail.  It took a long time (2500 hours HTOL) to show up."  This failure caused a product delay of 1.5 years.  A Technical Director at another company told us that his design manager got called up by the president of the company after a qual failure, who said," I am going to lose my job."
