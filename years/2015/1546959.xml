<AbstractNarration>Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program (I-Corps L), this project will develop ways to increase the scale and impact of a professional development model to transform middle grades science teaching and learning. Our nation's middle grades science teachers, the portal to science engagement and success in high school and beyond, are overwhelmingly under prepared to meet certification requirements and public expectations for student performance in science. Many middle grades science teachers complete a college degree in a field other than science or science education. This transformative, classroom-focused, field-tested professional learning program has the potential to simultaneously bolster middle grades science teachers? disciplinary content knowledge and teaching skills. This I-Corps L team project addresses the pressing national need for stronger middle grades science teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U-FUTuRES 2.0 model (University of Florida Unites Teachers to Reform Education in Science v.2) will be expanded from the current model of district, school, and classroom reform to respond to the pressing national need for improved science teaching.  Current coursework developed through a collaborative effort between science educators and partnering scientists at the University of Florida, will deepen middle grades science teachers' content knowledge and transform their classroom approach to an inquiry-based, learning-goals-driven, highly engaging and challenging science learning experience for all their students.  Incorporated in this innovation will be strategies for establishing a partnership with school and district leaders striving to support both the development and broader impact of their science teacher leaders in their schools and districts.  It is expected that the proposed innovation in professional learning and leadership development will result in increasing teachers' knowledge of disciplinary core science concepts, science and engineering practices and cross-cutting concepts, transformed teaching practice, and improved student engagement and learning outcomes.  The project goal is to prepare middle grades students for success in rigorous high school science courses, the gateway to STEM educational opportunities and careers.</AbstractNarration>
