<AbstractNarration>Fractured-rock aquifers are an important water resource. Complex fracture distributions in most rocks make it difficult to characterize and understand groundwater flow in them.  Cost-effective methods are needed to ensure sound decisions in groundwater management.  Methods using well water levels and cross-hole tests to identify groundwater flow pathways are useful, but the resolution of maps based on these data alone depends on the number of wells, which is commonly inadequate due to financial and time constraints.  In these cases, it is necessary to rely on additional data, particularly seismic velocities, to improve the mapping of subsurface flow pathways.  This research will be the first systematic experimental study of the flow properties in well-characterized 3D fracture networks that will relate changes in seismic velocity to changes in permeability.  This proposal builds on more than a decade of work using ice as a model for rock, which has shown that the basic processes controlling brittle failure of rocks and ice are similar.  However, ice has distinct experimental advantages over rock.  The proposed experiments and model development offer the opportunity to gain insights into the elastic properties and permeabilities of a broad range of fractured, crystalline natural (i.e., rocks) and synthetic materials.  Thus, this research has applicability to many disciplines in materials science, engineering, and the geosciences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identifying narrow, continuous high conductivity zones in fractured rock is a pressing challenge in hydrogeology. Hydraulic tomography (the inverse modelling of multiple cross-hole well tests) has shown increasing promise for this task, but the resolution of hydraulic tomography is sensitive to the number of boreholes and cross-hole tests, which are commonly too few.  In these cases it is necessary to rely on additional data types, particularly geophysical surveys, to improve the resolution of the hydrogeological characterization. Combining hydraulic and geophysical data is most effective when the form of the relationship that links geophysical and hydrogeological parameters, particularly the relationship between seismic velocities and permeability, is known. Both permeability and seismic velocity depend on fracture density. This research examines these relationships to link seismic velocity to permeability.  Specifically, using ice as a model material, this will be the first systematic experimental study of the flow properties of well-characterized 3D fracture networks designed to elucidate the relationship between changes in seismic velocity and changes in permeability in fractured geologic media. Despite the importance of fracture-induced changes in elastic properties and permeability, there are few systematic observations of the co-evolution of these properties during brittle deformation.  Such data are critical for refining constitutive models linking hydrogeologic and geophysical parameters. The proposed research is a combination of laboratory measurements and mechanistic model development that serves as a necessary precursor to field applications designed to obtain spatially dense information about permeability that will improve the quantitative characterization of groundwater flow and transport.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Fractured aquifers comprise ~65% of the principal aquifers in the United States. The management of fractured aquifers necessitates fracture flow and transport models that accurately capture the geometric and hydraulic properties of crack networks. Currently, there is no method that can determine 3D fracture network connectivity and property distributions.  Hence management of fractured rock aquifers relies on many assumptions concerning the flow and transport properties of crack networks. This project addressed two important questions regarding the flow properties of crack networks.  First, how much cracking is required for the creation of connected flow pathways, i.e., for the network to "percolate" or become permeable.  And second, once permeable, how does the permeability of the network evolve with increasing deformation. Regarding how much cracking is required for the creation of a connected flow pathway, we found it depends on how quickly the cracks are created, i.e., the strain rate.  At lower strain rates, the strain at percolation increases with sample size and percolation occurs at crack densities significantly below that at which percolation occurs in random crack networks.  However, at higher strain rates the strain at percolation is scale invariant and the crack density percolation threshold is similar to that of random crack networks.  In these higher-strain rate cases, the predictions of existing effective medium theories for effective elastics properties and the onset of percolation agree well with our experimental observations. Regarding the second question, in general, with increasing deformation fractured rock permeability can increase either by the growth/lengthening of the cracks that creates more pathways for flow or by the increase in the opening/widening of the existing cracks that allows for greater flow along existing pathways. Using ice as a model for rock, we found that once a pathway for flow is created, with additional deformation, crack growth mostly ceases even while permeability increases, indicating that after the onset of percolation the increase in permeability is primarily due to the opening of existing cracks.  After the onset of percolation, limited crack initiation and growth inhibits the formation of a pervasive crack network. While the primary focus of this project was on the properties of crack networks, we opportunistically were able to investigate the elastic properties of another type of "damaged" ice, that due to the addition of silica impurities.  Silica ice is common both on the surface of Earth (as glacial ice incorporates dust and other debris) and on many icy bodies such as our moon, Mars, and the icy satellites of Jovian planets, comets, and Edgeworth-Kuiper-belt objects.  Like cracks, silica alters ("damages") the structure of ice, impacting its physical properties such as elastic constants.  The objective of this study was to determine whether theories for the physical properties of ice damaged by cracks can be applied to ice damaged by impurities.  We found that with increasing silica content both the stiffness and resistance to cracking increased.  We also found that existing theories for the strain rate at which deformation transitions from brittle to ductile slightly under-predicted the experimentally observed transitional strain rate in silica ice, likely due to uncertainty in the sensitivity of changes in the rate of deformation of the silica ice to changes in the applied stress.
