<AbstractNarration>The goal of this activity is to understand the structure of complexity classes.  Complexity classes provide the best tool currently available for understanding the computational complexity of real-world computational problems.  Some of these problems are notoriously difficult, but recent progress justifies some optimism that additional useful insight about these complexity classes can be obtained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) is a well-known example of an apparently-intractable problem in NP that is not widely believed to be NP-complete.  Until now, all of the evidence that has been gathered -- trying to indicate that MCSP is hard to compute -- has followed the same path, invoking the connections between derandomization techniques and cryptographically-secure one-way functions.  This proposal will focus on developing a direct approach to reduce seemingly-hard problems to MCSP, and thereby set the stage for a more thorough understanding of the complexity of MCSP.  The research results will be broadly disseminated, both through journal publications as well as through survey articles in various venues. The long-term goals of research in computational complexity, if finally achieved, will have profound impact on society (for instance, by providing firm mathematical underpinnings to public-key cryptography, which currently rests upon many unproven conjectures).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research grant was short-duration highly-focused project, centered on the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP).  This problem has been the subject of intense study over the past half-century, but only recently has its complexity become somewhat better understood.  MCSP is widely believed to be an "NP-Intermediate" problem.  This means, it is believed that MCSP cannot be solved by any deterministic algorithm that runs in polynomial time, but it is also believed that it is not expressive enough to solve any of the well-known "NP-complete" problems, such as SAT, 3-colorability, etc.  MCSP has often been studied in conjunction with algorithmic information theory; in particular, there is a problem known as MKTP that shares many properties with MCSP.  The input to MKTP is a string x, and a number i, andthe question to be answered is: Does x contain at least i bits of information,using the "KT" measure of time-bounded information complexity.  The research supported by this award successfully developed new tools for proving intractability of MKTP, and also provided new connections between MKTP and MCSP.  These new insights are relevant for applications in cryptography and derandomization, and also shed light on fundamental questions in computability theory.  Twelve publications currently acknowledge the support of this grant.  The award provided research support and training for a graduate student,Erick Chastain, who completed his dissertation with support from the grant.
