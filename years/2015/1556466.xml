<AbstractNarration>Climate change affects the geographic distribution of populations and species and can result in increased opportunities for hybridization between previously isolated populations.  Hybridization can have a range of outcomes.  Most frequently, hybridization results in loss of fitness (hybrid breakdown), effectively reducing interbreeding and promoting the formation of new species. Occasionally, however, novel combinations of genes yield ecological advantages to hybrids, including adaptation to new ecological niches.  What attributes of parental populations predict the outcome of hybridization? Answering this question is the focus of this project, and will provide new insights into the effects of climate and ecological changes on adaptation rates and species formation. The researchers also will engage in novel public informal education at the Birch Aquarium and in hands-on experiences in marine biology for 5th grade students in underserved San Diego neighborhoods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Predicting hybridization outcomes requires an understanding of the molecular basis of hybrid phenotypes. This project will conduct genomic analyses of hybrids produced by crosses between divergent populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus.  Previous work has shown that energy production by mitochondria is frequently disrupted in hybrids.  Whole genome sequencing will be used to determine genetic differences between groups of hybrid copepods with normal versus disrupted mitochondrial performance; differentiation between the groups will identify candidate genes that are potentially responsible for hybrid breakdown. Results will address: a) Does hybridization result in widespread incompatibilities across the genome, or can targeted genes be identified? b) Are the same genomic regions responsible for hybrid breakdown in different interpopulation crosses?  A similar approach will be used to examine the genomic basis of improved hybrid thermal tolerance.  What genetic interactions allow some hybrids to survive temperatures that are lethal to both parental populations?  Is hybrid performance predictable from genetic or ecological differences between parental populations?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When a population becomes geographically isolated from the rest of its species, it may genetically diverge and ultimately become a new, reproductively isolated species.  In an early stage of this speciation process, hybrids between populations often show highly variable fitness, with some individuals showing fertility, survivorship and stress tolerances similar to the original parents, while others show higher or (more commonly) lower fitness.  Here our goal was to obtain a better understanding of hybrid fitness by examining both physiological traits of hybrids and their genetic composition (since each hybrid possesses a unique mix of the parental nuclear genomes and its mother's mitochondrial genome).  Studies focused on the copepod Tigriopus californicus which lives in pools on isolated rocky outcrops along the Pacific coast of North America.  Previous work on this species has found that fitness is frequently related to the performance of mitochondria, the intracellular organelles that synthesize most of the cell's energy in the form of ATP.  In this project, different T. californicus populations were hybridized in the lab and the resulting offspring were scored for various measures of fitness and then genotyped to assess the types of genomic interactions responsible for variable hybrid fitness.  The primary findings of these experiments were: 1) that hybrids with high fitness (measured by rate of development or survivorship) showed higher rates of ATP synthesis in isolated mitochondria, and 2) the genotypes of the high fitness hybrids showed a bias toward elevated frequencies of alleles at nuclear genes that were derived from the same population as the mitochondrial genome; when the mitochondria came from population 1, nuclear alleles from population 1 were favored over substantial portions of the genome (several chromosomes). These results strongly support the hypothesis that mitochondrial function is a consequence of the match between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes as is predicted by the intimate interactions between specific genes that form the ATP synthesizing machinery in the mitochondria.  Because essentially all eukaryotic cells share this mosaic nature of energy production (i.e., encoded in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes), the demonstration that optimal function requires a matched set of genes has important implications across biology, ranging from conservation and evolutionary biology to human mitochondrial medicine.  In addition to its broader impacts for biology, the project has also contributed in the area of public scientific literacy.  Specific outreach projects have included 3 years of partnership with the Ocean Discovery Institute in providing a hands-on DNA barcoding exercise for 5th grade students (approximately 800 students annually) in underserved San Diego public schools, creation of a new exhibit at the Birch Aquarium at Scripps (which has over 400,000 visitors annually) describing how work on copepods informs general principles of response to ocean warming, and a public lecture on the biology of ocean warming to an audience of ~200 people at the Birch Aquarium; the latter is now available on YouTube where it has received over 19,000 views.
