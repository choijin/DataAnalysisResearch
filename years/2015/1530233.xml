<AbstractNarration>Salt marshes provide numerous ecosystem services including shoreline protection, nutrient cycling, pollutant filtration, nurseries for fish and crustaceans, food production, recreation, and carbon sequestration. Coastal wetlands have been degraded and lost because of changes to upland and coastal environments, and future sea-level rise threatens to exacerbate these trends. This project will advance scientific understanding of the mechanisms that influence marsh formation, persistence, and degradation, which is essential to forecasting future wetland change. The project aims to develop a new way to analyze the vulnerability of marshes that will be relevant to decision-making. Through a student-organized symposium, the work will be communicated directly to policy-makers and practitioners of marsh conservation and restoration. This project will advance science teaching and education both through training the next generation of university students and working with youth in local high schools.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Coastal wetlands are complex biogeomorphic systems that provide important ecosystem services, but our current understanding of salt marsh evolution and projections of future changes are based on models and empirical studies of limited spatial and temporal extent. In this project, the team asks "what determines the present, continental-scale extent and distribution of coastal marshes"? They hypothesize that marsh distributions reflect interactions across a wide range of spatial scales, including local biogeomorphic feedbacks, estuarine-scale morphology that governs sediment gradients and wave energy, and past and present watershed processes that influence sediment and water flux. The team proposes an integrated theoretical and empirical approach that takes advantage of continental-scale variation in watershed and estuarine characteristics to understand (1) when, where, and how salt marshes have established, and (2) how marsh distributions respond to sea-level rise, altered suspended sediment concentrations, and other environmental changes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Coastal marshes provide important ecosystem services, and are threatened by local and global environmental changes including land use, river impoundment, and sea level rise.  To better understand how marshes respond to these drivers, this project sought to understand why some coastal areas support extensive marshes, while others are dominated by open water habitats.  We tested the hypothesis that marsh abundance is jointly determined by local processes occurring within marshes (specifically by feedbacks between marsh abundance and the strength of waves that erode their edges) and by broader-scale drivers such as the shape of the coastline and the presence and size of major rivers.  By examining the extent of marshes in coastlines all along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, we supported both elements of this hypothesis.  When examined at fine scales, marsh distributions are bi-modal, meaning that marshes are either dominant or scarce within any individual area.  This is the pattern we would expect if feedbacks favored these two extremes over the intermediate case of moderate marsh extent.  However, when examined at coarser scales of 100s of km, marsh abundance was best correlated with factors such as water depth, coastline roughness, and river inflows.  Together these findings suggest that the dominant drivers of marsh extent vary with scale.  We also developed a new model of marsh establishment and persistence, which supported our interpretation of these empirical findings.  Specifically, we showed that marsh growth and marsh collapse under sea level rise depend strongly on t the size of the estuary, and the influence of rivers on suspended sediment concentrations. The response of marshes to these environmental conditions reflects both the erosion of marshes at their edges as well as the accumulation and erosion of adjacent mudflats.  This work is important for our understanding of coastal ecosystems to sea level rise and human alterations of watersheds, as well as to our understanding of tipping points and resilience of ecosystems to changing environmental conditions.  To promote more effective management of coastal systems, we organized a symposium on coastal wetland resilience.  To promote broader public understanding of these issues, we developed lesson plans for secondary school students, and discussed the results of our work in local and regional media.
