<AbstractNarration>Legged robots have captured the imagination of society at large, through&lt;br/&gt;entertainment and through the dissemination of research findings.  Yet,&lt;br/&gt;today's reality of what (bipedal) legged robots can do falls short of&lt;br/&gt;society's vision.  A big part of the reason is that legged robots are&lt;br/&gt;viewed as surrogates for humans, able to go wherever humans can as aids&lt;br/&gt;or as assistants where it might also be too dangerous or risky.  It is&lt;br/&gt;in the expectation of robustness and walking facility that today's&lt;br/&gt;research hits its limits, especially when the terrain has granular&lt;br/&gt;properties.  Impeding progress is the lack of a holistic approach to the&lt;br/&gt;cyber-physical modeling and control of legged robots.  The vision of&lt;br/&gt;this work is to unite experts in granular mechanics, optimal control,&lt;br/&gt;and learning theory in order to define a methodology for advancing&lt;br/&gt;cyber-physical systems (CPS) involving a tight coupling of the physical with&lt;br/&gt;the cyber through dynamic interactions that must be learned online.  The&lt;br/&gt;proposed work will advance the science of cyber-physical systems by more&lt;br/&gt;explicitly tying sensing, perception, and computing to the optimization&lt;br/&gt;and control of physical systems whose properties are variable and&lt;br/&gt;uncertain.  Achieving reliable, adaptive legged locomotion over terrain&lt;br/&gt;with arbitrary granular properties would transform several application&lt;br/&gt;domain areas of robotics; e.g., disaster response, agricultural and&lt;br/&gt;industrial robotics, and planetary robotics.  More broadly, the same&lt;br/&gt;tools would apply to related CPS with regards to terrain aware&lt;br/&gt;exoskeleton and rehabilitation prosthetics for persons with missing,&lt;br/&gt;non-functional, or injured legs, as well as to energy networks with&lt;br/&gt;time-varying, nonlinear dynamics models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CPS platform to be studied is that of a bipedal robot locomoting&lt;br/&gt;over granular ground material with uncertain physical properties (sand,&lt;br/&gt;gravel, dirt, etc.).  The proposed work seeks to overcome current&lt;br/&gt;impediments to reliable legged locomotion over uncertain terrain type,&lt;br/&gt;which fundamentally relies on the controlled interaction of the robot's&lt;br/&gt;feet with the physical environment.  The research goal is to improve the&lt;br/&gt;perception and control of legged locomotion over granular media for the&lt;br/&gt;express purpose of achieving robust, adaptive, terrain-aware locomotion.&lt;br/&gt;It revolves around the hypothesis that simple models with decent&lt;br/&gt;predictive performance and low computational overhead are sufficient for&lt;br/&gt;the optimal control formulations as the compute-constrained adaptive&lt;br/&gt;subsystem will both learn and classify the peculiarities of the terrain&lt;br/&gt;online.  The main research objectives will involve: [1] a validated&lt;br/&gt;co-simulation platform for legged robot movement over granular media;&lt;br/&gt;[2] terrain-dependent, stable gait generation and gait transition&lt;br/&gt;strategies via optimal control; [3] online, compute-constrained learning&lt;br/&gt;of granular interactions for adaptation and terrain classification; and&lt;br/&gt;[4] validated contributions using experimental testbeds involving&lt;br/&gt;variable and unknown (to the robot) granular media.  Given the high&lt;br/&gt;value of the robotic platforms and the research with regards to outreach&lt;br/&gt;and participation, they will be used as outreach tools and to create new&lt;br/&gt;educational modules for promotion of STEM fields.  Further, the&lt;br/&gt;multi-disciplinary nature of the work will be highlighted in order to&lt;br/&gt;emphasize its importance.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
