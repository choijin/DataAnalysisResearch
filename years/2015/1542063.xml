<AbstractNarration>PI: Chen, Yu &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:1542063 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to develop advanced methods for characterizing an important category of minimally-invasive diagnostic medical devices. It aims to develop 3D-printed biomimetic phantoms for the performance testing of near-infrared spectroscopy systems (NIRS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minimally-invasive technologies constitute a major thrust in the modern medical device universe. Rigorously characterized phantoms are essential for the design and evaluation of advanced medical imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MRI). To date no well-established phantom-based test methods exist for evaluating such key technology areas as NIRS oximetry devices or hematoma detection systems. This proposal would clear the way for efficient development and regulatory approval of this highly promising diagnostic technology. Plans are presented for educational, mentoring, and outreach activities to advance the proposed cross-disciplinary research program.</AbstractNarration>
