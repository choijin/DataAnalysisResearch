<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to understand the coupled laser and ultrasound-material interactions in a novel ultrasound-assisted, water-confined laser micromachining process, which combines laser machining with in-situ ultrasound in water. The approach includes physics-based modeling of the coupled laser and ultrasound-material interaction, time-resolved observation of the machining process, and characterization of the machined workpiece microstructures and mechanical properties. The educational objective of this project is to integrate the research in micro manufacturing with education, community outreach and minority student involvement. The approach includes curriculum development by incorporating research results, graduate students mentoring, undergraduate and minority high school student involvement through a project class and an academy program, interfacing with local schools and museum, and teaching skill improvement.          &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will provide an improved understanding of the coupled laser and ultrasound material interactions in the ultrasound-assisted water-confined laser micromachining process, which can potentially avoid or greatly reduce current micromachining defects. This can lead to better product quality, increase the manufacturing efficiency, and reduced cost. This will have a broad impact on medical, electronics, automotive and many other areas, which have a rapidly growing need for micromachining.  The educational activities will improve education in the manufacturing area, strengthen the university's connections with local communities, enhance the public awareness to laser technologies, and attract more high school and minority students to the university science and engineering programs.  Research results dissemination can be effectively realized through journal and conference publications, and the interactions with industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcome Report  This project involves the study of a novel ultrasound-assisted water-confined laser micromachining (UWLM) process proposed by the PI.  In UWLM, a laser beam is delivered to the workpiece surface region immersed in water to remove materials from the workpiece, and during UWLM in-situ ultrasonic waves in water are also applied to generate beneficial effects to the machining process.  If an ultrasonic horn or a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer is used to generate the ultrasonic waves in water, the process can be called a horn-based or a HIFU-based UWLM process, respectively.     Intellectual Merit  This project has improved the understanding of some physical processes relevant to the UWLM process that involves laser and ultrasound &ndash; material interactions in water.   Relevant experimental and computational modeling work has been performed. The experimental studies include both in-situ time-resolved observation of the UWLM process and post-process workpiece characterizations. Under the investigated conditions, it has been found that utilizing similar nanosecond laser pulses from a laser, the UWLM process can produce better quality (that is, less debris deposition) than laser micromachining (ablation) in air, and much higher efficiency (referring to larger average ablation depth per pulse) than laser ablation in water without ultrasound applied. The "debris" here includes all the workpiece material that has gone through a phase-change and displacement process and eventually stayed onto (and hence changed the morphology of) the workpiece.  Under the investigated conditions, for microhole drilling on several different metals, the UWLM process can produce average ablation depths per pulse that are several times the depths by laser ablation in water without ultrasound. For micro-groove machining on titanium, the UWLM process can produce an average ablation depth per pulse that is much larger than laser ablation in water without ultrasound. The UWLM-produced micro-groove also has much less debris deposition than that produced by laser ablation in air.       The in-situ time-resolved imaging observation shows that one important underlying mechanism for the ablation rate enhancement in UWLM should be that: the in-situ cleaning effect induced by the ultrasonic waves in water can help reduce the material cloud induced by the ablation of a laser pulse that still lingers around the ablation site after the pulse. This may enhance the coupling of the next laser pulse?s energy with the workpiece surface, and hence increase the average ablation rate per pulse. This is also consistent with the measurement of the laser-induced pressure in water at a certain location near the ablation site, which is higher for UWLM than laser ablation in water without ultrasound.   To produce good machining results using HIFU-based UWLM, typically the ultrasound pulse following the corresponding laser pulse should be sufficiently intense and also end sufficiently early before the next laser pulse comes. The in-situ cleaning effect of the ultrasound can be sufficiently effective to permit HIFU-based UWLM to operate at a high laser pulse frequency of ~1 kHz.  Relevant computational modeling work shows that an ultrasonic horn or HIFU transducer, by generating sufficiently intense ultrasonic waves, can induce water cavitation, fluid flow and reasonably high pressures, which are expected to be responsible for the in-situ cleaning effect in UWLM if the horn or HIFU transducer is used in UWLM.  Computational modeling of bubble evolutions in water shows that the evolutions may locally generate high pressure, fluid velocity and temperature (within the bubble).         Broader Impacts   This study suggests that the UWLM process has a great potential to be a micromachining technology superior to the conventional laser micromachining process in air or in water without ultrasound.  This could potentially benefit many areas that need micromachining, such as the manufacturing of micro medical devices and the surface texturing of mechanical parts to enhance their tribological properties.  The gained understanding may also benefit other technologies that involve laser and/or ultrasound &ndash; material interactions (particularly interactions in water).

Some contents related to this project were incorporated into some classes the PI taught.  Due to space limit, only some critical information since the project?s beginning in May 2011 has been included in this report.
