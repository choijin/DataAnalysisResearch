<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Theresa Anderson is "New Techniques for Bounds in Harmonic Analysis." The host institution for the fellowship is University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Andreas Seeger.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the period of this award, the PI has investigated problems in both harmonic analysis and at the interface of anlaysis and analytic number theory, the latter being a new researh direction that she greatly expanded.  In particular, by thinking about her thesis in a broader context, she was able to extend the work of her thesis in new directions, expanding the knowledge of the structure of spaces of homogeneous type, which are extensions of Euclidean space that have a notion of doubling.  By studying under Dr. Andreas Seeger and learning from the harmonic anlaysis group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, she deepened her understanding of new Fourier analytic tools and was able to apply these to a variety of problems.   By connecting with number theorists, expanding the background that she had alrready obtained in umber theroy, she was able to solve serveral problems at the interface of anlaysis and number theory, including finding bounds for discrete versions of operators arising in harmonic analysis by using new number theoretic tools that she developped (since the continuous tools are not avaiable) that in many ways are sharp, and answering several distributional questions.  A hilight of her research includes showing that in a both a qualitative and a quantitative way, prime vectors are uniformly distributed on spheres as the radius of the spheres increases.   In terms of broader impacts, she planned the oragnization of a summer research school in analysis for undergraduates, where she would lead a team of three undergraduates, with a graduate student assistant,  to pursue research mathematics, and would result in a submitted paper.  She also planned a special Colloquium for Dr. Jill Pipher, including several events designed to hilight the achievements of female mathematicians and increase partipatin of underrepresented groups, such as a question and answer session.  She did K-12 outreach at numerous events, and spoke about her reasearch to a wide variety of audiences, including interdisciplinary and graduate.
