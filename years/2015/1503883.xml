<AbstractNarration>This research project concerns the analysis of the patterns that emerge when a simple geometric construction is repeated indefinitely. An example of a geometric problem having to do with the arrangement of shapes in space is: If one (endlessly) glues together equilateral triangles so that 7 triangles go around each vertex, is it possible to embed the resulting surface in 3-dimensional space?  An example of a problem having to do with geometric shapes in the plane is to determine the possible shapes swept out by the path of a frictionless ball as it rolls (endlessly) around the inside of a polygonal table and bounces off the sides. Such processes occur both in nature and in a purely abstract mathematical context, and often produce mysterious, intricate, and beautiful patterns. These processes have connections to number theory, geometry, and physics. This research project studies these processes via numerical simulation to generate hypotheses that are subsequently confirmed or disproved via rigorous mathematical justification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speaking more technically, the principal investigator will continue investigations into geometric dynamics, concentrating on polytope exchange transformations and outer billiards. One common theme in this work is the construction of higher dimensional compactifications of non-compact low-dimensional dynamical systems. Another common theme is the appearance of renormalization phenomena. In the situation of interest, one has a fiber bundle where the base space is the parameter space and each fiber is a polytope exchange transformation based on the parameter it lies over. The goal is then to find an auxiliary transformation of the base space which relates the dynamics at the fiber over one point to the dynamics of the fiber over the image of the point under the transformation. For instance, this seems to happen when one studies the symbolic dynamics of a process, and this project aims to find a general theory for this. The principal investigator will also study a number of geometric iterations, such as the pentagram map, a projectively natural map on the space of polygons that is related to integrable systems and cluster algebras. Finally, the principal investigator plans to attack a number of longstanding unsolved problems in geometry, such as the square peg conjecture.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the period of this award I continued to study various  problems in geometry and dynamical systems.  I made  progress in three main directions.  I will talk about  each of these in turn.        First, I considered the combinatorial properties of outer  billiards on polygons,. Outer billiards is a game similar to ordinary  billiards, except that the ball travels around the outside  the polygonal table, glancing off the corners according to  the following rule.  A person walking from the current location  of the ball to the next location would move on a line  segment, keeping the table to the right,  so that a corner of  the table lies at the exact center of the line segment.  When one moves from position to position, generally  circulating around the table clockwise, one  records the sequence of corners encountered.  For my first project I construced a kind of model which  predicts which vertices are encountered, depending on  the shape of the polygon and the starting point, when the  polygon is a quadrilateral.   My model reveals a kind  of fractal nature to the sequences, depending on the  number theory associated to the coordinates of the  polygon vertices.     Second, I considered how five particles will arrange themselves  on the sphere so as to minimize their total potential energy  when it is computed with respect to a power law.  Some  experimental work done about 40 years ago  by Melnyk  Knopf and Smith suggested that when the exponent of  the power law is less than about 15.05, the answer should  be the triangular bi-pyramid and then the answer changes  to a pyramid-with-square base for larger power law exponents.  This phenomenon is a simple example of a phase change  in physics or chemistry.   Through a combination of  theoretical arguments and computer assisted proof, I  rigorously established the existence of this phase change.     Third, I studied problems related to the famous Toeplitz  square peg conjecture, which asserts that one can always  find 4 points contained in any continuous loop in the plane  which make the vertices of a square.  Such a square would  be called an inscribed square.  Relatedly,  a rectangle inscribed  in a continuous loop would be a collection of four points in  the loop which make the vertices of the rectangle. I proved that, for  any continuous loop in the plane, all but at most 4 points  are vertices of an inscribed rectangle.  This result does  not solve the square peg conjecture, but it shows that  inscribed rectangles are very common in continuous loops.
