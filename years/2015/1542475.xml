<AbstractNarration>The worsening water crisis in California comes at a time when engineers are ill prepared to design and build civil infrastructure responsive to the challenges that lie ahead. In this Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site at the University of California-Irvine (UCI), community college engineering teachers will be immersed in a multi-disciplinary research experience to identify and mitigate (through engineering design) human health concerns associated with capturing, treating, and reusing dry and wet weather urban runoff. This RET Site will: (1) contribute to the development, implementation, and monitoring of green technology for treating and reusing urban runoff; (2) forge new alliances between units within UCI (Engineering, Social Ecology, Undergraduate Education), and between UCI and local community colleges and government agencies; (3) catalyze educational innovation in community colleges that service students from backgrounds traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields; (4) generate new teaching modules on urban water sustainability that utilize cutting edge pedagogical techniques designed to create excitement about STEM education; and (5) bring UCI graduate students into the community college classroom where they can inspire a new generation of well-rounded engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over three years, 30 community college teachers (Research Opportunities for Community College Teachers (ROCCT) Fellows) will take part in a nine-week summer experience at UCI that integrates hands-on research with team-based curriculum development. ROCCT Fellows will be recruited from four local community colleges (Cypress College, Fullerton College, Irvine Valley College, and Saddleback College) ROCCT Fellows will conduct research in three topic areas: (1) engineering design of natural treatment systems to remove contaminants (particles, pathogens, and nitrogen) from urban runoff; (2) microbiological testing of urban runoff water quality before and after treatment, including culture-based and molecular-based assays; and (3) governance, economic, and attitudinal barriers to the harvest and use of urban runoff for non-potable purposes in the home. These research activities will leverage two major external resources: (1) an NSF Partnership for International Research and Education (PIRE) funded undergraduate boot-camp on urban water sustainability; and (2) equipment and staff at a local field facility run by a government partner (Orange County Watersheds). The ROCCT Fellows will translate their research experience into context-based learning approaches that emphasize learning-by-trying activities and everyday life applications. During one academic quarter (three months) following the summer program, UCI graduate students will team with former ROCCT Fellows to deliver lectures and lead field trips for community college students. The ROCCT Fellows will present their research and curricular innovations at one or more national conferences (American Society of Engineering Education, Frontiers of Engineering Education Conference, and National Science Teachers Association). All aspects of the UCI ROCCT program will undergo formative and summative evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The RET provided an immersive, eight week summer classroom experience on contemporary water science and management, with particular emphasis on the importance of better understanding the impacts of drought, climate change, urbanization, and continued population growth on water supply and quality in California. Classroom experiences were supplemented by a series of field education tours of a major wastewater recycling facility, a stormwater harvesting site, and other key regional water infrastructure. The program also featured hands-on exercises and instructional lessons that led to the production of independent research projects by the teachers. A total of 24 community college and K-12 teachers from schools throughout Orange County, California participated in the program. Most of the teachers were from schools with a significant proportion of students from under-represented groups, providing training opportunities that will yield long-term benefits by enhancing diversity and inclusion in science education.</p> <p>The sixteen community college and eight K-12 teachers were instructed in - and undertook independent research projects on - community centered, low-impact water management solutions. UCI faculty and graduate student instructors - as well as industry officials from local water agencies - provided classroom instruction, provided water management data and information, and afforded individual mentorship for research projects and lesson plan development on a variety of topics of special interest to the teachers.</p> <p>Moreover, a cooperative agreement with the Irvine Ranch Water District, and access to water-related data on supplies and quality provided by the California State Water Resources Control Board, enabled the teachers to infuse their research projects with real-world data on current water conditions, permitting them to undertake projects of both immediate relevance to their communities, as well as long-term scientific value. Access to these agencies' data also facilitates the ongoing development of classroom lesson plans related to the teachers' research interests by permitting them to draw upon these agencies' expertise long after the RET has ended.&nbsp;</p> <p>Examples of projects developed by the teachers included ideas for enabling the implementation of stormwater harvesting for the purposes of replenishing municipal supplies and restoring local ecology; methods for inducing behavioral change with respect to conservation and improved residential water use efficiency, especially for outdoor landscaping; best management practices for groundwater protection (such as ways to alleviate contamination of aquifers); the local significance of the water-food-energy nexus (e.g., how CO2 management and water use efficiency are linked through both water conservation and dietary choices); greywater reuse applications in households; and, how climate change as well as water withdrawals critically affect streamflow throughout the region.</p> <p>Novel pedagogical approaches included having teachers work in small groups where instructional materials which they prepared for use in their classrooms could be critiqued and improved upon - and lesson plans could be refined. In addition, at the end of each summer course, teachers presented their research projects and proposed lesson plans in a conference-style setting where questions were fielded by fellow teachers and by the class instructors.

Second, they gained understanding of&nbsp; social science methods aimed at furthering understanding of various water problems such as: social barriers to conservation and how best to educate citizens on the impacts of urban runoff on stream ecology. Third, the program connected teachers to a network of academics and water professionals that will enable them to better incorporate water science and management problems in their classrooms. Lastly, the teachers have begun infusing their classrooms with knowledge acquired from the program. This is producing benefits on two levels: exposing students from under-represented groups with invaluable, empowering knowledge; and, equipping all their students with sustainability-related skills.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/03/2019<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;Feldman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent"
