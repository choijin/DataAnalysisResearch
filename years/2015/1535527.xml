<AbstractNarration>This grant provides travel funds for U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to attend the 3rd Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) in Heidelberg, Germany from August 23-28, 2015. The HLF brings together Laureates of the most prestigious awards in mathematics and computer science (the Abel Prize, the Fields Medal, the Turing Award, and the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize) to spend a week interacting with 200 early career researchers. In addition to the scientific exchanges with the Laureates and each other, participants at the Forum gain a valuable global perspective on computer and mathematical sciences -- early career researchers represented 47 countries at the 2014 Forum. Modeled on the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, the HLF provides graduate students and postdoctoral researchers with extraordinary access to a group of scientific role models through lectures, small group discussions, and casual conversations. Such experiences can have a profound impact on the development of an early career researcher. For more information about the Forum, please see www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) will recruit a highly qualified and diverse applicant pool for the Forum. There are many exceptionally promising early career researchers who have little or no opportunity to interact with the Laureates of the major prizes in the computer and mathematical sciences. The HLF is a unique opportunity for these individuals, one that can energize and steer future research. The recruitment and selection of participants will emphasize the potential benefits of the opportunity for the researchers, as well as the overall goal of ensuring a broadly inclusive group of participants. ORAU will provide logistical support both prior to and during the forum and also continue to perform an assessment of participant experiences to document the impact of the Forum.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded, eight PhD students to attend the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) held in Heidelberg, Germany from August 23-August 28, 2015.  This delegation of the future of American mathematics was enabled to interact with Laureates of prestigious computer science and mathematics awards &ndash; namely the Abel Prize, Fields Medal, Nevanlinna Prize, and A.M. Turing Award, and with other high-caliber graduate students from around the world.  HLF provided opportunities to form new research collaborations with Laureates and other students.  Participants gained a valuable global perspective on mathematics that prepares them for leadership in the global community.  As one supported student noted, "The network you create is amazing. To see many so mathematicians and computer scientists together so excited about their area is great."   The philosophy of the HLF is rooted in the words of the late Dr. Klaus Tschira, forum founder. He wrote: "mathematics and computer science pervade all aspects and spheres of life. They provide the foundation for todayÆs highly engineered and modern society, and they belong to our culture. Their social relevance will continue to grow."  In that spirit, the meeting connects these young researchers to collaborate and further the discipline as they mature professionally and to bridge the gap between the generations of mathematics research.  At least one student conveyed success, reporting that they "found other young researchers with more applied problems that I may be able to contribute to from a more theoretical perspective."  Another student gave a glimpse of their experience bridging the gap reporting: "I spent an entire evening talking to Fred Brooks (Turing Award, 2000) about his career as a professor. The stories of his experiments and students and travels were amazing. It was like talking to history.  His experiences will inspire me for the rest of my career."   The HLF gave participants an opportunity for interaction that is typically not available within their normal university environment, whereby Laureates provided formal plenary lectures and led small group discussions with topics driven by a combination of prepared presentations as well as student questions.  Shigefumi Mori, Fields Medal Laureate (1990) and President of the International Mathematical Union relayed the importance of the HLF to the young researchers in his talk, saying "For a mathematician, the object of research is a notion that exists as a real entity only in his/her mind and is often difficult to understand by researchers in other fields even within mathematical sciences. However the attitude toward or the way to view it is often more universal and can be shared with others in wider fields. It is thus important to absorb something broader than technical knowledge when one wants to interact with scholars in other fields.  The Laureates presented a broad selection of topics related to mathematics, regardless of their field.

Based on feedback collected, the supported students overwhelmingly reported that this was an invaluable experience.  The most common feedback included having the opportunity to talk to various Laureates about their research, receiving insights and resources, and being able to easily interact with Laureates and graduate students from around the world.
