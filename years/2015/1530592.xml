<AbstractNarration>This award funds a project that develops new knowledge about the statistical properties of methods that are widely used to test hypotheses developed from economic theory.  The overall goal is to give researchers who use these methods new tools for understanding which method to choose for their particular application.   Employing these tools could lead to more precise and reliable conclusions.  The project advances science by improving the methods used for data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions about the relative efficiency of estimators and tests are fundamental in econometrics.  In the popular Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) setting, it is standard practice to use a two-step procedure to improve efficiency.  The two-step procedure requires the estimation of a weighting matrix.  Standard asymptotic theory predicts that the estimator error in the weighting matrix is asymptotically negligible, and therefore the two step procedure outperforms the one step procedure in large samples.  However, this asymptotic result, while elegant and convenient, ignores possible estimation uncertainty in the weighting matrix.  This uncertainty can be very high.  The PI plans to develop a new asymptotic framework that fully accounts for estimation uncertainty.  He will compare the performance of the one step and two step GMM procedures, as well as other procedures, under this framework. The PI plans to consider both time series and spatial settings as well as parametric, nonparametric, and semiparametric models.  The results should help applied researchers choose the most efficient statistical procedures for their specific problems.</AbstractNarration>

First, we employ a more accurate fixed-smoothing asymptotic framework to compare the performances of the one-step and two-step GMM procedures. We show that the two-step procedures outperform the one-step procedures only when the squared long-run canonical correlation coefficients between two blocks of transformed moment conditions are larger than the thresholds established in this paper. The transformed moment conditions are obtained by rotating and standardizing the original moment process. The thresholds depend on the criterion of interest. We consider two criteria: the asymptotic variance of the GMM estimators and the asymptotic power of the associated tests. A Monte Carlo study lends support to our asymptotic results.   Second, we propose a simple and easy-to-implement modification to the commonly-used test statistics in the two-step efficient GMM setting and show that the modified test statistics are all asymptotically F distributed under the so-called fixed-smoothing asymptotics. The modification is multiplicative and involves the J statistic for testing over-identifying restrictions. This leads to convenient asymptotic F tests whose critical values, i.e., the standard F critical values, are readily available from standard statistical tables and programming environments.   Third, using the idea of orthonormal projections onto trend functions and fixed-smoothing asymptotics, we design simple, convenient, and trustworthy F and t tests in a cointegration system. The F and t tests have more accurate size in finite samples than existing tests such as the asymptotic chi-squared and normal tests based on the fully modified OLS estimator of Phillips and Hansen (1990) and can be made as powerful as the latter test.   Finally, the idea of the fixed-smoothing asymptotics has been employed in the nonparametric setting for capturing the serial dependence, which vanishes in the traditional asymptotic framework.  Based on the fixed-bandwidth asymptotic variance and the pre-asymptotic variance, we propose a heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust (HAR) variance estimator that achieves double robustness --- it is asymptotically valid regardless of whether the temporal dependence is present or not, and whether the kernel smoothing bandwidth is held constant or allowed to decay with the sample size. Using the HAR variance estimator, we construct the studentized test statistic and develop the asymptotic t theory.   Overall, the project develops more accurate F and t approximations and provides a more honest comparison of different inference procedures in a number of different setting. It will guide the applied researchers in social sciences and natural sciences to use more accurate and more powerful inference procedures.
