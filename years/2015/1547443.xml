<AbstractNarration>This EARS (Enhancing Access to the Radio Spectrum) program was founded in response to the 2010 Presidential Memorandum on Unleashing the Wireless Broadband Revolution mandated by Congress as part of the National Broadband Plan. It was referenced in 2010 State of the Union and later on the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (More than 1/3 of the bill deals with radio spectrum), the PCAST 2012 Report [President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology] (which calls for vastly increased use of spectrum sharing) and the 2013 Presidential memo (Expanding America's Leadership in Wireless Innovation). The aim of this program is to identify bold new concepts with the potential to contribute to significant improvements in the efficiency of radio spectrum utilization, protection of passive sensing services, and in the ability for traditionally underserved Americans to benefit from current and future wireless-enabled goods and services. The impact is large on the economics of the Nation as seen on the last FCC bidding of 65MHz of the spectrum for over $45 billion early in 2015. It will enable access to science, engineering, industry, civilian and military users of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The staggering growth of wireless communications systems has led to an increasing demand for spectrum to support commercial services, particularly in the frequencies below 3 GHz, where battery-powered mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets operate most efficiently.  It is desirable for such devices to be useful for a variety of applications, and in a variety of locations that have differing available spectrum. Currently this is achieved, in a smart phone for example, by a collection of hardware solutions, with one for each standard. This is complex and expensive, and such receivers will not be sufficiently adaptable for future spectrum usage. It is desirable to have a single hardware solution that is capable of receiving a broad spectrum and then selecting a particular transmission from it a based on the local spectral conditions and the application.  Adaptable solutions such as this do not currently exist due in large part to the interference that occurs when a desired signal is weak and is crowded by a channel containing a high power signal.  There are high dynamic range receivers that tolerate such disparate signal levels, but they are not adaptable over large bandwidths.  In this project, a novel high-dynamic range receiver topology that promises to enable the reception of a wide instantaneous bandwidth will be explored.  The topology is enabled by new signal processing concepts and integrated circuit technologies. The research undertaken will range from the basic theory to experimental demonstration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reducing the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI), e.g., cellular, radio, TV, satellite and radar signals, and interference from microwave ovens, is crucial for the future of radio astronomical discoveries. When studying celestial radio signals, it is not uncommon for the scientists to puzzle over mysterious interference. To avoid RFI, the radio astronomers select sparsely populated areas to set up their telescopes. In some cases, the quiet zones around the radio telescopes have to be established to limit the use of airwares. Therefore, the technology of RFI mitigation is a critical component needed by radio astronomy science in increasingly challenging RFI environments. This project brings together researchers in radio astronomy, statistical array signal processing, radio frequency instrumentation, digital signal processing, wireless communications, and software defined radios to address these challenges and boost the science of radio astronomy by introducing a novel framework that provides the necessary analytical tools for modeling, analyzing, and operating radio telescope arrays in complex RFI environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mitigating RFI in radio astronomy is an interdisciplinary research area which combines the efforts of scientists from various fields including electrical engineering, physics, astronomy, computer science, and astrophysics. Opportunities created by developing RFI mitigation techniques by the joint team of University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and the Center for Advanced Radio Astronomy (CARA) of the University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) researchers will have a direct impact in the number of students participating in STEM careers. The success of this project will be beneficial to both the commercial and the scientific communities. Recently, CARA teamed up with SpaceX, a leading commercial manufacturer of orbital launch vehicles, to create the Space Craft Tracking and Astronomical Research into Gigahertz Astrophysical Transient Emission (STARGATE), a space technology innovation center that combines higher education, research, economic development, and commercialization. The future connections developed between STARGATE's technology/business incubator and the Dallas Telecom Corridor will open up new opportunities for technology transfer and better planning of spectrum use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported commissioning and initial observations with the Low Frequency All-Sky Monitor (LoFASM), the first instrument specifically designed to observe astrophysical radio transients at the lowest radio frequencies observable from Earth.  Up until the 20th Century, visible light was the only means of observing the Universe beyond the Earth; and the picture it painted was of a serene backdrop of planets, stars, and galaxies, with changes occurring gradually and infrequently.  More recent observations of other forms of radiation (radio waves, xrays, gamma rays, and gravitational waves) have revealed a more dynamic Universe filled with exotic objects and sometimes catastrophic events: stars collapsing to form ultra-dense neutron stars or black holes, which can subsequently collide, implode, or release intense bursts of radiation.  The novel field of time domain astronomy explores this dynamic aspect of theUniverse.  However, a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that remains sparsely observed are low-frequency radio waves (frequencies from 10 to 100 megahertz), the lowest frequencies capable of reaching the Earth's surface through its ionosphere.  LoFASM fills this niche.  LoFASM follows a recent trend in radio astronomy of using a phased array of multiple antenna elements, rather than large focusing dishes, to collect radio waves and observe their direction.  LoFASM consists of 5 stations spread across the United States (see Figure 1), each composed of a mini-array of 12 antennas in a hexagram arrangement (see Figure 2).  This arrangement allows stations to observe large regions of the sky above, while rejecting human-generated radio radio frequency interference (RFI) coming from the sides.  The use of 5 geographically-separated stations further allows us to discriminate distant astrophysical emissions from locally-generated RFI.  Improved data analysis algorithms, developed in collaboration between radio astronomers at UTRGV and electrical engineers at UT Dallas, further allow astrophysical emissions to be teased out from the noisy background of terrestrial signals.  The benefits of this research extend beyond radio astronomy, allowing for improved "spectrum sharing" among many stakeholders of an increasingly crowded electromagnetic spectrum.  The design of LoFASM follows a design concept of small, easily-deployed and (relatively) inexpensive micro-arrays.  This complements the capabilities of larger arrays (e.g. Europe's LOFAR, New Mexico's LWA, and Canada's CHIME observatories), and dovetails with other newly-proposed small arrays (e.g. the Naval Research Laboratory's DLITE and New Mexico's Swarm stations).  LoFASM stations were built and commissioned in large part by high school and undergraduate students working with UTRGV's Center for Advanced Radio Astronomy (CARA), and the LoFASM V station was built using private funding.  The LoFASM project has been transformative in attracting and retaining students from South Texas, an economically-disadvantaged region, into STEM careers.  It has spun off other research projects and public-private partnerships, such as CARA's STARGATE space technology development project, that promise to further transform the region.  While astrophysical observations with LoFASM are just beginning, its impact is already being felt both regionally and across the nation.
