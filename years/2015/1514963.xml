<AbstractNarration>This award supports research that aims to resolve the species relationships and the evolution of Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis within Calandrinia s.l., a genus of plants widely distributed across the Australian continent, typically inhabiting arid to semi-arid environments, although several species have also been collected from temperate Tasmania, and from the monsoon-dominated tropics of coastal Australia. CAM photosynthesis is an adaptation that improves photosynthetic and water use efficiency under hot and dry conditions. In light of climate change and the increasing aridity of the world?s land (~40% of which is already considered arid, semi-arid or sub-humid), it is necessary that we understand the expression and evolution of CAM photosynthesis as it will likely play an important role in the future of carbon sequestration, sustainable biomass production, and food-crop security. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Joseph Holtum (James Cook University), an expert on the succulent flora of Australia and CAM photosynthesis. In efforts to collect specimens comprehensively across the genus, additional collaborations have also been established with the WA Herbarium, Melbourne Botanic Garden, SA Herbarium, Australian Tropical Herbarium, and NT Herbarium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the evolution of C3 photosynthesis - the pathway used by most green plants - only two known alternative pathways have evolved: C4 and CAM photosynthesis. Both of these derived pathways improve photosynthetic efficiency under hot/dry and low CO2 conditions. Much is known about the step-like evolution of C4 photosynthesis but little is known about the evolutionary history of CAM and its phylogenetic distribution. This study will use novel DNA sequencing techniques to generate robust molecular phylogenies of Calandrinia, a genus that represents the C3 to CAM-intermediate (CAM-cycling and facultative CAM) to CAM photosynthetic spectrum. To characterize photosynthesis physiological, isotopic (13C/12C and D/H), and anatomical measurements will be comprehensively made across the genus. These data will be interpreted in light of the molecular phylogenies to generate hypotheses on the historical transformations leading to the assembly of the CAM phenotype from C3 and CAM-intermediate ancestors. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis is a complex syndrome of traits that improves water use and photosynthetic efficiency in plants under drought and temperature stress. It has evolved from the more typical C3 photosynthetic pathway &ndash; the pathway found in most green plants &ndash; likely hundreds of times, and is a ubiquitous and important ecological adaptation in drier regions of the world. In addition to full CAM, there are many recognized intermediate photosynthetic types that have been hypothesized to represent evolutionary &ldquo;stepping stones&rdquo; along the C3 -CAM evolutionary trajectory. However, there has been no thorough phylogenetic analysis of any CAM-evolving plant lineage, so there has been no explicit demonstration of how these potentially intermediate types relate to one another, or to the evolution of a full CAM syndrome. Australian <em>Calandrinia</em> (Montiaceae) is an ideal lineage in which to investigate the evolutionary assembly of CAM photosynthesis, as species within this group are known to span the C3 to CAM phenotypic spectrum. This research integrates phylogenetics, anatomy, ecology, physiology, and greenhouse experiments to understand C3-CAM expression and to unravel the incremental assembly of CAM photosynthesis in Australian <em>Calandrinia</em>.</p> <p>This award specifically supported research aimed to resolve the phylogenetic placement, species relationships, and the evolution of Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis within Australian <em>Calandrinia</em>; a genus (~ 70 species) widely distributed across the Australian continent, typically inhabiting arid to semi-arid environments, although several species have also been collected from temperate Tasmania, and from the monsoon-dominated tropics of coastal Australia (Fig. 1).</p> <p>To resolve both phylogenetic placement of Australian <em>Calandrinia </em>and the species relationships within the lineage, we carried out six field-campaigns across the continent (20,000km), collecting leaf material for DNA analysis and photosynthesis investigation as well as seeds for subsequent greenhouse experiments. These collecting trips, along with material collected from voucher specimens at the Western Australia Herbarium, resulted in complete taxonomic sampling and yielded the first phylogeny of Australian <em>Calandrinia </em>(Fig. 2).<em> </em>In efforts to resolve the monophyly of <em>Calandrinia </em>s.l., which includes Australian <em>Calandrinia +</em> <em>Calandrinia s.s.</em> (found only in the New World), and its phylogenetic placement within the Montiaceae family, we sequenced species across the Montiaceae (162 individuals, representing all genera). These results confidently show that <em>Calandrinia </em>s.l. is not monophyletic (Fig. 3) and since naming priority goes to <em>Calandrinia s.s., </em>Australian <em>Calandrinia</em> will be renamed <em>Rumicastrum, </em>which is not, as originally thought, a chenopod but an Australian <em>Calandrinia</em> (Fig. 4).</p> <p>Resolving the phylogenetic placement and species relationships within Australian <em>Calandrinia </em>(hence forth <em>Rumicastrum</em>), greatly improves our ability to develop an identification key for all of northern Australia &ndash; a project currently underway at the Australian Tropical Herbarium (Cains, AU). The aim of this key is to streamline flora assessments, which are required before any development - mining, road building, and agriculture &ndash; commences in Australia. The further aim of the key is to create an accessible resource so that local people/ communities living in northern Australia can identify rare and endangered plants for conservation, educational, and employment opportunities.</p> <p>In addition to the phylogenetic and taxonomic work, we carried out a large growing experiment at the James Cook University greenhouse. Using seeds collected from the field, we grew up 25 different species of <em>Rumicastrum</em> and ran a watered, droughted, re-watered experiment across 7-10 individuals per species. We collected leaf material in both the morning and evening when the plants were watered, water limited, re-watered and measured the titratable acidity - a physiological tool that quantifies the amount of CAM a plant is doing &ndash; of the leaves. We found considerable variation in the level of CAM photosynthesis performed by <em>Rumicastrum</em>, with species in the genus representing the C3 to CAM phenotypic spectrum (Fig. 5). When we mapped these phenotypic data onto the phylogeny we found that there is clear reversibility from CAM to C3 photosynthesis (Fig. 6), which is particularly interesting, as we know of very few reversals back to C3 from CAM and none from C4 photosynthesis. Although this work to understand the evolutionary assembly of CAM from C3 ancestors is ongoing, we now have a phylogenetic framework in which to investigate CAM evolution.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/08/2016<br>      Modified by: Lillian&nbsp;P&nbsp;Hancock</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514963/1514963_10370445_1470676237641_EAPSI_annual_report_figures.001--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514963/1514963_10370445_1470676237641_EAPSI_annual_report_figures.001--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514963/1514963_10370445_1470676237641_EAPSI_annual_report_figures.001--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Distribution of Rumicastrum across Australia.
