<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award supports Vanderbilt University with the acquisition and commissioning of an FEI Helios NanoLab G3 CX dual beam focused ion beam (FIB) system for multidisciplinary research, education, and outreach in nanoscale science and engineering. The FEI Helios Nanolab G3 CX dual electron and ion beam system provides such capability for a group of researchers across Middle Tennessee, including those at Vanderbilt, FISK, and Austin Peay State Universities. The research projects address problems of technological importance such as nanowires for high-efficiency direct thermal to electrical energy conversion, creating novel man-made materials for manipulating light, for better solar cell design, and characterizing complex artificial vascular systems. Importantly, when integrated with the existing scanning transmission electron microscopy system at Vanderbilt, the acquisition of the NanoLab G3 CX system will help to establish an atomic-resolution microscopy infrastructure that is urgently needed in Middle Tennessee. The scientific research is tightly integrated with educational efforts, including hands-on training of graduate students. In addition leveraging various outreach programs at Vanderbilt, the impact of this project will be extended to high school students through demonstration of fabrication and manipulation of unique nanostructures. Moreover, the close collaboration between Vanderbilt and FISK Universities, a historically black university, will facilitate participation of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This powerful instrument will enable fabrication of nanoscale features with high precision, preparation of site-specific TEM samples, and three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale imaging. These new capabilities will lead to research activities addressing a broad range of nanoscience and nanoengineering challenges: from high performance thermoelectric nanowires to 3D all-dielectric metamaterials, from nanocomposite photovoltaic materials to complex 3D micro/nanofluidic networks. As an enabling tool, the dual beam FIB system will also open new opportunities and catalyze new collaborations among nanoscience researchers at Vanderbilt and across the Middle Tennessee. Together with the recently installed FEI Tecnai Osiris S/TEM, this project will establish the much-needed research infrastructure for high resolution microscopy in Middle Tennessee, which will produce significant impacts on many researchers at Vanderbilt and six nearby universities</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through this project, Vanderbilt University has acquired and commissioned an FEI Helios NanoLab G3 CX dual beam focused ion beam (FIB) system, which has played and will play an enabling role in the multi-disciplinary research, education, and outreach activities in nanoscale science and engineering.  Together with an FEI Tecnai Osiris STEM system, the FIB system established the urgently-needed research infrastructure for high-resolution microscopy at Vanderbilt and across Middle Tennessee, which has produced a transformative impact on many researchers in this area.  Leveraging many education and outreach activities at Vanderbilt, the FIB system also helped to educate the next generation of scientists/engineers about this state-of-the-art nanotechnology.  The Helios FIB system has allowed researchers to pursue many exciting research projects through its powerful nanofabrication, nanomanipulation, and characterization capabilities.  The state-of-the-art instrument has enabled a variety of research projects such as electrical and thermal transport property measurements of various kinds of nanowires, preparation of TEM specimens for high-resolution microscopy examination of materials such as advanced high-strength steels, and study of the cross-section of basement-memebrane like matrix deposited by cells, etc.  These studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of the world.  For example, the transport property measurements of various types of nanowires disclosed new observations, and the related underlying mechanisms has altered our understanding of how charge and energy carriers transport in different materials.  The microscopy examination of advanced high-strength steels helped to establish the structure-property relations of this important class of materials.  Through integrated research and education activities, the Helios FIB system has played an important role in nanoscience and engineering lab courses and provided students with hands-on experience in nanofabrication and characterization, allowing them to attain invaluable knowledge about how things work at the nanoscale, experience that cannot be acquired without this tool.  The Helios FIB system has also been used in various outreach activities to demonstarte how to do nanoscale science and engineering research to a broad audience including high school students and general visitors during different events.  Importantly, the Helios FIB system has become an essential part of the new cleanroom and high performance imaging suite in the new Engineering and Science Building on Vanderbilt Campus.  This important physical infrastructure will produce long-lasting positive impacts to many exciting research projects and training of next generation scientists and engineers.
