<AbstractNarration>Islands comprise only five percent of the Earth's landmass, yet nowhere in the world, in relation to land area, does land snail diversity compare to that of the Pacific Islands, where more than 6,000 species occur. However, habitat destruction, environmental change and incursions by invasive species threaten populations of native land snails. Snails have the highest recorded extinction rate of any major animal group, and the majority of extinctions are from Pacific Islands. The largest Pacific Island land snail collection in the world is at the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum (BPBM), which houses six million specimens. Natural history collections are critical to maintain research knowledge and to making decisions about biodiversity conservation. To secure this collection and improve accessibility to critical data for researchers, natural resource managers, students, and the public, this project will rehouse land snail specimens in environmentally stable and protective containers, image all original specimens from which species descriptions are based, and digitize all collection data so as to make these data readily available. The project team will recruit and train college and high school students to assist with this work and students will receive training in topics ranging from systematics to curation and museum conservation. Researchers and students will participate in outreach activities to increase public awareness of invertebrates, including land snails, their importance to natural ecosystems, and for monitoring environmental change, human migration and trade; and in the value of natural history collections to conserving and securing biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The security and accessibility of the largest and most biogeographically diverse Pacific Island land snail collection in the world will be ensured by completing the objectives of the project. Specifically, to safeguard against Byne's and glass disease, all cotton will be removed from the approximately 116,900 glass vials and replaced with polyethylene caps or archival foam. Approximately 5,000 lots with shells housed freely in no-lid boxes will be transferred to polystyrene friction boxes to secure them and prevent disassociation from labels. All labels are currently handwritten and these will be replaced by thermal transfer, acid-free labels with QR codes. Data from the ledger, labels, and other historical documents will be digitized, digitally curated, and images of Pacific island land snail primary types will be made available online and in type catalog publications. Specimen data and images will be made available through portals including iDigBio (idigbio.org), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and the BPBM website (bishopmuseum.org/PILS).</AbstractNarration>

Unfortunately, PILS are also the taxonomic group with the highest number of recorded extinctions among all known animals. The largest and most comprehensive collection of PILS is under the care of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum (BPBM) Malacology Center and has more than 4 million specimens in 180,000 cataloged specimen records or lots which is a collection of a single species taken from a single locality on a single occasion. Species in the collection represent 90% of the archipelagos in the Pacific and many of the threatened, endangered, or extinct species from these islands. Most of these collections are irreplaceable, as is the historical data associated with these specimens, and are critical to the study of biology, evolution, ecology, and conservation of these highly endangered animals. To ensure the security and accessibility of specimens and associated data, this project was focused on several primary objectives: 1) eliminate sources of Byne&rsquo;s and glass disease to prevent damage and loss of specimens among the more than 116,900 specimens records or lots; 2) update the Museum&rsquo;s in-house and online databases by digitizing ledgers and specimen label data, and link these data to about 180,000 specimen records; 3) identify and photograph all specimens of an organism on which the scientific name is based (also known as primary type material); and 4) train students from underrepresented STEM groups (e.g. Pacific Islanders, women in science) in fields of science needed to address current and pending biodiversity crises (e.g. systematics, taxonomy, conservation biology, museum science, and science communication).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Prior to this project, &gt;80% of shell specimens from an estimated 116,900 specimen lots in the BPBM collection were stored in glass vials stoppered with cotton. Cotton can absorb water and promote what is known as Byne&rsquo;s and glass disease, which are chemical reactions that can destroy the shells of specimens over time. As a result of the work funded through this project, Byne&rsquo;s and glass disease have been eliminated from nearly 130,000 specimen lots. All old vials have been replaced with non-reactive glass vials, cotton replaced with polyethylene caps, and all specimens rehoused in acid-free archival boxes. All ledgers (21 volumes containing about 15,000 specimen records each; totaling more than 300,000 specimen records) have been scanned, digitized and linked to specimen records within the in-house database. Additionally, transcribed specimen label data from rehoused specimens have also been entered into the database. Prior to this project, only 1,300 of the 248,000 cataloged specimen records of marine and non-marine molluscs were available online and data had not been updated since 2002. We now have a searchable online database that contains 305,100 specimen records. Additionally, the type material assessment identified about 870 putative primary types and all have been imaged and will be linked to their specimen records. With the collection upgrades and enhanced specimen records provided in this project, several peer-reviewed manuscripts were published that included digital images and identification of the specimens on which the original name is based (primary types), historical and updated species distributional maps, species re-descriptions and new species descriptions.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-647bcef5-7fff-3250-77a6-7fb637737cf7"><span>The project included 44 participants recruited and trained</span></span>&nbsp;in land snail systematics, taxonomy, conservation biology, museum curation, digital photography, digitization protocols, and science communication. Those trained included 18 high school students, 12 undergraduate students, 3 post-baccalaureate, 2 graduate students, 2 postdoctoral researchers, and 7 volunteers, and of these 14 were Pacific Islanders and 33 women, both groups underrepresented in science fields. Three women started as volunteers or undergraduate assistants but continued to work as post-baccalaureate students upon graduation, and are now pursuing biology degrees as graduate students. Several students on the project participated in state, national, or international conferences and gave oral and/or poster presentations of the research and training experiences with the project. Each participant also took part in museum tours, science festivals, and taxonomic workshops for the research and conservation community and the general public. Educational outreach products that were developed from this project included museum exhibits and informational videos shared via the museum exhibit spaces and web-based media. Eleven participants worked on the project for more than a year and three high school students participated in the project for three years, starting their sophomore year through their graduation! These high school students not only presented in biological conferences but also organized a bill to designate a state snail for Hawaii, further increasing awareness, appreciation and conservation recognition of Hawaii land snails and other invertebrates broadly. Over the course of the project, these high school students have won best poster presentation awards in national conferences and one high school student placed 3rd at the State High School Science Fair.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Norine&nbsp;Yeung</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1561774/1561774_10449866_1606687349464_1_rehousing--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1561774/1561774_10449866_1606687349464_1_rehousing--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Rehousing"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1561774/1561774_10449866_1606687349464_1_rehousing--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Rehousing"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Removing sources of Byne�s and glass disease � Vials cotton free and placed in archival boxes</div> <div class="imageCredit">N.
