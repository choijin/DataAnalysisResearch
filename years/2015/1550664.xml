<AbstractNarration>Mental Abacus is a popular mathematics technique practices primarily in Asian countries in elementary school contexts. Mental abacus students begin by learning to make rapid arithmetic computations on a physical abacus and then learn to imagine moving the beads without the physical device. Young children can then rapidly add, subtract, multiply and divide large numbers. This project will compare mental abacus teaching to two other teaching methods in order to understand how it helps first and second grade students learn to compute and learn conceptual understanding of place value. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;Prior work indicates the mental abacus computations are connected to visuo-spatial working memory. The project is a randomized experiment to compare the effectiveness of Mental Abacus, Singapore Math Curriculum and business-as-usual curriculum in grades 1 and 2 in multiple elementary schools.  Math outcomes will be measured with standardized test scores and four assessments (an in-house arithmetic fluency measure, the WIAT, the Woodcock-Johnson III, and a measure of conceptual understanding of place-value). A battery of cognitive measures and a measure of intervention fidelity will also be included. The project should result in understanding the effectiveness of Mental Abacus as a method for teaching and provide a foundation for larger scale work in the area.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project investigated Mental Abacus arithemetic training and its suitability as a supplement to standard mathematics education in a US K-12 environment. Mental Abacus (MA) is a popular arithmetic technique in which students learn to solve math problems by visualizing a physical abacus structure. Prior studies conducted in Asia have found that MA can lead to exceptional mathematics achievement in highly motivated individuals, and that extensive training over multiple years can also benefit students in standard classroom settings. In this project, we explored the benefits of shorter-term MA training to typical students in a US school. Specifically, we tested whether MA (1) improves arithmetic performance relative to a standard math curriculum, and (2) leads to changes in spatial working memory, as claimed by several recent reports. To address these questions, we conducted a one-year, classroom-randomized trial of MA instruction. We found that first-graders students struggled to achieve abacus expertise over the course of the year, while second-graders were more successful. Neither age group showed a significant advantage in cognitive abilities or mathematical computation relative to controls, although older children showed some hints of an advantage in learning place-value concepts. These results advance our knowledge of an increasingly popular after-school mathematics enrichment, suggesting that, while not worse than existing techniques, MA may not generate significant benefits for all children. Also, the work benefits society by pointing to the effective use of limited public education dollars, and suggests that if techniques like MA are implemented, this should be done with caution.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/06/2017<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;A&nbsp;Barner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
