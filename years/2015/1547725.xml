<AbstractNarration>This award is being jointly funded by the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and Materials Research (DMR) and provides support for a sustainable chemistry symposium at Pacifichem 2015. Sustainability and its implementation are increasingly important in the marketplace, in our society, and throughout everyday activities.  Future advances in sustainability require that we build upon chemical and biological advances, such as the toxicological sciences that describe how chemicals, by-products, and degradation products exert adverse effects upon biological organisms and the ecosystem, and determine the fitness for purpose, the social license to operate and ultimately the economic sustainability of the manufacturer within the specific industry sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this symposium is to provide attendees with the opportunity to see where these interdisciplinary concepts contribute to chemical design, synthesis, process and use.  Specific topics within the symposium include: a) Sustainable Molecular Design;&lt;br/&gt;b) Design for the environment and fitness-of-purpose in the 21st century; c) Life Cycle Assessment/ Impact Assessment; d) Sustainability Metrics; and e) Interdisciplinary Case studies.</AbstractNarration>

Over the course of the two-day sympoisum, approximately 25 papers and posters were presented, with roughly 50 attendees throughout the sessions.

For attendees, this symposium served as an opportunity to become exposed to new approaches that incoporate concepts from other disciplines which contribute to the holistic approach to molecular design.
