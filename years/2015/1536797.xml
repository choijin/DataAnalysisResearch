<AbstractNarration>The environment continually changes at many different scales and with many different impact levels, and yet, the current U.S. building stock, in general, does not.   Current practice for architects and engineers is to isolate the internal space of a building from the external environment with static barriers.  Alternatively, substantially greater levels of energy efficiency can be realized by structures that interact with and respond to their environment.  This project pursues fundamental research to utilize smart materials to design and optimize exterior building panels that operate as selective filters capable of adapting to environmental stimuli, such as solar insolation.  Smart materials provide the unique ability to comprise structures that respond to external stimuli and transform into optimized geometric configurations.  Such a morphing fa√ßade system will significantly alter the total sustainability of a building envelope and take advantage of available environmental energy sources.  Beyond direct application to building technology, this work provides core concepts that can accelerate the implementation of novel adaptive structure concepts in fields such as aeronautics, astronautics, and the automotive industry.  This research integrates multiple disciplines, including mechanics, materials engineering, architecture, and computer-aided engineering, as well as a geographically diverse team, and will facilitate mentorship and education of a diverse group of students. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The smart material exterior building panels will be realized as modular building tiles comprised of shape memory polymer with controllable local activation and actuation.  The technical approach involves three major thrusts: 1) Establishing a computational framework for the development of smart material tile morphing mechanisms; 2) Prototyping the tile concept to evaluate the feasibility of materials and morphing mechanisms and validating the computational methods; and 3) Numerical investigation of building case studies to evaluate the potential benefits of the smart material tile concept to overall building envelope efficiency.  In addition to establishing a new concept in responsive building technologies, the computational efforts represent a substantial contribution to the field of computational methods for inverse problems, particularly the formulation of uniquely tractable and generalizable shape-based design objectives that could be used to facilitate accurate and efficient computational inverse solution procedures in a variety of shape-based applications.  This work will further establish the concept of smart material morphing structures with controllable local actuation and activation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project was to investigate a new concept for a Smart Material, Adaptive, and Reconfigurable building skin tile (a SMARTile) that could be used to control the shape of the surface of a building for the purpose for self-shading, and thereby, reducing solar insolation.  In particular, this work involved the creation of a prototype SMARTile along with simultaneous integrated computational evaluation of the potential capability of such a smart material tile to be controllably transformed into desired shapes as well as substantially decreasing the total surface of a structure exposed to the sun.  The major outcome of this work is the prototype of the SMARTile that was shown experimentally to be able to have the properties locally modified to change the tile surface into a variety of different shapes, as may be beneficial depending on environmental conditions, in a stable, controllable, and recoverable fashion.  This prototype was used to create a numerical model, which was then integrated into a newly developed computational approach to optimally design the mechanisms to change the tile shape to achieve a desired shape change in the tile and/or to maximize the desired solar interaction (e.g., to maximize the amount of shade on the surface).  This computational development included the investigation of new tools for optimal design of a smart material structure to obtain a desired shape as well as optimizing a state of solar exposure, which have further impacts in general to the field of inverse problems in engineering.  Overall, the numerical analysis showed that the SMARTile concept has substantial promise for having a controllable affect on the interaction between a building surface and the sun, and that there is significant reason to further explore integrating this concept or similar into fa&ccedil;ade engineering practice.
