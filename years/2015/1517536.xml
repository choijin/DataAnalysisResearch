<AbstractNarration>Modifications  (called epigenetic marks) of DNA or of the proteins associated with DNA can cause certain genes to be turned on or off (gene regulation) at different stages of growth and development.  This project will define a mode of epigenetic-based gene regulation that is poorly understood in all organisms using as a model system maize (corn), which is an important agricultural product for human and animal consumption and for bioenergy production in the US.   Since these epigenetic marks are heritable and can be used to turn on genes with desired traits, this project may uncover novel approaches for engineering new strains of corn for agricultural purposes.  This project will engage high school students in summer research programs, and offer research experiences and training to graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proteins will be isolated by sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) from a known epigenetic regulatory sequence in maize.  They will be compared from ChIP samples of DNA in transcriptionally active and silenced states, along with specific deletions of the known regulatory sequence.  Collectively, this will be used to elucidate the specific protein-DNA interactions associated with transcriptional silencing and activation.  Because the regulatory sequence participates in allelic communication, proteins involved with epigenetic regulation associated with allelic communication will also be identified.  Analysis of these interactions will provide insight into mechanisms of transcriptional silencing, enhancers, and paramutation in eukaryotes and address the complexity of combinatorial epigenetic regulation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  In plants and other multicellular organisms, genetic information is organized as chromatin in the nucleus of each individual cell.  Chromatin includes DNA and proteins, with genes encoded on the DNA.  Organisms turn individual genes on and off throughout growth and development in a regulated manner to produce important molecules at specific times for metabolism, environmental response, and reproduction.  This project developed a new technique, Single-Locus Immunoprecipitation Proteomics (SLIP), to isolate proteins that interact with a specific region of chromatin isolated from maize (corn) plants.  Additionally, SLIP was used to discover proteins that associate with a part of the maize chromosome that helps regulate the expression of other genes in maize.  Most of these proteins have not been discovered using other approaches, including genetic studies of maize mutants. This work provides important insight into mechanisms of genetic regulation in plants.  Broader Impacts:  Maize (corn) is an extremely important crop plant in the United States, and provides food, fuel and fiber to most of the world.  These newly discovered proteins are likely to be important in regulatory mechanisms that influence plant growth, development, and ultimately agricultural yield in corn.  This project supported the extensive training of one graduate and five undergraduate students.  Two of these undergraduate students identify with ethnic groups that are under-represented in STEM careers. Three additional graduate students participated in peripheral research associated with this project, including two women, one of which also identifies with an under-represented ethnic minority in STEM. In total, this work contributed to the Ph.D. theses of 4 graduate students, resulting in 3 published articles, one additional submitted, and another in preparation.
