<AbstractNarration>Georgia's largest export in 2013, at $6.75 Billion, was aerospace products and parts. Exports from this sector grew by 19.8% in that year alone. Historically, machine tool technology has always been a foundational underpinning of manufacturing and this is especially true in the aerospace industry. While there is a national shortage of workers available with multi-axis CNC skills, and industry's demand for them is continuing to increase, the advanced training required to produce them remains unavailable. Professional development for machine tool instructors will directly address this problem by building the capacity for industry-recognized training at technical colleges and 4-year institutions involved in the Coalition of Machine Tool Technology Programs of Georgia (COMP-GA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Athens Technical College (ATC) in conjunction with COMP-GA and Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU) are creating a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Advanced Multi-axis Programming (CAMP) certificate program, to enhance the quality of Georgia's machine tool technology programs. Machine tool instructors from majorly rural areas in Georgia are receiving formal training from the renowned Vincennes University (VU) in Indiana to help sharpen their expertise in the field. Instructors are learning how to set-up, program, and use advanced multi-axis CNC machines, to incorporate the industry-recognized certification in to their classroom curriculums. COMP-GA and SPSU are partnering with the Regional Advanced Machining Partnership (RAMP) and Central Maine Community College (CMCC) who are also NSF/ATE recipients currently developing an advanced machining certificate. The CAMP project is responding to industry needs for trained workers, and meeting the specific demands of the aerospace industry in Georgia. The CAMP project is disseminating knowledge among Georgia machine tool programs while providing a model for working with four-year institutions to determine best practices for technical education. Machine Tool educators are learning to sustain technical instruction and maintain relevancy in the field. The professional development activities are influencing curriculums designs, and participants are creating strong foundations and practices that are benefiting the workforce in Georgia. The partnership between COMP-GA and SPSU is increasing the participation of underrepresented groups, including women and minorities, as all students matriculating are accessing greater job opportunities with higher rates of pay.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report   Due to Georgia?s statewide demand for highly-skilled multi-axis technicians and workers, Athens Technical College (ATC), a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG), in conjunction with Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU), a four-year public institution, now part of Kennesaw State University (KSU) in the University System of Georgia, applied to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and received a small grant for Advanced Technical Education (ATE). This grant funded the "CNC Advanced Multi-Axis Programming" (CAMP) project (DUE # 1501872).  The CAMP project provided TCSG and KSU Precision Machining and Manufacturing and Mechanical Engineering Technology instructors with a program of cutting edge professional development opportunities. This training has made positive and significant impacts on the states CAMP training capacity. There are now 13 faculty members teaching in the programs around the state with industry-recognized credentials and 13 of the 15 colleges have improved the equipment used in their programs.  This 21st century CAMP training is slated to begin for 20 Georgia students for the first time this spring and there are plans to begin developing and implementing an advanced curriculum for a TCSG CAMP certificate that will make the training available statewide. The project model is also transferable to any other state with programs needing to develop or increase their CAMP training capacities to address the national shortage of these workers.  Specifically, the CAMP project:  1.)   Formed the Coalition of Machine Tool Programs in Georgia (COMP-GA) for instructors who wanted to participate in the training opportunity to advance their program to the CAMP level and to help expedite the coordination of activities required to do so.  2.)    Arranged for COMP-GA faculty members, throughout the state of Georgia, to attend industry standard training, at various locals, on the programming and use of multi-axis CNC machining centers. Industry providers included Learning Labs, Inc., a Georgia Mastercam training provider, and the HAAS Technical Education Centers located at Vincennes University in Indiana (VU), Central Maine Community College in Maine (CMCC) and Danville Community College in Virginia (DCC).  3.)    Proposed a CAMP certificate to TCSG which has been accepted and approved for development.   4.)    Evaluated 10 different multi-axis machining and programming projects for suitability as potential projects in the proposed CAMP curriculum for TCSG institutions.  5.)   Provided COMP-GA instructors with guidance and expertise on developing a CAMP certificate for Georgia by creating an effective training and networking partnership with the Regional Advanced Machining Partnership (RAMP), an existing NSF/ATE project, which developed the CAMP training certificate curriculum now being used at CMCC.   6.)  Provided opportunities for COMP-GA instructors to promote 2-year student and high school dual enrollment into the TCSG Precision Machining and Manufacturing programs and on into the Bachelor?s degree in Manufacturing Operations through an articulation agreement with  KSU which will likely continue to stimulate recruitment.   Due to these accomplishments, TCSG now has a cadre of Precision Machining and Manufacturing educators who are academically prepared to implement a CAMP Certificate and begin teaching students the advanced skills required to setup and run modern multi-axis CNC manufacturing equipment throughout Georgia, and KSU will be teaching a spring 2018 course (MET 4342 &ndash; Numerical Control) to twenty, upper level college students.  This course includes multi-axis machining and students will be trained on "programming and machining 4th axis parts and performing 5-axis 2+3 CNC programming."   It is hoped that this project will continue to have an impact on the state and its manufacturing capabilities through the networks that have been established. To continue the projects momentum, the CAMP project leadership plans to seek further funding opportunities that will allow them to continue building on the networking connection they established with RAMP and to adapt and implement their curriculum as a CAMP certificate specifically tailored to meet the precision machining and manufacturing needs of Georgia?s industry.
