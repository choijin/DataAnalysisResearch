<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop the mathematical tools necessary to describe and analyze dynamical systems that mix logic and physics while including random influences.  These types of systems are sometimes called stochastic hybrid systems; where stochastic refers to the presence of random influences and hybrid refers to the mix of logic-based decision making and physical laws that determine the system evolution.   These mathematical tools would be extremely useful, as they would provide a framework enabling control engineers to better design autonomous dynamical systems that are resilient in the face of uncertainty.  The results of this proposal have the potential to impact researchers in a wide variety of application domains, where randomness interacts with worst-case effects and rigorous analysis tools are needed to certify desirable behavior in an engineered system. One possible application domain is the control of gene expression and other particular biological phenomena. Another application area is multi-agent resource allocation algorithms where agents invoke randomness in their allocation strategies to guarantee robustness to malicious agents in the network.  Indeed, stochastic hybrid systems can be used to model complicated biological systems, financial systems, resource allocation systems, and traffic management systems, to name just a few. All of the results developed through this proposal will be published in the leading conference venues and journals, to provide avenues for the transition of the work to applications.  Beyond contributions to the scientific literature, the proposed work will add to the existing graduate curriculum on stochastic and hybrid dynamical systems. Graduate students will be trained through direct financial support, but a broader group of students will be educated through teaching materials and a course that will be developed around the produced breakthroughs. These students include graduate students in all areas of engineering.  To reach students broadly, the PI envisions a graduate textbook on stochastic hybrid systems emerging from this work, to complement the recent book on non-stochastic hybrid systems. The work will spawn collaboration with international researchers, and will enhance student exchange programs with several international universities. The research developments will be applied to areas that are important to the broad population. Moreover, the PI will use this opportunity to consider how to expose freshman engineering students to a broad range of dynamical systems principles. This effort will follow up the previous experience teaching a freshman seminar, to engineering and non-engineering students, on the application of optimization principles to real-world problems. The aim here aligns with the societal goal of keeping younger students engaged in topics related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific technical objectives of the project start with establishing a mathematical framework and solution concept that is tractable yet general enough to be widely applicable.  Tools from the field of variational analysis are crucial to this development.  The objectives continue with the task of developing a wide range of analysis tools that can be used to certify appropriate behavior of an engineered stochastic hybrid system.  The techniques will especially focus on a Lyapunov analysis for stability properties like asymptotic stability in probability and recurrence; other ideas that have been fruitful for non-stochastic hybrid systems also will be considered.   Next, the aim is to establish strong sequential compactness results for the set of solutions to the models considered and, from these results, establish an invariance principle and converse Lyapunov theorems.  These results would parallel recent, very useful results for non-stochastic hybrid systems.  The final task is to begin to show explicitly how the developed framework and analysis tools can be used to engineer advanced, resilient, autonomous control systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research addressed our understanding of stochastic hybrid systems as a modeling and analysis tool that can be used to engineer high-performance, resilient, advanced control systems that enable autonomy, thereby freeing up human operators to focus on higher-level thinking and planning.  The research resulted in approximately seventy research publications in the world's top control systems journals and conferences.    For our mathematical modeling, some of the applications we developed during the grant included 1) automated dynamic positioning of marine vessels, 2) control over remote, digital communication channels, 3) coordination of multi-vehicle systems with advanced robust obstacle avoidance capabilities, 4) intelligent learning in self-optimizing systems, 5) adaptive pricing for systems that benefit society, 6) advanced optimization algorithms related to deep learning, and 7) rigorous analytical assessment of the behavior of chemical reaction networks.    The primary focus of the research was on development of the mathematics needed to understand how stochastic hybrid systems behave and how widely applicable these models can be to systems of interest to society.   For those unfamiliar with hybrid systems, they are systems that feature both continuous and digital aspects; they cover algorithms using discrete logic to control autonomous vehicles with continuously-valued positions and velocities, for example.  Stochastic systems are those that exhibit some randomness, either by design or by the influence of nature.   Stochastic hybrid systems involve randomness both in their continuous and digital aspects.   As a reult of the research carried out through this grant, we developed novel analysis tools to certify the desired behavior of general stochastic hybrid systems.  These tools have already been used by other researchers in various engineering applications.   The research carried out under this grant resulted in two Ph.D. dissertations.   One of those students went on to begin a career in industry while the other student became a professor at a major university in the USA.     The contributions of this research has set the stage for many future research developments that will assist with the ubiquity of resilient, assistive autonomy in dynamical systems that help society.
