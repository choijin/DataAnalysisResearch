<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project involving four institutions (University of California-San Diego, Oberlin College, University of California-Berkeley, and Swarthmore College) will develop a Concept Inventory (CI) for the second introductory programming course (CS2) in computer science.  CIs are validated assessments of course content knowledge, and can be used to compare teaching approaches, identify student misconceptions, and quantify learning gains.  In physics, the Force Concept Inventory was responsible for a widespread shift in the ways that physics students are taught.  The development of a CI for CS2 will have a similar impact on the way computer science will be taught across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will follow the CI development process established by Adams and Wieman, which has been used to develop CIs for many other sciences.  The process includes: consulting with a diverse expert panel to establish common CS2 content and identify core course concepts;  interviewing students to identify common misconceptions;  consulting with experts to create questions;  administering draft, open-ended questions to students;  statistically verifying the assessment;  and releasing the CI to the community. The project will also design a software system for creating and deploying CIs, and will make this software publicly available. The project team will hold training sessions on (1) using the CI to improve CS education, and (2) using the software to engage in further CI research.  Evaluation of the work will be overseen by an external evaluator who will validate the CI via student and faculty interviews.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[A Concept Inventory (CI) is a validated assessment to measure student conceptual understanding of a particular topic that can be used by researchers as a benchmark for comparing pedagogical techniques and by instructors to diagnose student difficulties in their courses.  Basic Data Structures is a core topic in computer science, often taught in the first year of upper-division undergraduate instruction and is so central to the field of computer science that it appears frequently in software engineering job interviews.   In the process of developing a Concept Inventory for Basic Data Structures, we published four peer-reviewed articles of value to the computing education community including: a set of agreed upon learning goals for Basic Data Structures, a review of the topics commonly taught in CS2 that uncovered that the term is inconsistently used by the community, and uncovered misconceptions held by students about Basic Data Structures.    Ultimately, the team created a validated instrument to measure student understanding of Basic Data Structures called the Basic Data Structures Inventory (BDSI).   The instrument was validated by interactions with a number of faculty who teach Basic Data Structures, with over 100 interviews with students, and through a statistical validation of the instrument based on piloting the instrument at 7 different institutions involving over 900 participants.  The instrument is now available publicly for use by the computing education community.   After producing the validated instrument, 75 faculty and researchers have requested access to the BDSI and it has already been used by programs to uncover student understanding.  For example, recent work by researchers at a Google-run program for underrepresented minority students in computer science used the BDSI to identify students? areas of strengths and weaknesses in order to provide targeted instruction.  Our team has also participated in outreach efforts to help gain awareness for the instrument in the computing education community and has produced a guide that describes the process for developing Concept Inventories in computing.
