<AbstractNarration>The focus of this project is on creating new techniques for understanding population analytics over a space of interest, e.g., a shopping mall, a busy street, or an entire city. Knowledge of population behavior important for many applications. For instance, knowledge of which are the busy corners of city sidewalk can provide city planners with input on where to invest city resources. Knowledge of where people congregate in a shopping mall allows officials to plan where to provide useful services, e.g., information kiosks, floor plans, and more. The process of gathering population analytics today is tedious -- some stores and shops use manual people counters to track how many persons are entering wireless technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical contributions of this project are two-fold. First, it is attempting to reduce the complexity of determining location of people by reducing the number of infrastructure points needed. Second, automated approaches to population analytics are fraught with privacy concerns, and this project is examining techniques that mitigate such concerns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personnel involved in this project will be trained in significant technical skills across a broad set of domains including wireless technologies, privacy techniques, and machine learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To demonstrate the feasibility of this project, the PI team is deploying a version of the system in an urban downtown area of Madison, WI. The team is collaborating with a number of local partners -- the city of Madison, the University of Wisconsin Bookstore, 5NINES (a local Internet Service Provider), and a few local participants. Together they are entering this technology demonstration as part of the Global City Teams Challenge being hosted by NSF and NIST.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this project has been better understand how to create analytics engines that can benefit transportation and city planners. The project utilizes low-cost sensors that are deployed in different locations, including vehicles, and using the sensed data, gathered from diverse such sources, systems can understand different properties of diverse systems. As a concrete example, the project defines methods that can monitor wireless signals in public transit vehicles to created detailed analytics of utilization of transit vehicles.

Other applications allow the system to describe how well different public spaces are being used and whether further investments in such spaces is worthwhile or not. Overall, the project suggests approaches to create such analytics engines for different applications, and opens up new possibilities of distributed sensing for the future.  Trials with developed systems were tried in different application domains. For example, a system called Trellis was deployed on multiple city buses in and around a mid-sized US city and it was used to understand how transit passengers use these buses over the course of the day, at different times of the year, and how factors such as changing weather conditions affect such behavior.
