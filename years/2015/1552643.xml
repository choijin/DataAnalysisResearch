<AbstractNarration>Making has been described as the next generation of innovation and do-it-yourself. Makers are an emergent group of imaginative inventors who value tinkering, hacking, re-making, and creating of technical artifacts. Makerspaces are places where these Makers gather in communities to learn from each other and create. There are some who believe that the Maker Movement can potentially lead to a resurgence of manufacturing job skills development as well as reshape engineering education. The Making community is diverse, encompassing informal learning in museum/library settings; Making in community spaces; university Makerspaces; engineering and science researchers who engage in Making; and education researchers who engage in Making. In order to reap the benefits of Making for the US manufacturing industry, it is necessary to understand the benefits of Making and how to advance the Maker Movement. This project will provide the initial baseline data needed to identify future directions in Making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop, launch, and analyze a survey on Making activities across the US. In an effort to leverage the knowledge acquired by those already active in the Maker Movement it is imperative that the various stakeholders learn from each other. The proposed survey will be used to gather information from the broad Maker Community to understand what Making means. Based on findings from the survey, a written report will be created and widely shared that highlights the state of the Maker Movement and how diverse Maker segments believe the Maker Movement can be best supported. This report will document how engineering schools and others are using Makerspaces and the perceived value of housing a Makerspace (e.g., pedagogical value, contribution to diversity, and contribution to retention. Findings from the Maker Survey report will serve as a potential baseline for new research inquiries into the Maker Movement and additional data collection and analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project surveyed engineering and engineering technology deans about how they think about Making, how Makerspaces are utilized on their campuses, how Making is used in their curriculum, and what positive student outcomes they attribute to Making.  A separate survey sent to the broader Maker community asked that population how it defines Making, how it finances and manages Makerspaces, and how it engages members of the community in Making.      Two papers summarized the survey results.  A conference paper titled "University Makerspaces: Characteristics and Impact on Student Success in Engineering and Engineering Technology Education" was published in the peer-reviewed American Society for Engineering Education conference proceedings. This paper focused on engineering and engineering technology deans? views of how Making contributes to positive student outcomes.  The paper was presented at the 2017 ASEE Annual Conference in Columbus, OH in a session through the Cooperative &amp; Experimental Education Division.    A report that summarizes the results from both surveys was made available on the ASEE website as a downloadable PDF and was distributed to ASEE members via email.  The report is titled "Advancing the Maker Movement: Making and Makerspaces at Engineering and Engineering Technology Schools and Departments and Outside the Engineering Academic Maker Community."  Some of the main findings from the surveys include:  &bull; Engineering deans, engineering technology deans, department chairs, and the non- Engineering academic Maker community all define Making as taking an idea or concept and creating it in material form. Engineering deans, engineering technology deans, and department chairs also defined Making as engaging students in hands-on engineering activities, while the non-Engineering academic Maker community defined Making as a community-oriented activity that is hobby-focused and brings personal satisfaction.  &bull; Most engineering deans, engineering technology deans, and department chairs reported having a Makerspace or multiple Makerspaces on campus. Those who reported having multiple Makerspaces are more likely to integrate Making into their curriculum and programs and were more likely to report positive student outcomes attributed to Making than respondents who reported one or no Makerspace on campus.  &bull; Not all engineering deans, engineering technology deans, and department chairs have the same view of what constitutes a Makerspace. While all respondents viewed designated spaces that housed 3D printers and scanners, laser cutters, or automatic and robotic systems as Makerspaces, some respondents did not view spaces that housed carpentry tools, machine shops, and fabrication labs as Makerspaces.  &bull; One suggestion from the non-Engineering academic Maker community on how to use Making to attract diverse students to engineering is to provide Making opportunities for K-12 students so they learn design and engineering processes like prototyping and testing, and to use Making as an opportunity to raise awareness among K-12 students of engineering as a profession and a field of study.
