<AbstractNarration>Nearly half of total annual construction costs are related to repair, replacement, and maintenance of existing infrastructure that have been deteriorated or damaged by environmental stress, structural loading, or other effects. The durability issues of structures can lead to a significantly higher life-cycle cost in comparison to the initial construction cost. The deficiencies of conventional concrete and subsequent impacts of the environment calls for a more durable material that will last longer under environmental stress, thereby contributing to the conservation of natural resources and the protection of ecosystem. Ultra-High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced Concrete (UHP-FRC) is the next generation of concrete material, which is six times stronger than conventional concrete, highly damage tolerant, fully ductile, and free of cracks under normal loadings. The very high compressive strength of UHP-FRC comes from its micro-mechanical design by the dense particle packing concept. The addition of discrete high-strength steel fibers considerably enhances its ductility and toughness.   UHP-FRC is a green concrete, environmentally friendly, and has the ability to create a durable infrastructure that is resilient and sustainable for the future of our country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will accelerate the introduction of UHP-FRC to potential areas of design and construction in need of a futuristic material that allows sustainability, workability, strength, durability, and resilience. The potential economic impact in construction will be evidently clear with UHP-FRC, because the strength and ductility of the UHP-FRC product will reduce the cost of reinforcement placement and reinforcement materials. This material will impact the markets in challenging architectural projects and constructability. This new technology will also reduce cost in repairs and maintenance by approximately 25% in comparison with conventional concrete. UHP-FRC has board applications in blast/impact/earthquake resistant structures, challenging architectural members, bridges and highways, railroads, and airport runways.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The market opportunity of applying ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHP-FRC) in niche market was investigated and researched through an I-Corps project (NSF Award No. IIP-1564926).We have interviewed 300+ people in the concrete industry for the purpose of finding issues and problems that could be solved by the value propositions of UHP-FRC. The team was able to identify clear customer segments which were validated during the course of the program. The customer segments were: fa&ccedil;ade manufacturers in need of lighter materials, precast manufacturers for structural concrete products (i.e. underground precast product), precast manufacturers of architectural products (i.e. insulated exterior thin walls), general contractors who build infrastructure systems (i.e. sound walls, double tees, tilt-up construction), and municipalities that need a reliable concrete products for a faster and more sustainable repair of the infrastructure. Furthermore, the search for information related to concrete issues took the team to explore different customer segments even in countries outside the U.S.; such as the tunneling market where contractors search for a thinner and stronger shotcrete material for tunnel lining. We also visited other countries for the market-fit analysis including Canada, Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, Peru, Italy, and Brazil. The information collected in this I-Corps project for the worldwide market-fit analysis of UHP-FRC was obtained from conferences, trade shows, face-to-face interviews, online interviews, phone interviews, meeting with contractors, material suppliers, influencers (engineers &amp; architects), decision makers (CEO, COO, CFO, etc.), local, state, and federal governments in the U.S. and abroad. This primary information was used to validate the market opportunity, value propositions, and to further research different customer segments.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/27/2017<br>      Modified by: Shih-Ho&nbsp;Chao</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1564926/1564926_10401986_1498593938960_DSC02341--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1564926/1564926_10401986_1498593938960_DSC02341--rgov-800width.jpg" title="UHPFRC Facade Panel"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1564926/1564926_10401986_1498593938960_DSC02341--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="UHPFRC Facade Panel"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">UHP-FRC facade panel</div> <div class="imageCredit">Shih-Ho Chao</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Shih-Ho&nbsp;Chao</div> <div class="imageTitle">UHPFRC Facade Panel</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
