<AbstractNarration>The goal of the research project is to describe the features of selective alternative teacher certification programs (ATCPs) that affect selective route mathematics teachers' (SRMT) professional pathways and to make informed recommendations to decrease the current high teacher turnover. While selective ATCPs are intended to address issues of teacher staffing and quality by recruiting high achieving graduates of the nation's most competitive colleges and career changers with impressive resumes, there is little understanding about the reasons for their mixed outcomes. Thus, the proposed project will utilize a multi-methodological longitudinal design that incorporates cultural-mathematical and sociological perspectives to 1) determine patterns of career trajectories of a representative sample of SRMTs and 2) examine how variations in the features of a selective ATCP affect SRMT retention.  The results of the study will be useful to various stakeholders, including policymakers, district and school leaders, and directors of urban-specific teacher preparation programs by clarifying patterns in the career trajectories of SRMTs while also revealing how to retain them..     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is framed by the literature on teacher turnover, alternative teacher certification programs, and teachers' professional life cycles. It is guided also by  two theoretical perspectives, namely a sociological careership perspective used to examine SRMTs' career trajectories and a cultural-mathematical perspective that identifies the features of selective ATCPs that influence SMRT retention.  The researchers will combine new survey and interview data with previously collected data on New York City Teaching Fellows (NYCTF) to produce findings that could inform the development of mathematics teacher preparation programs and interventions for an improved urban mathematics teaching force.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is supported by the ECR program that emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.  ECR supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research speaks to a major policy initiative for mathematics teacher preparation. Selective alternative route programs (SARPs) are responsible for educating large percentages of mathematics teachers for schools serving primarily students of color. This project builds on a multi-methodological study that includes a strong qualitative component. Without such a component, it is difficult to provide nuanced explanations or to uncover phenomena that challenge taken-for-granted assumptions. Using both longitudinal case studies of Math Teaching Fellows (MTFs) and longitudinal survey data of over 600 MTFs, this is a multifaceted examination of The New Teacher Project's (TNTP's) NYC Teaching Fellows, instituted in 2000.</p> <p>This research indicates that NYCTF has largely failed to close gaps in teacher effectiveness, retention, quality, and diversity that it was designed to close. Across multiple indicators, it is clear that this is due to flaws in its theory of action and also fidelity of implementation (Brantlinger &amp; Cooley, 2017; Brantlinger, Grant, Miller, Viviani, Cooley, Griffin, 2020; Cooley, Brantlinger, Hannaford-Simpson, Shahid, 2019). MTFs enter under-resourced, segregated schools with little preparation in mathematics or methods and quickly find themselves in crisis situations (Cooley, Hannaford-Simpson, Shahid, 2020; Cooley, 2019). TNTP's curriculum materials normalized a racial ideology that pushed for under-prepared teachers to quickly ameliorate testing gaps through a "no excuses" approach (Cooley &amp; Brantlinger, under review). NYCTF has effectively altered the math teacher population, making it whiter and more elite (Brantlinger, Cooley, Griffen, 2019).</p> <p>This study adds to evidence that elite college graduates are not better teachers than those they teach alongside (Brantlinger, Cooley, Miller, Griffin, under review; Brantlinger &amp; Griffen, 2019). Meritocratic myths fuel the growth of SARPs (Brantlinger, 2019). Analysis demonstrates how elite academic credentials allow for presumed math teacher proficiencies. However, such credentials do not guarantee deep mathematics knowledge nor good teaching. In spite of acclaim from higher-ups, MTFs demonstrated procedural teaching styles, held superficial mathematical understandings, regularly made errors, and struggled to coherently answer students' questions (Cooley, Brantlinger, Hannaford-Simpson, Shahid, 2019).</p> <p>SARPs have a powerful impact on low-income, segregated schools and the collective imagination of educational policymaking communities. SARPs remain a key component in districts' efforts to address staffing and teacher quality. This aggregate research provides insights into classroom experiences, MTFs' preparation, supervisors' views of MTFs, and the schools in which most MTFs begin teaching. It also considers broader sociopolitical factors that contextualize how SARPs are introduced and normalized. Analyzing quantitative and qualitative research together, this body of work lays out advances in understanding MTFs while also pointing to the need for more research on the impact of SARPs on mathematics education.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>References:</p> <p>Brantlinger, A.
