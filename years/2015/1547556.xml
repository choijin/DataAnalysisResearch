<AbstractNarration>The Earth is a dynamic evolving body, driven by heat sources deep within and enabled by the plastic character of the materials that make up the Earth. As observers on the outer skin of the Earth, even after four and a half billion years, we see constant reminders of this evolution in the form of earthquakes and volcanoes. Even the distinction between ocean and continent owes its origin to this dynamic process. This study is focused on the enabler of this process - the plastic nature of what we consider hard rocks. Over long times at elevated pressure and temperature, rocks behave as liquids. In recent years, tools have evolved that allow us to measure the viscous character of these hard objects at pressures and temperatures that one finds deep in the Earth. These experiments are built around a synchrotron facility that has been built at a national lab. The investigators will use both the National Synchrotron Light Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. This study will help our understanding of this dynamic evolution of the Earth.  A graduate student will be supported and will participate in this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MgSiO3 in the perovskite crystal structure (bridgmanite) is the most abundant mineral in the Earth and it's calcium counterpart (CaSiO3) is among the five most abundant minerals. The plastic nature of these minerals defines the fluid character of the deep Earth. These properties are both pressure and temperature dependent, and as of yet, unknown. Knowledge of these properties along with proposed temperature models can help constrain dynamics of the Earth evolution and current state. The plastic properties of these minerals is particularly interesting because these minerals are composed of silicon in six coordination with oxygen, while the bulk of materials studied to date have silicon in four coordination with oxygen. The investigating team proposes to study the mechanical properties of these minerals at conditions of pressure and temperature appropriate to the deep Earth. They will focus on defining a quantitative flow law that expresses the plastic properties of these materials. The plasticity of lower mantle minerals at lower mantle conditions of pressure and temperature has been beyond the experimental reach. This has left us with little mineral-based knowledge of the effective viscosity of the lower mantle at the conditions of the anticipated geotherm. Development of new deformation equipment enables a new effort to characterize the quantitative flow law of the high pressure phases at the extremes of pressure and temperature of the top of the lower mantle. This proposal is to study both the Mg and the Ca end-member silicate perovskite at these conditions. This is made possible by a new facility being installed at the new synchrotron, NSLS II, at the Brookhaven National Laboratories. The new facility will provide world class synchrotron X-ray light for these experiments with a new DT25 guideblock in a 1000 ton hydraulic press with deformation capabilities. Using standard X-ray diffraction and imaging tools, the team will be able to define stress and strain rate in the sample at the extreme conditions.</AbstractNarration>

MgSiO3in the perovskite crystal structure (bridgmanite) is the most abundant mineral in the Earth and it?s calcium counter-part is among the five most abundant minerals.  MgO as periclase is the final primary mineral in the lower mantle. We iniated study the mechanical properties of these minerals at conditions of pressure and temperature appropriate to the top of the lower mantle.    Rheology of the lower mantle minerals at lower mantle conditions of pressure and temperature has been beyond the experimental reach.  This has left us with little mineral-based knowledge of the effective viscosity of the lower mantle at the conditions of the anticipated geotherm.  Development of new deformation equipment enable a new effort to characterize the quantitative flow law of the high pressure phases at the extremes of pressure and temperature of the top of the lower mantle. This study focused on the Ca end-member silicate perovskite at these conditions.    The first step was the installation of the new equipment at the new synchrotron, NSLS II, at the Brookhaven National Laboratories. The new facility now provides world class synchrotron X-ray light for these experiments with a new DT25, the first in the world, guideblock in a 1000 ton hydraulic press with deformation capabilities.  The DT25 is a Kawai type apparatus with the capablity of attaining the necessary pressures and temperatures with deformation capabilities.  Using standard X-ray diffraction and imaging tools, we define stress and strain rate in the sample as a function of time at the extreme conditions.  Installation included:  1) Setting up the press and guideblock in the hutch in the correct position to accept the synchrotron beam  2) Installing and implementing computer controls on all of the motors.    3) Creating the high pressure anvil/sample cell tool box.  We needed to define the optimal combination of tungsten carbide and sintered diamond that were robust to sustain the high pressures and yet keep the cost (of the expendible anvils) down.  We sought to create a sample cell that would not contribute to the x-ray diffraction pattern and perhaps obscure the sample pattern.  We developed a method to make amorphous boron plus epoxy cells in octahedral shape of the correct dimensions.  4) Create computer based experimental protocol for conducting a deformation experiment.  This integrates the mechanical action on the sample and the data collection and storrage.    With all of these are in place and operating, we are able to conduct rheological experiments at mantle pressures and temperatures.  We have succeeded in creating Ca perovskite in situ and deforming it at high P and T.  The flow strength at a strain rate of about 3x10^-5 per second is about 3 GPa at 1000K.  This is the first measured strength of this material measured at high temperature.  We have also created a toolbox of techniques and software to characterize the elastic/plastic properties of high pressure phases in their P-T stability fields. These tools are available at synchrotron beamlines where they were developed to all users of the facilities.
