<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to finalize the design of an office-based implant for permanent relief of urinary obstruction related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH or enlarged prostate). This condition affects over 14 million men in the US and imposes a significant quality of life burden. Established treatments include only drugs, which have limited efficacy, and surgery, which has a high complication risk. The investigational device is intended to provide permanent symptom relief in a ten-minute procedure under local anesthesia, at a cost far lower than all existing options. Expected pricing based on established reimbursement codes suggests a $3-4 billion annual market opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project involves finalizing design of the aforementioned implantable device and its deployment system. The device must be easily deployable, provide sufficient circumferential force to hold back the prostate, fit within the delivery system without excessive strain or the potential for damage, and carry a low risk of adverse events. Bench tests, cadaver studies, and animal studies will drive device design to ensure satisfaction of these aims.</AbstractNarration>

The walnut-sized prostate gland surrounds the male urethra just below the bladder outlet. As the prostate progressively enlarges with age, it encroaches on the urethra and obstructs the flow of urine from the bladder, leading to urinary straining, frequency, urgency, and nocturia. These symptoms result in significant quality of life issues, including sleep disturbance, psychological burden, and disruption of social life and sexual activity. In the US, an estimated 40% of men over 50 and 90% over 80 have BPH, and the majority of these men will require treatment. An estimated 37 million men in the US and 500 million men worldwide suffer from BPH-related LUTS.</p> <p>Existing solutions fail to address the clinical need for a large percentage of patients. Drugs often have limited effectiveness and side effects such as loss of libido, and surgical solutions typically involve a painful, invasive procedure and carry a high risk of permanent sexual dysfunction. Minimally invasive attempts have not gained widespread traction due to a&nbsp;difficult user experience, complications, inadequate long-term effectiveness, and/or high cost.</p> <p>The Zenflow Spring System represents a new paradigm in BPH treatment: a safe, effective, cost-efficient, office-based therapy that provides durable symptom relief in a single procedure without complications.
