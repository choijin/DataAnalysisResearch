<AbstractNarration>With the recent advances in integrated circuit technology, devices and their operating voltages will continue to shrink. This aggressive scaling trend has the consequence of drastically reducing the total number of electrons on each circuit node, making the circuit much more susceptible to thermal noise making new approaches to estimating noise behavior in these circuits necessary.  Also the need for error mitigation resulting from such noise is especially pressing for logic circuits operating using very low supply voltages, designed for ultra-low power applications, where higher error rates are expected due to the reduced noise margins. The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students, include members of underrepresented groups and will thus help enlarge the workforce in information and communication technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address the noise immunity of ultimately scaled silicon based logic through three interrelated thrusts. The first thrust will focus on the experimentally validated prediction of thermally induced and voltage-noise induced error rates in these circuits. The second thrust involves development of a new simulation framework for analyzing transient effects due to noise.  This new framework will be capable of capturing rare failure-inducing events 1 to 3 orders of magnitude faster than conventional simulation techniques. Based on the findings obtained from these two initial thrusts, new noise-immune logic gate structures that confer additional noise margin will be developed. Moreover, these results will be used to design a new synthesis tool flow, that automatically determines where and how to optimally use these noise-immune logic gates to reach desired delay, power, and reliability requirements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A major advantage of silicon-based digital circuits is their relatively high signal-to-noise ratio, making them resilient to various sources of error. Even so, their error resiliency is being challenged by the increasing impact of intrinsic noise and the increasing variability of manufacturing process parameters. While transistors manufactured in current technology processes are still not affected by thermal noise, this has been identified as one of the fundamental factors that will lead to the end of technology scaling.  Moreover, random telegraph signal (RTS) noise, a phenomenon related to the trapping and de-trapping of carriers in the gate oxide, has become a growing concern for digital circuit designers.   Time-domain noise analysis provides a detailed description of the dynamic response of a circuit in the presence of noise and may be used as a guide in designing noise-immune circuitry.  However, state-of-the-art time-domain thermal noise simulators are computationally very costly, especially, if the goal is to observe rare fault-inducing noise transients.  Yet, it is important to understand the impact of these small fluctuations, especially for circuits operating at sub-threshold supply voltages.  Moreover, accurately modeling thermal noise in sequential elements is especially critical since these fluctuations may lead to bit flips in memory cells, thereby compromising the reliability of the entire integrated circuit.  Alternative noise-immune circuit designs will need to be considered to overcome potential challenges with fundamental noise.  To address these challenges, we have modeled noise directly in the time domain using stochastic differential equations (SDEs) based on Poissonian current flows. The resulting logic simulator allowed us to accurately simulate thermally induced noise transients with speedup of up to three orders of magnitude compared to traditional commercially available simulators. We model RTS noise in the simulation framework by integrating the effect of carrier trapping and de-trapping events with the Poisson charging rates of circuit nodes. In addition, we introduced a novel iterative algorithm to detect exponentially rare transient events and memory cell bit-flip errors that would be impossible to estimate with conventional simulation methods.  By extending our simulation framework to handle memory cells, we have shown that the commonly used mean time to error (MTTE) metric is not an informative measure of memory cell reliability.   Instead, we introduced a new, single-parameter measure of memory reliability as the time required for the probability of a single-bit error to reach 50% from a state with all bits at valid values.  Using parameter values from a 7nm predictive technology model, we ran several experiments with our simulator to evaluate how this measure of memory cell reliability is affected by lowered supply voltage, increased process variability, and temperature increase. Our results offer a way to assess when a circuit with aggressive device scaling coupled with lowered supply voltages will have a given probability of failure. This allows a designer to find the minimum supply voltages and the required manufacturing tolerances that will result in a predetermined level of reliability.  Finally, our simulation framework can be adapted to other technology nodes or other sources of noise and provides a means of evaluating trade-offs in the robust design of ultra-low-power memory cell design.  We also investigated alternative gate structures to reinforce correct behavior in the presence of thermal noise.  Prior research has used logic implications effectively for online error detection and correction.  In particular, error correction has been implemented by translating the logic relationship described by an implication using a modified version of a standard Schmitt trigger gate.  To extend implication-based error correction beyond prior works, we proposed new gates that provide more flexible use of implications by considering both single-node and 2-node implications.  The new gate structures require lower transistor overhead than Schmitt gate reinforcement.  Our simulation results show improved noise-immunity with 2-node implications, plus our gates can provide more robust error correction than the Schmitt gate when noise appears at the output of the gate. However, the Schmitt gate remains an attractive choice when the controlling signals for the implication are themselves susceptible to significant noise.  Operating at ideal conditions, intrinsic noise sources alone are unlikely to endanger the correct functionality of circuits, even when operating at subthreshold supply voltages.  However, since intrinsic error rates can change dramatically with device mismatches and lower supply voltages, designers will have to consider fundamental noise in their future circuit designs.   Just the sheer number of gates that can be integrated on a single chip will mean the probability of occasional errors occurring due to intrinsic noise could indeed be significant.   This project had provided several research opportunities for postdocs, as well as graduate and undergraduate students (several of them women and/or members of historically underrepresented groups). The students had several opportunities to present their work in conferences, journals, and invited talks.  These students are now employed in jobs in industry and tenure-track faculty positions.          Last Modified: 07/23/2020       Submitted by: Ruth I Bahar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
