<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support travel for up to 5 students enrolled in PhD programs in U.S. institutions, to present their accepted papers and posters and/or to attend the Doctoral Consortium associated with the 23rd International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP 2015), to be held in Dublin, Ireland, June 29 through July 3.  User interfaces that adapt themselves to available user information (such as special needs or individual preferences) are becoming increasingly important, so much so that adaptability has become a selling point for software products.  A system with the ability to construct and consult a user model (an explicit representation of properties of a particular user or group of users) can adapt diverse aspects of its performance and enhance its effectiveness, usability and/or acceptance in a variety of situations (e.g., to reduce information overload, to improve the quality of information retrieval, filtering and annotation, and to generate useful information visualizations).  Applications for user modeling range from electronic commerce and intelligent learning environments to health care and assistive technologies.  Relevant platforms for user modeling include mobile and wearable systems and smart environments, as well as individual desktop systems, groupware, adaptive hypermedia, and other web-based systems.  The annual UMAP conference is the premier forum at which academic and industrial researchers from all these fields gather to exchange their complementary insights on user modeling issues.  More information about the conference is available online at http://www.um.org/umap2015/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attending and presenting their work at UMAP will have a significant impact on the careers of the future generation of user modeling, adaptation, and personalization researchers.  First, they will have the opportunity to present their work to a knowledgeable audience and through lively discussions get useful comments at an early stage of their research when it will be most useful.  Just as importantly, they will have a chance to meet established researchers and other graduate students doing similar work, to exchange ideas and to make contacts that will be invaluable to them as they progress in their scientific careers.  Interacting with young researchers is also beneficial to experienced investigators, by providing fresh ideas and new perspectives.  Thus, the Doctoral Consortium is a great confidence builder for the students involved, and highly stimulating to the senior researchers as well.  Many past participants in the UMAP Doctoral Consortium have gone on to become well-regarded researchers and practitioners in the field.  Students whose work has been selected for presentation at the Doctoral Consortium will benefit from that experience in a number of additional ways.   They will be invited to write a paper that will be published in the UMAP 2015 conference proceedings. They will have 15 minutes to present their work (which may include a short demonstration if appropriate), to be followed by an additional 15 minutes for questions and discussion.  During both the question/discussion period and in subsequent informal interactions, organizing committee members and other participants will provide constructive comments on each student's work and attempt to address aspects on which the student has requested advice.  The organizers have reaffirmed the long-standing and demonstrated UMAP commitment to diversity; to this end, they will make special efforts to recruit participants who are women and members of under-represented groups, and they will ensure institutional diversity by supporting no more than one student from any given university.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the project was to provide travel support for PhD students enrolled in U.S. based institutions to attend the ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP). The support provided was limited to U.S. students who had accepted papers and posters or who were invited to present at the Doctoral Consortium associated with the conference.  The annual International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization is the primary conference series in the field of User Modeling, User-Adaptive Software Systems and Personalization.  Active participation of young researchers in this conference is very important for the health of the field and for the researchers themselves. By providing the support necessary for students to attend and present at the conference, the field as whole receives a significant benefit that goes beyond the impact on the students, themselves.  Furthermore, user modeling and personalization are highly interdisciplinary fields. Many of the researchers who make up the UMAP community, also regularly publish in a variety of other forums related to topics such as: data mining, recommender systems, user interfaces, human-computer interaction, educational systems, and others. Thus, the work supported by this conference and its participants, also helps support and advance research in many other related areas.  In total, the funds helped support seven students from five different institutions to attend UMAP conferences between 2015 and 2017. In addition, a student at the host institution was provided partial support to attend a related conferences on recommender systems in 2016 and 2017. The papers presented by these students all had students as primary authors and, in one case, the recipient of the conference best paper award.  All supported students were able to present their results in front of an audience of top experts and professionals in the field of user modeling and personalization. In addition to gaining valuable experience in developing their presentation and communication skills, the interaction with an international group of colleagues, who can provide critical feedback, represents an important part of the professional development of these students.  The results of the students' research have been published in the conference proceedings and are availlable on the ACM Digital Library.
