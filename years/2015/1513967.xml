<AbstractNarration>Simulated virtual prototypes have removed much trial-and-error from the design process in many fields.  But to be useful as a virtual prototype, a simulation must reliably predict the relevant characteristics of the thing being designed: strength for a bridge; lift for an aircraft, or appearance for a fabric.  Previous advances in rendering have led to a current explosion in the use of rendered images to prototype the appearance of objects, and even to represent them to customers, but only where the materials involved can be represented well.  Textiles are currently difficult to represent, due to their intricate construction and subtle reflectance, and because their appearance is inextricably linked to their shape and motion.  Although fairly suitable for movies, the state of the art in simulating cloth appearance and deformation is not predictive of real appearance and therefore not usable in a design process, in which realistic but inaccurate results are useless.  This project, which represents a collaborative effort between computer scientists at Cornell University and textile designers at the Rhode Island School of Design, aims to create the predictive simulation tools needed to enable virtual prototyping to revolutionize the textile and garment industries in the same way it has already revolutionized so many fields of manufacturing.  New models and algorithms created by the Cornell team will be integrated into the Loomit tool for fabric design, which will then be used by the RISD team to produce new textiles that will in turn be shipped back to Cornell where changes in the RISD design process resulting from Loomit's enhanced capabilities will be studied.  At RISD this involvement will engage many student artists and designers, helping them develop the skills to work with increasingly technological media in their future careers, while at Cornell the project will afford computer science students experience understanding and solving problems faced by artists and designers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Textiles remain a challenge for appearance simulation because of many unsolved fundamental problems.  The state-of-the-art models for realistic cloth rendering and simulation were developed for entertainment applications and do not accurately predict the behavior of real textiles.  In this project, the PI team will compare appearance and deformation models to measurements of textiles from CT, imaging, and other modalities, then improve them as needed so that they are capable of fitting real materials.  Current methods cannot capture the properties of an existing fabric well enough to predict its appearance under close visual inspection.  The PI team will develop new methods for jointly capturing the appearance and mechanical properties of textiles, combining measurement and model tuning to produce predictive working models of textiles and the garments and furnishings made from them.  Detailed cloth simulations and renderings are currently impractical for moderately complex objects, such as complete garments.  Scalability fundamentally requires multi-scale models that simulate details only when they are actually needed.  The PI team will create multi-scale models that enable interactive, predictive visualization during the design process.  Since the targeted applications all require accurate prediction, a major focus of the research is on validation, testing both the accuracy of the individual technical pieces and the ultimate usefulness of the new techniques in actual use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated several topics in computer modeling of textiles: methods for high-fidelity rendering; physical simulations of small-scale internal structure; and tools for creating textiles.  Textiles are used in a large fraction of manufactured products, from clothing and footwear to cars and aircraft.  The technologies developed in this project for design, modeling, and rendering of textiles have taken large strides towards making computation an essential partner in designing and making objects with textiles, which will improve efficiency and quality in design and manufacturing across all these industries.  The highest quality renderings of cloth come from detailed simulations of light interaction with the small-scale structure of woven or knitted yarns, and advances were made both in quality, by proposing and evaluating different ways to model both the arrangement of fibers and the light scattering they cause, and in speed, by leveraging precomputation to make rendering far more efficient..  These renderings require models for yarn and fiber structure, which have formerly come either from procedural models or CT scans.  The project developed new techniques and software to unify these approaches and move towards unifying the convenience of procedural modeling with the high fidelity of CT scans.  To model yarn structure, new methods and software were built to efficiently simulate the mechanics of yarns and predict the yarn-scale internal structure of textiles, as well as tools for validating the results against CT scans.  To model fiber structure, new ways were developed to calibrate procedural models against CT data and to generate them on the fly during rendering, to avoid otherwise prohibitive memory usage.  These developments make progress towards the goal of directly rendering textiles from manufacturing instructions.  This is a key need for virtual textile design, and the final stage of this project developed new systems for creating fabrics, making use of simulations as part of the design process.  The Weavecraft 3D textile design system allows users to design complex 3D woven textiles, which are used today for fiber-reinforced composites but have potential for broad application in footwear and soft goods, with full support of a 3D CAD system and a simulation of the fabric structure.  Built on top of this system, the Weaveprint system for automatic 3D textile fabrication is able to automatically convert desired shapes to 3D woven objects.  Together, these design tools substantially reduce the barriers to using 3D weaving in a wide range of applications.  The three thrusts of this project have substantially advanced the state of the art in textile modeling and prototyping.
