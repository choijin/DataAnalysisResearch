<AbstractNarration>The success of any complex software-intensive system is highly dependent on the extent to which it addresses stakeholders' quality concerns such as reliability, availability, security and performance. Software architects utilize a rich set of proven and re-usable architectural solutions such as tactics and patterns to satisfy each specific quality attribute.  The objective of this research project is to develop a novel tactic-recommender system that is trained through learning from the source code of thousands of open-source software systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will include developing a set of novel big-data compatible architecture profilers that ?detect? and ?learn? architectural choices made by several developers across source codes of thousands of open-source systems. This knowledge is used to recommend architectural tactics fitting a new project.  This represents a paradigm shift in utilizing automated techniques to bring design thinking into developers? daily coding activities.  Unlike existing architecture design practices, which all involve a rigorous upfront analysis of the system's quality concerns, this research takes a bottom-up approach. It uses the latent domain topics in the source code and identifies not only architectural tactics/patterns missing in a given project but also recommends several high quality sample implementations of the tactics/patterns from open source software projects.  The findings of this research will partially address the current gap between design and implementation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the work will be to improve the productivity of software development and to improve the quality and evolvability of software-intensive systems.</AbstractNarration>
