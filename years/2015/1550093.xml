<AbstractNarration>1550093&lt;br/&gt;Wendell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current pollution source identification methods focus on tracking bacteria associated with the human gut, but many of these bacterial indicators also thrive in the environment and reside in multiple other mammalian hosts. It is now widely accepted that coliform bacteria are unreliable for source tracking due to their ability to survive for extended periods of time in the environment, making it difficult to distinguish the source or timing of a contamination event. This project proposes a new approach for precise source identification through human mitochondrial hypervariable region II DNA which is a new and potentially transformative approach to combating fecal contamination in drinking water. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work extends the PI's recent human mitochondrial hypervariable region II source tracking study to a particularly unique and important ecosystem the coastal waters of Lord Howe Island (Australia). Lord Howe Island is recorded as a UNESCO world heritage site of global natural significance with a relatively small population (less than 1000) and is slated to undergo renovations to an aging septic wastewater infrastructure. The benefits of this sampling location are 3 fold: 1) a limited population should produce a tractable number of human mitochondrial hypervariable region II sequences, enabling a more discrete linkage between human waste source and coastal water contamination, 2) identifying impacting septic tanks will enable cost effective remediation for resource limited residents of Lord Howe Island, and, 3) Lord Howe Island is an ecosystem of global significance. The hypothesis of this proposal is that sequencing human mitochondrial DNA from impacted environmental water can definitively source and quantify pollution contributors. Unlike ambiguous bacterial assays, conclusive sourcing will enable mitigation of waste related sources and health risks. That is, human mitochondrial DNA enabled source identification can be achieved through sequence information found in the human mitochondrial hypervariable region II region, an approach more commonly used in criminal forensic analysis and anthropologic phylogenetics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding wastewater transport and the fate of anthropogenic inputs in the environment is essential to mitigating pollution.  Human DNA in the environment presents a unique resource to identify wastewater sources, with mitochondrial DNA providing the most abundant target. Since human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is usually in relatively low abundance compared to microbial markers, it was not unknown if the hyper-variable region of the mitochondrial genome could be used a as a reliable fate and transport indicator in more rural environments, where wastewater may be more dilute and/or mixed with other waste streams.  From this research human mtDNA was found in water that is used recreationally and groundwater with proximity to septic tanks, indicating that it can be used as a robust indicator for a variety of environmental water sources.  Because the hyper variable region is linked to the individuals contributing the waste, DNA sequencing can reveal the fate and transport of human DNA in the environment providing a directly human tracer/indicator unavailable with other biological markers.  Preliminary hierarchal cluster analysis showed that 2 sampling sites most geographically separated were the most similar in mitochondrial DNA profile.  Beach sampling locations in between these 2 locations clustered at a longer Euclidean distance, with the most distant being a central groundwater site.  These results provide evidence that human mitochondrial DNA is a valuable source tracking molecular target in both an urban and rural environment.  Where a tractable number of mitochondrial DNA sequences can be recovered, fate and transport of the wastewater containing this DNA can allow for a more detailed model of wastewater transport in the environment, including both surface and groundwater sources.
