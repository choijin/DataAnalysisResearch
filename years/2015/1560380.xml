<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Tufts University, located in Medford, MA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2016-2018. The program, "Integrative approaches to studying recognition systems in cells, organisms, and populations" will provide students the opportunity to work closely on collaborative, interdisciplinary projects combining faculty expertise in biochemistry, genetics, development, endocrinology, neurobiology, behavior, ecology, and conservation. Students will work with two mentors to design and conduct independent projects. In addition to research, the program includes weekly discussions, seminars, field trips, and two student symposia. The goals of this summer program are to increase students' proficiency in biological research and collaborative skills, to educate and inspire students toward future research careers, and to develop students' ability to effectively communicate scientific results. Accordingly, seminars are focused on proficiency in communication of scientific results, scientific ethics and the responsible conduct of research, and career development. Participants are selected from a broad undergraduate applicant pool, with special efforts to providing research opportunities for students underrepresented in science and those who might not have such opportunities at their home institutions (e.g., community college students).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. The Department of Biology has a long-standing commitment to mentoring undergraduates in research, and a strong track record of highly productive interdisciplinary research collaborations. Student-mentor relationships typically extend beyond the research experience and are facilitated via electronic networking tools. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences and/or in scientific papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine student career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/undergraduate/research/reu.htm, or by contacting Dr. Phil Starks at REU@tufts.edu.</AbstractNarration>
