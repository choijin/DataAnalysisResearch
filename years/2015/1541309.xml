<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) is an annual event, and is the most widely-attended gathering of experts from the signal processing community. In 2016, it will take place in Shanghai, China. Historically, about 25% of the ICASSP participants have been students. This is a very healthy statistic because the future of this all-pervasive discipline is largely determined by the number of young people adopting signal processing as their field of endeavor. Many of the students are coauthors of accepted papers and presenters at the conference. For them, ICASSP is a unique opportunity to meet many of the leaders in the field and to broaden their horizons by being exposed to areas of research different from their own. The conference is also an excellent opportunity for them to start networking with people who will likely be their future collaborators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately is expected that the number of US-based students attending the conference in Shanghai will be smaller than usual. This is largely due to the high travel costs to get to Shanghai from North America. This proposal aims at providing travel support for some of these students, hence, insuring better representation of US students at ICASSP 2015.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The travel grant for ICASSP 2016 was intended to support 50 US-based students, who were the first author and the presenter of an accepted paper, which was ranked among the top 50 of the papers whose authors compete for travel support. The grant selection committee received 87 applications. The papers were ranked based on the average reviewer score. The committee made the award to the top 50 students, together with a few students on the waiting list. The grant was provided on a reimbursement basis.   Due to visa problems and health issues, overall, 48 US-based students received the travel grant provided by NSF. The students benefited from the unique opportunity provided by ICASSP,   by meeting many of the leaders in the field, broadening their horizons by getting exposed to areas of research different from their own, and networking with people who might be their future collaborators. Students also got chances to meet representatives from industry who provided introductions of their companies and job openings, and to participate in initial interviews and recruitment.  The NSF supported travel grant had critical impacts on the career development of the awardees, and made significant contributions to workforces development in the broad area of signal processing.
