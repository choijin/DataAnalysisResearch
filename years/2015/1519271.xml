<AbstractNarration>Waves in which buoyancy is the restoring force are referred to as gravity waves, and such waves are ubiquitous in the atmosphere.  They occur over a broad range of spatial scales but are generally smaller than the frontal weather systems seen on weather maps.  They can be generated by a variety of mechanisms including air flow over mountains, the formation of frontal systems, and the vertical motions that accompany convection.  Despite their relatively small size, they are thought to play an important role in the atmospheric circulation due to their vertical flux of horizontal momentum, through which they drive the quasi-biennial oscillation in the equatorial stratosphere, modulate the strength of the midlatitude jet streams, and alter the strength of the stratospheric polar vortices, thereby playing a role in the seasonal evolution of the Southern Hemisphere ozone hole.  But the small size of the waves and their relatively rapid propagation make it difficult to observe them and examine their generation, propagation, and impacts on the mean flow. Moreover, the waves cannot generally be simulated by global weather and climate models due to their small size, and instead they must represented through parameterizations which estimate their aggregate effects as a function of the resolved flow.  While these parameterizations have become quite sophisticated, their validity is difficult to establish, and common circulation biases in models are often ascribed to inadequacies of the gravity wave parameterizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work under this award specifically addresses gravity waves generated by convection, motivated by recent observations from balloons and satellites suggesting that that large amplitude gravity waves, of the sort that come from vigorous, small-scale deep convection, account for a larger fraction of the gravity wave momentum flux than previously assumed.  Further motivation comes from the availability of the record of tropical convection from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM), a satellite record which is now over a dozen years long and can be used to estimate the generation of gravity waves by tropical and subtropical convection.  The data is used in conjunction with the gravity wave parameterization from the Community Atmosphere Model, along with observational wind and atmospheric stability data, to estimate the generation, propagation, and momentum flux of convectively generated gravity wave activity.  The momentum flux is then compared with estimates calculated from the satellite record of atmospheric temperature from the satellite record of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS).  The goal of this effort is to reconcile the large-scale patterns in gravity wave activity observed in the tropics and subtropics with existing knowledge of their convective sources, based on a theoretical understanding of their propagation and mean flow interaction.  The reconciliation is expected to require some ad hoc adjustment of free parameters in the parameterization scheme, and the PIs will conduct further experiments to determine how this "tuning" of the parameterization affects the large-scale atmospheric simulation produced by the model.  Some work will also consider  the generation of gravity waves by convection occurring in the storm tracks of the middle latitudes, using other data sources to estimate convection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has broader impacts due to the need for accurate gravity wave parameterizations in weather and climate models. These models are widely used as research tools for a variety of applications, and are also used to provide information to first responders, decision makers, and the general public.  In addition, the project supports and trains a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When clouds precipitate, latent heat is released into the atmosphere, generating gravity waves that can propagate long distances from their sources. When and where the waves break, they drive changes in remote circulation patterns and cause turbulent mixing.  Global models used for climate prediction seek to represent these circulation effects of gravity waves that emanate from precipitating clouds, but due to limitations on computing power and model resolution the waves themselves cannot be resolved.  Instead, the global models must use approximate methods, called gravity wave drag parameterizations (GWDP), to estimate the circulation changes driven by gravity wave breaking.  This NSF-funded project used theoretical models and observations of both gravity waves and precipitating clouds to test existing GWDP methods in the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) climate models, and to identify ways to improve their realism.  An important focus of our work was on realistic variability at timescales ranging from intra-seasonal to inter-annual.   Results from this research identified strong rain storms over South Pacific islands as important sources of atmospheric gravity waves with significant effects on intra-seasonal circulation changes at upper levels in the stratosphere.    The research also revealed how inter-annual shifts in tropical precipitation associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) led to surprising changes in upward propagating gravity waves:  Intuition would suggest that stronger precipitation in the El Nino phase would lead to stronger tropical gravity waves, however we found instead stronger waves during the La Nina phase. Our results revealed that intra-seasonal tropical circulation changes that accompany ENSO (changes in the so-called ?Walker circulation?) were more important in determining the strength of upward propagating waves than the strength of precipitation itself.    We also found evidence that precipitating clouds are a major source of gravity waves at mid-latitudes above the Southern Ocean.  Current NCAR GWDP methods assume waves at these latitudes are generated primarily by weather fronts, so these results pointed to a way to improve current GWDP methods.  The project resulted in seven publications in the peer-reviewed literature.  Ongoing work is applying the knowledge gained over the course of this project to improve the gravity wave parameterization methods in the NCAR community atmosphere models, and is expected to improve the realism of atmospheric circulation in studies near-term climate change with these models.  Such studies have applications in planning for the environmental consequences of climate change and predicting impacts on society.  Similar GWDP methods are also used in global weather forecasting models.  Improving GWDP methods are one way to improve the stratospheric circulation in weather forecasting models, which has been shown to impact long-range forecasting skill.  Thus, results from this project have potential impacts on both near-term climate prediction and long-range weather forecasting.
