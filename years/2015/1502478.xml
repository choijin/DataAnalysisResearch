<AbstractNarration>The Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Program is a broad-based, community-initiated research program on the physics of the Earth's magnetosphere and the coupling of the magnetosphere to the atmosphere and to the solar wind.  The work of GEM is accomplished in a series of campaigns and focus groups that solve specific problems leading to the construction of a global Geospace General Circulation Model (GGCM) with predictive capability. This project will contribute essential results to this goal pertaining to understanding the role of the magnetospheric plasma distribution and density in determining the efficiency of the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling.   In addition, the project supports the development of independent research careers for two early-career space physics scientist.  It also will offer educational opportunities for undergraduate students both at University of California Berkeley and University of Michigan Ann Arbor. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of this project is the development and validation of a global model capable of reproducing accurate plasmasphere dynamics and the self-consistent effects of the plasmasphere on the dayside reconnection rate and overall magnetopause dynamics.   Utilizing existing state-of-the-art models, two different approaches for incorporating the plasmasphere in a global MHD model will be developed and evaluated using multipoint spacecraft measurements from the THEMIS, Van Allen Belts Probes, and LANL satellites missions.   The best, and fully validated, approach will then be used to model three different storm events and measure the reconnection rates in a variety of ways with and without inclusion of the plasmasphere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Near-Earth outer space is not a true vacuum- rather, it is populated by charged particles (hydrogen and oxygen) and electric and magnetic fields.  These particles and fields come from the sun (via the solar wind) and the Earth (via the top-most layer of the atmosphere and the Earth's intrinsic magnetic field).  When the solar wind material interacts with the Earth material, an energy exchange happens that creates the aurora and other features.  The near-Earth particles can be divided up into three basic populations.  The most energetic particles are the radiation belts.  The medium energy particles are known as the ring current as they carry an electric current about the Earth.  Finally, the coldest population is known as the "plasmasphere".  For decades, this population was thought to be of little consequence to the near-Earth space system.  Recent studies, however, suggest that this cold population may change the rate of energy exchange between the solar wind and Earth.  The goal of this project was to use computer modeling with observations to investigate if the plasmasphere can change the rate of energy input from the solar wind to the Earth system.  The major achievement of this project was to improve our numerical computer models to be able to investigate this question at all.  Some numerical models are able to capture the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field.  These models are known as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models.  MHD models can capture some aspects of the plasmasphere, but very poorly.  Computer models of the plasmasphere specifically can reproduce the plasmasphere well, but need inputs from large-scale models, such as MHD.  During this project, we performed the code development such that an MHD and plasmasphere code could work together for the first time and effect each other's results.  Using this new MHD-plasmasphere approach, we simulated space weather storms with and without a plasmasphere.  We found that the presence of a dense plasmasphere "plume" (a beam of cold particles) could lower the energy input into the Earth system.  We compared the competing hypotheses by our peers: one that suggested that a plasmaspheric plume would change energy coupling, and one that suggested that the Earth system would compensate for the changes made by the plume and no net change would result.  We found that there was a net change in energy coupling.  We have supplemented the modeling work with observations to show that our code can reproduce key features in the real world system.
