<AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Law enforcement is one of the primary avenues through which citizens interface with government. But aggressive police tactics and the militarization of local law enforcement agencies have prompted widespread debate about the nature of police-citizen interactions, how they can be improved, and their impact citizens' perceptions of government and the social world. Using novel data on public opinion and police behavior, this project examines these issues in three parts. The first study tests whether revised procedures inside police departments improve the quality of police-citizen interactions. The second study assesses where and how militarized police units are used by local law enforcement agencies, and the impact of their use on public perceptions of crime and law enforcement. The third study tests the generalizability of these findings across other types of government agencies. Using a series of survey experiments, the investigator evaluates the conditions under which that actions of government agents beyond law enforcement personnel impact perceptions of the social problems with which they are associated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using survey experimental data on public opinion and micro-level data on police behavior, this project examines several normatively important questions concerning aggressive police tactics and the militarization of local law enforcement agencies. The first study uses an interrupted time-series analysis to test whether revised procedures inside the police department improves the quality of police-citizen interactions. The second study develops a theory of the perceptual side effects of government action, while assessing where and how militarized police units are used by local law enforcement agencies, as well as their impact on public perceptions. Longitudinal data on S.W.A.T. team deployments collected via hundreds of public records requests is merged with local crime and demographic data. The PI also uses survey experiments that randomly assign individuals to read police news reports that portray officers in either traditional uniforms or with various levels of militarized clothing and equipment demonstrate that individuals who see militarized police in a community are more likely to perceive that crime is worse in that community, and less likely to support police spending. These findings highlight how the actions of government agents can impact public perceptions of social problems in potentially misleading and unintended ways. The third study tests the generalizability of these findings. Using a series of survey experiments, the PI examines the conditions under which government agents beyond law enforcement personnel impact perceptions of the social problems with which they are associated.</AbstractNarration>

This study first uses over a decade of polling data to show that existing techniques for measuring public misperceptions produce results that are vulnerable to researcher discretion during analysis.

The third paper tests the effectiveness of a procedural reform to a highly controversial police tactic, "Stop, Question and Frisk." Using millions of records of police-citizen interactions alongside officer interviews, this study evaluates the impact of a change to the protocol for stopping criminal suspects on police performance in New York City. The analysis shows the directive produced an immediate increase in the rate of stops producing evidence of the suspected crime which motivated these stops. Interviewed officers said the order signaled increased managerial scrutiny, leading them to adopt more conservative tactics. This finding shows that procedural changes can quickly and dramatically alter officer behavior, suggesting a reform strategy sometimes forestalled by psychological and personality-driven accounts of police behavior.
