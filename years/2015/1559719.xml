<AbstractNarration>Understanding how humans comprehend speech is an unsolved and challenging problem, in part because factors such as different speakers, dialects, and speaking rates introduce a great deal of temporal and spectral variability into the speech signal. The focus of this research is on the influence of temporal context on perception of segments, syllables, and words. Results of the research may offer insights into treatment of disorders that involve disruption of speech rate (e.g., dysarthria, stuttering, Parkinson's disease, and aphasia), inform approaches to improve speech technology applications (e.g., enhanced automatic speech recognition, more natural sounding computer-generated speech), and lead to new discoveries related to brain mechanisms involved in understanding spoken language. The investigators will also involve students in the research, including those from a primarily undergraduate institution collaborating on the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will test different accounts of temporal phenomena in the perception of speech. They propose two interacting cognitive mechanisms controlling phenomena at lexical and phonetic levels, each driven by a different neural timing mechanism. The hypothesis is that effects of lexical rate primarily stem from top-down, speech-specific temporal expectancies, while phonetic rate effects originate in bottom-up, transient rhythmic expectations that are not specific to speech. This hypothesis will be assessed using psychoacoustic studies, non-invasive measures of brain activity, and theoretical modeling in order to identify the processing characteristics revealed by neural representations of temporal properties of speech.</AbstractNarration>

The current project focused on how listeners change their perception of speech to accommodate variation in the rate of speaking.

Our resuts indicated that listeners take into account the rate of background speech but treat it differently from the target speech patterns indicating that rate compensation mechanisms do not operate indiscriminately. Second, we asked how listeners copied with variation in the speech acoustics that may either be due to speech rate or phonolical regularities in the language. We found that listeners of different language backgrounds treated the same variation in the speech signal differently indicating that rate compensation mechanisms likely interact with the phonological knowledge of the listeners. Related studies evaluated questions how listeners cope with speech variation in the presence of other competing acoustic signals. This aspect of investigation is critical to ensuring that findings obtained in controlled lab settings generalize to conditions of real world listening.
