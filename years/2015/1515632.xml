<AbstractNarration>Ocean wave energy will be a critical energy source in the future.  It has been shown that velocity in waves can be increased with resonance chambers, increasing the amount of electricity that can be extracted from wave energy turbine harvesters. In the same way that noise reverberates and increases, ocean waves increase when they propagate into a basin of a certain volume at the end of a narrow inlet.  These bigger ocean waves have a greater velocity which can turn electric turbines faster, increasing the electricity output from the same resources.  Wave turbines are usually deployed in groups.  The arrangement of turbines affects fluid flow.  This award support research that will determine the ideal arrangement of chambers, when multiple turbines are deployed in an energy farm.  This research will be conducted in collaboration with Professor Richard Manasseh at Swinburne University of Technology, a leading researcher in the area of arrays of ocean wave power machines. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Research by the PI at the University of Hawai'i has shown that Helmholtz resonators can be used to increase the fluid velocity and energy extracted from ocean waves. Utilization of resonance chambers in wave-energy applications is fairly novel and a natural next step in optimizing wave energy technologies. The next step is to apply these resonators to the type of parallel arrays of wave farms, to determine how to optimize efficiency in wave machines. A series of simulations will be run on three chambers in the Swinburne wave tank. Simulations will be run in which all three arrays have the same dimensions, and also varying the dimensions. Successful tests will be refined as patterns emerge. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Optimization Of Arrangement Of Arrays Of Wave-Enhancing Chambers For Wave Turbines     Maura Sateriale  Proposal ID: 1515632     Accomplishments  What are the major goals of the project?  This project aimed to determine the ideal arrangement of resonance chambers to maximize the amount of energy that could be extracted from ocean waves.     What was accomplished under these goals? Provide information on at least one of the four categories     What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?  o Major Activities  Several scenarios for chamber arrangements were simulated, in an environment that was otherwise inaccessible to the primary investigator  o Specific Objectives                                A single resonance chamber (1), three chambers in parallel (2), a staggered three-chamber arrangement with the two side chambers one wavelength upstream of the middle chamber (3), and an arrangement with two side chambers (4) were simulated for several wave frequencies.     o Significant Results                                No arrangement performed more effectively than the single chamber.  This project strongly suggests that wave energy harvesting projects that use multiple chambers or water columns arrange them farther away than 1 wavelength, is contrast to current procedures.     o Key Outcomes or other Achievements   NOTE: Training and professional development are fundamental objectives of the EAPSI program. Please answer this question. Reports that fail to respond to the question will be returned to the PI.  How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?

Participants/Organizations  Senior Personnel:                       EAPSI awardee, Maura Sateriale  Worked for more than 160 Hours:         Yes  Contribution to Project:                Principal Investigator  Also list other individuals you worked with at host location. At minimum, you should list your host researcher by full name. Indicate for each person listed whether they worked more than 160 hours and what their contribution was:  Host researcher:                        Dr. Richard Manasseh  Post-doc  Graduate Student  Undergraduate Student                   Cameron Kartaschew, Isaac Chan, Gurwinder Singh  Research Experience for Undergraduates: Yes     In response to the question, "What other organizations have been involved as partners?" please list your host institution and, if relevant, other organizations you partnered with.  Swinburne Institute of Technology     Have other collaborators or contacts been involved? If yes, list.          No     Impacts  Answer the series of questions on specific impacts (development of the principal discipline of the project, other disciplines, human resources, technology, etc.) as appropriate. "Nothing to report" is likely to be an appropriate answer for many (most?) of these.     Confirmed already known information     Changes/Problems  Report honestly any changes that occurred in your project scope as well as any problems, delays, etc. and how they were dealt with.
