<AbstractNarration>This project will explore the challenge of cleaning data in the context of analysis pipelines over big data. Data cleaning has traditionally been designed to improve data quality in ETL systems where enterprise data is collected, prepared, staged, transformed, and loaded into a data warehouse to support offline data analysis. In the era of big data, such back-end processes are quickly giving way to interactive exploratory data analysis where analysts immerse themselves in data (possibly collected from heterogeneous data sources) in order to drive online (near-) real-time decision making. Existing systems do not scale to the volume, velocity, or the variability of the dynamically generated data (e.g., social media streams) and the offline architecture is unsuited for the online real-time nature of analysis. The market is abuzz with innovations in data transformation technologies, e.g., TriFacta allows analysts to visually manipulate data to generate complex analytical transformations and Data Tamer is exploring scalable data curation from diverse sources. Data quality (and hence data cleaning technologies) remain at the core of big-data analytics. Many popular media (as well as academic) articles have highlighted challenges such as entity linking and resolution as among the most important and immediate roadblocks for big data analytics. The key insight on which this project is based is that data cleaning to support analytics over big data is not simply a matter of scaling up known approaches to larger data sets by exploiting more hardware. While scale up is important, big data analytics in streaming, real-time, and interactive settings requires a paradigm shift in how data cleaning is performed. This project will significantly impact and change the modern practices of data cleaning and the way cleaning is integrated in the Big Data analysis pipeline and will explore broader impact through: (a) technology transfer opportunities with a relevant industrial partner whose existing products could benefit from the proposed research; and (b) open source effort in the context of the ongoing social media analytics system (SoDAS), currently under development, in which the proposed research algorithms will be integrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will explore two new innovations that will help advance data cleaning to enable Big Data analysis. The first innovation explores a progressive approach to entity resolution to support progressive analysis. The research will explore an approach where progressiveness is pervasive spanning all the phases of the cleaning process especially in scenarios when cleaning is based on complex logic possibly requiring dynamic acquisition of additional contextual information. The second innovation is the analysis-aware data cleaning that is developed for structured queries (e.g., Hive and SQL) for both one-time and continuous query scenarios that are issued on top of static and streaming data. The project will address these methodologies at the higher conceptual level as well as implement them on modern highly-parallel computing platforms and frameworks that run on a cluster of machines. The project will exploit two concrete contexts to guide the research exploration: (a) supporting analytical queries over structured web data sources such as fusion tables; and (b) online analysis of social media data. These application contexts will serve as vehicles for testing and demonstrating the research. The planned research, system development, and educational activities (e.g., curriculum changes to incorporate projects related to big data and data quality in the CS curriculum at UCI) will significantly enhance the educational experience of students, preparing them for a brighter future in the today?s knowledge driven society.
