<AbstractNarration>1546420&lt;br/&gt;Reible&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the project is to organize, conduct and document a workshop focused on research needs for the safe and environmentally appropriate implementation of hydraulic fracturing and to help translate the lessons learned in the US to the UK. Hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized oil and gas production in the United States but with some negative environmental consequences. Contributing to the environmental footprint of hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production are the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on water availability, concerns for potential impacts on surface and ground water quality, increased greenhouse gas emissions during production and use of the produced fuels, seismic activity as a result of produced water disposal and community impacts due to rapid growth in oil and gas activity in some areas. The workshop will explore the current state of understanding of these challenges, and research needs and opportunities to better understand these impacts and how to manage them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to develop a coherent research framework to overcome infrastructure, technical, and societal challenges posed by hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas and particularly to help manage the potential consequences of expanded use of hydraulic fracturing and increased oil and gas activity in the UK. The workshop will draw attendees from the US and the UK to understand both current activities and their relevance to the UK. The conflicts, opportunities and trade-offs being experienced in the US are likely to foretell what the UK is likely to face but critical differences are also likely and the workshop will explore both the similarities and the differences. The workshop is expected to lead to a clear definition of system research challenges that are critical to the economic and social vitality of hydraulic fracturing in the US and the UK. A particular advantage of the timing of this workshop is the ability to build upon almost a decade of experiences in the US and identify the remaining scientific and technological challenges to minimizing the environmental footprint of hydraulic fracturing. A goal of the workshop is to catalyze the formation of academic-government partnerships that are able to address these research challenges. The workshop will culminate in white papers that define and analyze scientific, technical and socio-economic research gaps needed for innovating the environmentally sustainable application of hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas development both in the US and the UK. Particular attention is directed to understanding the potential impacts on urban and high density rural areas that have previously faced little oil and gas development and the unique environmental consequences that might be posed by such development. Also of particular interest is under-represented groups that may perceive little direct benefit of hydraulic fracturing and a disproportionate cost and environmental impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview: The objective of the project was to organize, conduct and document a workshop focused on research needs for the safe and environmentally appropriate implementation of hydraulic fracturing and to help translate the lessons learned in the US to the UK.  Hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized oil and gas production in the United States but with some negative environmental consequences.  Contributing to the environmental footprint of hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production are the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on water availability, concerns for potential impacts on surface and ground water quality, increased greenhouse gas emissions during production and use of the produced fuels, seismic activity as a result of produced water disposal and community impacts due to rapid growth in oil and gas activity in some areas.    The workshop was convened November 5-6, 2016 in Arlington Va with 28 attendees from the US and 19 attendees from the UK.  Attendees included representatives from academia, industry, government and non-governmental organizations. The workshop explored the current state of understanding of these challenges, and research needs and opportunities to better understand these impacts and how to manage them.  The goal of the workshop was to develop a coherent research framework to overcome infrastructure, technical, and societal challenges posed by hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas and particularly to help manage the potential consequences of expanded use of hydraulic fracturing and increased oil and gas activity in the UK.    The conflicts, opportunities and trade-offs being experienced in the US are likely to foretell what the UK is likely to face but critical differences are also likely and the workshop explored both the similarities and the differences.  Intellectual Merit: The workshop led to a clear definition of system research challenges that are critical to the economic and social vitality of hydraulic fracturing in the US and the UK. A particular advantage of the timing of this workshop was the ability to build upon almost a decade of experiences in the US and identify the remaining scientific and technological challenges to minimizing the environmental footprint of hydraulic fracturing. A goal of the workshop was to catalyze the formation of academic-government partnerships that are able to address these research challenges.  The workshop culminated in a white paper that has defined scientific, technical and socio-economic research gaps needed for innovating the environmentally sustainable application of hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas development both in the US and the UK.  Broader Impacts of Proposed Activity: The workshop focused on the fundamental science and technical limitations as well as legal and socio-economic barriers to the appropriate balancing of energy development and environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing.  Because environmental constraints can slow hydraulic fracturing activity and the potential benefits of the resulting energy development, this topic is fundamental to societal progress.  By identifying solution-focused research, workshop outcomes will help mitigate high-profile conflicts at the energy-environment nexus as it pertains to the development of hydraulic fracturing in the UK and continued use of the technology in the US. The workshop assembled scientists interested in the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and matured their thinking about the application of the technology in areas where current development is limited.  Particular attention was directed to understanding the potential impacts on urban and high density rural areas that have previously faced little oil and gas development and the unique environmental consequences that might be posed by such development.
