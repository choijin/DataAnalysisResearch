<AbstractNarration>Embedded deep in the ice cap at the South Pole, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) is the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide opportunities for young physicists at all levels to become involved in particle astrophysics, with a particular emphasis on encouraging participation among women and underrepresented groups. The PI founded and serves as the faculty mentor to the Physics and Astronomy Women (PAW). PAW provides a forum for open discussion of the challenges facing women as well as their solutions, runs a mentoring program for starting undergraduate and graduate women in physics, increases the local visibility of women in science through outreach activities, and provides networking and professional development opportunities in a friendly environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DeepCore extension, a sub-array comprising the seven innermost IceCube strings, augmented by eight additional strings containing sensors deployed below 2100 m in the clearest ice, has enabled the observation of atmospheric neutrinos at energies as low as 10 billion electron-volts. This award will support this group to continue to exploit the DeepCore data to answer fundamental questions of neutrino physics, including a high statistics inclusive measurement of tau neutrino appearance and, with further refinements in reconstruction and analysis techniques, measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters. They will use neutrinos from IceCube and DeepCore to facilitate real-time searches for multi-messenger astrophysical sources via the Astrophysical Multi-messenger Observatory Network.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We are literally swimming in neutrinos.  About a trillion of them pass through our bodies every second.  Fortunately, they almost never interact with matter, so we never notice them and they cause us no harm.  In fact, they can only be seen when we train very sensitive and very large detectors on them, and even then they mostly elude capture.  The world's largest neutrino detector is the IceCube experiment, buried in the ice at the South Pole, Antarctica.  IceCube has sensitivity to neutrinos created close by, in the earth's atmosphere, as well as to neutrinos created billions of lightyears away, from well beyond the Milky Way.  The Penn State IceCube group has used IceCube data to measure the oscillation, or flavor change, of atmospheric neutrinos, and has developed a new algorithm for determining the energy and direction of atmospheric neutrinos.   The oscillation measurement is highly competitive with the two existing measurements of muon-to-tau neutrino oscillations, demonstrating that large-volume detectors like IceCube will soon produce the world's best measurement of this quantity.  The quantity is intrinsically important as one of a handful of parameters describing the behavior of neutrinos, ubiquitous fundamental particles that comprise one-quarter of the known particles in the Standard Model of Particle Physics.  It is also important because any significant deviations in its measured value from that expected by the standard oscillation picture could be an indication of unexpected, new physics, such as heretofore unseen new types of neutrinos.  The primary figure shows our measurements and compares them to the existing ones.  Each measurement is represented by a central value with an error bar.  In the absence of new physics, the expected central value is 1.0.  The smaller the error bar, the more precise the measurement.  The figure demonstrates that IceCube is closing in on the precision achieved by the world's best measurements.  The quality of this and related oscillation measurements depends heavily on our ability to measure the energy and direction of each atmospheric neutrino that we detect.  For example, a 10% improvement in our measurement of energy and direction is estimated to give a 30% improvement in our measurement of the oscillation of atmospheric muon to tau neutrinos. The Penn State IceCube group has made major strides in the implementation of a new algorithm for measuring neutrino direction and energy.  The algorithm turns on its head the traditional IceCube algorithm, which starts by simulating the light that interacting neutrinos produce and tracking it until it is detected by one of our 5,160 ice-bound light sensors. Most of this light gets absorbed in the ice and is undetected.  Instead, our algorithm cleverly simulates the sending of light out from each module, keeping track of where it goes until it is absorbed.  This is shown in the second figure, with an IceCube module at the center and simulated light emanating from it.  While this is not the way light actually propagates, it turns out to be physically equivalent--and much more efficient for simulation purposes.   With this new approach, all the simulated light is used, making the algorithm much more efficient, and thereby enabling us to employ much more finely detailed models of the neutrino interactions and the optical properties of the ice.  In turn this has led to dramatic improvements in our ability to determine the direction and energy of interacting neutrinos.  We anticipate that our new algorithm will soon become the standard tool used by IceCube for all of its oscillation analyses, leading to significant improvements across the board.
