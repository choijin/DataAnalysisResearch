<AbstractNarration>When thinking about infectious diseases and making decisions about how to protect themselves, people often overreact to infectious diseases with low risk of infection, such as Ebola, and at other times fail to respond to infectious diseases with higher risk of infection, such as the flu. Both types of responses can lead to negative outcomes such as stress and anxiety, less productivity at work, and inefficient use of healthcare resources (either using too much or too little depending on the disease). We think that one reason that people may exhibit these responses to infectious diseases is that there may be a conflict between their beliefs about their risk and their feelings about their risk. This research will examine areas of misinformation and emotional responses to three infectious diseases: Ebola, the flu, and MERS. After identifying key areas of misinformation and excessive or subdued emotional responses to these three diseases, the research team develops and tests a number of communication strategies that best correct misinformation and resolve conflicts between beliefs and feelings of risk to motivate more appropriate responses to infectious diseases. After determining which strategies are better at doing those things than others, the research team creates a website to display "best-practices" in communicating about infectious diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves conducting a number of web studies to investigate when and for whom cognitive- and affective-based communication strategies work best at modifying cognitions, affect, and behavioral intentions towards pandemic risks. The research uses the theory of "risk-as-feelings". These studies will advance our understanding of risk-as-feelings in a number of ways. First, the research team examines the frequency of simultaneous contradictory responses (SCRs) - when beliefs and feelings of risk conflict - at least with these three infectious diseases. Second, the research team tests for the existence of simultaneous contradictory affective responses. Third, the team then assesses the relative influence of cognitive and affective sources of information on cognitions, affective reactions, and behavioral intentions, as well as in the possible resolution of SCRs. Fourth, the application of risk-as-feelings to determine optimal communication strategies about these infectious diseases should serve as a test-case for the utility of incorporating risk-as-feelings into public health theories of health behavior and communication. Fifth, due to its foundation in the theory of risk-as-feelings, insights gleaned from the current studies should help shape the way information is communicated about other public health issues beyond these disease. And finally, the research tests whether resolving SCRs is key to inducing appropriate responses to pandemic risks or whether improving knowledge, acknowledging fears, and/or improving feelings of efficacy, is sufficient to improve responses, as would be predicted by standard health behavior theories from public health.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ People often overreact to infectious diseases with low risk of infection (e.g., Ebola), and at other times fail to respond appropriately to infectious diseases with higher risk of infection, (e.g. the flu). Our research investigated the psychology of people?s responses to infectious disease risks and how to use those insights to better communicate about those diseases.  During the first 2 years of our project, using the "risk as feelings" framework, we developed several potential measures of "simultaneous conflicting responses" (SCRs)&mdash;when people experience discordance between their beliefs about their risks (cognitive) and their feelings about their risk (affective).

We found variability in how people experience SCRs across different infectious diseases (20-60%), and overall, participants did not rely on their feelings of risk, but used whichever "signal" (belief or feeling) indicated the greater risk. Previously, it was thought that beliefs about risk impact behavior, but more recent research has focused on the role of feelings of risk on behavior. Our data suggests that there were as many affective SCRs as there are cognitive SCRs, and that both were associated with increased prevention intentions (i.e., primarily for vaccination intentions), further suggesting that resolving SCRs may not be key to inducing appropriate responses to pandemic risks.  Because this finding was inconsistent with our theoretical "risk-as-feelings" framework and did not provide clear direction for infectious disease risk communication, we shifted our focus in the last year of our project to understanding how social attitudes shape support for policies that may be implemented during disease outbreaks.   For our next 2 web-based studies, we explored 1) how classism and xenophobia (i.e., fear of people from other countries) shapes attitudes toward a made-up flu-like disease outbreak and 2) the role that social distance plays on support for infectious disease policies. Major findings from these studies included that participants supported the implementation of more restrictive public health policies (e.g., quarantines, travel restrictions) when the country of outbreak was perceived as less wealthy and culturally different than the United States (i.e., Kenya, Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil vs. England and Australia), and when social distance of the person affected by the outbreak increased (i.e., an American citizen or a Kenyan citizen vs. a friend or themselves).

Despite this, the majority of participants still supported travel restrictions. The largest reduction in support for travel restrictions happened when both the benefits and the potential harms were described, in either presentation (brief facts or detailed explanation).  Altogether, these studies highlight the complex interplay between emotions and cognition in shaping how the public responds to infectious disease risks with pandemic potential, both real and hypothetical. We have also demonstrated how a number of factors that are extraneous to the disease characteristics influence public support for potential infectious disease prevention and control policies. This research represents an important contribution to a largely neglected area of research and provides an initial demonstration of interventions that can be used to reduce public support for policies that may be ineffective at limiting a pandemic?s effects.
