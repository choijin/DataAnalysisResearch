<AbstractNarration>So-called von Neumann algebras have their origins in the attempt by Murray and von Neumann to put the study of quantum mechanics on firm mathematical footing.  The two generalized ideas from linear algebra, about symmetries of three-, four-, or higher-dimensional space, to an infinite-dimensional setting that arises naturally in quantum physics.  When trying to understand von Neumann algebras and their underlying structure, one is led naturally to consider "subfactors." These are pairs of minimal von Neumann algebras, one of which contains the other.  The study of subfactors has resulted in some surprising connections with other areas of mathematics.  One of the earliest is the famous Jones polynomial, which arrises in the mathematical study of knots.  This polynomial has led to a deeper understand of the connections between subfactors and topology (the qualitative study of shape--as opposed to geometry, which is the quantitative study of shape). More recently, subfactors have been connected, through the seemingly abstract algebraic field of "category theory," to the topic of topological quantum computing.  Quantum computers would be capable of efficiently computing a large class of problems that are widely believed to be intractable on traditional computers, and topology may be the answer to the difficult question of how to stabilize quantum systems enough to make computers from them.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal research goals of this project deal with questions in subfactor theory: the study of inclusions of von Neumann algebras with trivial center. In this approach, questions about subfactors are translated into questions about finite invariants of subfactors, namely, planar algebras and principal graphs. Planar algebras have many advantages: they allow one to calculate in finite-dimensional spaces, exploit the connection between subfactors and topology, and illuminate the underlying symmetry of the subfactors. The principal investigator plans to extend her previous research on classification and construction of small index subfactors and also to apply ideas from this classification in new places.  This project is guided by the following big questions that the principal investigator does not expect to answer completely but that lead one to ask smaller and more approachable questions: (1) Which graphs can occur as principal graphs?  (2) What is the highest supertransitivity a subfactor can have?  (3) Can subfactors with integer index have objects whose dimensions are not square roots of integers?  (4) Are exotic subfactors common, or rare, at higher indices? (5) Are there symmetry principals relating graphs and subfactor planar algebras embedded in their graph planar algebras?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project dealt with questions in subfactor theory:  the study of inclusions of von Neumann algebras with trivial center.  These mathematical objects have their origins in quantum physics, and enable us to study non-commutative types of symmetry.  In this project, questions about subfactors are translated into questions about related, but simpler, combinatorial objects called planar algebras and principal graphs.  Planar algebras have many advantages:  they allow us to calculate in finite-dimensional spaces, exploit the connection between subfactors and topology, and illuminate the underlying symmetry of the subfactors.     The main research output of this project was a deeper understanding of equivalence relations between subfactors and their relation to planar algebras based on principal graphs.  Specifically, finding a planar algebra in the graph planar algebra of a different graph tells us we are witnessing a Morita equivalence of categories.  This answers a decade-old question of Vaughan Jones on these unusual embeddings.        Intellectual Merit:  Over the course of this project, the relation between subfactors and category theory has been strenthened and deepened.  This increases the chances that subfactors will someday play a role in topological quantum computing, where modular tensor categories are key:  because although the tensor category coming from a subfactor is not modular, its quantum double is.           Broader Impacts:  The PI had the opportunity to talk about the work of this project at many conferences and workshops, and taught a week-long class at Quantum Symmetries summer school (OSU 2019).  At all of these events she has made the acquaintance of young female mathematicians who she hopes to serve as a mentor or role model to.       This project also allowed six undergraduate students to experience mathematical research for themselves.  One article resulted from this, and another is forthcoming, but more importantly, these students were able to learn what a career in academic mathematics entails.  One student has gone on to physics graduate school, and another expects to go to mathematics graduate school.       Last Modified: 08/03/2020       Submitted by: Emily E Peters]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
