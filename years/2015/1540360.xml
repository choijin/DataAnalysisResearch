<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to understand the nutritional drivers of Bornean orangutan foraging behavior. The project will be the first to test the assumption that orangutans maximize calories as part of their foraging strategy and will examine the nutrient priorities and balancing of orangutans to determine if protein is held at a constant level. Orangutan foraging may be a good model for the evolution of human dietary adaptations, because orangutans are large-bodied apes foraging in unpredictable habitats outside of the African rainforest, similar to early human ancestors. Understanding orangutan nutrient needs is also critical to the conservation of this endangered species.  This project will be one of the first describing the importance of non-fruit orangutan foods, which are critical to conservation efforts. The research and findings are being shared with the Indonesian Parks Department to develop conservation strategies. Additionally, the project also will support international research collaborations and capacity building, and training of US students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be conducted in Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia, a field site that is unique in offering a mosaic of habitat types in which 2,500 wild orangutans range. Non-invasive full-day focal animal follows will yield a complete characterization of orangutan diet, with samples of every consumed food collected and analyzed for nutrient content. Using new statistical analysis techniques it is possible  to test linear (optimal foraging, maximization or minimization theories) and geometric (nutrient balancing theories) models of orangutan foraging, and to determine if these strategies can co-exist. Improvements in GIS technologies, and the introduction of the Movement Ecology paradigm will allow an assessment of the goals of orangutan foraging and whether orangutans utilize landmark based navigation and certain movement patterns seen in humans.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research goal of this project is to understand the nutrient drivers guiding Bornean orangutan (<em>Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii)</em>&nbsp;foraging behavior, and to apply the science of movement ecology to understand orangutan habitat use in foraging. This information will then be compared to nutrition&nbsp;foraging models in humans, as we suspect the nurient drivers for humans and orangutans, both great apes living outside of the predictable African rainforests, will be similar, and will help elucidate some elements of hominin evolution.&nbsp;In addition, the results of this research have been and will continue to be helpful to conservation efforts by providing information on the nutrients orangutans seek, and thus offering a better understanding of what to feed rehabilitant and captive orangutans, and a more complete knowledge of what plant species and habitat types are important to conserve to insure that orangutans have all necessary nutrients. The funds provided by NSF allowed us to collect orangutan plant-food samples, and to have these samples analyzed at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) Nutrition Lab.</p> <p>We are continuing data analysis, but have interesting initial findings from this project to report. Sixty-six orangutan food samples were analyzed at LIPI and hundreds of additional samples await analysis (contingent upon collection of more sample, or the use of different equipment for analysis.) Our data thus far have allowed us to analyze 611 feeding &ldquo;transitions&rdquo;, or events where an orangutan left one food type for another. Of these, 62% involved fruit, either as an origin, a destination, or both &ndash; this was expected given the frugivorous nature of orangutans. Interestingly, though, in contrast to theoretical expectations, orangutans did leave available fruit without depleting this fruit, to consume non-fruit foods 80 out of 95 times. Our geospatial data includes several instances where an orangutan at non-fruit resources even though fruit was clearly available within 10m. This suggests that orangutans are not merely seeking fruit, depleting it, and consuming other foods that they find along the way in search of the next food resources &ndash; and instead, these animals are selecting certain foods. When orangutans left available fruit to eat non-fruit items, they most commonly consumed leaves next. We will continue to analyze the nutrients of these food choices, but anticipate that orangutans will seek to maintain a relatively stable level of protein each day, similar to humans.</p> <p>Another important goal of this research was to develop human resources. To that end, some of the NSF funding made possible the employment of an Indonesian botany assistant full-time, and a part-time climbing assistant. Each of these assistants was offered, and took advantage of, learning opportunities including conference attendance and additional skills training to improve their candidacy for future field positions. In addition, this project funded the travel and board expenses of a US post-baccalaureate student who served as a research and climbing assistant. She was also able to take advantage of several learning opportunities and conference attendance, and has since been awarded a Fulbright fellowship to continue work in Indonesia. This assistant and I made several conservation and science based presentations at local K-12 schools and universities, hoping to share our research and conservation of the forest with the next generation of Indonesian policy makers. We are grateful for the NSF funding that allowed us to be the conduit of developing these individuals and others at camp.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Andrea&nbsp;L&nbsp;Digiorgio</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540360/1540360_10386187_1507510526308_GreenschoolADwstudents--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540360/1540360_10386187_1507510526308_GreenschoolADwstudents--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Andrea at GreenSchool"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540360/1540360_10386187_1507510526308_GreenschoolADwstudents--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Andrea at GreenSchool"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Visit to Green School in Sukadana - Andrea presented field methods and nutrition information.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Pak Agung</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Andrea&nbsp;L&nbsp;Digiorgio</div> <div class="imageTitle">Andrea at GreenSchool</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540360/1540360_10386187_1507510644240_ADandPakBacong440gBaccaurea--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540360/1540360_10386187_1507510644240_ADandPakBacong440gBaccaurea--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sample Collection with Pak Bacong"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540360/1540360_10386187_1507510644240_ADandPakBacong440gBaccaurea--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sample Collection with Pak Bacong"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Pak Bacong was employed as a part-time tree climber.
