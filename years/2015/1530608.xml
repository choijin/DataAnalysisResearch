<AbstractNarration>This project studies how to best allocate resources over time when money isn't available as a means of eliciting the agents' private information - an essential ingredient in the determination of the efficient allocation. Property rights to the allocation must dynamically respond to claims by the agents regarding their needs, punishing greedy agents and rewarding frugal ones, while attempting to preserve efficiency. Potential applications range from how to allocate hospital beds; how a nurse should divide up her time; how an agency should pick among competing projects, etc. The goal is to derive transparent and robust yet effective decision rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We allow the agent's private information to be serially correlated over time (but independent across agents), and consider both the cases in which agents desire only one unit (e.g., a medical procedure), and in which their payoff is additive in the number of units they get. Values are private. The principal is committed to the mechanism, and the resource supply is exogenous. In some simple settings, a two-part tariff using a virtual budget implements the optimum. For more complicated settings, the project will rank standard procedures (e.g., auctions with virtual budgets) and compare their performance to the best mechanism.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary of the results:     Dynamic Allocation without Money, joint with Johannes Horner.  Costly Miscalibration, joint with Eran Shmaya.  The Value of Multistage Persuasion, joint with Eran Shmaya.       Intellectual merit:     The objective of our first paper is to study how to optimally allocate resources over time when money is not available as an instrument to elicit players’ private information. The designer uses future allocation decisions to elicit private information. Potential applications range from how a department shall allocate hiring slots, how an agency shall pick among competing projects, how a nurse shall allocate his/her time, how a cloud provider shall allocate computing capacity. In the paper "Dynamic Allocation without Money" (joint with Johannes Horner), we characterize the optimal dynamic allocation rule when an agent’s value for the good evolves according to a two-state Markov chain. We solve for the optimal allocation mechanism for a fixed discount factor. The agent is endowed with a virtual budget, corresponding to the number of units he can claim in a row with no questions asked. Whenever the agent claims the good, his virtual budget goes down by one unit. Whenever he forgoes the good, his virtual budget is adjusted in a way to make it incentive compatible to report the true value.  We show that efficiency in allocation decreases over time, which stands in contrast to situations in which money is available. In the long run, the agent is either "tenured" or "terminated." Moreover, the more correlated the agent’s value is over time, the more difficult the designer’s job is. In "The Value of Multistage Persuasion" (joint with Eran Shmaya), we examine dynamic information design when money is not available as an instrument. We characterize environments in which the designer finds it optimal to use one round of experiment instead of multiple experiments to influence an agent’s decision. In "Costly Miscalibration" (joint with Eran Shmaya), we develop a measure of miscalibration to test the validity of a platform’s forecasts over many products and potentially many periods. We show that platforms who suffer higher cost of miscalibration have higher credibility and higher payoffs.           Broader impact:      Dynamic mechanism design without money is an important topic in economics, operations research and computer science. The methodology developed in our project is useful for generating effective and robust decision rules for more complicated allocation problems. Dynamic information design is an important topic in economics and computer science. Our results provide new insights on how to optimally design communication schemes on online platforms.
