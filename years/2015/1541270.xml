<AbstractNarration>Building on the University of California - Santa Cruz (UCSC) "100 Gb/s Science DMZ" project, the CyberInfrastructure (CI) Engineer coordinates the development of research CI (on-campus and in regional and national forums), and works with the CI community to disseminate new CI tools, techniques and models.  The CI Engineer works directly with researchers to facilitate their use of CI, and with campus IT engineers in the design and development of new CI capabilities. The CI Engineer works on research projects involving the development of new CI-related technology, including the Pacific Research Platform project. The CI Engineer coordinates a continuous technology assessment for use in planning the development of campus CI, and the evolution of the campus CI plan while advising campus leadership on technology with potential impact on faculty and their research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CI Engineer participates in regional, state and national level organizations, including California's Research and Education Network (CENIC), Internet2, and the OpenStack Foundation, sharing lessons learned at UCSC and to hear of new developments. These lessons are also disseminated via the web for access by the broader CI community. Through research projects or independent studies, the CI Engineer engages science and engineering students in the use and development of campus CI.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CI Engineer hired for this project made major contributions to UC Santa Cruz CI infrastructure, including:  The addition of a distributed Ceph storage cluster to our Science DMZ to implement Eli Dart's storage-enhanced Science DMZ described here. Extended Science DMZ to engineering buildings (Baskin Engineering and Engineering 2), which contain compute infrastructure for the Genomics Institute and Storage research groups. Collaborated with UC San Diego on their "CI-New proposal: Cognitive Hardware and Software Ecosystem Community Infrastructure (CHASE-CI)" project to deploy ML cluster at UC Santa Cruz. Cluster is currently used by Santa Cruz Machine Learning Collaborative and the Genomics Institute   In addition he worked with researchers across science and engineering divisions to assist with development of software and hardware to facilitate their research (Chemistry, Applied Math &amp; Statistics, Particle Physics, Astronomy, Astrophysics, Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences, and Physics), and taught the Applied Math &amp; Statistics Department's graduate HPC course in 2017 and 2018.  To ensure maximimum benefit from this project, this work was presented in a number of venues:   "PRP from the UCSC point of view" (link) at 2017 PRP V2 Workshop, February 21, 2017, La Jolla, CA "Ceph File System in Science DMZ" (link) at 2017 Technology Exchange, October 17, 2017, San Francisco, CA "Deep Learning Astronomical Survey Data" (link) at Data Organization, Management and Access (DOMA) workshop, November 16, 2017, New York, NY and at CHASE-CI workshop, May 14, 2018, La Jolla, CA   In addition, a blog was maintained on Ceph configuration, CyberInfrastructure, High Performance Computing and Machine Learning at http://manjusri.ucsc.edu/.  The cost of success on this project is the challenge of retention of individuals with the skills and expertise acquired as a part of these projects. For UC Santa Cruz, specifically, the individual hired as our CI Engineer was recruited to a more lucrative job at Stanford after two years of work. We are now in the process of rearchitecting the research support organization in the IT Division with plans to recruit a new CI Engineer in the near future.
