<AbstractNarration>Some fungi live in close symbiotic association with plants. These ectomycorrhizal fungi provide resources to the plant host, and in return, the plant provides nutrition to the fungi. The interactions of fungi and their hosts provide crucial ecosystem functions including the recycling of nutrients. While the critical roles that fungi play in the environment are well established, their importance in tropical systems is not well understood, and this is especially true for tropical Africa. This project in the Guineo-Congolian rainforest will provide the first thorough documentation of these fungi and plant relationships of tropical Africa using modern methods. The huge forest covering the Congo River basin is one of the last great tropical rainforests of the world. Current threats to the region include logging, mining, and climate change. This project will fill a major gap in our knowledge of the important symbiotic fungi of this ecosystem through expeditionary fieldwork in the undisturbed rainforests of Cameroon. This project is potentially transformative in that if the fungi associated with closely related host plants of Africa and South America are shown to have a common ancient origin, such results would fundamentally impact understanding of the evolution, global biogeography, and local adaptation of ectomycorrhizal symbioses. Additionally, application of new DNA sequencing methods will develop entirely new, phylogenetically informative data that will transform the field. It is estimated that over 100 fungi will be discovered that are new to science. Recognition of these species will greatly inform broader research areas. Key features of the project include student training, internet-based information sharing, and public outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By combining traditional specimen-based sampling with high throughput DNA sequencing, this project will provide the most complete diversity data to date on ectomycorrhizal fungi of Afrotropical forests. Additionally, it will enable comparison of intercontinental tropical ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in corresponding ecosystems. The research will enhance understanding of fungal biogeography in the Gondwana-derived Afrotropical and Neotropical Guiana Shield regions. Survey plots identical to those used for surveys in the Guiana Shield of South America will be established in the Dja Biosphere Reserve and Korup National Park Cameroon and ectomycorrhizal fungi will be sampled using morphological and molecular methods over multiple years. Replication of sample design allows for direct comparisons between Africa and South America, allowing for robust biogeographic analyses to determine the evolutionary histories of ectomycorrhizal taxa in a global context.</AbstractNarration>

Standardized specimen sampling techniques, state of the art DNA sequence-assisted diversity documentation, phylogenomic and phylogenetic analyses, have been employed to examine the origin and diversity of EM mutualisms in the ancient, primeval Guineo-Congolian rainforest. The study sampled EM fungi associated with the leguminous tree <em>Gilbertiodendron dewevrei</em>, which forms monodominant forests that are a defining feature of the region. Permanent survey plots were established and sampled over five years in the Dja Biosphere Reserve of Cameroon. We have employed morphological and molecular taxonomic methods and novel biogeographic analyses to deduce the evolutionary histories of the taxa in a global context.

Continued taxonomic work beyond the timeline of the funded project will yield formal description of at least 100 additional species new to science.

BROADER IMPACTS.  The project has:  (1) Developed a WWW-accessible database (http://tropicalfungi.org/) with the most exhaustive documentation ever of EM fungal diversity in Afro-tropical and Guiana Shield rainforests, including key fungal and plant taxa.  (2) Has provided taxonomic, molecular biology, and tropical biodiversity research training for a postdoctoral associate, four US or Cameroonian graduate students, six Cameroonian students, and local and 12 indigenous parataxonomists in both Cameroon and Guyana.  (3) Described and curated new EM fungal species and genera, discovered previously unknown lineages of EM fungi and plants, and provided greatly expanded specimen and DNA-sequence resources for globally representative macrofungal systematics and evolutionary research.  (4) Provided outreach activities including 30 formal symposium and conference presentations at national and international meetings.  (5) Provide important information to management agencies in Cameroon on fungal biodiversity and unique EM-dominated habitats that informs their conservation efforts in Guineo-Congolian rainforests, experiencing ongoing environmental threats, including those driven by climate change.
