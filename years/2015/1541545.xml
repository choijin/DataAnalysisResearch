<AbstractNarration>For the first ~300 million years of plant life on land, Earth's flora consisted entirely of flagellate plants, which today include approximately 30,000 species of bryophytes, lycophytes, ferns, and gymnosperms. Numerous major innovations, including stomata, vascular tissue, roots and leaves, woody stems, and seeds, evolved first in flagellate plant ancestors. The flagellate plants not only provide a window to the early evolution of these critical features, but are represented today by vibrant and diverse lineages that contribute substantially to global ecology, particularly via contributions to global carbon and nitrogen cycles and offering critical habitats for biodiversity. This research project will analyze molecular genetic variation among the 18,000 available flagellate plant species in order to create a species-level phylogeny (evolutionary tree of species relationships) for the entire group. Phylogenetic trees generated will be linked to fossil data, a comprehensive dataset of plant traits, and available data on species occurrence on the planet. The results of this project will inform investigations into the origins of features characteristic of flowering plants and provide a platform for student training and outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve our understanding of the history and relationships of the flagellate plants by using new sequencing technologies to examine 500 nuclear loci and to produce a species-level phylogeny for these taxa that is linked to and integrated with an immense and varied amount of data on fossils, phenomic characters, and geospatial distributions. Phenotypic datasets will utilize a natural language processing tool which will be enhanced and tested to handle large datasets and the geospatial data will allow exploration of world-wide patterns of diversity and endemism. All data will be fully integrated into ongoing projects such as Open Tree of Life and Next Generation Phenomics. Education experts will develop an online educational tool for training the next generation of biodiversity scientists by providing an accessible framework for using the project data in university classrooms while promoting evidence-based teaching practices. A MicroPlants citizen science project will promote scientific literacy and plant awareness in the general public, through museums and schools.</AbstractNarration>

Though distantly related, all flagellate plants have swimming sperm that rely on water for fertilization. Numerous major innovations, including stomata, vascular tissue, roots and leaves, woody stems, and seeds, evolved first in flagellate plant ancestors. The flagellate plants not only provide a window to the early evolution of these critical features, but are represented today by vibrant and diverse lineages that contribute substantially to global ecology, particularly via contributions to global carbon and nitrogen cycles and offering critical habitats for biodiversity. Field Museum and collaborators provided a supporting role to the principal investigators from the University of Florida (Award No. 1541506) helping towards several project goals including 1) generating a species-level phylogeny for the available (~18,000) flagellate plants based on 500 nuclear loci and 2) developing content for a discovery-based online educational tool for classroom use and further educational efforts in phylogenetics and biodiversity at multiple levels. Throughout the project period Field Museum directly contributed samples as well as helped facilitate and solicit international colleagues toward sampling efforts for both mosses and liverworts; developed online platforms for citizen (community) science; developed lesson plans for 3rd-5th graders and high school students on 1) Plant biomimicry; 2) Plant Structure &amp; Function; 3) Biodiversity &amp; Ecosystems. Funding from the National Science Foundation has now helped a long-term sustainable Collections Club - with almost 100 volunteers participating in quarterly events - often focusing on curation and databasing activities on mosses, liverworts and ferns. Members include the general public, upper elementary students through to high school students participating in authentic research and science. Ferns, mosses and liverworts featured prominently in a year-long exhibit "Specimens: Unlocking the Secrets of Life" - a major exhibition dedicated to the principle of showcasing the significance of scientific collections. A highlight was the transformation of a web-based platform into an exhibit piece with touchscreen technology. 1000&rsquo;s of individuals participated generating tens of 1000&rsquo;s of data points. The project has led to ongoing funding opportunities to continue to collaborate with scientists, education experts and educators to further refine, develop and implement online educational tools for training the next generation of biodiversity scientists and promote scientific literacy and plant awareness in the general public, through museums and schools.
