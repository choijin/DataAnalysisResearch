<AbstractNarration>Cameron Hummels is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Caltech. One of the most important open questions in the field of astrophysics is how galaxies acquire their gas and transform it into stars, a process that uniquely determines the evolutionary path of each galaxy over cosmic time. Observations of the circumgalactic medium, the gas reservoir surrounding a galaxy, are the key to understanding how galaxies accrete and process gas; however these observations are difficult to interpret because they require infrequent bright background objects to illuminate the foreground circumgalactic medium. Hummels will construct a "synthetic telescope," a piece of software for mimicking the observations made by real telescopes of this gas reservoir, and apply it to advanced supercomputer simulations of large volumes of the Universe containing thousands of galaxies. These simulated galaxies will provide context for better understanding observations made by real telescopes. In addition, Hummels will organize a public education program as a collaborative effort between Caltech and Pasadena City College. This outreach program will have frequent traditional and non-traditional events focused on increasing scientific interest and awareness in the general population of the greater Los Angeles area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hummels will integrate several existing open-source codes into a "synthetic telescope" software pipeline for post-processing hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy evolution to generate simulated observations. This pipeline will account for (1) dust; (2) self-shielding effects of dense gas pockets; (3) atomic line transfer; (4) local photoionizing sources including stars and active galactic nuclei; (5) metagalactic ionizing background radiation; (6) collisional ionization; and (7) equilibrium and non-equilibrium ionization. It will be compatible with standard hydrodynamical codes and will produce photometric images, IFU data, and spectra spanning the wavelength range from the ultraviolet to the submillimeter. Hummels will apply this pipeline to the FIRE, CGM@HR, and AGORA simulations. He will compare these synthetic observations to the COS-Halos and KBSS surveys of the circumgalactic medium to investigate the origin and structure of the circumgalactic medium as it varies with galaxy mass, environment, and redshift, to better understand galactic gas accretion and ejection. Hummels will then release the software pipeline to the astrophysical community. Concurrent to this research effort, Hummels will organize a public education program to host frequent activities for scientific enrichment of the general public. This effort will use traditional and non-traditional events to focus on reaching out to people and communities who are otherwise ambivalent to science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dr. Cameron Hummels has contributed substantially to both public education of science and the study of galaxy evolution over the course of his National Science Foundation Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship.  Scientifically, he created a transformational new piece of software for mimicking what telescopes would see if they were to observe the virtual galaxies modeled in sophisticated computer simulations of the universe.  This code, called Trident, produces synthetic spectra from simulated galaxies, which are meant to be compared directly against observational data taken from telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope.  The first of its kind, Trident not only works with all major astrophysical codes, but it was released to the public as open-source software ensuring that the whole astrophysical community will benefit from its use.  The full description of how it works was published in the Astrophysical Journal.   Dr. Hummels applied his software, Trident, to the most advanced galaxy simulations in the field to better understand the origin and nature of the low-density gas surrounding galaxies, the circumgalactic medium (CGM).  The poorly understood CGM is increasingly regarded as the key to understanding how galaxies form and evolve over cosmological timescales.  Dr. Hummels' results indicate that small-scale features in the CGM, primarily created by runaway cooling, drive the overall evolution of the CGM.  Previous efforts to simulated the CGM failed because they lacked the precision to resolve these small-scale structures, but Hummels' work suggests that the CGM is primarily comprised of a fog of small cool gas cloudlets.  Much of this work has been confirmed by other research groups and is transforming theoretical studies of the CGM.   As part of Dr. Hummels' NSF AAPF, he founded several large-scale outreach initiatives serving the population of Los Angeles and beyond.  He created a monthly public lecture series with accompanying stargazing at Caltech, regularly hosting 100-200 attendees and staffed by volunteers from the Caltech Astronomy Department.  Additionally, he created a monthly "Astronomy on Tap" series at a local bar where attendees could enjoy a drink while listening to informal talks about science and then mingle with scientists who were present.  A Spanish-language Astronomy on Tap event was held, specifically to try to engage underrepresented minorities traditionally lacking in STEM.  Dr. Hummels has since posted all of the lectures on Youtube to reach a global audience, with 1200 subscribers so far and over 75,000 views of the 40+ lectures.   These tradtional events preferentially target people who are already interested enough in science to attend, so in order to reach others people, Dr. Hummels created "Guerilla Astronomy" activities like "Science Train" and "Sidewalk Stargazing."  Science Train consists of a group of scientists boarding the LA Metro with signs encouraging people to "Ask an Astrophysicist" ond subsequent educational discussions. Sidewalk Stargazing occurs on select weekend evenings on busy pedestrian streets where volunteers set up telescopes inviting passersby to look at bright planets and the Moon. These types of events served to reach a wide cross-section of members of the public not met by traditional education activities.   Through these educational activities, not only did Dr. Hummels produce a broader impact on society at large, but he served to mentor scientists and students from many of the astronomy institutions throughout Los Angeles who served as volunteers or speakers at these events.  Over 150 unique scientists from over 10 institutions in Los Angeles volunteered at these outreach events.  In total, Dr. Hummels organized and oversaw more than 100 events hosting 21,000 visitors with NSF support.  The breadth and popularity of these events have been a significant boon to the education of Los Angeles and beyond.  Instructions and leadership are in place for these events to continue into the future, preserving these important efforts to promote science education in our society.
