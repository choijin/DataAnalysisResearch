<AbstractNarration>Robotics is undergoing tremendous growth over a wide range of important areas, from transportation, to manufacturing, entertainment, space exploration, health-care and education.  While the field is progressing forward, both in research findings and industrial markets, the percentage of female roboticists continues to lag far behind their male counterparts. This project will strengthen the presence of women in robotics by organizing "RSS 2015 Workshop on Women in Robotics" and partially defraying the cost of women to attend.  The workshop will be held at the Robot Science and Systems (RSS) conference on July 16th in Rome, Italy.</AbstractNarration>
