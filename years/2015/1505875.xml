<AbstractNarration>Phenomena relating to microscopic (quantum) effects which occur during and after the formation of a black hole will be studied.  The results will test predictions made using simple models in which the black hole exists in one space dimension and may provide insight into the important question of what happens to the information about how a black hole forms.  If a system of very cold atoms called a Bose-Einstein condensate has its properties configured correctly, then quantum effects will occur which are in some important ways similar to those which occur for black holes.  The difference is that Bose-Einstein condensates can be studied in the laboratory.  An investigation of such systems will be made with the goal of making predictions for effects that could be observed in the laboratory. The validity of an important approximation called the semiclassical approximation that is used as a bridge between macroscopic (classical) and microscopic (quantum) phenomena will be studied in two cases.  One is the effect of particle production on the dynamics of the universe for an important model in which the universe begins by contracting and later expands.  The other is for the effect of particle production on a strong electric field.  One or more graduate students and probably some undergraduates will participate in some aspects of the research, continuing a long history of their training in numerical and analytical research techniques and co-authorship on publications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed will investigate questions related to the information about how a black hole forms; the existence of quantum effects in analog black hole systems related to the existence of a horizon, which can be observed in laboratory studies; and the validity of the semi-classical approximation in certain cases where quantum effects are significant. In the case of black hole evaporation the objectives include determining the importance of quantum effects in the interior of a black hole and investigating the details of particle production in the exterior region during gravitational collapse to form a black hole, in order to gain insight into the question of what happens to the information about how a black hole forms and to check the accuracy of similar calculations in two dimensional dilaton theories of gravity.  For Bose-Einstein condensates, which can serve as analogs for black holes, the goal is to determine whether undulations or other new observable effects that require the existence of a horizon are predicted to occur.  The validity of the semiclassical approximation will be studied for one important model (de Sitter space) in which the contraction is to a minimum size and is followed by an expansion.  Numerical computations of the stress-energy of quantum fields will be made in the black hole and cosmological investigations and in the cosmological case the backreaction on the spacetime geometry will be computed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research done for this grant addresses topics relating to quantum effects in black hole spacetimes, Bose-Einstein condensates that can serve as analogs for black holes, and cosmology.  These effects include both particle production and vacuum polarization.  The latter results in contributions to the energy density and pressure that can be nonzero even when no matter or radiation is present.  It was shown that there is an exact correspondence between the particle production that occurs for a black hole that forms from the collapse of massless particles such as photons in two spacetime dimensions and a mirror in two spacetime dimensions that is undergoing acceleration along a particular trajectory.  Details of the time dependence of the particle production that occurred throughout the entire histories of these spacetimes were studied.  One paper has been published in the journal Physical Review D and two papers have been published in the proceedings of an international conference that was held in the summer of 2015.  It was also shown in both two dimensional and spherically symmetric four dimensional spacetimes that the deviations in the spectrum of the produced particles from the late time behavior predicted by Hawking decrease much more slowly in time than would be expected.  This result puts the issue about what happens to the information about how a black hole forms in a new perspective since the emitted particles in the black hole evaporation process are sensitive to the details of the collapsing matter for a significantly longer period of time than would have been naively expected.  A paper on this work has been accepted for publication in Physical Review D Rapid Communications.  If a nonrotating black hole has enough electric charge it will not radiate due to the Hawking effect and its temperature is zero.  Using the semiclassical approximation to quantum gravity, it was found that if the conditions in the early universe were right for a type of inflation called Starobinsky inflation to occur then uncharged zero temperature black holes can exist.  If the black hole evaporation process shuts off when the black hole is small, it is possible that these solutions could describe the end point of the black hole evaporation process.  Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) analog black holes have certain characteristics that are similar to those of real black holes and, unlike real black holes, they can be studied in the laboratory.  Quantum effects in BEC analog black holes were theoretically studied and two papers were published in Physical Review D.  One paper discusses the details of massless quantized sound waves (phonons) for certain BECs.  The other paper studies certain properties of the BEC in cases where the phonons have an effective mass.  Three projects were finished and three papers were published in Physical Review D relating to various aspects of quantum effects in cosmology.  One study involved particle production in de Sitter space, which in a particular set of coordinates, corresponds to a universe that begins with zero size and expands to an infinite size.  It is often used as a model for the universe during inflation when the universe expands extremely rapidly or for the late time behavior of the universe if the dark energy is a cosmological constant.  Strong evidence was found that particle production occurs in de Sitter space and this could have implications for the early and late history of the universe.  If the dark energy is not a cosmological constant and if it has the right properties then the universe could end up with a final singularity, which comes from a divergence of one or more quantities such as the energy density and the pressure.  A study was done and it was found that if conditions were right for a particular type of inflation called Starobinsky inflation to occur in the early universe, then quantum effects within the context of the semiclassical approximation to gravity cannot remove the final singularity.  In some other cases they can.  The results are in accordance with some previous studies of these effects.  Another study involved the validity of a semiclassical approximation that has been used to describe the rapid particle production that occurs right after the universe expands very rapidly in models of chaotic inflation.  The key result is that this semiclassical approximation is not valid during this rapid phase of particle production and other ways must be found to obtain a detailed description of this process.  Two undergraduate students who graduated in the Spring of 2019 along with four current graduate students at Wake Forest University received training in various aspects of scientific research.  So far, one of the graduate students is a coauthor on a publication and one of the former undergraduate students is a coauthor on a paper that has been accepted for publication.
