<AbstractNarration>High quality mechatronics technicians with interdisciplinary skills are in high demand by industry; yet, it is often difficult for students in rural areas to access and complete traditional mechatronics technician degrees. This project entitled Rural Access Mechatronics Program (RAMP) at Clark College in rural southwest Washington state is designed to increase the quantity and quality of mechatronics technicians  by developing a hybrid/online Certificate of Completion in Mechatronics Fundamentals. This will provide rural students, under-and unemployed workers, and incumbent workers a new option for an educational pathway from a certificate in mechatronics to an Associate in Applied Technology (AAT) degree with anytime anywhere courses resulting from the hybrid format. Upon successful completion, students will be prepared for either technician positions or be ready to progress on the educational pathway to a baccalaureate degree. The objectives of the project are to institutionalize hybrid learning options through faculty professional development and increase the number of quality mechatronics technicians. The curriculum will be validated by multiple advanced manufacturing employers in the region who are concerned by the rapidly growing need for more skilled mechatronics technicians in the Washington Oregon border area. Through the RAMP pilot, Clark will make significant contributions to the larger technological education community as the RAMP model will be replicable in other rural communities where access to education is an issue.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The hybrid modality of the certificate opens up access to stackable certificates and an AAT degree for more rural students. The project addresses critical barriers to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education such as mathematics prerequisites by embedding the needed mathematics competencies into the mechatronics classes of the hybrid curriculum. Faculty members are being prepared with the skills needed to deliver hybrid curricula, designed specifically to meet the needs of a rural population, thereby expanding hybrid learning options throughout the educational pathway. RAMP builds upon and expands the work of other ATE centers and projects including 1) applying best practices gleaned from iMEC (1304835) to guide the transition of curricula into a hybrid format; 2) partnering with CA2VES (1501695) to leverage their knowledge in hybrid/online delivery; utilize their modules/virtual labs; and investigate their video library for use in RAMP professional development efforts; and 3) utilizing the best practices of CARCAM (1304036) for recruitment and retention of rural and first-generation students. Employers are being engaged in the curriculum development process to assure that mechatronics technicians have the skills and knowledge to be well prepared to work in industry. A comprehensive evaluation is being developed to continuously enhance the project activities and provide opportunities for researching and evaluating the success of the project and its deliverables, as well as the sharing of best practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ RAMP Summary     Pre-RAMP     Most of the department used standard teaching methods of weekly in-class presentations, reading and homework assignments, hands-on in class / lab experiments, quizzes on previous week's assignments, midterm and a final exam.  A professor and an adjunct instructor in our department were the only instructors that had weekly homework assignments available on Canvas.     RAMP Implementation     Every Mechatronics department instructor was trained to use the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) and tasked to develop a couple of classes within their expertise.  Each instructor taking at least two out of the total, nine hybrid online instruction with face-to-face labs specified in the RAMP grant.  The RAMP labs were initially held once every three weeks over a ten week period at Clark College Columbia Technical Center, in eastern Vancouver. This was to reduce the amount of student travel time to and from the remote rural areas in the Clark College district.  We discovered that holding labs once every three weeks did not allow the students to retain the manual dexterity technical skills (muscle memory) acquired during previous lab experiences.  Students attending lab once every three weeks, were fumbling and mishandling lab equipment during each lab session, including the final lab session.  This was corrected during RAMP's second quarter, when the labs were scheduled from once every three weeks to once a week.  This improved the students' manual dexterity and we could see the mastery of manual skills develop with each consecutive lab.  A couple of glitches occurred during the second quarter of the first RAMP cohort and all during the second cohort, from changes that were made to the LMS by Canvas software developers.  This resulted in some unexpected random changes to some grading keys within multiple choice quizzes, assignments, and exams question pools that the first cohort did not experience in the first quarter.  This required additional time reviewing entire question pools for the affected classes.     Post-RAMP     The hybrid model of online presentation slides, weekly pre-lab quizzes, homework assignments, midterms, exams, and ability to download and printout labs with standard weekly face-to-face, hands-on lab experience will be expanded to additional classes in the future of the Clark College Mechatronics program.  The demand for online learning continues with the influx of semiconductor manufactures into the Pacific Northwest, from other areas of the country, and the future expansion of advance manufacturing in the Portland Vancouver metro area.     RAMP Success     The co-PI feels that in terms of rural access RAMP failed, because there were just a couple of students from rural areas entering the program.  On the other hand, there was an unexpected demand for our local semiconductor industry and smaller companies that support the semiconductor industry.  The local semiconductor industry loves the online classes that were developed under the RAMP grant program, that allow semiconductor employees to upgrade their technical skills and knowledge, while still working.  Upgrading the technical skills of the local workforce, is a big success, by allowing community members access to higher paying jobs through industry financed hybrid educational opportunities, without students having to leave the job to attend college full time and pay for their education out-of-pocket.     RAMP Issues     Semiconductor industry work schedules of 12 hour work days, with rotating on / off days and mandatory unscheduled overtime pose a challenge for Clark College, who operates on a conventional 9-to-5 business day, 3 academic quarters, out of a full year.  Open lab times need to be expanded for students? work schedules and an online lab equipment sign-up / use scheduling software needs be developed, so the student success rate is increased.  Also, this is requires some administrative re-thinking outside the 9-to-5, three academic quarters per year, normal college operating schedule, and willingness to provide support services such as labs, libraries, and tutoring, for students and additional faculty and lab support staffing, which is currently outside of the college?s administrative mind set.
