<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for participation in the conference "p-adic Methods in Number Theory" held at the University of California, Berkeley on May 26-30, 2015.   Since their conception by Kurt Hensel around 1900, p-adic numbers have played a central role in number theory; for example, they are used in a crucial way in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.  To a number theorist, p-adic numbers are just as "real" -- and just as important -- as real numbers.  Both are ways of "filling in the gaps" left by considering just rational numbers.  In their book "Number Theory I: Fermat's Dream," Kato, Kurokawa, and Saito write poetically, "In the long history of mathematics a number meant a real number, and it is only relatively recently that we realized that there is a world of p-adic numbers.  It is as if those who had seen the sky only during the day are marveling at the night sky. [ ]  Just as we can see space objects better at night, we begin to see the profound mathematical universe through the p-adic numbers."  This conference will bring together experts in the many different facets of p-adic numbers and their applications, will promote a cross-fertilization of ideas between number theorists of all stripes, will expose graduate students and postdocs to state-of-the-art techniques and results, and will promote participation by underrepresented minorities and women in high-level number theory research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A conference on p-adic methods in number theory is timely and important, as many spectacular recent number-theoretic advances have made use of deep p-adic methods.  We mention, for example, recent work establishing special cases of the p-adic local Langlands correspondence; the proof that most hyperelliptic curves of odd degree have just one rational point; developments on non-abelian Coleman integration and integral points on curves; work on the fundamental curve of p-adic Hodge theory; and recent results on perfectoid spaces.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project helped support a major international  conference whose purpose was to gather experts in p-adic analytic  geometry and p-adic modular forms in order to survey recent developments  in these fields and inspire future breakthroughs. In particular, the conference was thematically centered around those  areas of mathematics that have been inspired by or have grown out of the  work of the late Robert Coleman.  For an overview of Robert Coleman's work and its importance, see https://resmathsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40687-015-0036-7     Since their conception by Kurt Hensel around 1900,  p-adic numbers have played an increasingly central role in number  theory, and today p-adic methods are ubiquitous.  To a number theorist, p-adic numbers are just as `real' -- and just as important -- as what we usually call "real numbers".  As Kato, Kurokawa, and Saito write poetically in their book ``Number Theory I: Fermat's Dream'':    "In the long history of mathematics a number meant a  real number, and it is only relatively recently that we realized that  there is a world of p-adic numbers.  It is as if those who had seen the  sky only during the day are marveling at the night sky&hellip; Just as there are countless stars in  the night sky, there is one [field of p-adic numbers] Q_p for each prime  p.  What each star is to the sun is what each Q_p is to [the real numbers].  Just as we can see space objects better at night, we begin to see the profound mathematical universe through the p-adic numbers."   The conference funded by this project brought  together experts in the various number-theoretic applications of p-adic  methods, and exposed graduate students and postdocs to state-of-the-art techniques in the subject.   Many of the invited speakers were well-known expositors as well as first-rate mathematicians.
