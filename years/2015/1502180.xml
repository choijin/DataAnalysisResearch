<AbstractNarration>This research project is primarily concerned with work in number theory, a branch of mathematics with important applications to cryptography and coding theory.  The work also features connections to graph theory, a research area with applications to the study of large-scale networks such as the internet.  The project will have a number of broader impacts, including support for high school, undergraduate, and graduate research.   The PI is currently supervising two Ph.D. students from Georgia Tech and one Ph.D. student from UC Berkeley, in addition to one undergraduate research student and two high school students, each of whom is working on projects related to this project.  The PI also has been involved in a number of mathematical outreach activities, including an online course on Number Theory and Cryptography for gifted high school students, and he writes a popular math blog.  These activities will be continued in this project, integrating ideas from the current research whenever feasible.  The project will also contribute to the dissemination of mathematical ideas through conference organization and publication of proceedings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary intellectual merit of the project is that it will increase our understanding of Berkovich spaces, tropical geometry, combinatorics, and complex dynamics, and unearth new relationships between these different areas of research.  Berkovich spaces --  the modern incarnation of the pioneering early twentieth century work of Kurt Hensel on "p-adic numbers" -- have in recent years found applications to numerous areas of mathematical research, including algebraic geometry, number theory, and complex dynamics (where they can be used to study fractals such as the Mandelbrot set).  Berkovich spaces are also intimately connected with tropical geometry, a relatively new and very active area of research with applications to number theory, algebraic geometry, statistics, biology, and physics.  One can think of tropical geometry as a simplified model classical algebraic geometry in which the set of common solutions to a system of polynomial equations is replaced by the set of common solutions to a much simpler system of linear inequalities.   Surprisingly -- and rather mysteriously -- the tropical simplification remembers much more information about the original solutions than one might originally expect.  The investigator's previous work involved unexpected new applications of Berkovich spaces and tropical geometry, and this project will build on and significantly advance that work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Intellectual Merit of the Project Outcomes relate primarily to nonarchimedean geometry and matroid theory.   Nonarchimedean geometry replaces complex numbers like the "square root of minus one'' with even more exotic mathematical structures called "p-adic numbers" and builds high-dimensional curved shapes out of p-adic local building blocks. One of the most useful aspects of nonarchimedean geometry is that these high-dimensional curved shapes, while extremely complicated, have combinatorial shadows called "skeletons" which are relatively simple.

Matroids are beautiful and important objects which lie at the interface of combinatorics and geometry, and in recent years some sophisticated algebra has appeared in connection with matroid theory as well. Matroids consist of a collection of sets called "bases", which generalize structures studied classically in connection with matrices. The most well-behaved kinds of matroids are called "regular".  The PI made several breakthroughs in matroid theory in connection with the research in this project.  For example, together with Backman and Yuen (both former students of the PI), the PI used novel geometric methods to efficiently generate bases of a regular matroid at random. This has applications to theoretical computer science and combinatorics.  One of the most important questions mathematicians ask about a matroid is whether it is "representable" by a matrix. The PI and Lorscheid, building on work of the PI and Bowler, have introduced a new algebraic invariant of matroids, called the foundation, which governs all representations of a matroid in a simple way.  The PI expects the theory of foundations to lead to an improved understanding of matroid representations.      Regarding Broader Impacts, the PI supervised three graduate students, three postdocs, two undergraduate research students, and several high school students. One of the PI's undergraduate research students, Libby Taylor, was awarded the 2018 Alice T.

In addition to writing or publishing 12 research papers during the period of the grant, the PI also edited a conference proceedings.
