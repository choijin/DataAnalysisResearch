<AbstractNarration>Diophantine geometry is the study of integer solutions of polynomial equations, seen through the prism of the geometry of their solutions over the complex numbers.  Structural characteristics of the integer solutions are sometimes governed by subtle geometric phenomena.  We rely on results on the geometry of complex surfaces, especially those defined by equations of small degree.  Examples include equations of degree three or four in three variables.  Our hope is to discern larger patterns governing the behavior of large classes of problems sharing common characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses problems at the interface of algebraic and Diophantine geometry arising from fundamental questions about the behavior of rational points on algebraic varieties.  In the simplest situations, these touch on beautiful constructions from classical algebraic geometry. Beyond these, one quickly encounters deep geometric problems not accessible through classical techniques.  Specific research questions will include: How to interpret moduli spaces of K3 surfaces with level structure geometrically? To what extent can these be organized using notions of derived equivalence for K3 surfaces and their twisted analogs? Can these techniques be used to evaluate Brauer-Manin obstructions explicitly? Given two derived-equivalent K3 surfaces, how are their Diophantine properties related, especially over local fields? For del Pezzo fibrations over curves, how are spaces of rational curves governed by cohomological invariants? As the numerical invariants of the fibrations vary, what inductive structures are shown by the spaces of rational curves?  These will be addressed using deformation-theoretic properties of rational curves, structural descriptions of cones of effective curves arising from Bridgeland stability conditions, and classifications of degenerate fibers of K3 fibrations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A main motivation for this project is the rational parametrization problem: Given a polynomial equation, can we explicitly parametrize its solutions? For example, the equation x2+y2 = 1  defines a circle, and substituting x = 2t/(t2+1)      y = (t2-1)/(t2+1)  we find that the equation is satisfied for each t. Furthermore, almost every solution arises from a single value of the parameter t. We call this a rational parametrization of the equation.  Many algorithms for rendering curves and surfaces - on computer screens or in industrial applications - use such parametrizations. Thus we would like to develop criteria for when they exist.   It has long been known that systems of linear equations can be rationally parametrized, as well as non-degenerate quadratic equations. On the other hand, numerical invariants associated with high degree equations show they generally cannot be rationally parametrized. The case of cubic equations remains quite mysterious. Those in two or four variables cannot be parametrized while cubic surfaces can be, at least over the complex numbers. We expect that cubic equations in five variables are complicated: the existence of a rational parametrization is sensitive to the coefficients of the equation, i.e., is not deformation invariant. However, while examples with rational parametrizations are known - with new instances found by the PI, Addington, Tschinkel, and V'arilly-Alvarado in the course of this project - no cubic equations in five variables are proven not to admit a rational parametrization.  Until recently, the numerical invariants available for distinguishing rational parametrizations were not sensitive enough to detect behavior depending on the precise values of the coefficients. A few years ago, Claire Voisin proposed using decompositions of the diagonal to preclude rational parametrizations and indicated that this could distinguish among equations of a similar form with varying coefficients.  In collaboration with Kresch, Pirutka, and Tschinkel, the PI exhibits examples of this type. Thus the existence of rational parametrizations is not a deformation invariant (of smooth complex projective varieties) but depends on the coefficients of the defining equations. Our examples are four-dimensional, given by equations of the form F(x,y,z;u,v)=0  that are quadratic in both (x,y,z) and (u,v).
