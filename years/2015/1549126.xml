<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a breakthrough innovation that will revolutionize preclinical drug testing, provide valuable information for the first-in-human clinical trials, rescue drugs, decrease time to optimize therapies, and reduce the incidence of safety hazards and adverse reactions. Clinical-Trials-on-a-Chip will serve as the pioneering platform for predictive in vitro testing of humanized biotherapeutics that have become first line therapies for cancer, inflammatory, autoimmune, infectious, cardiovascular and neurological diseases; a market worth $200 billion. The platform will also help rescue drugs by identifying genomic and molecular signatures of human sub-populations and disease sub-types for which these drugs are efficacious and safe; thus, saving pharmaceutical industry over $1 billion per failed drug and a decade of research while bringing safe drugs to patients. Lastly, the platform will serve in a $42 billion personalized targeted therapies market to optimize therapies of cancer patients at a lower cost and faster than is currently attainable using xenografts implanted in mice; thus, saving lives. Ultimately, this project will lower cost of bringing safe and efficacious drugs to market and expedite development of frontline therapies for the benefit of patients, health care and society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide Clinical-Trials-on-a-Chip platform for predictive efficacy and safety testing of humanized biopharmaceuticals; a market worth $200 billion. Due to lack of appropriate testing solutions, targeted therapy and immunotherapy drugs are tested in animals which immune system is compromised to be able to carry the disease. For example, cancer immunotherapeutics are tested in immunosupressed mice to avoid rejection of tumor grafts. Next, the correlation between animal and human studies is low because these drugs are humanized and active only in humans. Lastly, biopharmaceuticals are large molecules which cannot be appropriately tested in vitro either. In vitro platforms are made for testing small molecule, Tylenol-like, drugs clearing in 3-4 hours, not in 1-30 days like antibodies do. This project will solve this problem by providing novel in vitro platforms and methods for efficacy and safety assessment of high molecular weight therapeutics. Specifically, Clinical-Trials-on-a-Chip will enable drug researchers to mirror drug distribution, half-life elimination, and conduct repeat dose testing to better predict antibody specificity and efficacy in diseased organ models, cross-reactivity with normal tissues, and off-target organ liabilities such as unexpected off-target organ toxicity in a simple and easy to use research tool.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this project are:  A fabricated, integrated and interfaced product prototype.  A validated prototype with shown proof-of-concept functionality.  Characterized prototype performance with human liver cells.  Obtained major 3-fold improvement in liver metabolic activity. This is crucial for testing new generation of antibodies and drugs that metabolize slowly.  Superior functional characteristics further achieved via iterative product design and ten iterations.  Undertaken additional developments that turn the Phase I product into a push-button system.  Shown that product answers to a key challenge. The technology was selected and then advertised as a "CRACK IT" solution in the UK.  Granted a patent for Lena Biosciences? micro-organ scaffold.  Granted patent for Lena Biosciences? micro-organ perfusion system and synthetic vasculature.  A putative product promotion at various scientific, entrepreneurial and fundraising events to raise the awareness about the forthcoming product.  Developed a pitch deck and pitched to investors.  Secured investment.  Completed SBIR customer discovery. Identified customer, market, competition and a clear point of entry with minimal barriers.  Identified target application and formed collaborations and partnerships.  Developed a business plan.  Started the product commercialization process.  Through these activities Clinical-Trials-on-a-Chip has been developed as a platform tool that enables pharmaceutical companies, contract research organizations, cancer centers, hospitals, and academic researchers to:  1. Emulate 4 "patients" with 3 major organs, in order to  2. Assess human response to drugs in vitro, and  3. Make informed Go/ No Go decisions to proceed with testing in live subjects  therefore, reducing cost and risk associated with pre-clinical testing of frontline therapy drugs that are inactive in animals and currently cannot be adequately tested prior to first-in-human trials; thus benefiting patients, society, and healthcare industry.
