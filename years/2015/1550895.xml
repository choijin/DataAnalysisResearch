<AbstractNarration>Thermoelectric materials, materials which can convert temperature changes to electric power, offer a potentially green, compact and elegant solution for challenges ranging from energy harvesting to precise temperature control. The wide-scale adoption of thermoelectric technologies, however, has been hindered by low overall conversion efficiencies and high costs. Improvement of thermoelectric material performance relies on the optimization of several fundamental, interconnected material properties, but strategic materials processing techniques have the potential to promote unprecedented levels of performance through selective, tailored modification of these quantities. Toward this end, this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports fundamental research that will provide the foundation for computer-based design of materials that exhibit targeted properties for the optimization of thermoelectric material performance. The knowledge gained from these efforts will enable realistic material processing techniques that provide a path for low-cost, high-performance bulk thermoelectric materials. The potential impact of these technologies is immense, and could provide an economically accessible energy solution across the globe. These research efforts resonate with the vision to educate the next generation of engineers by emphasizing innovation and societal impact: this work will foster the mentality to find smart, natural ways to exploit wasteful features of engineering systems and turn them into something useful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A predictive computational framework to quantify and exploit the synergistic response of thermoelectric material properties to selective vacancy defect configurations will be implemented. Detailed molecular dynamics calculations will establish the relationship between lattice defect configurations and the resulting thermal conductivity and phonon distributions present in the material. These results will be coupled with additional ab initio electronic structure calculations to predict electron/phonon scattering rates modified by lattice defects. The scattering rates in turn will be employed to compute the electrical transport coefficients (electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient) in realistic systems using semi-classical Boltzmann theory. The combined determination of thermal and electronic properties will fully quantify the material figure of merit in response to the material defect profiles, and will be employed to guide the optimization of the thermoelectric material performance parameters. Defect/property relationships established from this combined computational approach will be used to inform realistic material design processes. These initial EAGER efforts will thus enable computer-based design strategies for material processing and strategic designs that lead to optimal thermoelectric material performance for bulk materials.</AbstractNarration>
