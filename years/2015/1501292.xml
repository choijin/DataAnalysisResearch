<AbstractNarration>The Southern Ocean plays a dominant role in the oceanic uptake of excess (anthropogenic) carbon, yet the extent of this air-sea exchange process is poorly represented by earth system models, and its future projection remains highly uncertain. The O2/N2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean Study (ORCAS) seeks to advance understanding of the physical and biological controls on air-sea exchange and uptake of O2 and CO2 in the vast Southern Ocean. This will be investigated through intensive airborne surveys of atmospheric O2, CO2, related gases, their state of equilibrium, along with other ocean surface properties over diverse biogeochemical regions adjacent to the southern tip of South America and the Western Antarctic Peninsula. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ORCAS will utilize the NSF Gulfstream V (GV) aircraft equipped with a suite of high-precision in situ and remote sensing instruments, on 14 flights over a period of 6 weeks in austral mid-summer, from Punta Arenas, Chile, out over the Drake Passage, and with concurrent overflights of the ARSV LM Gould sampling the Palmer LTER site. ORCAS observations will be guided by, and used to test a suite of ocean biogeochemistry models to improve our understanding of key processes and feedbacks in this under sampled yet climatically important region of the world.</AbstractNarration>

The primary measurement objectives of the ORCAS field campaign were: large scale O2 and CO2 distributions from the surface to 12 km, and from 35-75 S, CO2:O2 ratios from vertical atmospheric O2 and CO2 gradients through the mid-troposphere and across the top of the ABL, and O2 and CO2 fluxes to be estimated over a range of time and space scales based on LPDM-derived influence functions for each measurement location. In addition to the core O2, CO2, and related gas measurements supported through this grant, research elements funded separately included hyperspectral remote sensing of the ocean surface and characterization of the emissions of biogenic reactive gases over the Southern Ocean.  The ORCAS campaign has been successful.  All flight data has been made available to the public (http://data.eol.ucar.edu/master_list/?project=ORCAS), a campaign overview paper has been published (Stephens, B. B., et. al., 2018: The O2/N2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean (ORCAS) Study, Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc., https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0206.1.), and other analyses and paper writing is ongoing.  Initial analysis of flight data suggests significant revision of prior estimates of CO2 and O2 exchange between the Southern Ocean and the atmosphere.  This grant funded the University of Michigan contribution to ORCAS. Michigan specific work has focused on demonstrating the capability of Lagrangian flights and modeling to constrain air-sea gas exchange on 4-24 hour time scale.  Demonstrating these methods that initially were develop for land-atmosphere exchange can work for air-sea gas exchange opens the possibility for improving our understanding of air-sea gas exchange of both long-lived and reactive gases.  As part of this project postdoctoral training was successful, with a Michigan postdoc moving onto a tenure-track faculty job.  Broader outreach included extensive interaction with elementary school students, providing direct connection to experimental field work.
