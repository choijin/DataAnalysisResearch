<AbstractNarration>The project develops a new curriculum to educate next-generation security analysis.  The new curriculum attempts to integrate two very distinct areas, data analysis and security.  In particular, new labs and projects in existing courses for security are redesigned to make students naturally exposed to learn big data processing techniques with real-world examples. For example, "large-scale malware analytics" will be provided in Information Security Lab (CS6265), and similarly "large-scale static and dynamic analysis" will be provided in "Software Analysis and Testing" (CS 6340) at Georgia Tech.  To broaden our efforts, all materials and resources (e.g., new course materials, labs and related tools) will be shared as online training modules publicly available so that the educational communities can adopt the data-driven approach in their education.  As a result, the number as well as the quality of security analysts can be vastly increased, and hence our government and industries can be much more effective in securing the cyberspace.</AbstractNarration>
