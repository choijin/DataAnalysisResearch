<AbstractNarration>Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics concerned with the behavior of dynamical systems when they are allowed to run over long time intervals. One of the fundamental results of ergodic theory is the Mean Ergodic Theorem of von Neumann (1932), which amounts to an abstract statement about the limiting average state of a conservative system. In this project we seek to apply concepts and techniques of model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, to establish results on ergodic averages and ergodic recurrence by reinterpreting and extending research results discovered in the decades following von Neumann. The model-theoretic viewpoint should help illuminate and potentially unveil connections between ergodic theory and other branches of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the project's goals is casting recent results on convergence of multiple ergodic averages into a suitable model-theoretic framework that allows combining analytic arguments with the theory of types, forking calculus, and ordinal ranks. An important concept in the proposed research is a ranking of the complexity of "polynomial actions" of a group G on some measure space X, or rather of the induced (polynomial) actions of G on various topological spaces (say, of functions on X). This requires developing an abstract algebraic framework that extends Leibman's theory of polynomial mappings between groups. Ancillary anticipated products of the model-theoretic approach include results on metastable convergence (akin to a weak form of uniformity in situations in which uniform convergence is absent), on convergence of averages on ultraproducts of polynomial-ergodic systems, and on polynomial-ergodic actions of ordinal (transfinite) rank (generalized Leibman degree).Connections and applications to combinatorics, Ramsey theory, and number theory will also be studied.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ * Intellectual Merit This award provided funding to use methods of continuous logic to prove results on convergence of ergodic averages, as well as explore connections between compactness in logic and T. Tao's finitary (``metastable'') viewpoint of convergence.   Classical first-order logic has found numerous applications in discrete mathematics, set theory, arithmetic and algebra since the early XX century.  In contrast, applications of logic to  infinitary mathematics, including analysis, probability, ergodic theory and topology, are more recent and less widespread.  This project formalized Tao's notion of uniformly metastable convergence of sequences in the framework of Henson's continuous first-order logic from the 1990's.  As a result, we showed that a Uniform Metastability Principle (UMP) holds for continuous first-order logic:   "If any theorem about convergence in a class of metric structures, axiomatizable in continuous first-order logic, is refined to a statement about metastable convergence with some rate, then the validity of the original statement implies the validity of its metastable version."   A major outcome of this project was X. Caicedo and the PI's unveiling of a deep connection between uniformly metastable convergence, topological compactness, and logic compactness.  The validity of UMP for a class of structures that is axiomatizable in some logic L for metric structures is equivalent to the compactness of the logic L; thus, the UMP for Henson's logic is only one example of UMP's for various other compact logics.  In fact, UMP follows from the compactness of L using purely topological methods (otherwise not in widespread used in logic), while the study of the converse exploits deeper properties of logics and raises open questions in topology.   By endowing Henson's framework with suitable first-order notions of measure and abstract integration, we studied the mean convergence of ergodic averages under unitary polynomial actions.  Enriching classical unitary polynomial actions to a saturated non-classical setting allows for "soft", finitary natural proofs of ergodic convergence theorem.  We also constructed classical examples of convergence of simple ergodic averages under a unitary polynomial sequence whose range generates a non-nilpotent group.  Another major outcome of this project was solving an aspect of a conjecture of Tsirelson open since the 1970's.  By introducing the notion of definable second-order type over a class of Banach structures, Casazza and the PI proved the undefinability of Tsirelson's space over the class of spaces that contain $\ell_p$ or $c_0$.   * Broader Impacts This project directly supported the research of two Hispanic faculty at the University of Texas at San Antonio (a minority-serving institution in the seventh-largest city in the country), funded visits by coauthors and experts in model theory and topology, financed senior personnel academic travel and dissemination efforts at national and international venues, partly supported a 1-week conference in logic, topology and Cp-theory, and contributed to enriching academic life at The University of Texas at San Antonio.
