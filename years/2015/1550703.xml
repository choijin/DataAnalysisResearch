<AbstractNarration>This project will support attendance by early-career scientists at the Keystone Symposia on Plant Epigenetics:  From Genotype to Phenotype, to be held in Taos, NM on February 15-19, 2016. The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings. There will be ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative possibilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of Plant Epigenetics and the emphasis on understanding genotype to phenotype relationships continues to promise new and insightful mechanistic discoveries.  This conference will provide a forum to discuss new discoveries, as well as the role of epigenetics in crop improvement and the potential for using epigenetic approaches for increasing crop productivity in the face of variable climate and environmental stresses. In addition, the meeting will provide opportunities to share updates on novel methodologies and methods for analysis that help address the need for new bioinformatics methods and infrastructure for sharing results.  A primary goal of the conference is to grow the community of researchers studying or using plant epigenetics, especially those from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Keystone Symposia conference on "Plant Epigenetics: From Genotype to Phenotype" was designed to address key questions in plant epigenetics, including the mechanism of plant epigenetic regulation from nuclear organization to accessibility of loci and regulatory elements; how the activity of epigenetic regulators is controlled by extrinsic and intrinsic cues; and what the similarities or differences are in epigenetic mechanisms in diverse plant species from model systems to crop plants.  This meeting was planned as a part of EPIC (Epigenomics of Plants International Consortium), whose mission is to support "the efforts of the international research community studying epigenomics and epigenetics in plants."  The objectives for this 4-day meeting were consistent with this mission and were to 1) provide a forum for ground-breaking discoveries regarding the role and mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance in plants; 2) actively consider the role of epigenetics in crop plants and the potential for using epigenetic approaches for crop improvement; 3) provide opportunities to share updates on novel methodologies and analysis methods; 4) broaden the participation in plant epigenetics research; and 5) provide an interactive forum to involve new investigators and highlight their research through short talks and poster sessions.     These objectives were accomplished through formal plenary talks, poster sessions, and attendee/speaker networking between sessions and during meals.       All of these talks and posters presented at the conference were directly focused on the role of epigenetics in crop plants and approaches to use epigenetic information for crop improvement.  Importantly, both speakers and poster presenters took advantage of this venue to present unpublished research and solicit feedback.  Several researchers also presented new methods, which they discussed freely between sessions.  In addition, students and junior investigators had opportunity to participate in discussions during the talks and network with other researchers.  The EPIC planning meeting and the meeting wrap up provided a forum to discuss the future of EPIC and its goals.  Key continuing goals of the community include: 1) Maintaining ties among the community &ndash; the group decided to continue biennial meetings; next in Europe in 2018 and then in Japan in 2020; and 2) An integrated genome browser and repository for genomic data (EPIC CoGe Browser) &ndash; currently being worked on by Brian Gregory (University of Pennsylvania) and Eric Lyons (University of Arizona) using the iPlant collaborative.  The browser will provide a way to compare data sets and to share/standardize analysis pipelines.     The 110 attendees at the meeting were diverse with regard to gender, ethnicity, stage of career, and institutional affiliation.  Thirty three percent of the meeting participants were female, 59% were non-US attendees, and approximately 46% of attendees were students and postdoctoral fellows.  The meeting provided ample opportunity for training and professional development. Trainees and newer investigators were exposed to dozens of high-quality oral presentations by more senior investigators, who served as models for high-quality research and communication skills.  Of note, several plenary speakers were junior investigators (Drs. Arteaga V&aacute;zquez, Becker, Johannes, Reinders and Schmitz).  Plenary sessions also included short talks drawn from submitted abstracts, the majority of these presentations were given by students, postdoctoral trainees and newer investigators (Drs. Cahn, Keren, Lewsey, Mozgov&aacute;, Rabanal, Seifert and Zhai).  Three poster sessions also provided a venue for trainees and newer investigators to share their research and to discuss this research with more experienced investigators.  Finally, the unstructured portions of the meetings and the retreat-like venue provided significant and generous opportunities for productive informal interactions between trainees, newer investigators and more senior investigators.     We assessed outcomes with regard to attendee perceptions of the quality and impact of this meeting through post-conference surveys sent via email.  We received responses from 73 (66%) attendees.  The survey results demonstrated that attendees felt that the meeting was of high quality and value.  For example, 93% rated the scientific content as very good to excellent, and 79% of respondents agreed with the statement "I made a contact at this conference that I anticipate will lead to a collaboration or sharing of information, data or techniques."
