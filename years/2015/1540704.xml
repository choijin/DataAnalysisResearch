<AbstractNarration>There is an established need for well-qualified teachers in high-need school districts, which are often located in urban communities. New York City, in particular, has a need for teachers of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) who are competent with a diverse and international student population. With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, and in partnership with New York City District 31, as well as seven high schools and two middle schools in that district, the Robert Noyce Teacher Academy at the College of Staten Island (CSI) of City University of New York (CUNY) will recruit undergraduate STEM majors and prepare them to become secondary STEM teachers. The project will support an average of 8 Scholars per year, for a total of 24 new teachers. Each Scholar will receive 2 years of support. Most CSI students are first-generation college students and their families have high expectations. An honors program devoted to preparing high quality teachers of mathematics and science can play an important role in changing the perception of the value and prestige of teaching. Each semester these undergraduate STEM majors will spend 50 hours in a different high-need host school and will assume increasing teaching responsibilities from tutoring individual students, to tutoring groups, to presenting a "do now", to teaching a lesson. Through advisement, they will satisfy the requirements for New York State initial teaching certification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the host school experience, CSI Noyce Scholars will engage in a cohort structure; learning community environment; mentoring by STEM discipline faculty, education faculty, and collaborating teachers; and international professional development opportunities. A longitudinal research study will address questions such as: (1) What is the effect of specific features of the Noyce program? (2) What topics or issues should be added to the Noyce Scholar's college experience to increase preparedness for teaching in a high-needs school? (3) How do changes in assessment and curriculum in the New York City Department of Education impact the CSI teacher education program and the preparation of Noyce Scholars? and (4) What are specific examples of discrepancies between CSI teaching preparation and school practices specifically in District 31? To address these questions, the project team will gather data from Noyce Scholars and collaborating teachers through surveys, portfolios, and the CSI institutional research office.</AbstractNarration>
