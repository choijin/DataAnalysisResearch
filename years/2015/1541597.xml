<AbstractNarration>To achieve high efficiency and low emission, many practical combustion systems have resorted to combustion regimes wherein ignition is severely impeded. To overcome the difficulties associated with ignition, lasers are an attractive ignition tool for thse combustion regimes. This International Conference has been one of the premier interdisciplinary conferences where scientists with diverse backgrounds (e.g.; experts in combustion, laser physics, spectroscopy, and plasma) come together to present their highest quality research and discuss new ideas.</AbstractNarration>
