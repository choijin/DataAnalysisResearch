<AbstractNarration>Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. One of the most exciting quests in particle physics is the search for new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Extensions of the standard model predict not only new particles with masses above the electroweak scale (about 100 billion electron-volts, eV), but also so-called WISPs (Weakly Interacting Sub-eV Particles). The most famous WISP candidate is the axion, which has been introduced to explain the smallness of Charge-Parity (CP) violation in Quantum ChromoDynamics and which turns out to also be a prime candidate for a constituent of the dark matter in the universe. Similarly, axion-like particles, light spin 1 particles called "hidden sector photons," seem to occur naturally in realistic embeddings of the standard model into string theory. It is therefore an important and fundamental question whether any of these weakly-interacting light particles exists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Any Light Particle Search (ALPS) experiment will give students and postdoctoral scientists the opportunity to develop scientific skills from a diverse set of disciplines spanning lasers and optics, electronics and feedback control systems, vacuum and cryogenics, computational methods and data analysis algorithm development. The required technologies are spin-offs of technologies that were developed for ground- and space-based gravitational-wave detectors. The work supported by this award will build on these investments and continue the development of techniques and devices which have commercial applications in the laser and optics industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ALPS experiment is a "shining light through a wall" study. In such an experiment, laser light traveling through a strong magnetic field may (in part) be converted to axions or axion-like particles. These particles are so weakly interacting that they can pass unimpeded through an opaque wall and then convert (in part) back to photons in a second "regeneration" region of a strong magnetic field where they are detected. The most sensitive laboratory setup thus far is the first stage of ALPS I concluded in 2010. With major upgrades in magnetic length, laser power and the detection system, the proposed ALPS II experiment aims at improving the sensitivity by a few orders of magnitude for the different WISPs. This award will enable US participation in the ALPS experiment by bringing the group's expertise in seismic isolation and suspension systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: The omnipresent additional gravitational force in the universe is one of the largest mysteries in science. The simplest explanation is the existence of some unknown matter that only interacts gravitationally with ordinary matter. The goal of many ongoing dark matter searches is to use postulated feeble non-gravitational interactions between dark matter and known ? standard model ? particles to identify and characterize the dark matter itself. One of the most promising and general searches is the axion-like particle search (ALPS) which is currently in the final design and early construction phase.   Axions have been predicted as a solution to a lingering problem of the standard model. It includes a parameter which can take on any value between 0 and 2&pi; but appears to be exactly 0. This value can be enforced by a new field, the axion field, which is equivalent to the axion particle the same way the electro-magnetic field is equivalent to the photon. If this axion exists it would also be a part of the dark matter. However, once the standard model is extended to one axion, it is possible if not likely that many additional axion-like particles with similar properties exist; after all, dark matter is five to six times more prevalent in the universe than ordinary matter which also consists of many different particles. The discovery of any axion-like particle would even be more revolutionary than the anticipated discoveries of the Higgs boson at the LHC or gravitational waves with LIGO.   ALPS exploits a predicted but very weak interaction between axions and photons inside a strong magnetic field. It is a light shining through walls experiment in which a strong laser beam of 1024 photons per second is propagating through a strong magnetic field. A minute fraction of those turn into axions which propagate through a light-tight wall into a second magnet field region where they partly reconvert into photons. The appearance of a photon beam behind the wall would prove the existence of axion-like particles.   The experiment itself is located at DESY in Germany. It consists of 24 magnets which will form two 120m long magnet strings separated by a central experimental area and an opaque wall.

ALPS will create a unique infrastructure of two 120m long magnet strings which will also be used for searches for other particles as well as studying properties of the vacuum in a strong magnetic field an effect known as vacuum birefringence.   The discovery of axion-like particles would reveal a new type of matter which forms in many ways a parallel world we are not aware of and currently only experience through its very weak gravitational interactions. It would spark public interest in STEM areas as very few discoveries can and help to attract new talent into STEM related fields.
