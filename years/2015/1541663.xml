<AbstractNarration>Under the guidance of Dr. Robin Beck, Ashley Schubert will investigate the influence of cultural interaction on ancestral Cherokee communities in the Appalachian Summit of North Carolina. It takes advantage of long term archaeological data to examine a process of interactional caused change which continues today in many parts of the world.  The project will examine Native American life during the late prehistoric period when some Appalachian communities underwent a process of cultural transformation identified by archaeologists as Mississippianization. The long process of Mississippianization (AD 900-1500) that unfolded in many Native American communities across the midwestern and southeastern United States is identified archaeologically by similarities in artifact styles and community practices. How, then, did mountain communities respond to Mississippian practices that they encountered?  How does the process of social integration or resistance play out in household activities and in public contexts?  Is change expressed differently at sites that experience differing degrees of contact?  Using recent excavations at a Pisgah village site (the Cane River site) and analysis of previously excavated collections from this site and from a mound and village center (the Garden Creek site), this research will compare the archaeological assemblages and spatial organization of both household and community activities across the central Appalachian Summit during a time of major cultural transformation. The goals of this project are (1) to investigate the extent to which Mississippian contact and exchange influenced major Pisgah settlements and (2) to evaluate how these changes affected community practice within the ecology of the Appalachian Summit. This research has the potential to generate a more comprehensive picture of early Mississippian emergence and interaction across a peripheral geopolitical region. This will inform Mississippian studies across the Eastern Woodlands, as well as provide greater insights into early complex pre-state formations at multiple scales of social interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research on Pisgah communities will have broader impacts on local community education, broader collaboration among regional archaeologists, and participation and involvement with descendant communities. Excavations behind a local middle school facilitated an investment of the project into community education and stewardship. By utilizing educational opportunities during excavation and making use of existing archaeological collections, this project preserves the in situ archaeological record while simultaneously acknowledging the collections curated in nearby universities. This project has engaged other stakeholders, including archaeologists from the Pisgah National Forest and the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians, and facilitates a more robust understanding of the archaeological record in western North Carolina while ensuring that results and findings are shared with descendent communities. Results and data will be shared through peer-reviewed publications and the online digital archive for archaeological data, the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR). Public outreach will include instillation of a local museum exhibit and lectures given at local museums and conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mississippian phenomenon is a large-scale political, economic, and social transformation that occurred from approximately A.D. 900 to 1500 across what is now the midwestern and southeastern Untied States. While researchers have made substantial inroads into describing how Mississippian changes differ across many regions of the Southeastern Untied States, archaeologists do not yet understand in detail how this process of expansion and integration played out at the presumed edge of the Mississippian world, particularly in communities outside the river floodplains and valleys of the Midwest and Lower South.    In order to better understand the diversity of Mississippian lifeways and identities in Pisgah communities, Schubert analyzed the material correlates of household and community practice at two Pisgah sites during the later end of the Pisgah phase (AD 1200-1600) &ndash; Garden Creek and Cane River.  Both of these sites are located in the central Appalachians of North Carolina and exemplify two different Appalachian Summit microenvironments for which people may have selected distinct aspects of the Mississippian culture.   From 2013-2014, Schubert directed additional excavations at the Cane River site, in Yancey County, NC, in order to collected more data on archaeological assemblages and spatial organization at the site.  Additionally, Schubert collected data from extant collections from the Garden Creek site, a large Pisgah village and mound site located in Haywood County, NC.      The results of the archaeobotanical analysis of the samples recovered, processed, and analyzed from Cane River show that the plants utilized by inhabitants included a variety of crops, edible seeds, nuts, fruits and miscellaneous seeds and taxa.  Corn was nearly ubiquitous in the samples; beans and squash rind were also present in several samples.   Overall, nuts were the most abundant plant food represented at Cane River.  When comparing gathered resources, such as nuts and edible seeds, to the grown corn, beans, and squash, both types of resources were well represented in the diet.  The seed coat thickness of one of the amaranth seeds indicates that it was a domesticated variety, meaning that the people at Cane River continued to cultivate native crops alongside newer domesicates.  Given the ubiquity of many plant foods across different contexts, it appears there was no specialized consumption.  The results of the zooarchaeological analysis of the specimens from Garden Creek and Cane River show similar taxonomic compositions.  However, whole large mammal bones, recovered almost exclusively from the mound at Garden Creek, are interpreted as evidence of lavish feasting.  The presence of passenger pigeons and large quantity of toad remains found in ceremonial contexts under Garden Creek Mound 1 may indicate evidence of ritual offerings. The differences between the ceremonial context (Mound 1) at Garden Creek and the domestic village assemblages at Garden Creek and Cane River are subtle, but the difference in completeness of large mammal skeletal elements does show that the domestic sites? animals were processes much further for nutrition.  At Garden Creek?s Mound 1, there is no evidence for post-depositional scavenging and dispersal, indicating a single event of deposition followed by immediate burial. This is likely because inhabitants were either feasting and/or the quick burial of the bones was ritual.  There is no evidence from the faunal or botanical remains to indicate a restriction of subsistence that has been typically associated with the adoption of maize agriculture among Mississippian groups.  By comparing the archaeological assemblages and spatial organization of both these communities over time, we have a radically improved understanding of the timing of Mississippianization in the Appalachian Summit and how the tempo of interaction and integration fits into the final years of the Mississippian expansion across the Southeast.  Five samples from various features at the Warren Wilson site (a well-known Pisgah site), date the occupation from cal AD 1282 to AD 1412.  At the Garden Creek mound and village site, eight radiocarbon dates from off-mound features and levels of ceremonial architecture within Mound 1  show that mound construction actually occurred earlier than previously hypothesized, between cal AD 1290 and AD 1414, and that there was a very tight chronology of mound-building.  Nine samples from various features across the Cane River site show the Late Pisgah occupation ranged from cal AD 1287 to AD 1631. These dates demonstrate that the Cane River site occupation overlaps with the Warren Wilson Pisgah occupation and the  Garden Creek Pisgah mound and village.  However, this upland village extends after the probable abandonment of these floodplain sites, raising questions about what environment or cultural factors allowed groups to persist longer at these higher elevation sites.  As doctoral dissertation research, this project provided the doctoral candidate with the opportunity to design and execute a broad archaeological research project from the ground up, utilizing museum collections that might otherwise remain unstudied.  Overall this research has generated a more comprehensive picture of Mississippian emergence and interaction across a frontier geopolitical region.
