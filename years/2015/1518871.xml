<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Midwest Algebra Geometry Combinatorics (ALGECOM) meetings, a series of biannual one-day conferences the Fall 2015 edition of which will be held on October 24, 2015, at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The goal of these conferences is to provide an informal and collaborative atmosphere to promote interaction among Midwest mathematicians. Travel support is for graduate students and speakers. The conference will include a poster session that will permit students and postdocs to present their work. This will assist in the development of STEM research and training at a variety of Midwest institutions. Venues and dates are chosen several months in advance. Past/future locations also include DePaul University, Loyola University, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The conference website is https://sites.google.com/site/algecomday/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference series grew from a desire to bring together mathematicians with common interests (combinatorics and its interplay with commutative algebra, algebraic geometry and/or representation theory). In particular, it deepens the links between hosting Chicago universities (Depaul and Loyola) with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Purdue University, and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. These institutions have significant geographic separation; ALGECOM provides a regular meeting to stimulate interaction and synergies. Continuing support allows extension from Illinois and Indiana towards Michigan. This award continues this trend, which will in particular benefit graduate students both from the Midwest and elsewhere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  ALGECOM (Algebra, Geometry, Combinatorics) is a decade long conference series tradition in the midwest, having started in Fall 2009. It has flourished, with the benefit of NSF support.   The conference is held in a single day, with four speakers, as well as a poster session. It has been held in numerous universities: the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Michigan, Notre Dame University, Purdue University, Loyola University, DePaul University, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, and in Fall 2019, Washington U., St. Louis. The conference provides a valuable meeting place for mathematicians. This is bolstered by the thriving poster session geared towards early-career mathematicians.   The intellectual merit of this conference is expressed through the dissemination of mathematics through the talks and posters. In particular, some major developments in the field of algebraic combinatorics have been expressed at the conference. For example, in Spring 2019, Professor Jennifer Morse gave a talk about her groundbreaking work (with Blasiak, Pun and Summers) on Macdonald polynomial theory.    The conference's broader impacts are significant. Substantial efforts have been placed on diversity and inclusion. For example, in Spring 2017, the ALGECOM conference held at the University of Illinois had all speakers being women. Beyond equity, the conference has been valuable giving a forum for mathematics exchange which will help bolster training and eventual job placement.
