<AbstractNarration>Memories of facts and experiences take time to be stored robustly in the brain. Understanding of the underlying mechanisms would not only yield insight into a fundamental ability found in all animals, but also allow for the optimization of learning and memory in healthy individuals as well as interventions in humans with compromised memory. Many current hypotheses of memory posit the importance of "replay" within ensembles of neurons in the brain. The idea is that in periods of quiescence or sleep, neurons in the hippocampus, a key brain structure for memory, re-excite the patterns of activity that occurred during the original learning/experience. This neural replay of the original activity patterns enables distributed cortical regions to form robust, lasting interconnections and thereby support memory. In rats learning to navigate mazes, the signals of dozens of individual hippocampal neurons can be accessed simultaneously. In this project, neural recording, computational, and statistical tools are developed and tested to observe neuronal activity in the hippocampus of rats over long periods of time-- periods that include repeated active learning and quiescence/sleep episodes-- and address fundamental questions about replay and how individual neurons participate in replay/learning over time. The algorithms developed in this project are shared widely through on-line media. The data collected contribute to instructional material used in interdisciplinary graduate training programs and courses focused on neural signal processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, new neural recording technology and novel and computational analysis techniques are used to acquire and interpret week-long continuous recordings of hippocampal activity while an animal learns a novel task. The result is the first ever qualitative and quantitative assessment of replay over a period of this length. The resulting data have the potential to yield great insight into how changes in patterns of neural activity at the scales of milliseconds (replay) interact with changes at the scales of hours (circadian) and days (learning). The algorithms developed, which are shared through a public on-line site, may be foundational to a new experimental paradigm where neurons are recorded continuously over time. A particularly valuable outcome of the project are novel algorithms for automatically isolating the signals of individual neurons from each other, and tracking slow changes to their signatures over time. Additionally, a new latent-variable model technique for quantifying how individual replay events compare with the patterns exhibited during learning enables the statistics of replay variability to be assessed. The impacts of this work have the potential to be broad, from techniques that revolutionize systems neuroscience to data that underpins new models of learning and memory.</AbstractNarration>
