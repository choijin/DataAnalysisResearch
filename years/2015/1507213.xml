<AbstractNarration>S. Alex Kandel, Surface Heterogeneity and Defects in Gas-Surface Reactions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemists use formulas containing reactant and product molecule symbols to describe a chemical reaction.  However the formula is only a very basic starting point for understanding how the reactions occur and, therefore, how to control them.  Dr. Kandel is investigating the molecular changes, or mechanisms, of chemical reactions taking place at solid surfaces to shead light on how these reactions actually take place at the atomic scale.  He is particularly interested in determining the effect of compositional impurities and atomic-level structure on the rate and the products of a reaction.  In some cases, these changes are desired, such as the enhanced catalytic activity demonstrated by specific defects in many processes of industrial importance.  In others, such as the preparation techniques used to create computer chips and other semiconductor devices, even a small number of imperfections in a surface can result in an unusable product.  Dr. Kandel employs an imaging technique known as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to "see" individual atoms and molecules in order to determine how the solid surfaces change at the atomic level during the course of a chemical reaction.  These experiments produce time-lapsed sequences that show how the particular local composition and geometry influence and control both the rate and the outcome of a chemical reaction.  The fundamental understanding gained in this project helps the future design of new catalysts, surface coatings, and materials processing methods.  Dr. Kandel's research is attractive to students at many levels, and he involves several high school students and their teachers as research assistants every year.  He also maintains a data base of STM images that is accessible to the general public through his web page at the Univeristy of Notre Dame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research program, Dr. S. Alex Kandel is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program to study the reactions between gas-phase radical species and solid surfaces, with a particular emphasis on how the local molecular structure of a surface influences chemical reactivity.  Hydrogen, chlorine, and methane radicals are used to chemically modify well-characterized organic monolayers, and the progression of atomic-scale changes caused by their interaction is monitored using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).  Radical-surface reactions are relevant to a variety of chemical processes in which a surface is exposed to a reactive environment, including combustion (hydrogen atoms), upper atmosphere chemistry (chlorine atoms), chemical vapor deposition (hydrogen, methyl), and plasma processing (hydrogen, chlorine).  In addition, the systematic investigation of how various aspects of the surface monolayer structure influences reactivity helps build fundamental knowledge of surface-radical interactions and new mechanistic understandings of gas-surface chemistry.  Dr. Kandel involves high school, undergraduate and graduate students in his research, and serves as a mentor for high school students in local and international science competitions.  He also maintains a data base of STM images that is accessible to the general public through his web page at the Univeristy of Notre Dame.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding the properties of the surfaces of materials requires these surfaces to be studied at the molecular scale.  At this scale, surfaces are highly heterogeneous, with impurities and defects that can determine the properties of these surfaces.  In particular, chemical reactions that occur on surfaces can have their rates and outcome changed completely by a surface defect, and the overall result of the surface reaction can be determined on the number and distribution of defects on the surface. As part of the work funded under this proposal, new instruments have been developed that allow the measurement of surface properties and the monitoring of surface reactions.  Investigations into the properties of surfaces include the assembly of molecules into ordered structures.  This process is of interest not only for the applications of molecule-thick films as protective coatings, lubricants, or functional materials, but is of fundamental interest as the initial step in a crystallization process.  One outcome of the funded project is a greater understanding of the connection between the structure of individual molecules and the nature of the larger-scale assemblies that the molecules form.  In particular, even very simple molecules have been shown to arrange into multiple different configurations, depending on the conditions present when the molecules are delivered to the surface.  By studying simple as well as progressively more and more complex systems, a deeper understanding is gained of the ways in which molecules interact and the effect of those interactions on longer-scale structures.  Broader impacts of the work include the training of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and high-school students.  Studies of molecular assembly also have the possibility of answering key fundamental questions related to crystal polymorphism, the propensity of many materials to arrange themselves into multiple different crystal structures in the solid state.  This has the potential for broader impacts ranging from material science to the production of pharmaceuticals.  Results were disseminated in papers in peer-reviewed journals and in conference presentations.  In addition, all raw data is made available online to the general public.  A new website was created for the public dissemination of hardware and instrumentation design, with downloadable CAD files and other information helpful in building copies or making variations upon our apparatus.
