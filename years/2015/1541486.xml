<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to develop methods for the modeling and optimization of smart mobility services. Bike sharing programs, smart parking systems, and person-2-person car sharing are the focus of the research program. The research will contribute to the analysis of spatial nonstationary queueing networks. The research program includes empirical analysis, analytic modeling, and simulation studies of the aforementioned smart mobility services. The tangible products of this research includes software and algorithms for the management of these smart mobility services, documentation of research results, evaluation of pilot programs,  issues of an operations research graphic novel, and the development of educational materials on smart mobility services.&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will encourage the further development and deployment of smart mobility services. These services are accessible and energy efficient transportation modes. Accessibility to transportation is a key employment, economic, and help indicator, particularly in low income and minority communities.  The wide adoption of smart mobility services contributes to the U.S. policy goal of dramatically reducing the amount of greenhouse gases that are generated by the transportation sector. The investigator has partnerships with several organizations to apply the research findings directly to the development of bike sharing in Paris, smart parking in Pittsburgh, PA, and person-2-person car sharing in Chicago. Furthermore, the research and education plan supports the increased participation of African Americans in the mathematical sciences through involvement in the Conference for African American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences (CAARMS). Additionally, the investigator writes a graphic novel that introduces public audiences to operations research. The award supports an expansion of this effort.</AbstractNarration>
