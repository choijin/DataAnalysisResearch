<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty who participate in the program "Problems in Mathematical General Relativity" that will run from September 14 to December 15, 2015, at the Institute Henri Poincare in Paris, France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This trimester-long activity will be part of a world-wide celebration of the centenary of Einstein's discovery of general relativity. It will bring together the leading authorities in the field to discuss a broad spectrum of topics, including the following: the formation, rigidity, and stability of black holes; the stability of Kerr-Cauchy horizons; the relationship between geometry and general relativity; the dynamics of self-gravitating matter. The highlight of the trimester will be a workshop that will be held November 16-20, 2015, and that will constitute the event's primary celebration of general relativity's hundredth anniversary.  The program for the trimester provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In ccollaboration with  Lars Andersson  in Germany  and P. Lefloch in  Frnace the PI has  organized a   a    trimester   of  concentrated activity   in mathematical General Relativity (GR)  at   the Institute Henri Poincare in Paris,      dedicated to the  100 aniversary  of General Relativity. The main  conference of the  trimester did in fact coincide   with the publication, in  November  1915 ,  of the historic  sequence of three papers by A, Einstein  which have founded      the theory of General Relativity.   The  main activities of the  trimester  were as follows:     1.)  {September 14 --18,  2015:Summer School: Introduction to mathematical general relativity}  2.) September 23 --25,  2015:Recent advances in general relativity    3.) September 28-- October 1, 2015:  Geometric aspects of mathematical relativity   4.)  October 26-- 29,  2015:Dynamics of self-gravitating matter}   5.) {November 16-- 2,  2015: General relativity: a celebration of the 100th anniversary   6.){December 14--16, 2015:  Relativity and geometry &acirc;?? in memory of A. Lichnerowicz   The main conference of the semester  November 16-- 2,  2015  has    been one of the main world  anniversary events     of the birth of General Relativity  as it has attracted a  remarkable  list of speakers, great lectures,  and a very broad audience.      In addition  the  activities of the trimester have also included  series of lectures  on various  aspects of  mathematical  General  Relativity    given by    J. Szeftel, G. Galloway,  Q. Wang, S Klainerman  P.G. LeFloch   and  G. Huisken as well   as weekly  seminars on various topics  of  current research.    The main scientific themes   discussed  during the semester were:   1.) General Evolution Problem  2.)  Recent proof of  the Bounded $L^2$  Curvature  Theorem  3.)  Recent results  on the  Formation of Black Holes  4.)   Recent   results  on  the  Rigidity and stability of  Black Holes  5.)  Recent results  concerning the stability of the  Kerr Cauchy horizons  6.) Riemannian Geometry and the Constraints  equations in GR.   7.)  Relcent results on the formation of   shock waves in $3D$ relativistic fluids     The    trimester has attarcted a large number of   posdocs and graduate students   form various countries and diverse backgrounds.
