<AbstractNarration>This award funded by the Division of Chemistry Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites Program supports a dispersed REU site led by Professor K. C. Russell at Northern Kentucky University. The site also includes senior researchers and their undergraduate students at Grand Valley State University, the University of Richmond, the University of San Diego, and Colby College. Research projects supported in this site are focused on the study of "theoretically interesting molecules" in the fields of synthetic organic, physical organic, organometallic, and materials chemistry. The REU site supports eleven undergraduate research students per summer in a ten-week program. Broader impacts are addressed through the recruitment of students from local two-year colleges and from four-year institutions that lack significant opportunities for undergraduate research. The site seeks to prepare the diverse student cohort participating for further study in the chemical sciences and graduate school, with eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate research projects include: (1) the exploration of calcium-catalyzed addition reactions (Prof. Kristine Nolin, University of Richmond); (2) the synthesis and characterization of novel [12]- and [14]-annulenes (Prof. K. C. Russell, Northern Kentucky University); (3) the synthesis and evaluation of extraction agents for Ln-Ln and Ln-An separations (Shannon Biros, Grand Valley State University); (4) the synthesis of self-assembled architectures from end-functionalized polysaccharides (Prof. Peter Iovine, University of San Diego); and (5) the synthesis of rigid oxacalixarene scaffolds (Prof. Jeffrey Katz, Colby College). In addition to research activities, the student participants take part in an integrated ethics curriculum that includes training modules and case studies based on current events within the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF Sponsored REU Program on Theoretically Interesting Molecules, The TIM Consortium, represents a departure from traditional REU program in that is dispersed. The dispersed nature of the program offers faculty and students from  primarily undergraduate institutes and students from schools with few, if any, research opportunities to participate in cutting edge research projects and have a research experience comparable to those hosted at a single research intensive university.  During each year of the funding cycle each of the five TIM faculty mentored two students or three students at their home institution (Northern Kentucky University, Colby College, Grand Valley State University, University of San Diego and Macalester College).  One student was internal to each host school and one or two external students were taken from regional colleges (where possible) that did not have significant undergraduate research opportunities.  The entire group generally travelled to two meetings each year, one a national conference and an end of year research meeting where each student gave an oral presentation of their summer research project.  At both meetings the group was joined by an external faculty mentor from an internationally renowned research program.  The TIM faculty and students interacted extensively with the mentor.  These interactions have led directly to graduate school and transfer opportunities for the students and collaborations between Consortium faculty members and with R1 mentors. There were 31 unique students over the funding period, and more than two-thirds of the student participants were women, URM, or both.  Approximately one-third of the students from the funding cycle are still undergraduates.  The majority of the remaining students have gone on graduate school. One hundred percent of community college student participants transferred to four year colleges where they either graduated or are continuing as undergraduates. One of the community college transfers went on to win a Goldwater fellowship.  The Consortium was involved in a broad range of research projects including materials, host-guest chemistry, coordination chemistry, synthetic chemistry and methodology.  More than 45 oral and poster presentations, and peer-review publications support the advances in knowledge developed through these diverse projects.  Oral presentations do not include those given at the end-of-summer TIM Symposium.  During the national meetings The Consortium continued to provide Undergraduate Context Sessions, where consortium faculty would field questions posed by any undergraduate present at the meeting and would guide discussions on those questions.  The Context Sessions were attended by approximately 75 individuals, including plenary lectures, industry members and faculty, in addition to the undergraduates.
