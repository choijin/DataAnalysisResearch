<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Texas Southern University seeks to infuse innovative electrical and computer engineering specialized artificial intelligence (AI) tools into traditional engineering problem-solving routines with a problem-based learning approach to bridge current curricula gaps, enhance engineering students' problem-solving and critical thinking skills, expose them to new technology, prepare them for diverse and multidisciplinary workforce requirements, and attract and encourage students to pursue professional engineering licensure or post-graduate studies in engineering field. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five key objectives: 1) to develop an interactive and comprehensive intelligent database to document, compare, and analyze cutting-edge AI applications in the civil engineering field and use it as the platform and educational media for curricula development and implementation; 2) to develop one new interdisciplinary course  "AI Tools for Engineering Problem Solving" for senior engineering students; 3) to enrich current curricula by integrating innovative AI application case studies into twelve existing civil engineering junior and senior level courses; 4) to foster an interdisciplinary academic setting by hosting a server-based intelligent database; and 5) to support undergraduate students' early involvement in research. The project activities can serve as a model for other institutions that desire to strengthen undergraduate education in their engineering and technology programs.</AbstractNarration>

This three-dimensional alignment strategy includes alignment to teaching objectives, alignment to students? expectations, and alignment to 21-centry STEM field. We gathered data from student learning activities (direct assessment) and national and in-house&nbsp;student&nbsp;surveys (indirect assessment) to study the impacts of the new curricula. The data analysis techniques include the descriptive analysis to find out the frequency data in student surveys, the Independent-Samples T Test to determine if Mean difference is statistically significant with confidence level at 95%, as well as the Grounded Theory method for qualitative data analysis in the indirect assessment. When compared to national benchmarks, TSU results rated fifteen out of twenty-one areas higher than the national average in which they gained a variety of benefits from their AI infusion experiences (Figure 4). With our well-aligned self-developed assessment instruments, TSU student assessment results also indicated very positive results (evidenced in both direct and indirect assessments) in learning engagement, interactions, problem solving skills, future research interests to name a few. To summarize, the new AI infused curricula have noticeably enhanced and enriched the students' experiences by more in-depth learning, generating new knowledge through the exploration of new ideas, improving communication and problem-solving skills. Students received mentoring from faculty not only as their classroom instructor but also as researcher. For future engineers, the ability to understand the problem and to see the big picture is instrumental to their success as responsible practitioners and&nbsp;better candidates for 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century job market. In addition, TSU project activities can serve as a model for other institutions that desire to strengthen their engineering and technology programs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/30/2020<br>      Modified by: Yachi&nbsp;Wanyan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546465000_Figure1Overviewofthecurriculaintegrationframework--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546465000_Figure1Overviewofthecurriculaintegrationframework--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546465000_Figure1Overviewofthecurriculaintegrationframework--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1 Overview of the Curricula Integration Framework</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yachi Wanyan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yachi&nbsp;Wanyan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546538820_Figure2ConceptualGuidelineforAIinfusionpilotcourses--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546538820_Figure2ConceptualGuidelineforAIinfusionpilotcourses--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546538820_Figure2ConceptualGuidelineforAIinfusionpilotcourses--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2 Conceptual Guideline for AI Infusion Pilot Courses</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yachi Wanyan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yachi&nbsp;Wanyan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546666646_Figure3TimelineofAIinfusionexpansionandprogressiondetails--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546666646_Figure3TimelineofAIinfusionexpansionandprogressiondetails--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546666646_Figure3TimelineofAIinfusionexpansionandprogressiondetails--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3 Timeline of AI Infusion Expansion and Progression Details</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yachi Wanyan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yachi&nbsp;Wanyan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546760756_Figure4SampleResultsofStudentsLearningGains(TSUvs.NationalBenchmarks)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546760756_Figure4SampleResultsofStudentsLearningGains(TSUvs.NationalBenchmarks)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546760756_Figure4SampleResultsofStudentsLearningGains(TSUvs.NationalBenchmarks)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 4 Sample Results of Students Learning Gains (TSU vs. National Benchmark)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yachi Wanyan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yachi&nbsp;Wanyan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
