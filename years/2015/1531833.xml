<AbstractNarration>Optical techniques for watching single molecules received the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry because of the way they are revolutionizing research in the life sciences.  In laboratories around the world, the use of fluorescence to "see" individual molecules undergoing chemical changes is helping to reveal how complex molecules like proteins really work or when these proteins become disabled by genetic mutations or pharmaceutical drugs.  Recently, researchers at UC Irvine have invented a new, all-electronic method for "listening" to single molecules.  Instead of looking at fluorescent light coming from a protein, the electronic technique is sensitive to the movement of charges on a protein's surface.  The goal of this MRI project is to develop a new type of microscope that can combine this new, electronic listening technique into the more conventional platform of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy.  Specifically, the project will take apart a fluorescence microscope, modify the microscope to be compatible with the electronic technique, and build up a single, integrated instrument that can simultaneously watch and listen to single proteins as they do their work.  For example, some proteins require one portion to bend before another portion can become chemically active.  Other proteins can be disabled when a drug binds and blocks a particular motion.  Being able to monitor two different portions of the same protein will be an exciting new capability for understanding cause and effect in the biochemical processes that are fundamental to healthy lives.  The instrument developed in this project will add to the capabilities of two major research centers located at UC Irvine and serve as a proof-of-principle for future commercialization efforts.  In addition, the instrument will contribute to the ongoing, interdisciplinary mentoring and training of undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral researchers, any of whom could contribute to similar development and commercialization efforts in the microscope industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single-molecule fluorescence techniques are exposing the complex structure-function relationships among proteins, peptides, and biopolymers.  Direct observation of mechanical organization and real-time recordings of single-molecule kinetics are helping reveal how complex biochemical processes work and how they are affected by mutations and co-factors.  To complement light-based techniques, researchers at UC Irvine have recently exploited the sensitivity of nanometer-scale field effect transistors to create a new single-molecule technology that is sensitive to the movement of charges on a protein surface.  The electronic signals generated by these movements represent a physical mechanism that is independent of conventional single-molecule fluorescence, suggesting that a promising combination of two degrees of freedom can be used to probe individual molecules.  The goal of this MRI project is to demonstrate a microscope that validates this premise.  By combining the nano-transistor electronic technique with total internal reflection fluorescence imaging, the project aims to enable new types of single-molecule science that take advantage of two modes of simultaneous monitoring.  For example, synchronized monitoring may distinguish between cause and effect among complex processes involving energy transfer, substrate binding, bond cleavage, and domain motions, each occurring at different sites within one protein.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Techniques to "watch" single molecules received the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry because of the way they are currently transforming research throughout the life sciences.  In laboratories around the world, scientists are now using single-molecule fluorescence to visualize the growth of cells, the function of proteins, and the manipulation of genetic information.  These new views are helping reveal how complex molecules interact with their surroundings to make life possible.  Recently, researchers at UC Irvine invented a new type of single-molecule technique that measures proteins using electronics instead of fluorescence.  The electronic technique is essentially a sensitive, molecule-sized microphone built from nanoscale transistors.  This microphone can "listen" to the movements of a protein and record activity like folding, recognizing, and binding without using light.  This MRI project created a new type of microscope that combined the two single-molecule techniques.  Beginning from the more conventional, optical type of microscope, the team added compatibility for mounting and measuring single-molecule electronic devices.  This one-of-a-kind combination is now a microscope that can simultaneously "watch" and "listen" to one molecule at a time.  The intellectual merit of building such a microscope is to advance the frontier of single-molecule science.  The two measurement modes are independent, so simultaneous measurement detects new features that cannot be resolved by one technique alone.  For example, it can be difficult to distinguish between cause and effect at molecular scales, since a molecule's successful function is deeply entwined with its shape and orientation.  The new, dual microscope can record the microsecond fluctuations of a protein trying to recognize the right binding partner in a solution of molecules, and then the blink of fluoresence indicating a successful binding event.  The timing of the two signals -- the final chemical event as well as the motions leading up to it -- helps scientists correctly decipher how the protein is completing its task.  In addition to the construction effort and proof-of-principle measurements, this project contributed to the training of five graduate and undergraduate students working under a postdoctoral researcher. Now complete, the instrument will begin serving an even larger group of interdisciplinary researchers.  UC Irvine has a vibrant community of life scientists, physical scientists, and technologists, all of whom interact in collaborative facilities and major research centers.  The research community extends to Cal State University and community college partners through programs like Cal-Bridge and Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity (BUILD), and to the community through our infrastructure for administering user facilities.  The broader impact of this project includes past, present, and future training of junior scientists in advanced techniques for next-generation science.
