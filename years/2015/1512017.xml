<AbstractNarration>PI: Igor L Kuskovsky&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1512017&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sun represents the most abundant potential source of sustainable energy on earth. Solar cells made from thin films of nanometer-sized crystals called quantum dots are potentially less expensive and more efficient than crystalline silicon solar cells currently in commercial use.  The goal of this project is to engineer the composition and size of the quantum dots to enhance the collection of solar energy in the ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths of the solar spectrum, resulting in potentially high solar energy conversion efficiency and power output.  The quantum dots will be made from mixtures of the elements zinc, selenium, cadmium, and tellurium as model compounds for scientific study.  The composition of these mixtures will be guided by computer simulations.  The proposed research may lead to the discovery of new quantum mechanical processes for solar energy conversion.  As part of the educational activities associated with the project, the principal investigator will mentor high school students through Queens College Summer Science Program on nanotechnology related projects for science fair competitions in the state of New York.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop Type-II quantum-dot photovoltaic (PV) semiconductor materials that enable the absorption of light below the band gap of the host material, leading to higher solar energy conversion efficiency.  Toward this end, Type-II quantum dots will be imbedded into a wide band-gap semiconductor host to make an intermediate band gap material with photon absorption characteristics mapped to the solar spectrum in the ultraviolet to infrared range, using material systems and synthesis approaches that lead to increase of photocurrent without loss of open circuit voltage. Toward this end, the research plan will integrate material synthesis, band gap calculations, and PV device simulation to identify ideal intermediate band gap PV materials. The candidate material systems consist of a p-ZnSeTe/Zn(Cd)Te-ZnCdSe/n-ZnCdSe structure with embedded Zn(Cd)Te-ZnCdSe type-II quantum dots. The barriers, latticed matched to the InP substrate, have the bandgaps of about 2.1 eV, while the quantum dots have a valence band offset of 0.8-1.0 eV. These parameters will be achieved by controlling quantum dot size and chemical composition. To accomplish effective partial filling of the intermediate band, a structure with alternatively doped quantum dot layers will be engineered.  Film growth will be designed to avoid formation of a wetting layer that can lower the open circuit voltage of the final material. This process will also allow for the deposition of several hundred defect-free quantum dot layers for improved light absorption.  Device-level simulation will characterize the interplay between device configuration and recombination processes associated with these intermediate band gap materials.  Based on the research, instructional material will be developed on the topic of fabrication of Type-II quantum dots for solar cell applications, and will be used in courses for a professional Master's degree program in Photonics at Queens College, The City College of New York.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The limitation of single junction (?conventional?) solar cells are well established, limiting their practical application and increasingly difficult increase in efficiency vs cost. The third-generation photovoltaics is being actively worked on to defeat these limitations. One of the directions is the so-celled intermediate band solar cells (IBSC), where one strives to increase output current by absorbing more sunlight beyond visible spectrum without decreasing the output voltage, as both contribute to the power of the solar cell.</p> <p>We proposed to use semiconductors formed from elements groups II and VI &nbsp;of the periodic table &nbsp;since they possess material parameters that are in excellent agreement with those proposed for the best IBSC, and potentially have higher output voltage than conventionally used Si or GaAs semiconductors. Generally, this results in the decreased current output, which we proposed to mitigate by utilizing so-called type-II quantum dots ? nanometer inclusions with one type of charges trapped in them ? as conduit for increased light absorption and current production. During this project we had to address and solve several issues, including determining the best material combinations, the parameters for growth and quantum dot (QD) formation, the device design, as well as providing a proof-of-concept. We settled on ZnCdTe quantum dots embedded in ZnCdSe matrix with the same material used for negative contact layer while ZnSeTe would be used as positive contact layers. One of the important reasons for these choices is that all these materials can be grown lattice matched on InP substrates, which are widely available. The lattice matching is important for high quality devices and their long-term operation.</p> <p>These choices proved to be fruitful. We indeed, proved theoretically and experimentally, that the proposed material system does satisfy the most suitable parameters for the best IBSCs. This work also guided our growth approach to finding the parameters for lattice matched devices. We solved the problem of a parasitic unintentional interfacial layer that was decreased the quality of the material and the potential devices. While solving this issue, we have shown that using a binary CdTe QDs instead of ternary ones completely removes this layer and decreases the complexity and cost of the devices. We successfully found growth conditions for lattice matched devices with the binary QDs and have grown several such samples ?on demand?. The lattice matching was measured by X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence studies.</p> <p>To investigate the grown material, we developed a computational tool to analyze the X-ray results in almost real time and to obtain quantitative physical parameters of the QDs, which we previously did not have access to. The latter is used in calculations to precisely determine the indeterminate band energy position, which can be compared with the two-step-photon experiments.</p> <p>Finally, we have established the steps required for fabrication of the devices and produced such devices, as proof-of-concept. We have shown that even our prototype conceptual devices can produce an open circuit voltage ? one of the most important parameters of solar cells ? as high as 0.65 V, with a single experimental 5 mm by 5 mm, device outputting 1 mW of power. We have established the existence of the IB in our devices and have shown that indeed the presence of infra-red light increase the photovoltaic efficiency in the visible, confirming the presence of intermediate absorption states, consistent with the presence of an intermediate band.</p> <p>The Broader Impacts of our research are also multiple. The advances made toward demonstrating a working IBSC will have great impact in the scientific community and the potential energy landscape by enabling the development of a practical high efficiency solar cell. The understanding of the growth process and the solutions found to avoid problems at the heterointerface are also of general interest and can be applied to many other materials; and the calculations developed to characterize the structural properties of buried ultra-small QDs through interpretation of the optical and structural properties of the overall structure is also of general interest to the materials community.</p> <p>On the human resources side, this work led to the completion of one doctoral thesis of one student, who successfully defended his thesis, and one master's student who completed his degree.
