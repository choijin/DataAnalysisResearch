<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project at the University of North Dakota proposes to conduct a conference to bring together K-12 teachers of science and mathematics in North Dakota. The proposed innovative conference would collaboratively combine the annual meetings of three organizations in the state of North Dakota, all of whom have K-12 roles in the development of a STEM-literate workforce squarely in their focus. The three organizations are: North Dakota Science Teachers Association (NDSTA), North Dakota Math Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NDCTM), and the North Dakota STEM Network (NDSTEM). The program involves a statewide collaboration of higher education faculty and staff, state government and local community leaders, K-12 administrators and teachers, informal educators, and representatives of local STEM related business and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will involve the major STEM education networks in the state. The evaluation of the conference will be done by post-conference surveys that will capture the impact of it on the professional development of teachers and the awareness and knowledge of higher education, government, along with business and industry to positively interact and support math and science educators in preparing their students for the workforce of tomorrow.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the "2016 North Dakota Collaborative STEM Conference" project were to promote attendance among STEM education stakeholders in North Dakota (UND) at the conjoint meeting titled "North Dakota Collaborative STEM Conference 2016," particularly among teachers from rural and small schools that serve Native American students. The conference dates were April 21-23, 2016 in Grand Forks, North Dakota, the location of the University of North Dakota (UND) campus. Therefore, this project also provided opportunity and support for UND to engage with other conveners that included: North Dakota Science Teachers Association, North Dakota Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the North Dakota STEM Network, North Dakota Department of Public Instruction, and the North Dakota Council for the Arts. Major activities of the conference included:  $500 Incentive Awards for 53 teachers who would otherwise be challenged to attend; preconference reception on UND campus; preconference Networking sessions between K12 teachers and UND STEM resources; nationally known speakers for conference (Don Wettrick &amp; Roger Bybee); opportunity to view "Most Likely to Succeed" documentary.   642 attendees included: secondary math and science teachers; elementary teachers; special education teachers; enrichment and media specialists; K12 administrators and curriculum coaches; higher education faculty, students, and outreach coordinators; state agency officers, professional engineers, and nonprofit staff. 323 conference attendees responded to a Post-Conference Qualtrics  survey authored by the principal investigator in  collaboration with conference partners.  Results were reviewed by  planners and have been shared with planners for subsequent years.   A vast majority were satisfied with quality of speakers, facilities,  hospitality, etc. Participants grew somewhat or significantly in Knowledge  regarding interdisciplinary collaboration(74%), Teaching strategies (87%),  Content knowledge (83%), Strategies to engage students (86%), and  Relationships, partnerships, or networks to enhance my professional work  (77%).

Most who saw MLTS film (@140) thought it an appropriate and thought-provoking addition to the program. Collaborating organizations crossed levels and disciplines, each with  unique cultures and perspectives. It is recommended that for future collaborative conferences Memoranda of Understanding should  be developed at the very outset of planning. Business and industry professionals want to be involved, and some feedback suggested increased attendance could be attained if conference attendance included Continuing Education Units (CEUs) opportunities for professionals in information technology,  engineering, health care, bio-research, unmanned aerospace systems, precision agriculture, etc.        Last Modified: 12/30/2016       Submitted by: Robert Pawloski]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
