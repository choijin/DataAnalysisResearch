<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to develop a scalable framework for increasing the spectral efficiency of wireless Multiple-In, Multiple-Out (MIMO) systems in environments with long channel coherence time by leveraging implicit channel sounding. To date, standards committees and equipment vendors have avoided implicit channel sounding since key technical questions regarding its use remained unanswered. By providing a zero-overhead method for implicit channel sounding, the proposed system will be able to provide rich environment and user mobility data to the Media Access Controller (MAC) and application layer, with strong implications for the future design of rate and group selection for MU-MIMO systems. With commercialization targeted at unlicensed TVWS wireless devices, the proposed 4-antenna system will be able to provide at least a 4-fold increase in network capacity compared to existing single-antenna TVWS solutions, without suffering from protocol overhead congestion typical in existing multi-user MIMO systems. Integral to this approach is the ability to implement the technology on low-cost software-defined radio hardware, placing this technology within the reach of underserved communities looking for low-cost broadband data solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate an innovative implicit beamforming protocol that eliminates channel sounding overhead in TV-band White Space (TVWS) radio channels, enabling efficient and high-speed, last-mile unlicensed wireless network deployments. The project will develop and benchmark practical implicit channel reciprocity calibration for software-defined radio arrays, while utilizing an innovative software-defined radio signal flow that allows the system to be implemented on low-cost commodity system-on-chip hardware. Both approaches represent a departure from existing methods of beamforming in commercial systems, which rely on both overhead-intensive explicit beamforming and real-time parallel hardware for signal processing and beamforming calculation. While shown to be feasible in academic research papers, both key innovations have yet to be validated in an operational system and several known barriers to implementation are investigated in this project. Finally, the proposed implicit beamforming system will be validated on real TVWS channels though trace-driven system emulation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an implicit beamforming system will be tested on commercial hardware and on real wireless channels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ VUUM LLC is developing Argos, a wireless communication system, to provide last-mile high-speed broadband Internet access to under-served rural markets. In 2015, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) estimated that 57% of the worldÃ†s population does not have access to the Internet. This digital divide deprives citizens of a "vital enabler of economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection," which stems from a lack of broadband access solutions that can economically reach rural populations.   VUUM's technology-based solution to this problem, Argos, is a proprietary base station and remote client hardware and software platform specifically designed from the circuit level to the Media Access Control (MAC) layer to support "massive" implicit Multi-User Beamforming (MUBF), which can significantly decrease the cost of building high-speed broadband networks for the rest of the world.   During this NSF SBIR Phase I award, VUUM prototyped and tested critical Argos system components and performed a suite of measurement campaigns to validate the Argos system design over unlicensed Television-Band White Space (TVWS) radio spectrum. Argos is capable of flexibly scaling up to support "massive" MUBF with hundreds of radios and providing 100-fold capacity gains over existing TVWS products.   VUUM was able to quickly prototype a small-scale Argos system on VUUM's mature SDR platform, WURC. This 8-radio Argos-WURC base station prototype was used to validate reciprocal array calibration algorithms, demonstrating tolerances well within targets necessary for high-performance, implicit MUBF.   VUUM leveraged this Argos-WURC prototype to perform a series of indoor and outdoor measurement campaigns to evaluate the effect of node and environmental mobility on MUBF performance. An FCC temporary license (call sign WJ9XFF) was obtained to perform these over-the-air measurements, the results of which confirmed the hypothesis that the long channel coherence time of TVWS spectrum will permit high MUBF processing latency for fixed wireless systems in the targeted environments, even in the presence of environmental mobility.   In parallel to these measurement studies, VUUM also prototyped and validated end-to-end signal flow on a new hardware and software platform, Iris, its next generation of software-defined radio modules designed at the circuit level to provide a low-cost, production-ready platform for Argos that can scale to hundreds of radios.   These activities validated VUUM's implicit MUBF technology and prepared the company well to scale its system during NSF SBIR Phase II.
