<AbstractNarration>Educators or administrators invested in improving student outcomes in STEM, are constantly looking for proven, evidence-based, trusted sources worthy of their time and investment. They are aware of pedagogical advancements and are willing to do the work necessary to implement innovative practices.  However, at many institutions, the financial climate and lack of professional development funding evidences the need for lower cost, yet high quality experiences and materials. For those who have no support, or must attend a disciplinary meeting instead with their limited allowance, webinars and e-friendly publications specifically provide accessible options to support their own professional development. This includes full-time faculty and the growing number of adjuncts. This proposal extends the benefits of a proven strategy by utilizing new technological platforms to promote broader adoption, increase equitable access, and promote program availability. Widely available and interactive webinars provide people with limited time or funds the opportunity to connect with experts from around the country for a reasonable cost and on a specific topic of need. Expanded applications of the proposed approach (Science Education for New Civic Engagements and Responsibilities) will lead to an exponentially larger number of students with strong scientific and quantitative literacy and more practitioners aware of an approach that responds to the challenges they face daily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 2001 the Science Education for New Civic Engagements and Responsibilities (SENCER) project and the National Center for Science and Civic Engagement has developed and disseminated a range of educational products and professional development programs that support the improvement of formal and informal science education, including over 50 course models, "backgrounder" essays, peer-reviewed articles, residential and non-residential institutes and workshops, and a signature assessment tool (the SENCER SALG-Student Assessment of Learning Gains). All publications are currently digitized, tagged and searchable, and included in a web-accessed "digital library." In the project's most recent iteration new products are in development, including a webinar series, a series of workshops for faculty and administrators, a SENCER handbook, and course modules called "pearls of practice." This team believes that several of these products have commercial potential, either as benefits of a paid membership, and/or for individual download and sale.</AbstractNarration>
