<AbstractNarration>This project will organize and conduct a highly visible dissemination outlet for grant holders from a variety of NSF programs supporting engineering education. This outlet will take the form of a poster session at the American Society for Engineering Education's (ASEE) Annual Conference for each of the four years from 2016 to 2019. Such a poster session has been held at the June ASEE conference every year since 1986, with NSF sponsorship since 1992. The grant programs from which awardees have been invited have changed and expanded over the time and will evolve with changes in NSF programs. Recent sessions have included the following NSF programs: Transforming Undergraduate Education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (TUES), Advanced Technological Education (ATE), Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Talent Expansion (STEP), Engineering Education and Centers (EEC), Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE:EHR), and Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education in Engineering (NUE). Grant recipients who have received engineering awards in the two years previous to the conference will be invited to submit an abstract for inclusion in the poster session. If accepted, they will be invited to submit a paper for the proceedings and, if the paper is accepted, present in the poster session. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF Grantee Poster Session at the ASEE annual conference is a central and well-attended event at the ASEE Annual Conference.  Continuation of the session at future conferences will result in the broad and rapid dissemination of the research-based engineering education developments. The papers associated with all posters will be freely available and searchable via the ASEE webpage. This exchange and availability of ideas will result in those effective practices and research results being adopted by other educators in their own programs.  The session fosters interaction between engineering education practitioners, education researchers, and institutional administrators.  These interactions will lead to new collaborations and project ideas to address emerging issues in engineering education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the organization of a large poster session annually at the American Society for Engineering Education?s (ASEE) Annual Conference during the years of 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.  These poster sessions provided a highly visible dissemination outlet for National Science Foundation (NSF) grant holders with funding related to engineering education. The presenters are able to share their activities and results with a broad range of engineering educators and administrators in attendance at the ASEE meeting, which normally attracts over 4,000 attendees.  Each of the four years, approximately 150 poster presentations were made.  The results are further disseminated through the proceedings papers which each presenter is required to submit and which are made freely available through ASEE?s website at https://peer.asee.org.      Participation in the sessions was by invitation only, with abstracts solicited from investigators with current funding in a variety of NSF programs in engineering education and closely related topics, including Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE), Transforming Undergraduate Education in STEM (TUES), Advanced Technological Education (ATE), Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM), Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), Research in Engineering Education (REE), and others.     Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts: The NSF Grantees poster session is a long running tradition at ASEE, with continuous NSF sponsorship since 1992.  Qualitative and quantitative assessment of the events was performed, which showed that it remains an effective way to promote the exchange of ideas related to improving a wide variety of aspects of engineering education.  The event is always well attended, and presenters reported interacting with an average of 17 other attendees during the 1.5 hour session.  The activity encourages the submission of NSF proposals in the future (60% of session presenters indicated that they had attended this poster session at ASEE before becoming a presenter themselves). The impact is also felt as those who attend adopt ideas presented at the poster session into their own educational programs.     The PI has obtained another grant to continue organizing these poster sessions over the next four years.          Last Modified: 06/05/2020       Submitted by: Amber Genau]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
