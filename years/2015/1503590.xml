<AbstractNarration>With increasing network connectivity available, data generated by embedded sensor devices have been effectively shared in many collaborative applications, such as sensor data collection, environmental monitoring, and wearable computing. Data sharing has been a research topic for many years, with hundreds of related projects. In contrast, the concept of energy sharing among multiple embedded sensor devices has captured very little attention. Until now, energy has been predominately harvested and consumed locally in a single embedded sensor device. In this project, we attempt to lay a foundation for energy sharing among sustainable sensor devices. The outcome of this research will constitute a significant advance in the development of theoretical foundations and practical algorithms for designing and improving energy efficiency of sustainable sensor networks. The broader impact of this work shall be amplified by (i) improving course development and student training; (ii) increasing research participation of minorities, women, and Native Americans; (iii) facilitating international dissemination of research findings; (iv) raising interest in technology among K-12 students and other under-represented minority groups; and (v) fostering interdisciplinary collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
