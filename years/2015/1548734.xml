<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop, manufacture, and evaluate a novel nervous system simulation platform consisting of freely connectable electronic neuron modules. These devices will be used in the post-secondary classroom to further students conceptual grasp of neuroscience and physiology, and to generate lasting enthusiasm for a career path centered on the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) sector. Per a 2012 study by the Department of Education, undergraduate STEM major retention rates are only 35% from initial declaration through graduation. Studies have shown that unengaging introductions to STEM are partially to blame. We believe that our product's positive effect on new knowledge formation and student enthusiasm for STEM has the ability to increase this low retention. We also believe that our company will grow at a similar rate to our benchmark companies in STEM and neuroscience education which, after approximately five years in business, each have several dozen employees and aggregate sales greater than $1 million dollars. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Our Phase I proposal involves undergraduate student construction of neural networks, including a patellar tendon (knee-jerk) reflex using our neuron simulators, and evaluation of student learning and interest in STEM gains resulting from that construction. At the heart of our neuron simulator is an Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller. LEDs integrated into the circuit board provide feedback about the virtual "membrane voltage" level. Similar to real neurons, individual simulators are connected together through axon outputs and excitatory or inhibitory dendritic connectors integrated into each board. The flexibility of the simulator connection pattern can lead to numerous nerve network possibilities, supporting our belief that our neuron simulators are connector toys for the nervous system.</AbstractNarration>
