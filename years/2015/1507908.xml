<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference Recent Developments in Positive Characteristic Methods in Commutative Algebra, held during March 13-15, 2015, at Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia. The motivation behind the conference is to bring together researchers, including postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, in commutative algebra and related areas, in order to exchange ideas and discuss recent developments in positive characteristic methods. Top researchers in the field as well as postdocs and graduate students will be invited to speak at the conference. To make the conference accessible to all participants, introductory talks are scheduled. The conference will provide a platform for the participants to start exploring research aspects related to the highlighted topics, and it is anticipated that they will contribute research progress in these areas within a few years.  More information can be found on the conference web site:  http://www2.gsu.edu/~matfxe/gsu-usc/foca.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on recent developments in positive characteristic methods. Research on positive characteristic methods has seen tremendous developments in recent years via using concepts related to the Frobenius homomorphisms. This includes the tight closure theory in characteristic p, singularities derived via tight closure theory, as well as the corresponding singularities in characteristic zero (via reduction to characteristic p) in algebraic geometry. The highlights of the conference, Frobenius operators and Cartier algebras, also involve the Frobenius homomorphisms in very fundamental ways. Both of them have intricate connections with the tight closure theory, birational geometry, F-modules, F-stability, test ideals, jumping numbers, anti-canonical covers, etcetera. Very recent research also includes the invariant "Frobenius complexity" being defined in order to measure whether a ring Frobenius operators is finitely generated. This conference will provide an opportunity for the participants to get exposed to the topics, exchange ideas, forge collaborations, and contribute to these research areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overall, the 3 day conference (March 13-15, 2015) was successful.  The conference featured 10 talks and a poster session.  On March 13th, the talks were focused on introduction of Frobenius Operators and Cartier Algebras, which are the fundamental concepts of the conference. The purpose of these introductory talks was to go over the relevant definitions, notations, results and open questions in the area, and hence to make sure that all participants had enough background for the upcoming research talks.  On March 14th and 15th, the talks were research oriented, delivered by experts in related areas. These were more advanced research talks that addressed front line topics and questions in studying Frobenius Operaters and Cartier Algebras, and more generally in studying rings of prime characteristic.  The poster session, which was 1 hour long, was held on March 14th. There graduate students participated, displayed their posters, and answered questions.  The speakers included established professors, new faculty members, as well as postdoctoral fellows.  Overall, there were about 50 participants, including professors, postdoctorals, and, last but not least, graduate students. They came from all over the nation, with the farthest international participant from Spain.  Nearly all the participants were supported or partially supported by the NSF funding.
