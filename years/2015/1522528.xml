<AbstractNarration>California Polytechnic State University will replace a fixed-level vessel landing at the Cal Poly Pier, the primary field facility of the Center for Coast Marine Sciences (CCMS).  The CCMS coordinates the marine research and teaching at the University, primarily using the Cal Poly Pier. The Pier extends 1 km into Port San Luis Bay, and has an extensive flow-through seawater system as well as facilities for diving operations and the deployment of small boats. However, the existing boat landing on the pier is an aging, fixed platform that is marginally safe and usable only during the calmest of sea conditions, conditions that are rarely present on the California central coast. This project will replace the current access platforms with a larger fixed platform and calls for the installation of a camel vessel mooring and fender system to provide a buffer between the pier and vessels moored against it. The project will also increase the capacity of the hoist, allowing for easier deployment of vessels. This will make deployment of vessels and access to the waterline and vessels much safer and easier, permitting access in a variety of sea conditions and tidal heights. The new platforms and hoist will allow the CCMS to further increase capacity and scope for year-round field research and field teaching, all while improving access and efficiency and greatly increasing safety.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CCMS, the Pier, and all resources are managed by the College of Science and Math. These resources are available to any researcher or faculty member in the College for no cost, aside from consumables (e.g. fuel), providing a significant in-kind contribution to and lowering the cost of marine science teaching and research. The CCMS currently operates five research vessels, from a 13 foot Boston Whaler to a 26 foot Radon, the R/V Tom Richards. In the Pier's current state, the only boat access to the water is via a fixed landing with upper and lower elements at approximately 3 and 1 m above mean lower low water (MLLW), respectively. As such, access to the water is challenging in all but the calmest sea conditions, which are rarely present along the California central coast. The main elements of this project include removal of the current lower landing, expansion of the upper landing to cover an area of 12 x 20 ft., installation of a camel vessel mooring and fender system to provide a buffer between the pier and vessels moored against it, and replacement of the current jib crane motor and hoist mechanism to a 1-ton capacity system. This expansion and improvement will provide greatly enhanced access to the waterline and to Cal Poly's fleet of small boats in a range of sea conditions, significantly improving safety and expanding the educational and scientific opportunities for marine science students and researchers at Cal Poly.</AbstractNarration>

The Cal Poly Pier is the only research facility of its kind on the Central Coast of California, and one of only a few piers like it in the state.

The newly-installed lower landing is large, with over 450 sqft (42 sq m) of deck space. Such a size now allows faculty to bring an entire class to the waterline, giving a group of students access to the water a full kilometer out in the bay, a level of access that few if any other institutions can provide. The project was complicated, requiring permits from 6 agencies that took two years to obtain. Finding an appropriate contractor required two separate bid package solicitations and over six months, but a contract was signed in early 2018. Demolition of existing structures began in May 2018 and construction staging and off-site fabrication began in July-August of 2018.

These features will greatly simplify and improve access to Cal Poly vessels for students and researchers, and allow us to board vessels safely in a greater variety of sea conditions. A new two-ton hoist located on the pier deck above the landing allows vessels and equipment to be deployed from the pier. The new lower landing also has a new, angled, retractable ladder for fully outfitted SCUBA divers. As with improved vessel access, this ladder will allow divers to enter and exit the water much more easily and safely. Finally, the landing includes fixed rails at deck level for tying off equipment or experiments to be deployed in the water, as well as removable safety railing around the entire perimeter of the lower deck, providing both safely and access when required for larger items. Combined, this landing and all of the features it now has will greatly enhance Cal Poly&rsquo;s educational and research activities, providing expanded opportunities for a range of projects.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/19/2019<br>      Modified by: Benjamin&nbsp;Ruttenberg</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576626807273_IMG_6578--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576626807273_IMG_6578--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Research Dive Class"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576626807273_IMG_6578--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Research Dive Class"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Cal Poly research diving class gears up for a dive from the new lower landing</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tom Moylan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Benjamin&nbsp;Ruttenberg</div> <div class="imageTitle">Research Dive Class</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576626923026_IMG_2435--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576626923026_IMG_2435--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Full lower landing"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576626923026_IMG_2435--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Full lower landing"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">View of the full deck of the lower landing</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tom Moylan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Benjamin&nbsp;Ruttenberg</div> <div class="imageTitle">Full lower landing</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576626977228_IMG_2441--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576626977228_IMG_2441--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The dive ladder"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576626977228_IMG_2441--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The dive ladder"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A demonstration of the new dive ladder</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tom Moylan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Benjamin&nbsp;Ruttenberg</div> <div class="imageTitle">The dive ladder</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576627057454_IMG_2442--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576627057454_IMG_2442--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Deploying gear"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576627057454_IMG_2442--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Deploying gear"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Deploying gear on one of the fixed railings, accessed by removing one of the safety railings</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tom Moylan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Benjamin&nbsp;Ruttenberg</div> <div class="imageTitle">Deploying gear</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576626731273_IMG_2444--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576626731273_IMG_2444--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Lower landing deck"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522528/1522528_10397964_1576626731273_IMG_2444--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Lower landing deck"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">View of the the lower landing deck from the southeast corner</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tom Moylan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Benjamin&nbsp;Ruttenberg</div> <div class="imageTitle">Lower landing deck</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
