<AbstractNarration>A recent study on hiring indicated that interviewers felt that 80 to 85 percent of the job candidates they interviewed were poorly prepared. This has led to a remarkable rise in career coaching and employment websites.  At the present time, the American unemployment rate is 6.2%, representing 9.7 million unemployed persons currently seeking work. Extending beyond this figure, the underemployment rate, or the overall rate of those seeking full-time work, is estimated to be as high as 15.1% for the same period.   The vast majority of these job seekers lacks experience in branding themselves successfully and does not possess an extensive professional network from which to learn about job opportunities; this means that companies could easily be missing out on large numbers of qualified candidates. The proposed technology provides digital tools to help candidates hone their interviewing skills and professionalism for no charge, while simultaneously providing companies with an inexpensive platform to apply video analytics to the task of pre-screening candidates. This will allow companies to gain the high-value information normally only obtainable at high cost during a live interview for a much broader set of candidates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team envisions a free service where job candidates are able to try the proposed concept "Honest Signals" video analytics features before subscribing and gaining access to a network of potential employers. Companies who use the Honest Signals service for employee screening will have access both to a network of users who have asked to have their videos shared with employers and to custom analytics tools which will allow them to screen candidates based on their own unique needs, thus streamlining human resources operations for challenging hiring scenarios such as low-end/unskilled labor, retail associates, and overseas labor. The proposed work will bring fundamentally new kinds of information to job candidate assessment and will help pioneer automated methods to exploit these new data sources. The use of these vastly richer forms of information has the potential to transform the practice of hiring through the use of innovative techniques drawn from social psychology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to help drive towards the commercialization of technologies developed in one previous and one current NSF IIS / Robust Intelligence grants.  Over the course of these two grants, our group developed a novel computer vision / machine learning algorithm that allows for the incorporation of deeper information gleaned from human behavior, which in turn allows for the creation of more accurate and robust systems.  Given the wide variety of potential applications for machine learning and machine vision technology, we began to participate in the i-Corps program in the hopes of focusing and guiding our commercialization efforts.  While we had high hopes for our involvment in the i-Corps program, after participating in the i-Corps kick-off workshop in the Bay Area, it became clear that our venture was not a good fit for the program, and in consultation with the i-Corps program manager, we mutually decided to end our participation in the program.  All unspent funds (the vast majority of the award) were returned to NSF, and we have spent our limited time resources on commercialization activities more directly aligned with our nascent venture's needs.  We have continued to make good progress on this front, securing pre-seed funding and building a customer-focused demo, and we are hopeful that we will ultimately be successful in commercializing our technology.
