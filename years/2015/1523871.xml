<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Adam Pritchard is "Using fossil skeletons and modern reptile muscles to study flying and running in extinct reptiles." The host institution for this fellowship is Yale University, and the sponsoring scientists are Bhart-Anjan Bhullar and Jacques Gauthier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fellowship research is developing musculoskeletal models for extinct reptile groups, the ancestors of crocodiles and the flying reptilian pterosaurs, to reflect the changes in muscle function and anatomy over a period of more than 150 million years.  This is done by first developing new three-dimensional musculoskeletal models of modern reptile groups (crocodiles and lizards) and birds, using specimens at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History. Because these modern animals are related evolutionarily to the extinct animals, the modern anatomical models allow interpretation of the impressions of muscles on extinct reptile skeletons and changes in muscle anatomy, leading to changes in locomotion in the fossil record. Fossil samples come from collections at Yale University, the University of Kansas, the University of Texas at Austin, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Natural History Museum of Denmark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training goals include combined training in modern reptile biology and paleontology.  The models are being made available over the internet, accessible to anyone addressing further questions about muscular anatomy in modern and fossil reptiles. They also are useful teaching tools for anatomy instructors leading dissection labs and ecologists seeking to understand how environmental changes might correlate with anatomical changes in animal groups.  Educational and public outreach also include using the models to train volunteers, both from Yale's undergraduate population and through the EVOLUTIONS after school program. Biological and paleontological collections are critical to the success of the research and training, but very few in the public understand the reasons behind such holdings. The exhibits at the Peabody Museum and the Fellow's own Past Time podcast series provide a window into an active paleobiology project.</AbstractNarration>

In animals with bony skeletons, the attachment sites of muscles and the construction of joints provide important clues about the possible motions of the limbs and the relative development of the muscles that cause those motions. If we can get an accurate understanding of the anatomical mobility in fossil animals, we can get a better understanding of how they fit into their ancient ecosystems. With a larger sample of fossil animals from various time periods, we can also interpret how that mobility changed over millions of years. For this project, we focused on the skeletons of early reptiles from the Age of Dinosaurs.</p> <p>To rebuild ancient muscles and joints, we required high-quality three-dimensional models of joints and muscles in modern animals to compare with fossil skeletons. Over the two years of this project, we obtained three-dimensional data from a series of modern vertebrate animals by i) exposing the bodies to special stains that make soft tissues (e.g., nerves, muscles) visible under certain radiations, ii) scanning the bodies using CT scanning technology, and iii) using the CT scan data to build three-dimensional models of the skeletons and muscles. We obtained a wide sample of modern reptiles and a mammal for this project.&nbsp;</p> <p>We then used the same CT scan methods to rebuild the three-dimensional anatomy of a series of fossil animals. We obtained data for primitive, land-dwelling reptiles: animals that capture the presumed ancestor condition for reptile mobility and locomotion. We then obtained scan data from fossil animals with extreme skeletal anatomy indicating very different habits and forms of locomotion, including i) an animal with apparent digging adaptations called a drepanosaur and ii) a series of animals with apparent flying adaptations called pterosaurs (colloquially "pterodactyls"). In the course of the work, we also discovered a small reptile with extremely bizarre jaw muscles.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the final phases of the project, we used the muscular data from our modern animals to interpret the positions and probable sizes of muscles in the sample of fossil animals. We also took three-dimensional models of the individual bones from our CT scans of fossil animals and re-articulated them in the three-dimensional modeling program Maya, a program used by 3D animators. This program allows us to compare the ranges-of-motion at specific joints across our sample of animals.</p> <p>Our sample of modern vertebrates includes data from seven species, including lizards, crocodylians, turtles, a mammal, and a sphenodontian. The latter is a very rare animal from an ancient lineage independent of other modern reptiles that is very rare in museum collections: to our knowledge, this is the only contrast-stained dataset of this animal. It and all of the others will be made available to the general public as we publish our results. Our sample of fossil reptile skeletons include nine species, including three primitive reptiles, one digging specialist, and five flying reptiles. The data were collected in collaboration with museum collections in the United Kingdom, Denmark, and throughout the United States. Additionally, our data from the digging reptile and pterosaurs represent the first three-dimensional models for the limb skeletons of these species; nearly all specimens of these lineages are badly crushed due to their fragile skeletons. Our initial reconstructions of musculature and range-of-motion in our fossil sample indicate the following: i) the digging reptile had muscles and limb mobility very similar to a modern anteater, allowing it to dig into insect mounds; ii) the flying reptiles transitioned from a primitively flexible and mobile elbow joint to a passively extended elbow, which might be an adaptation to soaring flight; and iii) the jaw muscles in the newly discovered reptile were uniquely expanded for such a small species.&nbsp;</p> <p>The results of our studies have been published in the journal <em>Current Biology</em> and <em>Nature Communications</em>.
