<AbstractNarration>El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events affect weather and climate worldwide, with El Nino impacts over the United States including flooding in California, mild winters in Alaska and the northern tier, and drier conditions in the Ohio valley, with largely opposite conditions during La Nina, or cold phase ENSO, events. The predictability of ENSO is a matter of both practical and scientific interest, and there have been many efforts to identify precursor patters in sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure (SLP), and other variables so that the onset of ENSO events can be anticipated several months to seasons in advance. The PIs have proposed a novel mechanism through which changes in surface wind over the North Pacific associated with the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO, a prominent mode of Northern Hemisphere climate variability) can lead to ENSO events 9 to 12 months later. The mechanism, dubbed trade-wind charging (TWC), involves the southward transport of relatively warm subsurface waters from the central subtropical North Pacific, driven by the curl of the surface wind stress anomalies associated with the NPO (a Sverdrup transport). The southward heat transport warms the ocean thermocline in the central equatorial Pacific, thus creating favorable conditions for the development of an El Nina event (a similar chain of events can promote a La Nina event starting from the opposite phase of the NPO). The examination of the TWC mechanism involves testing three related hypotheses: 1) Positive and negative trade wind charging (TWC) of the equatorial Pacific heat content in isolation is sufficient to generate warm and cold boreal winter ENSO events, respectively; 2) Positive and negative TWC enhances the efficacy of initial subsurface ocean conditions in generating warm and cold boreal winter ENSO events; and 3) Positive TWC enhances the efficacy of Meridional Mode (MM) dynamics in generating warm boreal winter ENSO events. The research is performed through experiments with a climate model, the Coupled Model version 2.5 developed at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. In one set of experiments, the ocean component model is integrated subject to surface atmospheric conditions taken from reanalysis products, so that the ocean state bears the imprint of an observed NPO event, after which the ocean is coupled to the atmospheric component model and the fully coupled climate model is integrated for several additional months to track the development (or lack thereof) of a TWC-induced ENSO event. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has broader impacts due to the societal value of better long-lead predictions of ENSO events, as noted above. More specifically, the research offers specific targets for the evaluation of operational forecast model used for ENSO prediction, and the PIs plan to develop an index that can be used to monitor TWC behavior relevant to ENSO prediction. In addition, the project supports a graduate student and a postdoctoral research associate, thereby providing future workforce development in this research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ El Nino and La Nina represent the warm and cool phase of climate variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean.  El Nino and La Nina have the potential to bring flooding in some regions of the world and drought to other regions.  Notably, El Nino is associated with cool and wet conditions over much of the southern regions of the United States, and La Nina is associated with drought over the same area.  In addition, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean are suppressed in El Nino years and are enhanced during La Nina episodes.  Better understanding of the causes of the El Nino / La Nina cycle has the potential to better understand changing climate in the United States.     The funded work tested a proposed mechanism El Nino initiation.  The mechanism is called Trade Wind Charging (TWC) and involves changes in atmospheric circulation, both in winds and heating, over the North Pacific Ocean.  In the TWC scenario changes in the atmosphere imprint changes in ocean temperature, well below the surface of the ocean.  Over the course of many months, these temperature anomalies migrate to the equatorial Pacific Ocean, where they emerge to the surface.  At the surface the temperature anomalies are amplified by well-known ocean-atmosphere interaction processes that can cause the temperature anomalies to amplify, eventually creating an El Nino.     To test the TWC mechanism we used a combination of observation-based analysis and a series of experiments using a coupled ocean-atmosphere model.  The analysis phase identified the atmospheric pattern associated with the TWC mechanism.  Using these patterns we constructed a series of numerical experiments, whereby we altered the atmospheric condition in the coupled model.  We then ran the coupled model for over a year to see if the TWC generates El Nino favorable conditions.  The analysis and model experiments confirm that the TWC mechanism does generate El Nino favorable conditions, and is an important component of interannual variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean.     The importance substantiating the TWC mechanism is that it could aid researchers in the prediction of El Nino and La Nina events.  Since the TWC mechanism leads the formation of El Nino by many months, researchers could potentially monitor for TWC conditions in the atmosphere, and use that information to make informed predictions of the probability of El Nino formation in the coming months.
