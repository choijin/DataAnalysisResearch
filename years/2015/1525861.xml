<AbstractNarration>News reports are rife with accounts of data breaches, network security problems, and the dangers of keeping personal information online. Modern life, though, makes it impossible to avoid doing just that. It is almost no longer a choice whether we make purchases, communicate with our bank, apply for government services, or file our taxes online - it is the standard expectation. This research explores how people resolve the tension between these two realities and the practices that people have adopted to balance competing demands upon them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to understand how people manage security online, in two ways. The first is in the sense of engaging in technical fixes for potential problems; the second is how they come to terms with the potential risks and develop strategies, accommodations, and justifications for particular ways of working online. Using techniques from anthropology and sociology, this project sets out to understand online security as part of people's everyday lives. The research will have two major outcomes. The first to document the conditions of contemporary digital life, as a contribution to ongoing studies of the impact of digital technology. The second is to provide the basis on which new technologies can more adequately protect people's privacy and security online, and more easily integrate with people's online and offline practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project began with the question, "What tools and strategies do people adopt to keep information secure in the face of data breaches and security attacks online?" We set out to answer these questions through surveys and interviews with a range of non-specialist users of network services in order to understand their experiences of "everyday security". One important piece of context that rapidly emerged was that the great majority of the people we talked with had direct experience of data breaches &ndash; occasions where vendors or service providers they used online had suffered from data losses that included customer information such as credit card details.  We had anticipated that these experiences might have caused people to adopt different security systems such as password managers or VPN tools that might mitigate some of the threats that they faced online, and we were interested in which tools had been successful.
