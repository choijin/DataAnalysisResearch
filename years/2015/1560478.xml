<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (CPP), offers state-of-the-art, multi-disciplinary research experiences in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) technologies, engineering, and computer science to diverse and talented cohorts of undergraduates, particularly women and Hispanic students, from 2 and 4 year institutions with limited or no research opportunities. UAV's have the potential of replacing manned aircraft for dull, dirty, and dangerous missions. In addition, UAV's are less expensive than manned aircraft and pose no risk to human operators. Military applications include intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), battlefield damage assessment, and force protection.  Civilian applications include remote sensing, scientific research, search and rescue missions, border patrol, surveillance of disaster-affected areas, aerial photography, aerial mapping for geotechnical survey, vegetation growth analysis, crop dusting, and precision agriculture.  The UAV industry is the fastest growing sector of the aerospace industry.  However, there is a lack of professionals entering the workforce for UAV related jobs.  This REU program is designed to increase students' interest in UAV technologies by means of first-hand experience on UAV research with direct mentorship by faculty advisors from various departments within the CPP Colleges of Engineering and Science.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site offers undergraduates, in collaboration with CPP faculty and graduate students, opportunities to conduct research during a 10-week summer program, on state-of-the-art technologies and advanced research projects in UAV flight dynamic and control, computer vision, artificial intelligence, embedded systems, and robotics. In addition to their research, students will participate in weekly research seminars, research meetings, and professional development seminars. The seminars will include topics such as literature review, writing a scientific paper, improving written and oral communication skills, technical presentations, graduate education, career paths, resume building, and ethics in science and engineering. The 10-week program will also include outreach activity. The students will give presentations on UAV technologies, engineering, and computer science to K-12 students at local schools. This will enhance students' communication skills, allow them to see the broader implications of their research, and see how they can positively impact society through research. The discoveries made during these collaborations will be communicated to the broader scientific community via publications and presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The REU Site offered research experiences to undergraduates in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) technologies in a multidisciplinary environment. The Site exposed undergraduates including minorities from 2- and 4-year institutions with limited or no research opportunities to state-of-the-art in UAV technologies. The Program involved more than 50% underrepresented minorities and 23% women. The students were carefully mentored by an interdisciplinary team of faculty members from Aerospace Engineering, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, and Computer Science departments. The learner-centered and team-based summer research program covered a wide range of disciplines such as Flight Dynamics, Guidance, Navigation, and Control, Computer Vision, Autonomy, Aerospace Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Modeling &amp; Simulation, Collision Detection and Avoidance, 3-D Mapping, Localization and Mapping, Flight Testing, etc. Students learned fundamental skills in engineering and computer science, and were trained to use computational tools needed to engage in multidisciplinary UAV research. Students also learned to do scientific literature review, and gained skills in technical paper writing and presentation.</p> <p>In addition to their research, students participated in weekly research seminars, research meetings, and professional development seminars. The seminars included topics such as literature review, writing a scientific paper, improving written and oral communication skills, technical presentations, graduate education, career paths, resume building, and ethics in science and engineering. The participants also engaged in K-12 outreach. They presented their research on UAV technologies to Middle and High School students. The participants were provided an opportunity to visit research labs and aerospace industry involved in UAV research &amp; development including Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center. The research projects combined with professional development opportunities helped us shape their future career in industry, Government agencies, and academia.</p> <p>The participants who have so far graduated with a BS degree in Engineering or Computer Science, some are pursuing full-time studies for graduate degrees in the area of UAVs or Computer Science. Others joined aerospace industry involved in UAV research &amp; development, US Navy, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and other related industries. &nbsp;Two students have received DOD?s <em>Science, Mathematics, and Research Transformation</em> (SMART) scholarships, and will pursue graduate degrees upon completion of their BS degrees. Five of the six participants from Community Colleges have already transferred to 4-year institutions including Cal Poly Pomona for BS degrees in Engineering. All of the graduated and non-graduated participants are planning to pursue their studies for graduate degrees, either full-time or part-time. Participants who have not yet graduated or are graduating soon were or have been accepted for summer internship and full-times positions at companies such as Northrop Grumman, Aerovironment, and Lockheed Martin Corporation. All three companies are heavily involved in UAV research and development.</p> <p>UAVs have potential to replace manned aircraft for many dull, dirty, and dangerous missions such as surveillance of disaster-hit areas, search &amp; rescue, package delivery, traffic monitoring, remote sensing, precision agriculture, crop dusting, border patrol, battlefield damage assessment, and supply missions. UAVs are significantly cheaper than manned aircraft and pose no risk to human operators. The UAV industry is one of the fastest growing sectors of aerospace industries. However, there is a lack of students entering the workforce or graduate schools in this area. At the current pace, the work force requirement of the growing UAV sector cannot be achieved. The REU program was designed to increase students' interest in UAV technologies by means of first-hand research experience on UAV research with direct mentorship by faculty advisors from various departments within the CPP Colleges of Engineering and Science. The Program helped develop a trained workforce to meet the requirements of this growing sector. This will have significant impact on society as the strong workforce will also be responsible for the safety of the UAVs and safety and privacy of public. Increased use of UAVs will reduce the cost for number of missions, thereby helping reduce the Government spending at Federal, State, and Local levels for a number of missions and tasks.</p> <p>&nbsp;The REU Program also helped us involve additional students from Community Colleges and High Schools for summer research experience. They were supported by internal sources and funding from Aerospace Industry. They worked alongside the REU participants. This helped us expose them to current research on UAV autonomy and their applications, and motivate them to join or transfer to STEM disciplines.</p> <p>&nbsp;As only one of the few REUs dedicated to UAV technologies across the nation, the Program served as a role model for others who want to establish UAV research at their institution and/or submit a proposal for REU Site. The Program has been appreciated by the Aerospace Industry alike as the Program was able to prepare graduates who are ready to take higher level of responsibilities than entry-level graduates usually do. The Program has also been helpful in upgrading our labs and getting funding from other Government agencies (State/Federal) or Industry.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>
