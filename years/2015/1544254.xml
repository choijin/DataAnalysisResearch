<AbstractNarration>Using High School Transcript Data and Diagnostic Information to Fine-Tune Placement Policy and Tailor Instruction in Developmental Math&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical ability is critical for students' continued success in school, access to postsecondary education, and preparation for future employment. People who succeed in mathematics in high school and college have better employment prospects than others and can expect to earn more. Clearly, mathematical literacy is a growing need in our increasingly technological society. However, many students come to college unprepared for success; depending on the college, up to 40 percent of these students are placed in developmental courses their freshman year. Developmental mathematics is a college course, generally aimed to remediate areas missed in high school mathematics and prepare students for higher-level college mathematics. Unfortunately, many students do not complete or pass their developmental courses; college completion rates within six years are less than 60 percent at many colleges. In addition, even if they do succeed in these courses, they are not necessarily prepared to succeed in more advanced courses. Research that contributes to improving this situation is greatly needed. This Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will use diagnostic testing and high school performance data to improve the process of determining which mathematics courses students start with as they begin their college careers. They will also conduct research to investigate the effects of accurately placing students in mathematics courses on student retention in college and in STEM fields, graduation rates, and time to graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will combine information from assessments and high school and college performance data to improve the accuracy of students' placement in mathematics courses upon entering college. They will use the Mathematics Diagnostic Testing Project (MDTP) assessment to obtain a detailed view of students' mathematical skills and areas in need of remediation. They will collect high school transcript data from Mathematics and English courses, standardized test scores, and GPA, as well as demographic data. They will also collect college level performance data including placement and other assessment results and data on courses taken including grades, withdrawals, and number of course attempts. They will combine these data to achieve two primary goals. Using quantitative methods, they will develop a model to improve placement accuracy. Using qualitative methods, they will identify ways to personalize instruction in college mathematics. They will work with students and instructors at two large urban community colleges in the Los Angeles Community District (LACCD).</AbstractNarration>
