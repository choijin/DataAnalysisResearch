<AbstractNarration>This project will examine the effects of economic restructuring and rising social and political conservatism on gender roles in post-Soviet societies. While much research has explored the effects of neoliberal economic restructuring in post-Soviet regions on ethnicity, labor, and nationalism, fewer studies have paid attention to the connections between gender and domesticity and the geopolitical and economic changes in the region. Anxieties arising from economic liberalization have led to calls for new regulations on family values, gender roles and domesticity.  This study will analyze how neoliberalism and nationalism are redefining gender identities in order to shed light on how political actors draw on symbols of the "home" and "family" to justify restrictive social policies and, in some cases, validate engagement in political conflict. Understanding how political and economic processes link with intimate home and family matters will also help to elucidate the effectiveness of international development programs seeking to empower women.  Documenting the way women navigate social and economic change in their everyday lives will inform regional development policies in an effort to alleviate gender based violence and poverty.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various groups in post-Soviet Armenia have been struggling with economic and geopolitical anxieties caused by continual economic and political transformations.  Many of these anxieties have manifested in new concerns over gender roles and the socioeconomic and political meanings of home and domestic spaces. To better understand these changes, this study asks: 1) What is the symbolic significance of the home and practices of domesticity in geopolitical debates? 2) What are the impacts of economic restructuring on practices of domesticity and the spatial politics of home? 3) How do the symbolic meanings of the home and everyday domestic practices become sites for reproducing or contesting neoliberalism and geopolitical divides? Specifically, this research will examine the discursive production of gender and the material conditions within which people experience and navigate economic change. The researchers will employ critical geography perspectives to illuminate how economic transformations materially affect everyday lives and the ways in which gendered subjects are produced or transformed.  The study relies on qualitative methods including semi- structured interviews, participant observation, and textual analysis of news and magazine articles about contemporary domesticity.  Data gathered from these sources will be triangulated to understand how various actors - citizens, political groups, and international development programs - have renegotiated the value of women's domestic labor as a result of economic restructuring and growing social conservatism.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were three-fold: 1) to understand the social, economic and political links between national and international influences on home and family, 2) to elucidate the effectiveness of international development programs that seek to empower women, and 3) to analyze broader economic restructuring and its effects on the perceived value of women?s domestic labor.  The project documented the way women navigate social and economic change in their everyday lives and how their lives are informed by regional development policies designed to alleviate gender based violence and poverty.  This project broadens and sharpens theories of neoliberalism through an examination of informal, non-capitalist practices (such as unpaid domestic labor) that make capitalist relations possible.  To address these goals, the Co-PI conducted 85 interviews, 16 focus groups with 80 participants, and in-depth ethnographic participant observation with ordinary citizens, mostly women.  An additional thirty interviews with NGO representatives and other political activists working on the questions of gender-based economic development in the region were conducted.  Based on this data, the researchers found that young women, ages 18-25, in post-Soviet Armenia are experiencing a sense of displacement both within their families and within their country?s broader social, economic, and political context.  The older generations call for a preservation of traditional family values&mdash;a multigenerational, patriarchal, and patrilocal family structure&mdash;and conservative gender roles that place women at home and men in the economic and political public sphere.  While the older generation is nostalgic for the Soviet past and a sense of economic and territorial security, young women are eager for global economic and educational opportunities and personal freedoms often found outside of the country. Many educated young women are reluctant to accept a future that is limited to motherhood and housework.  Concurrently, many young men feel threatened by women?s new work opportunities in the service-based economy and seek to reinforce traditional gender roles.  Within this context, conservative political groups have been successful in disseminating information about gender roles and relations that runs counter to the ideologies of gender-based economic development NGOs.  The result has been confusion within popular discourse about what gender means and the intentions of international economic development programs.  Gender in Armenia has become a geopolitical tool for expressing cultural and political allegiance to either liberal, "European" values or "traditional" family values supported by pro-Russian political groups.  Discursively, the concept of gender and discussions about equality between men and women has taken on spatial and temporal meanings that affect how it is understood by regular citizens.  Instead of serving as conceptual tools for understanding social relations, concepts like "gender" and "equality" have transformed into political devices for disciplining international development projects, marking them as "foreign" and "unwanted" interventions.  "Gender equality," for example, is discursively marked spatially and temporally as associated with Europe and "western" values and as "progressive" or "modern," something communities should strive for in the future, and associated with the social and political ideals of liberalism.  Conversely, the traditional Armenian family structure is presented as timeless, originating from a pure "nationalist" past, and uncomplicated by "foreign" influences.  Gender then becomes a divisive concept, separating those with nationalist sentiments from those seeking the freedom of expression associated with western (neo)liberalism.  The third significant finding comes from research based in rural areas where villagers struggle to manage daily existence and face very limited access to the cash economy.  In this setting, exchange of goods and a heavy reliance on social networks continues to dominate everyday life. This results in women?s domestic labor remaining highly valuable as they are key actors in both of these activities.  On one hand, rural women?s practices of exchange and barter undermine the neoliberal economic project that aims to rationalize, individualize, and reduce social relations and labor to market-based values. On the other hand, their diverse economic practices ultimately reproduce the neoliberal project. For example, households? limited cash resources combined with increasingly available loans at high interest rates are used for technological advancements like washing machines, computers, and personal vehicles.  Through an analysis of popular discourses and material practices, this study contributes to theoretical understandings of how geopolitics and economics work across scales, from international geopolitical and geo-economic influences to intimate lives of individuals.  The primary outcomes of this project will be the Co-PI?s completed dissertation and four publications in peer-reviewed journals.
