<AbstractNarration>An ionic compound is a chemical compound in which positive and negative ions are held together by ionic bonds. The positively charged ions are called cations and the negatively charged ions are called anions. Electride is a unique class of ionic compound with nonreducible countercations and electrons as anions. These anionic electrons are neither associated with specific atom or bond nor fully delocalized, but they are localized within the crystal voids. Since these electrons are not bound to any ions, electrides have a great potential for cold emission in a low electric field for high-efficiency light-emitting devices like cold-cathode fluorescent lamps.  Most of these electrides are sensitive to air and temperature, but recently several new layer structured two-dimensional electrides have been developed making the practical application of electrides possible. Two-dimensional electrides also attract scientists because of their unique electronic properties such as superconductivity and for the potential application for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) due to their low electron work function.  Theoretical study of electrides is essential for developing new electrides for selecting candidate compounds with enhanced electronic properties. This research will be conducted with Dr. Sung Wng Kim, a noted expert in material science, at Center for Integrated Nanostructure Physics (CINAP), Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), Suwon, Republic of Korea. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical simulations will use the first-principles calculations based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). Among layer-structure two-dimensional electrides, two carbides (Yttrium carbide - Y2C and Dysprosium carbide - Dy2C) and two nitrides (Strontium nitride - Sr2N and Barium nitride - Ba2N) have been selected for the proposed project.  It is proposed to do theoretical calculations and compare with the experimental results obtained in the host research advisor's group.  The proposed project will obtain structural, electronic, magnetic and surface properties of Y2C, Dy2C, Sr2N and Ba2N using first principles calculations to elucidate the relationship between structure and material properties of electrides.  This award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project that I performed in Korea in Summer 2015, through NSF-EAPSI program concerned the investigation of basic properties of composites which have trapped electrons in their cavities. "Electrides" is the scientific name that we use to identify those compounds.   Before I discussed about my own research work I'll briefly explain about trapped electrons and elctrides. These electrons are  localized within crystal voids rather than being confined to a particular atom or molecule. Ionic compounds have positiv (cation) and negative (anion) counterparts. Electrides are a relatively-unexplored unique class ionic compound in which electrons serve as anions. They have large nonreducible countercations that generate significant interstitial spaces within layers.    The first electrides were based on organic compounds, and were prepared by dissolving an alkali metal in a solution of crown ether. The synthesis of the organic based electrides was very challenging due to their thermal instability and air and water sensitivity.  This challenge provoked the searching for more stable, inorganic, electrides as electronic materials.    The material must satisfy three characteristic properties to have 2D anion electrons. (1) Two dimensional layered structure; (2) positive charge per formula unit; (3) interlayer spacing to confine electrons at room temperature.  The magnetic and electronic properties of electrides vary with the shape of the trapping sites and the size of the open channels that connect sites. However, the underlying mechanism for their unique electronic and magnetic behavior is not fully understood. One of the main drawback of applicability and lack of studies of electrides is decomposition of electrides at low temperature due to reduction process. In this project I proposed to tackle timely important topic of understanding electronic and magnetic properties of electrides that are highly interesting for technical applications.  I have studied yttrium carbide crystal (Y2C) and gadolinium carbide (Gd2C) as potential 2D electrides. Y2C and  Gd2C and have hexagonal layered structure with a larger spacing between the layers. Electronic bands are crossing the Fermi level with a broad dispersion from the cavity electrons located between the atomic layers. I identified two sets of distinguishable bands with magnetic properties. To see the efficacy of the selected candidate as an electride, the distribution of electron conduction charge density near Fermi energy was plotted. Charge density plots also proved that considerable charge extraction in the interstitial site of Y2C Gd2C. I further investigated their magnetic properties such as local magnetic moment and magnetization density plots.  The magnetization density plot was used to determine the contribution of anionic electrons to the total magnetization.   According computational simulation results I can conclude that both Y2C and  Gd2C have electrides properties with anionic electrons are in the crystal voids.
