<AbstractNarration>Searching for planets around other stars is an extremely difficult technical endeavor, yet the scientific benefits include understanding the circumstances that led to the development of life on Earth and estimating the number of planetary systems that resemble our own solar system.  This project exploits the latest technical advances in astronomical methods to obtain images of Jupiter-like planets that may orbit a sample of 600 stars very close to the Sun.  This survey for planetary systems will also map the locations of asteroid and comet belts in other planetary systems.  It will also help identify nearby stars that should be targeted by future searches for smaller planets located in the habitable zones around these nearby stars.  Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in all phases of this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cornerstone of the project is a 600-star, three-year, direct-imaging survey to be conducted with the recently commissioned Gemini Planet Imager at the Gemini South 8-meter telescope.  The architectures of planetary systems beyond 5 AU will be probed, a region that is mostly inaccessible by transit and RV techniques.  The team will also obtain follow-up observations at other facilities such as HST, Keck and ALMA.  The key deliverables are: (a) multi-epoch astrometric measurements of directly detected exoplanets in order to calculate their orbital elements, (b) high resolution maps of the spatial distribution of dust grains associated with the collisional erosion of planetesimals in debris disks, and (c) analytic and numerical tools to infer the past, present and future dynamical interactions between planets and planetesimals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project focused on mapping the outer architectures of young planetary systems to quantify how gas giant exoplanets and debris disks dynamically interact with each other and produce different evolutionary pathways.  The project was challenging because the outer parts of nearby planetary systems are only detectable with the direct imaging technique which requires very high performance of a telescopeâ€™s optical system to suppress starlight and resolve faint point sources and extended structures adjacent to bright stars.  Among our various tools, we used one of the most advanced direct-imaging cameras in existence, the Gemini Planet Imager, to target 531 stars over five years from the Gemini South 8-meter telescope in Chile.  This effort represented one of the largest, most sensitive direct imaging surveys for exoplanets ever conducted. We also obtained astronomical observations from Keck Observatory and ALMA for many planetary systems and developed state-of-the-art data reduction and analysis techniques for the project.  The intellectual merit of the project encompasses over 66 peer-reviewed manuscripts (on average one research paper per month) where planetary systems were discovered and/or quantified. These include the discovery of the two Jupiter-mass planet 51 Eri b and the mapping of 29 debris disks. In addition, we measured the orbits and atmospheric properties of the exoplanets surrounding the stars beta Pic, HR 8799, HD 95086, and HD 106906.  The statistics from the entire survey, including non-detections which provided upper limits to planets in mass and separation space, indicated that giant planet formation is rare beyond 10 au, that high-mass A stars preferentially form giant planets beyond 10 au, and that brown dwarf formation is more common at these distances.  Our research efforts directly involved the research training and mentoring of a generation of undergraduate and graduate students in astrophysics, as well as postdoctoral scholars and research scientists.  Our results were disseminated widely to the public via new social media content, public talks, and five press releases that were picked up worldwide by science journalists.  The projectâ€™s substantial broader impact therefore extended far beyond the professional research community, elevated the publicâ€™s awareness of the latest advances in science and engineering, and nurtured interest and knowledge in STEM disciplines.
