<AbstractNarration>Data centers are the core of modern business environments as computation has been rapidly moving into the cloud in the last decade. Data centers are among the fastest growing users of electricity in the U.S. consuming an estimated 91 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 2013, about 2% of the total electricity consumed by the US. It is essential that data centers be operated effectively to improve energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. Due to aggressive adoption of cloud-based computing, the demands on data centers are growing rapidly, and both academia and industry will need to rethink how data centers are designed, built, and operated to be sustainable. This award will support the organization of a workshop to bring together industry practitioners, academic researchers, and government stakeholders to discuss the vision, challenges, and opportunities for sustainable data center research for the next 5-10 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research agenda of the workshop has the potential for broad and transformative impact on the US and beyond by finding new ways to make better use of energy and natural resources in the nation's computing infrastructure. Furthermore, the workshop will engage early career scholars and those from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups to connect them with a broad community of academic and industrial researchers interested in data center sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Data centers continue to be among the fastest growing users of electricity in the U.S. Due to aggressive adoption of cloud-based computing, the demands on data centers are growing exponentially, and both academia and industry will need to rethink how data centers are designed, built, and operated to be sustainable. Around the mid-2000Ã†s, the advent of mega-scale internet services and public cloud offerings led to a redesign of data center architectures, which addressed key inefficiencies, particularly in electrical and mechanical infrastructure. However, this first generation of improvement has plateaued. It is time for a second, holistic, clean-slate redesign of the data center, encompassing new server architectures, heterogeneous computing platforms, radical networking paradigms, new mechanical and electrical designs, intelligent cluster management, and radical rethinking of software architectures.   The NSF Sustainable Data Center (SDC) Workshop brought together industry practitioners, academic researchers, and government representatives to build the community and discuss the vision, challenges, and opportunities for SDC research for the next 5-10 years.   Attendees identified central challenges across three domains, the SDC software &amp; hardware stack, SDC power &amp; infrastructure, and resources &amp; alliances to facilitate joint academic- industry research. The discussions identified four overarching research objectives: (1) Define the limits of sustainable data center efficiency and benchmark existing systems against these goals. (2) Scale software efficiency to match the rate of data growth. (3) Define algorithms, models, systems, and efficiency metrics that can incorporate smart power grid technologies into sustainable data centers. (4) Develop funding programs and incentivization mechanisms that encourage academic-industry alliances to facilitate knowledge transfer between cloud and data center operators and academic researchers.  The workshop's final report details specific challenges and recommendations to realizing each of these four objectives.
