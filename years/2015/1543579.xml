<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to participate in one of the primary biennial meetings on cross-disciplinary research in space and laboratory plasma physics, the 2015 International Workshop on the Interrelationship between Plasma Experiments in the Laboratory and in Space (IPELS2015) to be held in Pitlochry, Scotland, UK. The IPELS2015 workshop is expected to include presentations in most of the major topics of cross-disciplinary interest in space and plasma physics, including: particle acceleration, self-organization, explosive phenomena, shocks, turbulence, and high energy density physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will be used to provide partial travel support for students and postdoctoral researchers to attend the workshop. The recipients of the travel support will be making presentations at the workshop and will be selected using a merit-based selection process. Supplementary selection preference will be based on available resource needs of the home research group, distance to the conference venue, and the impact of the applicant's attendance in increasing the diversity of conference participation. This workshop will be an excellent opportunity for young scientists to gain information and to interact with more experienced researchers.</AbstractNarration>
