<AbstractNarration>This EARS (Enhancing Access to the Radio Spectrum) program was founded in response to the 2010 Presidential Memorandum on Unleashing the Wireless Broadband Revolution mandated by Congress as part of the National Broadband Plan. It was referenced in 2010 State of the Union and later on the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (More than 1/3 of the bill deals with radio spectrum), the PCAST 2012 Report [President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology] (which calls for vastly increased use of spectrum sharing) and the 2013 Presidential memo (Expanding America's Leadership in Wireless Innovation). The aim of this program is to identify bold new concepts with the potential to contribute to significant improvements in the efficiency of radio spectrum utilization, protection of passive sensing services, and in the ability for traditionally underserved Americans to benefit from current and future wireless-enabled goods and services. The impact is large on the economics of the Nation as seen on the last FCC bidding of 65MHz of the spectrum for over $45 billion early in 2015. It will enable access to science, engineering, industry, civilian and military users of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to provide an innovative, secure and resilient spectrum-sharing technology to improve wireless broadband communications for the consumer electronics sector and enhance spectrum availability for critical government services. The problem of sensing, estimating and detecting several gigahertz of a spectrum bandwidth populated by a number of unidentified (as to location) user's signals has unleashed a highly interdisciplinary research endeavor. This problem a crosscutting problem in all these disciplines: signal processing, communications, systems, and circuit problem. The fundamental challenge is to estimate unoccupied spectrum regions that are surrounded by potentially large signal blockers. The combined bandwidth, linearity and dynamic range requirements of these unoccupied regions exceed that found in state-of-art of radio receivers by several times. Cognitive radio technology has been proposed for such purposes over the last decade; however, its development has run into bottlenecks due to several technological challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the need for a more efficient coexistence of weak opportunistic secondary user signals with mixed strong/weak primary signals that are currently used for commercial applications, public safety, homeland security, and national defense. This proposal aims at designing and optimizing novel and innovative cognitive multi-channel spectrum sensors, enabling smart and dynamic next-generation wireless communication systems, which will coexist harmonically with other broadband systems over the same frequency bands. To accomplish this goal, the proposed research objectives are: (1) coarse frequency estimation of strong primary signal blockers that interfere with the estimation and detection of weaker primary signals and spectrum holes; (2) strong blocker removal system in the radio frequency (RF) and analog domain to filter out the selected channel for reliable determination of opportunistic communications; (3) novel signal processing techniques based on locally most powerful (LMP) detectors for the estimation and detection of weak primary signals and spectrum holes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The current project addressed several bottlenecks that have limited spectrum-sharing technology in wireless broadband communications. The contributions made in the framework of this project facilitate the implementation of cognitive-radio receivers. To this end, a digital linearization technique that can be implemented on any direct-conversion receiver was proposed. This technique eases the linearity requirements of the receiver front-end that are imposed by these broadband receivers while operating in the presence of strong signal blockers. This approach is based on signal component cancellation rather than complex high-cost equalization. It uses two nonlinear LNAs (forming a main and auxiliary path) to mitigate the third order signal nonlinearity components in the digital domain. By using two nonlinear LNAs, and by doing some very simple digital processing, the third order nonlinearity can be ideally removed. In the digital domain, two coefficients are used to perform the cancellation. At the start of the system operation, an adaptive filtering algorithm approach is performed which will tune the coefficients for maximum possible cancellation accuracy.</p> <p>In addition to the linearity requirements, a part of this project deals with the design of a very low-noise quadrature voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). This clock is required to up convert and down convert wideband signals. Cognitive radio systems demand wider spectrum than normal LTE standards, resulting in tough noise specifications for both the RF front-end and the clocks required for up/down conversion. With this motivation, two novel voltage-controlled-oscillators (VCOs) architectures were proposed, fabricated, and tested in a 40 nm CMOS technology while offering significant improvement when compared with state-of-the-art solutions.</p> <p>Lastly, to enable the coexistence of secondary users with strong primary signals, the spectrum must be sensed so that the available channels can be detected for usage. More specifically, this project explored different sparse spectrum sensing techniques, that is, a feature that can estimate the spectrum while using fewer samples, power, computation, and implementation complexity.</p> <p>One of the proposed wideband spectrum sensing techniques is based on a multicoset sub-Nyquist sensing scheme, by exploiting the joint sparsity of the multiband signals. Each secondary user simply implements a multicoset sampler to subsample the wideband signal, to reduce the energy consumption on signal sampling. Then a low-dimensional measurement matrix is computed based on subspace decomposition to estimate the active channel locations. Compared with the traditional sub-Nyquist samples, the measurement matrix improves the computation efficiency and reduces the noise distortion. Moreover, this scheme locates the active channels blindly without the prior knowledge of the spectral support for the received signal at either the sub-Nyquist sampling or reconstruction stage</p> <p>In alignment with this milestone, a fast-convergence, high-accuracy reconstruction and classification algorithm that can cope with environments where power and bandwidth are continuously changing was developed. Numerical results showed a 70% speed increase with 100x more accuracy in comparison with other algorithms, making it more efficient for real-time processing, and an enabler of spectrum sharing in modern wireless communication systems.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/27/2020<br>      Modified by: Sebastian&nbsp;Hoyos</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580147596284_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580147596284_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580147596284_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Digital linearization technique</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sebastian Hoyos</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sebastian&nbsp;Hoyos</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580147652123_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580147652123_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580147652123_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tail switch VCO</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sebastian Hoyos</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sebastian&nbsp;Hoyos</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580148007837_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580148007837_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580148007837_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Broadband cognitive radio</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sebastian Hoyos</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sebastian&nbsp;Hoyos</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580148066869_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580148066869_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580148066869_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cooperative wideband spectrum sensing scheme</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sebastian Hoyos</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sebastian&nbsp;Hoyos</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580148143253_Fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580148143253_Fig5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580148143253_Fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Level-crossing random sampler</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sebastian Hoyos</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sebastian&nbsp;Hoyos</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 5</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580148214761_Fig6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580148214761_Fig6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 6"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1547436/1547436_10397157_1580148214761_Fig6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 6"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Spectrum sensing testing</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sebastian Hoyos</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sebastian&nbsp;Hoyos</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 6</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
