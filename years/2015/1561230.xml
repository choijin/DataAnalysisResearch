<AbstractNarration>Of the more than one million global cases of breast cancer diagnosed each year, approximately 15-20 percent are characterized as triple-negative, lacking the three major therapeutic markers (the estrogen, progesterone, and Her2/neu receptors) for breast cancer. Compared to other breast cancers, it is more aggressive, less likely to be detected on an annual mammogram, more likely to metastasize early, younger age at onset, and more prone to relapse after treatment. Because of the lack of a specific targeted treatment, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the worst prognosis among all breast cancers. Hence, it is highly urgent to develop effective anti-triple-negative breast cancer (anti-TNBC) agents with novel mechanisms of action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this proposed project are to learn how to transfer innovative technology (anti-triple-negative breast cancer agents) developed in the PI's lab to successful FDA-approved drugs for clinical uses. By studying novel anticancer natural products isolated from one type of marine sponge, the PI's group has successfully developed an anticancer drug candidate that exhibits highly potent activities against drug resistant cancers with a novel mechanism of action. Our compound is particularly effective against the aggressive and metastatic cancers without effective drug therapy, e.g. triple negative breast cancer. In this program, the team will learn how to build Lean Startups and Evidence-Based entrepreneurship. Customer discovery and development, risk assessment, lessons learned, agility and evidence-based strategies for technology transfer will be the major emphasis of the project. Specifically, the team will conduct 100 potential customer interviews to find out what customers really want, and how to successfully build a biotech startup company. By the time the team completes its training, each member will have a clearer vision for its company and a business model that will lead the team to success. In addition, the team will carry out Proof-of-Concept study of its leading drug candidate. The proposed project is expected to have a strong impact on the field of developing effective anti-triple-negative breast cancer agents with novel mechanisms of action. It will provide oncologists new powerful weapons in the fight against this deadly form of breast cancer.</AbstractNarration>
