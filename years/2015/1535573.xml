<AbstractNarration>The ability of a wireless device to achieve simultaneous transmission and reception (STAR) over the same channel has generally been deemed impossible, until recently, where several researchers have demonstrated the possibility of full-duplex (FD) communications using a combination of self-interference suppression (SIS) techniques, in classical static-spectrum settings. In this project, the PIs will explore a completely different application scenario for SIS, in the context of opportunistic dynamic spectrum access (DSA) systems. The project is expected to have big impacts on opportunistic wireless systems, boosting their capacity and enabling them to support real-time traffic. This will ultimately lead to the proliferation of a new generation of FD-capable wireless devices. Proposed techniques can be applied in many contexts, including opportunistic super-WiFi access points (e.g., White-Fi systems, standardized by IEEE in its 802.11af standard), femto cells that utilize cellular bands on a secondary basis, military radios that operate in contested- or shared-spectrum environments, satellite radios with anti-jamming capabilities, etc. PIs will integrate their findings in relevant graduate courses. In addition to results dissemination and curriculum development, PIs will carry out a number of educational and outreach activities, including giving tutorials and invited sessions at conferences, guest-editing special issues on FD for DSA systems, etc. PIs will also collaborate with BWAC I/UCRC industry partners to demonstrate a sample of the proposed solutions on their spectrum-agile radio platforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key outcomes of the proposed project might include: (1) novel integration of SIS techniques into opportunistic DSA systems; (ii) optimized mode-selection strategies that enable a pair of DSA devices to dynamically alternate between various communication modes, depending on observed channel occupancy profile, traffic conditions, and SIS capabilities; (iii) theoretical analysis and validation of key performance metrics for an FD-capable DSA link under energy- and signature-based sensing, considering various non-idealities; (iv) a channel access and information exchange protocol for a multi-channel FD-enabled DSA network with heterogeneous SIS levels; (v) a cooperative sensing mechanism for an FD-enabled DSA network with diverse sensing and SIS levels; and (vi) an adaptive spectrum handoff mechanism for an FD-capable opportunistic network.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Traditional handheld radios are half-duplex (HD). In such radios, bi-directional communications are achieved by separating the forward and reverse links in time (time-division duplexing or TDD) or frequency (frequency division duplexing or FDD), as shown in Figure 1. Until recently, the ability to achieve simultaneous transmission and reception (TR) using the same radio over the same frequency channel has been deemed impossible, at least for omnidirectional RF communications. Essentially, the problem is that the transmission power of a wireless device is typically much higher than the received power of another signal that this device is trying to acquire, leading to significant self-interference in the receive chain. The infeasibility of simultaneous TR in RF communications has recently been challenged by several research groups, which successfully demonstrated the possibility of in-band full-duplex (FD) communications over the same channel by exploiting various self-interference suppression (SIS) techniques.&nbsp;</p> <p>SIS has been primarily considered for static-spectrum systems, i.e., the assigned frequency channel is fixed. In this project, the PIs explored a different application scenario for SIS, in the context of opportunistic dynamic spectrum access (DSA) systems. In such systems, secondary users (SUs) are allowed to access a licensed channel opportunistically, provided that they do not cause harmful interference to primary users (PUs), also known as incumbents. This interference avoidance is often done through a listen-before-talk (LBT) strategy, whereby an SU periodically interrupts its transmission to sense the channel for any PU activity. However, while sensing the channel, the SU cannot transmit data, hence degrading its throughput.&nbsp; More importantly, if the SU generates real-time or streaming traffic, periodic interruption of its transmission leads to unacceptable audiovisual artifacts and connection loss. From the PU's standpoint, the SU's inability to sense the channel during its transmission periods (so-called transmitter deafness) accentuates the chances of PU/SU collisions and, consequently, PU outage. By design, SU's operation must be transparent to PUs, since a PU may unexpectedly become active, irrespective of the state of coexisting SUs. To remedy these issues, in this project we exploited SIS techniques at opportunistic SUs in one of two possible ways (see Figure 2 in the supplementary file): TR and simultaneous transmission-and-sensing (TS). While the former mode is already known in current FD systems, the latter mode is quite new, and is particularly relevant to DSA systems. The ability to operate in either mode gives rise to a spectrum awareness/efficiency tradeoff. More specifically, an SU may improve the spectrum utilization by operating in the TR mode, which will dramatically increase the throughput of the SU link. On the other hand, the SU may exploit its SIS capabilities in the TS mode, enabling it to monitor the PU activity while transmitting and quickly vacating the channel if such activity was detected. In practice, SIS is imperfect, and residual self-interference may degrade the sensing accuracy in the TS mode, compared to a classical (HD) sensing-only (SO) mode.
