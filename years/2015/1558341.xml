<AbstractNarration>Paleoclimate data show that the Earth's climate varied dramatically during the last ice age. Abrupt transitions from cold to warm North Atlantic climate states, spaced several millennia apart, were generally associated with increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. While surface climate also varied on shorter, millennial time scales, atmospheric carbon dioxide variability on this time scale was negligible. Changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on the longer times scale, and surface climate on both time scales, are generally attributed to changes in circulation within the deep ocean, but our knowledge of deep ocean circulation variability during the last ice age is limited. Detailed knowledge of glacial circulation variability is required to understand the influence of deep ocean circulation variability on surface climate and atmospheric carbon. This project supports education and training of an undergraduate student and a post-graduate investigator. All data generated as part of this study will be made publicly available. The data will also be valuable to the climate modeling community, which uses paleoclimate data to test the same models used to predict future climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottom water temperature estimates, determined from elemental ratios of benthic foraminifera, from a tropical North Atlantic sediment core, will be used to identify times of deep ocean circulation change during the last 65,000 years. Models predict large and rapid warming at the location and depth (~550 m) of the sediment core in association with a weakening of deep Atlantic water originating from the North Atlantic region. The sediment core has high accumulation rates (&gt;30 cm/kyr), and variations in magnetic susceptibility that can be tied directly to Greenland ice core &amp;#948;18O variations. Proposed radiocarbon and planktonic foraminiferal &amp;#948;18O analysis will further refine the chronology. Reconstructing deep ocean variability during the last ice age is critical to understanding the role of deep ocean circulation in driving glacial atmospheric carbon dioxide variability, which generally varies significantly only on longer, multi-millennial, time-scale. On the other hand, confirming that deep ocean circulation did (or did not) vary on the shorter millennial time scale will help determine whether or not observed large climate shifts in, for example, tropical Atlantic hydrology, occurred in the absence of deep ocean circulation change. Such a finding would imply that episodes of North Atlantic cooling have significant and widespread climate impacts in the absence of changes in ocean dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

As these waters flow northward in the North Atlantic, they cool and their density increases. These dense waters sink in the Nordic Seas and subpolar north Atlantic, and then flow southward between ~ 1000 and 4000 m as "North Atlantic Deep Water" (NADW). This upper northward flow and deeper southward flow is termed the "Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation" or "AMOC". The AMOC transports heat northward into the North Atlantic, warming the circum-North Atlantic region.  Previous research suggests that the AMOC weakened during episodes of massive continental ice sheet discharge into the North Atlantic, such as those that occurred during the last deglaciation. Models and observations suggest that such disruptions in the AMOC cool the surface North Atlantic as less heat is transported northward in the AMOC?s upper flows. On the other hand, models predict strong warming in the subpolar North Atlantic below the surface, and in the upper South Atlantic. These predictions have not been adequately tested.  We investigated the temperature history of the South Atlantic, between 1000 and 2000 m below the sea surface, during the last 25,000 years, an interval that includes the last ice age, and the most recent deglaciation. Our data, based on the magnesium/lithium ratio of the shells of foraminifera that live on the sea floor, provide strong evidence for the link between severe AMOC collapse and large-scale heat distribution predicted by ocean models. Our results indicate that the subsurface South Atlantic warmed early during the last deglaciation, at the same time as a dramatically weakened AMOC.  New data we generated, reflecting changes in the source of water masses, the delivery of freshwaters from melting ice, and nutrients, along with an investigation of climate model simulations, helped isolate the main reasons for the temperature trends we observe at the two sites. The results suggest that waters at ~1000m warmed because heat that is transported northward when the AMOC is strong was "trapped" in the upper South Atlantic when the AMOC weakened. On the other hand, warming at 2000 m was due to the southward flow of warm waters from the upper North Atlantic.  Both data and model simulations imply that rising atmospheric pCO2 did not significantly influence South Atlantic temperatures at water depths between 1000 and 2000 m. The model simulations suggest the contribution of CO2 forcing to subsurface warming was strongest in the North Atlantic above 2000 m. This and other model predictions should be tested in the future with additional data, as agreement between data and models gives us confidence in model predictions of future changes in the climate system.
