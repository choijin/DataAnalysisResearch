<AbstractNarration>Located in the Canary Islands, the 10.4-meter diameter Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) is the largest optical-infrared telescope in the world.  The PI of this award led the team that built the GTC's "CanariCam", a unique camera that images heat radiation from galaxies, star-forming regions, young planetary systems, supernovae, and other phenomena at the frontiers of astrophysics. To maximize the science productivity of telescope time provided in return for CanariCam development and to forge a strong international science collaboration, the CanariCam Science Team (CCST) was formed to provide access to this enormous telescope to US astronomers, including graduate students and post-docs, who would not otherwise be permitted to use it. This NSF award supports essential activities of this international team, particularly science planning, observing, analysis, and dissemination of results. This program also introduces many US astronomers to observational techniques with which they are unlikely to have had much previous experience, and it provides graduate students and post-docs an unparalleled opportunity to receive training in an international environment while exposing them to advanced astronomical techniques and research at the world's largest telescope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award provides critical on-going support to assure the success of the CanariCam Science Team (CCST). A highly diverse set of science programs proposed by individual scientists on the CCST are shaped by the PI into a coherent super-program to be carried out across several observing semesters and on any particular night. Especially for more complex programs, the PI meets face-to-face with CCST members and travels to the telescope for some observing runs to ensure that all CCST observations are carried out smoothly and efficiently by GTC staff. Data reduction for CanariCam is supported formally in publicly available IRAF routines, but this award also supports community-wide dissemination of high-quality, mostly IDL, reduction and analysis routines developed by CCST members for their own purposes. Finally, annual team meetings supported by this award play a critical role in engaging and training students and postdocs, since they are scientifically intense and hands-on experiences in which real science is being planned, discussed, and debated.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview</span></strong></p> <p>The Gran Telescopio Canarias is the largest optical-IR telescope in the world. Located on La Palma in Spain?s Canary Islands, its segmented mirror has a light-collecting area equivalent to a 10.4m circular mirror. The University of Florida (UF) is a GTC partner with Spain and Mexico. Telesco led the team that built CanariCam, the GTC?s camera that operates in the mid-IR (?thermal emission?) spectral region&nbsp;(Figure 1).&nbsp;CanariCam has several observational modes. It takes two-dimensional ?heat? images of celestial targets. It can also take spectra, spreading the light into its colors to permit exploring the matter?s composition and motion. CanariCam has a polarization mode, permitting an observer to look at polarized light in images and in spectra. Polarization provides unique information about the properties of matter and, most elusive of all, the ghostly interstellar magnetic fields.&nbsp;Since it began operation in 2012, CanariCam has achieved outstanding results.</p> <p>For building CanariCam, Telesco was awarded special bonus nights of GTC observing time with CanariCam. To maximize the science productivity of this special time and to forge a wide-ranging scientific collaboration that could provide long-lasting benefit to science, Telesco formed the CanariCam Science Team (CCST), an international team of about 40 astronomers who carried out a major program of astronomical observations using this special observing time. While each team member provided his or her own research funding, this NSF award supported the overall team effort ? the glue ? that enabled special team meetings, observer attendance at the observatory, travel to permit science interaction among team members, and special software development that could be used by all investigators. The NSF support permitted the PI to weave together the diverse science goals into a coherent program, and it was vital for maintaining&nbsp;a highly distributed, diverse, and yet cohesive and inspired Science Team.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advancing Knowledge</span></strong></p> <p>The science program emphasized groundbreaking research in a range of research areas, including sub-stellar objects (brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets), active galaxies, disks where planets are forming supernovae, and magnetic fields.&nbsp;Here are a few examples of key results (lead Team scientist indicated).</p> <p>(1) Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): We have shown (E. Lopez-Rodriguez) that mid-IR polarization of scattered IR light from central toroids orbiting supermassive black holes in the centers of AGN fits into the widely accepted ?unified-model? picture. In that picture, various types of AGN are not intrinsically different but seem to differ because of our viewing perspective.&nbsp;</p> <p>(2) Polarized light from giant interstellar molecules: We have discovered (H. Zhang) that IR light scattered by giant molecules call polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is polarized. PAHs hold a large fraction of all the interstellar carbon, and they have major effect on energy transport across the universe. Our observations deepen our understanding of their structure and how they interact with interstellar magnetic fields and radiation.</p> <p>&nbsp;(3) Supernovae: We have made (C.

Roche) the most detailed image of the magnetic field circulating in the region spanning only a few light years near the very center of our Galaxy (Figure 3).
