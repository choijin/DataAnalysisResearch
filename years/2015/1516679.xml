<AbstractNarration>The southern Great Basin is among the most arid regions in North America. It has almost no&lt;br/&gt;perennial streams, but does have &gt;1,000 springs. These springs are islands of aquatic habitat&lt;br/&gt;in an ocean of desert. Remarkably, many of these isolated springs contain diverse aquatic&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems and even endemic species of fish, spring snails, and other aquatic organisms. The&lt;br/&gt;presence of many aquatic species that can only survive in water is evidence that the springs&lt;br/&gt;are remnants of a perennial drainage system, and the presence of endemic species requiring&lt;br/&gt;intervals in the million-year range for genetic divergence are evidence that at least some&lt;br/&gt;of these springs have never desiccated over the geological time scale. Aquatic biogeographical&lt;br/&gt;patterns thus inform the geological and hydrological history of the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to expand the already-large regional biogeographical database and to use the combined&lt;br/&gt;new and preexisting data to test models of tectonic and paleohydrological evolution of the&lt;br/&gt;southern Great Basin. The PIs will focus on two timescales: that of the extensional breakup of&lt;br/&gt;the region from the late Miocene to the present and that of glacial/interglacial climate cycles.&lt;br/&gt;Extensive work has been done to understand the extensional history of the region, which started&lt;br/&gt;in the eastern portion of the study area at ~14 Ma and migrated westward to the Sierra Nevada&lt;br/&gt;front, driven by plate-boundary dynamics. They will simulate this evolution using a regional&lt;br/&gt;quasi-3D kinematic/tectonic-geomorphic-hydrologic coupled model that fully couples movement&lt;br/&gt;along faults, mass distribution, magmatism, isostatic compensation and flexural deformation&lt;br/&gt;with hydrology and surface geomorphic processes, including erosion and deposition. The extensional&lt;br/&gt;fragmentation of the hydrological system will be studied and groundwater flow, necessary to&lt;br/&gt;simulate the resulting development of springs, will be an integral part of the regional tectonic-geomorphic-hydrologic model.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;Modeled paleohydrologic histories will be tested against biotic data (aquatic biota inventories,&lt;br/&gt;microbial and macrofaunal DNA, and genetic divergence times) with island biogeography theory.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will test for relations of hydrologic fragmentation chronology with endemic species and&lt;br/&gt;for ecosystem diversity with spring resilience, as inferred from groundwater ages and climatically&lt;br/&gt;driven modeling. They will use these results to assess and improve their tectonic/paleohydrologic models.</AbstractNarration>
