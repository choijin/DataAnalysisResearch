<AbstractNarration>This research will synthesize all data available about the evolutionary relationships, paleontology, and diversity of geckos, a group of more than 1600 lizard species with a worldwide distribution in warm-climate areas. The researcher will use the pattern of relationships among geckos revealed by the synthesis to interpret the evolution of ecological, behavioral, physiological, and other traits of geckos. The project will make previously unpublished raw data available on publicly accessible websites and will result in publication of a comprehensive book describing the diversity and comparative biology of geckos. The project will identify avenues of research in evolutionary biology for which geckos are an ideal model system and will serve to guide the future research of students and others. This project will contribute to the professional development of Biology undergraduates and Masters students at a primarily undergraduate institution by providing opportunities for participation at all levels of the research underlying this project. It will also interface with a traveling museum exhibit aimed at the general public, and children in particular, that uses geckos to promote the understanding and appreciation of global biodiversity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data relating to the genealogical, spatial and temporal relationships within Gekkota (paleontology, morphology, allozymes, mtDNA, multigene data (Sanger and Next Generation sequencing, karyology, etc.) will be evaluated, synthesized and the sources of conflict considered. Data gathered over three decades will be compiled from published papers as well as unpublished projects. These data will be combined into new, expanded matrices and analyzed using a diversity of widely employed phylogenetic methods. The PI will assess data quality, the strength of the phylogenetic signal, and in the case of conflicts among datasets, will identify probable causes and provide the rationale for a preferred interpretation. Available biological data will be analyzed in the context of the phylogenies generated using either formal methods (e.g., ancestral state reconstruction of traits of interest, either across the entire tree or some portions thereof), or, if data are too incomplete for this, they will be assessed qualitatively. Knowledge gaps will be identified and research priorities will be selected to both close these gaps and pinpoint evolutionary questions for which geckos would be especially good systems, thus facilitating comparative biological investigations of the group by a broad spectrum of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Geckos comprise 1900 diverse species of lizards that are distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics of the world. They are known largely for their nocturnality, use of acoustic communication, and adhesive toepads ? although not all of these traits are shared by all geckos. Geckos are ecologically important in several contexts, being both the largest group of nocturnal insectivores among the reptiles, and one of the only reptile groups represented on remote islands. Because they are numerous (&gt; 25% of all lizard species), geographically widespread, morphologically and ecologically diverse, and evolutionarily old (the basic gecko body plan was established at least 150 million years ago), geckos are ideally poised to be a model vertebrate group for addressing a wide range of comparative biological questions.</p> <p>The use of geckos as evolutionary models requires an established taxonomy of the group based on explicit hypothesis of the relationships among all the gecko lineages. This has been achieved through decades of research using data from both DNA sequences and morphology. I synthesized more than 30 years of such data generated in my laboratory and the labs of collaborators, resulting in the reliable placement of all ~120 gecko genera and approximately 75% of all gecko species into evolutionary trees. I have used this basis to interpret what is known about morphology, physiology, ecology, behavior and other aspects of gecko biology within an explicitly evolutionary context. This has identified knowledge gaps and provided direction for evolutionary biologists who can use these lizards as a system to answer a diversity of questions.</p> <p>A key outcome of this research is that geckos provide an excellent model system for addressing many comparative biological questions. Phylogenies derived from traditional and next generation sequencing methods are largely congruent and, thus, there exists a stable, dated phylogeny that provides the context for the interpretation of gecko structure and function at all levels across a time span of at least 150 million years. Recently discovered diversity in gecko amber inclusions further provides a mid-Cretaceous window within which both internal and external structures of geckos can be evaluated to "ground truth" predictions about the timing of character evolution derived from molecular phylogenies.</p> <p>Syntheses of gecko vocalization has demonstrated that call structure is species specific in geckos, and probably even specific to individuals. It also confirmed, for the first time, that gecko advertisement calls have narrow ranges of frequency that complement the range of hearing on a species-by-species basis, but that warning or distress calls are broadcast across much wider auditory ranges, aimed at an array of possible predators. The structure of the larynx shows only some phylogenetic signal and morphology is more closely linked to function. The synthesis of gecko adhesion links the climbing ability of geckos to the paleontological record, which confirms that this trait was well established by 100 million years ago. However, the mechanism of adhesion is well documented chiefly in a single model species,&nbsp;<em>Gekko gecko</em>, and both structural and performance data for other geckos is very limited. Thus, further phylogenetic sampling is needed to determine if the adhesive mechanism is adequately explained or if geckos, which have evolved functional adhesive toepads on multiple occasions, may exhibit alternative strategies to deploy and control the adhesive system. Other knowledge gaps exist in the areas of physiology, life history and behavior and there is a great potential for studying such questions as: adaptation to life at cool temperatures, how gecko communities are structured and function, and how visual, acoustic, and chemical communication are integrated across the gecko tree of life. In addition to clarifying the biology and evolution of a major group of vertebrates, tackling such questions contributes to the fundamental understanding of evolutionary constraint, parallel and convergent evolution, and the evolution of complex structures and behaviors.
