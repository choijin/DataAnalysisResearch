<AbstractNarration>Major advances in structural biology have often resulted from novel approaches to data collection and analysis. Historically, increasingly powerful X-ray sources led to great leaps in the ability to obtain information about structures of biomolecules, which is critically related to the molecules' biological function. The first X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) came online in 2009 at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, granting researchers the unprecedented ability to see the detailed atomic arrangements in, and movements of, biological molecules in their natural state (i.e. warm and wet). Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX), a novel extension of crystallography making use of the extreme flux and ultra-short duration of XFEL pulses, has produced new insights into fundamentally important processes such as photosynthesis, helping to understand how plants and bacteria convert sunlight into energy and create the oxygen we breathe, making life possible on earth, as well as improving human health by aiding pharmaceutical drug design, for example guiding improvements in pain killers and blood pressure regulators. However, XFEL experiments with biological targets typically require very large volumes of data and thus a correspondingly large volume of scarce, precious protein, to obtain high-resolution molecular structures. Furthermore, XFEL facilities typically host only one or two experiments simultaneously, and only two XFELs presently serve the global user community, while more will be coming online in 2017. The number of biological targets that can be studied and the rate of discoveries can be dramatically increased through the development of innovative, advanced algorithms that reduce the number of necessary measurements and extract more information from the samples by fully exploiting the information content that is unique to XFEL diffraction, and by extending XFEL use to uncrystallized targets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has three main objectives: (a) explore algorithms for improving data accuracy in XFEL serial femtosecond crystallography through modeling and optimization (beyond the Monte Carlo approach for data merging), (b) explore and develop novel phasing methods which exploit the full spatial coherence of the XFEL for 2D and 3D nanocrystals, and (c) develop structure-determination methods that can be applied to samples that cannot be crystallized, through XFEL fast solution scattering (FSS). FSS can provide dynamic structural information from "snapshot" diffraction from particles that can be studied dynamically in solution, broadening the range of samples suitable for XFELs. Further development of this approach to include statistical intensity correlations that are unique to XFEL measurements can potentially displace the need for crystal growth altogether. These new algorithms, which will be freely available to the scientific community, will increase accessibility and applicability of the revolutionary capabilities of XFELs for biological imaging by significantly decreasing the amount of sample, data and experimental time (and therefore overall costs) necessary to obtain high-resolution structures. Thus the project will contribute directly to improved understanding of the fundamental biomolecular mechanisms by providing time-resolved images of molecular machines at work. The results of this project will be available at http://www.public.asu.edu/~nzatsepi</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Increasingly brilliant and powerful X-ray sources have led to giant  leaps in our ability to reveal the complex structures and dynamics of  biomolecules including enzymes and viruses.  Atomic-resolution images of  such molecules are vital to our most basic and fundamental  understandings of life.  Detailed insights into the biomolecular structure/function relationship greatly aids in the development of  therapeutic drugs to treat disease, and the development of new  biotechnologies (to combat climate change, for example). One of the  greatest leaps in X-ray technology came about when the world's first  X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) facility began operating in 2009 at  SLAC National Lab in California.  In that year, the maximum X-ray  brilliance available to scientists increased by a factor of nearly ten billion overnight.  There are now several XFELs  operating around the world, and techniques that make use of these  facilities to study biomolecules have been under intense development  for more than a decade.  X-ray scattering measurements made with XFELs  have revealed increasingly detailed views of an increasingly  broader range of biomolecules under dynamic and near-physiological conditions (i.e.  moving in a warm and wet environment). Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) is one of the  most widely-used  techniques, and has produced new insights into  fundamental processes such as photosynthesis, which helps us understand  how plants and bacteria convert sunlight into energy and create the  oxygen we breathe, and how we might engineer molecules to perform  similar energy -harvesting functions.

This problem is greatly compounded by the fact that XFEL  facilities support only one or two experiments simultaneously, which  restricts the total number of concurrent biomolecular studies at XFELs  to just a few, worldwide.  The central aim of this proposal was to  develop XFEL analysis algorithms that improve the effectiveness of XFEL  measurements by reducing the amount of data required for a given observation, and by broadening the range of targets to which XFEL  measurements can be applied.  Work carried out by the project  investigators along with collaborators in the US and abroad produced  more than 30 peer-reviewed journal articles that cover many topics,  including the introduction of new algorithms for analyzing coherent  X-ray scattering signals that are unique to XFELs, utilization of new modes of XFEL operation  such as megahertz pulse trains and ultrafast time-delayed two-color  X-ray pulses, and the release of XFEL data analysis software packages  that are freely available on the web under copy-left licenses.   Algorithms developed under this project have also carried over into the  related fields of synchrotron X-ray scattering and cryogenic electron  microscopy.  This award moreover supported the application of new  methods and software to several investigations (carried out by the  investigators and their collaborators) that include structure-based drug  design and the formation of "molecular movies" of enzyme reactions, RNA  dynamics, molecular ion pumps, and photosynthetic proteins.  Broadly  speaking, investigations supported by this award have helped scientists  take advantage of the uniquely powerful capabilities of XFEL facilities,  which in turn has contributed to the recent acceleration in the rate of  scientific discoveries made using XFELs.
