<AbstractNarration>Waves in nature (for example, water waves or electromagnetic waves) can be modeled by solutions of certain differential equations that incorporate various physical processes into a mathematical framework that admits further detailed study in principle.  But even with such a wave equation in hand, there remains the difficult task of deducing important information from the model, information that is needed to solve important problems of engineering that motivate the study of waves in the first place.  One common approach is to use computers to solve the equations (approximately). However, such an approach is limited in scope to very concrete simulations involving particular initial conditions, and it holds only in parameter ranges in which the numerical methods can be accurate.  On the other hand, there are other parameter regimes that are quite common (for example, the situation that electromagnetic waves can be approximated by light rays) in which the computer-based approach becomes difficult, and therefore one would like to have an alternative method of analysis.  This project is aimed at developing such alternative methods of asymptotic analysis for wave propagation problems that are nonlinear (so that large waves can be accurately modeled) but that nonetheless admit a kind of transform relating them to linear problems (for which the familiar superposition principle applies).  One application of such theoretical analysis would be to describe the evolution of sub-surface oil plumes caused by an oil leak like the Deepwater Horizon disaster.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an attempt to place completely integrable nonlinear wave equations on a similar footing as constant-coefficient linear equations, from the point of view of asymptotic analysis (i.e., to further develop nonlinear analogues of the classical methods of stationary phase and steepest descent for integrals).  The specific problems to be addressed include the study of the inverse-scattering transform for the Benjamin-Ono equation (a nonlocal integrable model for internal gravity waves) in the small-dispersion limit, the study of the resonant interaction of wave packets through a quadratic nonlinearity in the semiclassical limit, the study of an analogue of the defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation describing waves in two spatial dimensions in the semiclassical limit, the study of dynamical stability of so-called rogue waves, the study of mixed initial/boundary-value problems for integrable equations in the semiclassical limit, and the investigation of "universal wave patterns", analogues to wave propagation problems of universal phase transitions in statistical mechanics and mathematical physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to study several aspects of nonlinear wave propagation using tools of mathematical analysis.  Most of the results dealt with studying waves in certain extreme situations like small-wavelength limits where one might expect some interesting phenomena to be revealed that should be relevant in practical applications as well as mathematically beautiful to describe and behold.    The intellectual contributions made under the support of this award include the following.  Firstly, a complete theory of a mapping that simplifies the dynamics of certain types of internal waves modeled by the Benjamin-Ono equation was advanced under the assumption that the initial interface is described by a rational function, i.e., a fraction of polynomials.  Arbitrary initial interface displacements can be accurately approximated by such rational functions, and the new theory gives complete and mostly explicit results for each such approximation.    The next parts of the project concerned asymptotic analysis for nonlinear waves related to limits like the small-wavelength limit mentioned above, but in new settings where existing methods are incomplete.  One of these new settings was in the context of nonlinear wave propagation problems in which multiple wave fields are interacting with each other; specifically we obtained an asymptotic description of the direct scattering data for a model called the three-wave resonant interaction system, and we showed that the description was accurate with the help of numerical inverse-scattering.  Another new setting was in the context of nonlinear waves propagating in multiple space dimensions; specifically, we studied the direct spectral transform for the defocusing Davey-Stewartson type II model (a certain model for water waves on a two-dimensional fluid surface) and obtained a short-wavelength approximation for the scattering transform that is formally valid for sufficiently large values of a spectral parameter in the problem.  This leads to certain predictions about the reflection coefficient for the problem, which is a key ingredient going forward in describing  the types of waves that can appear in a short-wavelength limit.  Another model that was studied is the focusing nonlinear Schr&ouml;dinger equation, where our particular interest was on solutions that are models for rogue waves on the surface of the sea.  We formulated for the first time an inverse-scattering transform that directly captures these rogue waves, and then we used the new transform to analyze the linear instabiliity properties of rogue waves.  We also used the new transform to give a novel characterization of rogue waves of high "order" which translates practically into very large amplitude.  We used this tool to then determine how very large amplitude rogue waves look, with particular interest in describing "precursors" to large amplitude rogue waves that could be used to provide warnings to ships or fixed structures.    Aside from the practical applications of this study of nonlinear wave propagation, some of which have been indicated above, the impact of the project was also broadened via dissemination of research results through scholarly publications, public posting of preprints, and lectures in universities and international conferences.  Furthermore, a PhD student was trained under the support of this project.  Her PhD thesis concerns the formation of a certain universal wave pattern that appears independently of details of the initial conditions and is mathematically described in terms of modern special functions.  The setting here is a model for nonlinear waves with a "twist", such as helical vibrations in RNA molecules.  The model is called the sine-Gordon equation.  Since completing her PhD thesis, the student has entered the STEM workforce.       Last Modified: 10/02/2018       Submitted by: Peter Miller]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
