<AbstractNarration>Towards Synergizing International Collaboration on Plug-In Electric Vehicles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 1:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to initiate a bilateral, international research collaboration between researchers from the University of Maryland at College Park (UMD), Maryland, USA and the Istanbul Technical University (ITU), Istanbul, Turkey in the area of next generation plug-in electric vehicles. The requested funding will support the PI and his graduate student from University of Maryland to visit the ITU team and their facilities. The PI's ongoing research on the increased technical capabilities of plug-in electric vehicles will benefit significantly from ITU's newly established, state-of-the-art automotive center test platforms, which currently do not exist at UMN, and are required for the experimentation needs of the PI's research.  ITU's expertise in high-efficiency control of electric and hybrid vehicles would also be a valuable resource for the UMD team.  The visit will serve the two teams to determine how to device a collaboration plan, and determine how the complementary skills of the two teams could be exploited for the planned research. The visit will also help the US team to gain familiarity with the sophisticated platforms and equipment at the ITU?s Mechatronics Education and Research Center (MERC) and Advanced Vehicle Technologies and Research Center (AVTRC). In addition, the project will offer a unique international research opportunity to the US student, who will work with the ITU team for a month, after the return of the PI. This extended stay will provide the student with some exposure to a new culture, as well as experience in a collaborative international research environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will pave a path for future international collaborations to achieve major breakthroughs in control, modeling and design of power electronics interfaces and adjustable speed drives for the next generation of plug-in electric vehicles. It will extend the research and educational activities in transportation electrification at the University of Maryland and the Istanbul Technical University in two main areas: (a) design and control of adjustable speed drives for various propulsion machines including induction machines and permanent magnet synchronous machines; and (b) feasible methodologies and practical approaches for real-time implementation and validation of onboard integrated chargers. It is the intention of the UMN and ITU research teams to improve and strengthen this collaborative effort with the development of other collaborative multidisciplinary research efforts of much larger scale, such as through IRES and PIRE proposals.</AbstractNarration>
