<AbstractNarration>This three year renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site from the Jacobs School of Engineering at the University of California-San Diego will focus on the expanding research strength in biomaterials across engineering departments and expose students to biomaterials research with a focus on applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery. This Site will provide lower-division, undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups, with limited research opportunities, with a hands-on biomaterials research experience, faculty and near-peer mentoring, research presentations at local and national meetings, and professional development activities that encourage continued graduate training in biomaterials.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a three year period, this REU program will engage undergraduate students in a 10-week intensive, summer research experience focused on the generation of new biomaterials knowledge made possible through access to state-of-the-art facilities at UCSD, cutting-edge research projects, and accomplished faculty mentors. A "boot camp" will be conducted during the first week of the program to ensure that all participants have the necessary basic skills required to succeed in their research experience. Community building, professional development activities, weekly research skills workshops, a biomaterials-based REU journal club, and attendance and participation in research conferences and professional meetings are components of this REU Site and will result in better-trained undergraduate students who are highly motivated to pursue graduate training in biomaterials.</AbstractNarration>
