<AbstractNarration>Electricity usage of buildings (including offices, malls and residential apartments) represents a significant portion of a nation's energy expenditure and carbon footprint. Buildings are estimated to consume 72% of the total electricity production in the US. Unfortunately, however, 30% of this energy consumption is wasted. Virtual energy assessment is an approach that can optimize building energy efficiency and minimize waste at a low cost with minimal expert intervention. A virtual energy audit includes a thorough and near real time analysis of different sources of building energy usage, individualized energy footprints of load appliances and devices, and proactive identification of energy holes and air leakages. This project builds a low cost solution that combines the use of non-intrusive single point energy monitoring and low cost IR cameras to provide continuous energy audits. The system will provide continuous virtual audit reports to the landlords or residential users. The system will be deployed in low-income neighborhoods in Baltimore City, Maryland, where poor insulation problems are assumed to be fiscally insurmountable and low cost solutions to determining these issues is important for the landlords. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To develop a scalable low cost virtual energy auditing system, this breakthrough research pursues the interfaces of smart building sensing, computing and actuation. The project will be executed under three main research thrust areas. First, it utilizes an autonomous discovery, profiling and rule-based predictive model to capture the relationship between disaggregated power measures and a device's actual usage patterns to pinpoint any abnormal consumption. Second, the PIs develop zero-energy far-infrared imaging sensors for low cost low frequency heat map scanning and air leakage detection. Third, the project engineers and evaluates cyber-physical building sensing system with a control level design perspective for virtual energy auditing that drives the realization of deep energy savings and building efficiency. Additionally, the PIs with collaboration from Constellation will host building energy education projects and workshop where undergraduate, high school, and underrepresented group of students would understand how to design and program energy meters and smart plugs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Energy wasted in residential and commercial buildings from leaky windows and doors, open refrigerator doors, and unnecessarily switched on small to medium everyday appliances account for a large fraction of the energy budget of a country. Energy audit systems provide a remedy to this problem where certain types of energy wastage due to leakages and poor insulation can be analyzed and addressed. However, there is a critical need for low cost systems that can continuously monitor such wastage and provide recommendations to users on how to mitigate such wastage. To this end, this project developed a low-cost thermal imaging system, IRLeak that can detect open and drafty windows,&nbsp;open refrigerator and microwave doors, and computers left accidentally on. Moreover, proper thermal insulation yields optimum energy expenses in buildings by maintaining necessary heat gain or loss through the built envelope. However, improper thermal insulation causes significant energy wastage along with infusing various damages on indoor and outdoor walls of the buildings, for example, damp areas, black stains, cracks, paint bubbles etc. Therefore, it is important to inspect the temperature variations in different areas of the built environments in regular basis. The project designed a method for identifying temperature variance in building thermal images based on Symbolic Aggregated Approximation. In addition, air leakages pose a major problem in both residential and commercial buildings. They increase the utility bill and result in excessive usage of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, which impacts the environment and causes discomfort to residents. Repairing air leakages in a building is an expensive and time intensive task. Even detecting the leakages can require extensive professional testing. The project designed a method to identify the leaky homes provided their energy consumption data is accessible from residential smart meters. It employed a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) technique to disaggregate the HVAC data from total power consumption for several homes. It developed a recurrent neural network and a denoising autoencoder based approach to identify the "ON" and "OFF" cycles of the HVACs and their overall usages. The project categorized the typical HVAC consumption of about 200 homes and any probable insulation and leakage problems using the Air Changes per Hour at 50 Pa (ACH50) metric.

Gray-box models offer an explanation of those dynamics, as expressed in a few parameters specific to built environments that can provide compelling insights into the characteristics of building artifacts. The project presented a systematic study of Bayesian approaches to modeling buildings' parameters, and hence their thermal characteristics.
