<AbstractNarration>Throughout the world, communities suffering from socioeconomic inequalities and discrimination join social movements to voice their concerns. Recently, social scientists have observed a new phenomenon: these social movements are deploying the symbolic power of specific cultural practices for their organizing goals while, at the same time, the governments against which they are organizing are seeking recognition from UNESCO for the same practices as Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH). This convergence of political strategizing and nation building from above and social mobilization from below raises new questions about the role of culture in human society and the nature of contemporary political systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City University of New York doctoral student Laura B. Carter, supervised by Dr. Vincent B. Crapanzano, will undertake research on these questions. She has chosen to conduct the research in France and in the French overseas territory of Guadeloupe, where a recent UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage designation provides an apt site for investigating both ends of this process.  In Guadeloupe, she will collect data through participant observation, interviews, and oral histories in two separate regions, in order to document and analyze how practitioners and cultural stewards create, maintain, and vary the heritage tradition. In France (with non-NSF funding support), she will investigate changes in France's cultural policies and how they produced the Intangible Cultural Heritage nomination. Findings from this research will further social scientific understanding of the workings of social movements, the multiple meanings of heritage projects, and the changing nature of political forms in the contemporary world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This anthropological project analyzes the shifting cultural politics and history-making practices of the French overseas department of Guadeloupe. It interrogates the relationship of politics and aesthetics as they have recently intersected in the Guadeloupian Afro-Creole drum-dance practices of Gwoka.  Gwoka's polymorphous nature serves as arena for studying the political and cultural negotiations at play within questions of reparations and the history of slavery and colonialism. It also forces attention on the ways Gwoka practices attest to evolving traditions and engender new ways-of-being Guadeloupian and French that reflect contemporary challenges.  My interdisciplinary and multi-sited project has consisted of fieldwork in both Guadeloupe and Paris from January 2015 to August 2017, with the support of Fulbright, Wenner-Gren, the NSF and ARC (Advanced Research Collaborative) at the CUNY Graduate Center.

This project analyzes vying forms of cultural politics and aesthetics of the non-sovereign French department, Guadeloupe, and more largely those of France vis-&agrave;-vis her overseas ("outre-mer") former colonies.                                                                      The historical part of my study has consisted of tracing parallels (and incongruence between) social mobilizations and cultural discourses from before departmentalization (1946) through the civilian massacre of 1967, up to the explosive social movement moment of 2008-2009.  The central part of my historical research focuses on the 1970?s &amp; 1980?s, a crucial period of social and political mobilization in which Gwoka?s revalorization played an important role.  In my dissertation, I shall analyze the diverse range of mediation of the cultural forms that fall under the umbrella term of "Gwoka".
