<AbstractNarration>This is a project creates an I-Corps Site at the University of New Hampshire (UNH).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNH's I-Corps Site enables faculty researchers and trainees to explore the commercial potential of their discoveries. The application of the Lean Launchpad (LLP) curriculum, intellectual networking events, access to business and scientific mentors, and funding mechanisms help participants in identifying the critical path to commercialization and ways to reach the market with innovative ideas more efficiently. UNH Innovation, which is the unit primarily responsible for entrepreneurial activities and technology commercialization at UNH, hosts the I-Corps Site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNH's existing commercialization infrastructure is coordinated to increase the likelihood that research can be quickly exposed to the I-Corps program. At least 30 I-Corps Teams are trained each year and participate in the UNH Flywheel process. Highlights of this innovative process include:&lt;br/&gt;   (1) Exposure to a four-week Lean Launch Pad (LLP) course focusing on customer discovery and value proposition; &lt;br/&gt;   (2) A 10-week LLP course with exposure to the entire business model canvas; &lt;br/&gt;   (3) A demo day to showcase ideas; and &lt;br/&gt;   (4) Twice-yearly Sandpits, where multiple subject matter experts are invited to an open discussion on a general topic to promote interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary conversations. &lt;br/&gt;Promising projects are connected to business mentors, are eligible for new translational funding, and are provided access to local incubator and angel/venture capital networks to accelerate market entry of ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Implementation of this I-Corp Site constitutes a redesign of the ecosystem in such a way as to increase interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary collaboration throughout UNH's $110MM research portfolio, and develop connections to available resources necessary to ensure that discoveries fulfill their economic and social potential. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To assess the impact of this redesign, this proposal contains an innovative approach to program assessment. While tracking well-established metrics such as invention disclosures, licenses, and startup activity, UNH also tracks qualitative and social network measures to help assess deeper changes in UNH?s innovation ecosystem. This more robust measurement approach not only assists in future improvements in UNH's innovation ecosystem, but also increases the scalability and transferability of lessons learned and insights gained at UNH?' I-Corps Site to the national innovation network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UNH Site impacts transcend exposure to and access by faculty and students to LLP coursework.  Startup formation and job creation are expanded as a direct result of UNH research and an improved culture of commercialization on campus. The UNH Flywheel process (1) exposes the regional and national business communities to UNH?s research capacity, (2) increases research collaborations between faculty and industry; and (3) improves connections between graduate students and the local business community. The program works with existing organizations on campus like the Society for Women Engineers, Luna Cats, UNH ADVANCE, UNH chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, and the Associate Vice President for Community, Equity, and Diversity to ensure recruitment and enrollment for programs is well advertised and broadens the participation of underrepresented cohorts in commercialization.</AbstractNarration>
