<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Understanding mechanisms that caused rapid global climate changes in the past is a key problem in paleoclimate research, and is critical for evaluating impacts of ongoing and future climate change. In particular, the role of the tropics in climate shifts remains poorly understood. This grant will provide funding to the University of Minnesota at two campuses: Duluth and Twin Cities, in order to recover a drill core from Lake Chalco, on the southern outskirts of Mexico City. These lake sediments have the potential to provide a half-million year record of North American climate. The core from Lake Chalco is directly relevant to one of the most densely populated urban centers on our planet, Mexico City, home to ~20 million people. The project includes plans to increase public scientific literacy and engagement, building on existing programs in Mexico (museums and mobile classrooms) and Minnesota ("Flyover Country" mobile app), and to organize workshops for local K-12 teachers. A robust plan for evaluation of Broader Impacts is included. This project will contribute to the training of the next generation of geoscientists through the inclusion of students and postdoctoral researchers in the drilling project. This project will foster ties among scientific communities in the U.S., Europe and Mexico, both during drilling and continuing scientific investigations of the Chalco Basin. While the focus of this proposal is recovery of an environmental record, other groups have interest in utilizing the core or the boreholes for a range of studies including volcanic history and hazards, seismic monitoring and earthquake hazard modeling, as well as hydrological monitoring and teaching tools. No funding is provided for these related projects in the current grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding to recover a drill core from a &gt;350m lacustrine sedimentary sequence contained in the Lake Chalco basin on the southern outskirts of Mexico City in the Basin of Mexico. These sediments have the potential to provide a &gt;500,000 year record of North American climate. This will be a unique climate archive that could develop into the "type sequence" for paleoclimate studies in North America. Chalco is well suited for reconstruction and investigatation of interannual through orbital-scale variations in the North American Monsoon (NAM) and hydrologic variations of the neotropics. Ongoing work indicates that the system records environmental responses to both Milankovitch- and millennial-scale climate forcing. In order to evaluate the relative role of low latitudes in initiating and propagating abrupt global climate changes, information regarding the geographical distribution, patterns and timing of abrupt changes in the tropics is still needed, particularly records to help define the nature of variability in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Precipitation over the Chalco Basin is determined by the position of the ITCZ and the strength of the NAM. Long-term (orbital) variations in the position of the ITCZ follow insolation. However, Holocene paleoclimatic records show an antiphase pattern in precipitation intensity between the tropical core of the NAM and its northern margins in response to ocean forcing (e.g. Atlantic Meridional Overturn, AMO, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, PDO). A record from the Chalco basin can be compared with existing long term records to the North and to the South to determine if this antiphase relationship to AMO and PDO forcing existed in earlier interglacials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The MexiDrill program achieved its primary objective: to obtain a long, continuous, high-resolution sedimentary record of past environment in southern North America.  The targeted location, the Lake Chalco Basin, contains 320 m of lake sediments and is within the city limits of Mexico City.  We recovered the entire sedimentary sequence and our preliminary data indicate that it represents a ~350,000 year history of neotropical American climate and of regional volcanic activity. This is among the longest continuous records from North America, and is from a key location that is currently lacking in paleoclimate data.  Furthermore, its location adjacent to a major population center gives this environmental record particular societal relevance.  We have begun work on the core, and have completed our "initial core description" (ICD) and established an initial stratigraphy.     The field program (22 February to 3 April 2016) was successful, achieving all project goals on-time and on-budget. Details include:  Participants from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM); U of MN Duluth; U of MN Twin Cities; U of Pittsburgh; U of New Mexico; Tech U Braunschweig, Germany; Oxford U, UK; LIAG, Germany; IPE, Spain. Additional financial support from the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP), UNAM, and the Leibniz Institute for Applied Geophysics (LIAG). 1262 m drilled in total (including reamed interval in basalt) 1065 m of core recovered Triple coring of 300+m of lacustrine sequence, providing an essentially complete spliced sequence. 420m logged downhole (in situ) by the LIAG team from Hannover, Germany Maximum depth reached: 520m   Maximum core recovered in 12h-shift:  100m (we believe this is a record for projects supported by ICDP).      The core was shipped to the US National Lacustrine Core Repository (LacCore) in Minneapolis, MN, arriving on 9 May 2016.  All core was split and went through initial core description (ICD) at LacCore during "core parties" in August and November 2016.  We developed preliminary stratigraphic description of the core, confirming that the triple coring provided essentially complete recovery.  Additional sampling, focused on developing a preliminary chronology and undertaking initial microfossil analyses, was undertaken in May and December 2017.  Details of ICD and sampling include:  Participants from UNAM; U of MN Duluth; U of MN Twin Cities; U of Pittsburgh; U of New Mexico; U of Freiberg, Germany; U of Birmingham, UK; LIAG, Germany; IPE, Spain. Whole core logging (MS, gamma density, natural gamma), splitting, and imaging all recovered core.  High-resolution magnetic susceptibility of all core. X-ray fluorescence core scanning of selected sections Preliminary sampling of the spliced section for inorganic and organic carbon and nitrogen, stable isotopes, organic biomarkers, pollen, diatoms, grainsize. Sampling for exploratory chronological studies (radiocarbon in collaboration w/Queens Univ Belfast, UK; U-series in carbonate in collaboration w/MIT; tephra stratigraphy in collaboration w/ UK colleagues at Oxford, Birmingham and Glasgow; OSL in collaboration w/ U of Freiberg, Germany).      We developed a preliminary age-depth model on the basis of 14C, which is relatively well behaved in this system, U/Th ages in carbonates, and major shifts between wet and dry conditions that we believe to be associated with glacial-interglacial transitions.  Taken together, these results indicate an age of ~350,000 years at the base of the 320m lacustrine sequence and a relatively steady sedimentation rate averaging ~1mm/yr.  This allows us to frame hypotheses to examine during the next phase of this study. These include evaluation of:  Millennial scale variability during glacial periods and terminations The influence of precession on the North American monsoon and on ITCZ migration Regional climate responses to long interglacial periods Reasons for variability in precipitation during glacial periods Evolution of regional volcanism.       This project has a number of broader societal impacts.   Our results on past hydrologic balance, climate, and volcanic activity are relevant to millions of citizens of Mexico City and the surrounding area. Ten graduate students (4 from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, 1 from U of Minnesota Duluth, 2 from U of Pittsburgh, 2 from U of New Mexico and 1 from Oxford U) have been involved in the field program and/or the initial core description.  Postdoctoral fellow Stockhecke (supported by the Swiss NSF) participated in the field program and has had a leading role in initial core description and developing a "spliced section" of the cores to maximize the continuity of the record. The EarthImages Foundation produced a short documentary (https://youtu.be/tNkdvdGUYrY) with ICDP support as part of project outreach.  This has been used at meetings and conferences, as well as presentations at schools and museums.  A Facebook page maintained particularly during the field program facilitated communication with interested public and science community. https://www.facebook.com/MexiDrillChalco/ We worked to develop content for Flyover Country&reg;, the NSF-funded offline mobile app for geoscience outreach and data discovery.
