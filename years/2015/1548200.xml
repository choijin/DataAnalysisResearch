<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project has a goal of increasing the diversity of engineering faculty at post-secondary institutions through engaging graduate students, post-doctoral professionals and early career faculty in faculty oriented professional development activities.  The lack of diversity in the engineering ranks is well documented.  According to data collected by the American Society for Engineering Education, the percentage of Hispanic tenure track faculty actually declined from 2012 to 2013, from 3.9% to 3.6%.  During that same period, the number of African American faculty also declined from 2.7% to 2.6%. The numbers of American Indian and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders changed by single digit numbers, their overall percentage being so small that it did not vary significantly.  When considering gender, the number of tenure track female faculty was 14.5% in 2012, a number that has slowly increased from the 8.9% in 2001. It is a national imperative to diversify the engineering profession, and the presence of role models within the engineering faculty ranks is crucial to support the encouragement of underrepresented students seeking and earning engineering degrees. More specifically, 408 engineering doctoral degrees were awarded to members of this target demographic in 2012, however the number of assistant professors only increased by 28 (from 411 to 439). This is FTE for the given year and does not account for faculty that may have been promoted from assistant to associate or those who may have left the academy. If even Â¼ of those earning doctorates had joined engineering faculties, this would result in an almost 25% increase in the representation. Clearly greater effort is needed to increase the number of those that earn doctoral degree who choose to enter academic ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven engineering professional organizations that target underrepresented populations in engineering and other STEM fields will collaborate on this project: the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES), Great Minds in STEM (GMiS), Latinos in Science and Engineering (MAES), the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the Society for Advancement of Hispanics/Chicanos and Native Americans in STEM (SACNAS), the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), and the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). This project will facilitate travel for graduate students, postdoctoral professionals and early career faculty to attend national engineering conferences hosted by each organization.  Utilizing content experts, these organizations will provide professional development opportunities at these conferences designed to prepare participants to become successful engineering faculty.  By creating a collaborative infrastructure between these organizations, they will design, implement and evaluate the efficacy of increasing engineering faculty diversity through these workshops and professional development activities for the targeted participants.  This activity will also create a self-supporting community engaged in higher educational pursuits thus addressing the isolation often perceived as contributing to the low numbers of faculty from diverse groups. A secondary benefit is that the undergraduate and pre-college students who attend these same conferences will have the opportunity to interact with the graduate students, postdoctoral professionals and early career faculty participants, thereby increasing their opportunity to learn about and potentially seek graduate degrees, increasing the pool of those who seek tenure track positions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To address the need for more women in positions of academic leadership in engineering and to foster the professional growth of women within the academy, The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) developed the Academic Leadership for Women in Engineering (ALWE) program. The overarching purpose of ALWE is to provide female academics in engineering tangible skills and knowledge needed to pursue and gainfully acquire and maintain institutional leadership positions at a university. SWE provided women with skills that will help them grow personally as leaders. Participants in the ALWE program experienced two-full days and many interactive sessions that will provide best practices to advance in academia while creating opportunities and mechanisms to network across institutions. To that end, the objectives of ALWE are as follows:  Recognize the various roles associated with holding      leadership positions within academia. Learn strategies and tools to advance in leadership      roles within academia. Learn negotiation skills to use in pursuing      institutional leadership positions. Expand an existing network of women in academia. Support a community of practice focused on similar      goals, with women facing with similar challenges.     Core Goals:  To create a collaborative infrastructure between the      seven leading diversity professional organizations in engineering, To utilize this collaboration to design,      implement, and evaluate the efficacy of increasing the      participation of diverse faculty, post-docs, and graduate students      at the annual conferences of the partner organizations, and To create professional development opportunities for      early-career faculty, post-docs, and/or graduate students to support their      success and persistence in academic careers.   Specific Objectives:  Facilitate interaction between academic and engineering. Deliver professional development that supports the      success and persistence of academic career pathways.  Provide 40 ASSIST grants which cover hotel and travel      fees for early-career faculty, post-docs, and graduate students in      academic careers.   The project is contributing to understanding the demographics of women and underrepresented minorities aspiring to and pursuing careers in engineering. It has contributed professional development and strengthened professional networking opportunities to support the career success and the personal well-being of ASSIST Travel Award recipients. It has also helped participants develop greater understanding of the role of research in academic careers and provided strategies for securing research funding. ASSIST travel grants have been given to students and faculty at over 90 universities so far, a strong start toward achieving broader impacts. Through the development of resources for graduate students, post-docs and untenured faculty, SWE is building a body of knowledge to support women engineers seeking careers in academia.  Outcomes:  The ALWE program hosted over 40 attendees in 2017-2018, with 40 receiving travel grants through the ASSIST program each year. Hosted in-person and online professional development programming on the following topics during the 2017-2019 ALWE programs:       Academic career paths(2017, 2018, 2019) Negotiating best practices(2017, 2018, 2019) Academic leadership panels (2017, 2018, 2019) Self-management for academics  (2017, 2018) Funding best practices (2017, 2019) Teaching and instruction best practices (2018, 2019) Diversity, inclusion and equity in academia (2018, 2019) Academic publishing best practices(2019)[CW1] Facilitated networking opportunities for the participants and members from SWE?s Women in Academia committee in 2017-2019 programs.   In 2019, attendees reported an increase in confidence in each of the following learning outcomes, which are aligned with ASSIST goals for providing early career faculty development:     Negotiation strategies: Conducting objective market research to benchmark a target salary and benefits Developing persuasive responses to negotiation strategies Identifying and articulating your personal value     A community of practice framework was implemented for the 2017 and 2018 programs:   Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI): Identifying strategies to garner support and buy-in for diversity from stakeholders DEI: Identifying strategies to leverage your position to advance DEI DEI: Defining diversity, equity and inclusion          Last Modified: 01/28/2021       Submitted by: Karen Horting]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
