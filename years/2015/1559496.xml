<AbstractNarration>This IRES student training project will support research experiences in Nepal and Kenya by a total of 15 students (12 undergraduate and 3 graduate students) over three years. The students will develop, produce and evaluate paper-based devices used to test pharmaceutical quality and water quality. The primary goal of the project is to help students become more passionate about the power of science and engineering to solve global challenges while also developing valuable analysis and design skills. The project is led by principal investigator (PI) Dr. Toni Barstis of St. Mary's College, with co-PIs Dr. Reena Lamichhane Khadka and Dr. Donald Paetkau also of St. Mary's, and Dr. Marya Lieberman of the University of Notre Dame. The international mentors are Dr. Basant Giri of the Kathmandu Institute of Applied Sciences in Nepal, and Dr. Beatrice Jakait and Dr. Sonak Pastakia of the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program (AMPATH) in Kenya. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Estimates suggest that in developing countries such as Nepal and Kenya up to 30% of the medicines are falsified or substandard and up to 90% of the water sources may be contaminated with bacteria. However, most tests used in the U.S. to evaluate water or pharmaceutical purity are too complicated for use in developing countries, requiring steady power sources, ultrapure water or other expensive materials. The paper-based assays that this project will develop and evaluate are low-cost, require only small volumes of liquid, use readily available materials, and require no power source. The devices and this training have potential value anywhere a cheap, easy to use testing method is needed. Through this project U.S. students will have the opportunity to build competency as global scientists and engineers by developing collaborative relationships with students and research mentors in Nepal and Kenya, and seeing how their scientific knowledge can make a difference in communities. Applicants will be primarily chosen from St. Mary's College, an all-women liberal arts college, and from alumni of a Notre Dame REU that targeted students from primarily undergraduate institutions and included many women, first generation-to-attend-college students and underrepresented minorities, providing strong potential for this project to include a diverse range of student participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three cohorts of U.S. students will conduct research in the summers of 2017-2019 to develop paper-based, milli-fluidic analytical devices (PADs) to analyze pharmaceuticals and drinking water. Students will design and field-test the devices, comparing the outcomes from the PADs with "gold standard" analytical methods including High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Mass Spectrometry (MS). Students will work at sites in Nepal and Kenya, where previous international collaborations by the PIs have laid the groundwork for safe living and working conditions for the participants and where the students can make genuinely useful contributions to ongoing projects led by the Nepali and Kenyan mentors. U.S. students traveling to Nepal and Kenya will first work together at their home institutions designing and manufacturing PADs, while in electronic contact with their international mentors and the international students who will be part of the research teams. The U.S. students will then spend at least four weeks in their respective country collecting samples, conducting field and lab testing, engaging in cultural activities, and meeting with experts and community members impacted by the research. Students will also be in electronic contact with the other country group to compare data and experiences during the time abroad. The summer program will conclude at the home institutions with further analyses and data validation, presentation locally and with international students electronically, and report preparation for presentation to the appropriate country agencies. Users of the research results may include: WHO RapidAlert Network, the Nepali Department of Drug Administration, the Nepal Water Supply Corporation, UNICEF-Nepal, and the Kenyan Pharmacy and Poisons Board.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Substandard and falsified (SF) pharmaceuticals are a serious and growing worldwide problem: Substandard pharmaceuticals are those that contain less active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) than the quality standard (e.g., a 500-mg amoxicillin tablet that only contains 400-mg of API amoxicillin), and typically result from poor quality manufacturing controls or improper storage conditions; whereas, falsified pharmaceuticals are those that were deliberately tampered (e.g., purposefully underdosed with the correct API, contain a different, substituted API, or are completely missing the API). SF pharmaceuticals are dangerous because they can cause harm to patients, and this is especially problematic in developing countries. To address this global health concern, PI Barstis has developed a paper-based analytical devices (PADs) for use in the rapid on-site chemical screening of suspicious pharmaceuticals. Co-PIs Lamichhane-Khadka and Paetkau expanded the PADs for use in the rapid on-site biological screening of drinking water.

Students improved their ?essential soft skills? via work in a culturally diverse setting and through on-campus training of future U.S. researchers. Tight-knit cohorts of U.S. and Nepali researchers were formed during each summer of travel. Together, we ate delicious meals, spent countless hours on the road, sang Nepali songs, resided with family members, learned about Buddhist and Hindu traditions, and visited many temples/World Heritage sites/national parks, and exchanged ideas (e.g., new experiments, different PADs designs, and other environmental and health issues facing the Nepali). Every year, these experiences bond the group together, resulting in a deep, long-lasting relationships. Long-term assessment of the impact of this experience on our students remains to be seen, but thus far, two alumnae have obtained permanent employment at multinational companies, another is pursuing a Ph.D. in biochemistry on a related research project, and others are attending medical school with the intent of engaging in ?doctors without borders.?</p> <p><strong>Key Outcomes (Intellectual Merit): (1) SF Pharmaceutical Study: </strong>Over the three-year time, the research groups have collected and analyzed over 1500 pharmaceutical samples. Thus far, the PADs (patented technology) have shown to be an inexpensive, fast, portable, and reliable method of screening for SF allopathic medicines. To illustrate, the PADs results for the 500-mg amoxicillin and 500-mg amoxicillin and 125-mg clavulanate samples show that only a few amoxicillin samples are underdosed, but almost half of the amoxicillin-clavulanate samples are underdosed in clavulanate, with two samples completely lacking clavulanate. This was confirmed with HPLC (the ?gold standard? analytical method of pharmaceutical analysis). Experimentation to determine whether manufacturing quality control or poor storage conditions are responsible is underway. Similarly, preliminary PADs and HPLC results for the allopathic albendazole (antiworming), metformin (antidiabetic), paracetamol (analgesic), and omeprazole (antiGERD) samples show that only a few samples are underdosed. PI Barstis and student researchers have shown via preliminary analysis of the pharmaceuticals that pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution practices as well as proper storage conditions are lacking in Nepal, which may cause serious harm to the Nepali people. No deliberate counterfeiting has been identified. <strong>(2) Contaminated Drinking Water Study</strong>: Over the three-year time, the research groups have collected and analyzed over 200 drinking water samples. The water samples were tested for <em>E. coli</em> contamination using the three portable methods: the Micrology Labs Coliscan EasyGel, the Micrology Labs Coliscan EasyCard (a newly patented, but not commercially available technique), and the Saint Mary?s College MicroBio PAD. Additionally, the MicroBio PADs results were compared with MPN results (the ?gold standard? method for the detection and estimation of <em>E. coli</em>). The MPN test revealed a broad range of <em>E. coli</em> levels in the water samples tested; the number of bacteria ranged from &lt;3.0 to &gt;1100 CFU/mL. Compared with the gold standard, the MicroBio PAD was able to accurately detect <em>E. coli</em> in 27% of the municipal tap water samples, 14% of the hand pump/well water samples and 50% of the stone tap water samples. These preliminary results show promise in the MicroBio PAD as a portable, reliable technique to screen for contaminated drinking water, but further improvement is required.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/26/2019<br>      Modified by: Toni&nbsp;L&nbsp;Barstis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559496/1559496_10444157_1574819749559_SaintMary'sCollegePADsPoster_Page_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559496/1559496_10444157_1574819749559_SaintMary'sCollegePADsPoster_Page_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Saint Mary's College PADs Project"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1559496/1559496_10444157_1574819749559_SaintMary'sCollegePADsPoster_Page_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Saint Mary's College PADs Project"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image is that of the overall PADs Project research.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Toni L.O.
