<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The American Geophysical Union (AGU) and the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) have teamed up to provide a series of workshops on topics that overlap and complement their respective memberships. This year, these professional organizations are jointly sponsoring a workshop on applying potential-field and electromagnetic methods to studies of sedimentary basins.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;There has been considerable student interest in attending this meeting; in fact 13 students have had their abstracts accepted for participation and the purpose of this award is to provide support for the travel and fieldtrip expenses of 12 of the student participants.  These students will have the experience of presenting their research and interacting with leading researchers in potential-field studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference has been widely publicized via internet announcements and prominent webpages constructed by the American Geophysical Union and the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, and the response has been excellent from a diverse audience.  The expected audience is 70-100 participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Sedimentary basins host resources of hydrocarbon, water, geothermal, and mineral, and can have implications for the larger tectonic setting. Basins are also of great interest in hazard investigations because they often are bounded by active structures and have shapes and infill composition that amplify ground motion.

In this workshop, researchers from industry, academia, government agencies, and students exchanged concepts and ideas on the development and integrated application of these methods to define the structure and tectonics, natural resources, and hazards associated with active and relic basins.
