<AbstractNarration>Marine food webs can concentrate monomethylmercury (MMHg), a neurotoxin in mammals, in upper trophic level consumers. Despite their remoteness, coastal Antarctic marine ecosystems accumulate&lt;br/&gt;and biomagnify MMHg to levels observed at lower latitudes and in the Arctic.    Marine sediments and other anoxic habitats in the oceans are typical areas where methylation of mercury occurs and these are likely places where MMHg is being produced.   Krill, and more specifically their digestive tracts, may be a previously unaccounted for site where the production of MMHg may be occurring in the Antarctic.  If monomethylmercury production is occurring in krill, current views regarding bioaccumulation in the food web and processes leading to the production and accumulation of mercury in the Antarctic Ocean could be better informed, if not transformed.    This project will conduct a preliminary assessment of the krill gut microbiomes, the microbiome's genomic content and potential for production of monomethyl mercury by detecting the genes involved in mercury transformations.  By analyzing the krill gut microbiome, the project will provide insights regarding animal-microbe interactions and their potential role in globally important biogeochemical cycles.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will conduct a preliminary assessment of the krill gut microbiomes, the microbiomes genomic content and potential for production of monomethylmercury.  The diversity and metabolic profiles of microorganisms in krill digestive tracts will be evaluated using massively parallel Illumina DNA sequencing technology to produce 16S rRNA gene libraries and assembled whole metagenomes. The project will also quantify the abundance and expression of Hg methylation genes, hgcAB, and identify their taxonomic affiliations in the microbiome communities.   Environmental metagenomes, 16S rRNA gene inventories produced from this project will provide the polar science community with valuable databases and experimental tools with which to examine coastal Antarctic microbial ecology and biogeochemistry.  The project will seek to provide a wider window into the diversity of extremophile microbial communities and the identification of potentially unique and useful bioactive compounds. In addition to public education and outreach.  This project will train graduate students and provide educational and outreach opportunities at the participating institutions</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Despite the remoteness of Antarctica's Southern Ocean, concentrations of the developmental neurotoxin monomethylmercury (MeHg) in Antarctic birds and mammals are similar to those observed in lower latitudes, the Northern Hemisphere, and the Arctic.  The goal of this project was to identify microscopic organisms capable of producing MeHg in the lower digestive tracts of Antarctic krill, an important species of zooplankton in the Southern Ocean.  The microorganisms that produce MeHg live in environments with low levels of oxygen such as wetlands and marine sediments. Such environments are very limited in the Antarctic. However, since the lower digestive tracts of planktonic animals (zooplankton) become anoxic and support microorganisms capable of living without oxygen (anaerobes), they may also support mercury methylation.  Using the sequences of a gene found in all bacteria, we produced the first library of microbial communities in the lower digestive tracts of Antarctic krill.  The composition of digestive tract microbial communities varied in krill collected from different locations along the Antarctic Peninsula.  Our preliminary analysis of the microbial communities in the lower digestive tracts of krill revealed the presence of representatives of 4 taxonomic groups of bacteria known to contain the mercury methylation gene.  In future work, we will identify specific microorganisms bearing the mercury methylation genes and we will examine the extent to which mercury methylation genes and enzymes are present and active in krill from the Southern Ocean.
