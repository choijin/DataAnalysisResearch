<AbstractNarration>This project develops the rigorous theory of statistical mechanics, the study of mathematical models, often random in nature and involving many tiny particles or other bodies, that idealize and exemplify physically interesting phenomena such as the transitions in microscopic structure undergone by a cube of ice as it melts into water. The notion of universality plays a fundamental role: certain mathematical structures emerge from many different random systems when these systems are viewed on an appropriately large scale in space and time. We will develop the theory of randomly growing interfaces, where a one-dimensional surface is growing in a local fashion at random rates while also being subject to restoring forces such as surface tension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this context, the right notion of universality is specified by a stochastic partial differential equation, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. Its late-time and large-scale behavior models universal aspects of many randomly growing interfaces. The construction of line ensembles having a natural Gibbs resampling property whose lowest indexed curve is the fundamental solution of the KPZ equation is a technique developed in collaboration with Ivan Corwin that marries integrable systems approaches to probabilistic ideas. The proposal plans to exploit this new perspective to investigate several phenomena in models in the KPZ universality class, including aging and decorrelation in Brownian last passage percolation, and polymer coalescence and tree structure in the Airy sheet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[            Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality         One of the central objects of KPZ universality is the KPZ equation, a stochastic partial differential equation  that models the height of a randomly growing interface.  Growth is stimulated in a local and random way by the field of space-time white noise.     Algebraic structures play an important role in studying  KPZ universality. Such structures   coming from representation theory and integrable systems can be leveraged  to create and analyse what are now called `stochastic integrable systems'.          These  predictions arising from algebraic structures are detailed and precise.  They have a lot to say, for example,  about a liquid crystal interface that grows when  a laser pulse initiates growth by firing at a single spot.  But the laser could fire in a whole array of configurations:  for most of these, there are no exact formulas.   In a sense, then, algebraic structures in  KPZ are delicate.  The Principal Investigator  analyses them  by reinterpreting them probabilistically.  These techniques  deal with intrinsic features of the randomness involved  in such mathematical models as mutually avoiding Brownian motions,  rather than directly analysing exact formulas and determinants.    A critical tool is resampling. This technique begins with a very simple observation  about a system of mutually avoiding Brownian motions.  Suppose the topmost  among these motions  is forgotten over a given interval [a,b], but the rest of the trajectories remain.   What is the statistical information about the trajectory fragment that we forgot?    The answer is simple. To draw back the missing piece,  and recover it in a statistical sense, we should draw a Brownian motion that begins  at time a at the known value of the motion, and similarly ends at time b,  and which is forced to avoid all the curves below in the intervening period.            The top curve among many mutually avoiding Brownian motions is very significant in  the theory of KPZ universality. When it is viewed in coordinates scaled by the  (1/3,2/3)-exponent pair that is a fundamental characteristic of this theory,  it describes the boundary fluctuation  of the growing unstable region in the liquid crystal  (when the laser fires at just one point).    The simple resampling observation is actually very powerful as a tool for analysing this  interface. Indeed, in 2010, Ivan Corwin and the PI made this observation,  calling the resampling the Brownian Gibbs property,  and using it to define the Airy line ensemble,  an infinite system of mutually avoiding curves. This system is one of the fundamental and universal characters of this theory,  viewed from the perspective of Brownian Gibbs resampling. Using resampling techniques, we introduced a KPZ line ensemble,  an object which accurately describes the Brownian structure of the KPZ equation  even after scaling with the (1/3,2/3)-exponent pair.     Under this NSF grant, probabilistic tools - of resampling, and also of surgery -  have been developed to tackle many questions in KPZ universality.  Consider again a liquid crystal instability,  with the laser now firing  in a rather general configuration. It has long been suspected that the suitably scaled liquid crystal boundary  will resemble Brownian motion, as it does in the case of the single spot laser pulse.  To make sense of these ideas, think of the  unstable region  as a tree growing  in the plane from the spot that the laser hits. At a given time, the tree's canopy  is the unstable region's boundary, which is understood to look Brownian,  using the resampling ideas in this work with Ivan Corwin.   When growth begins  in a more general initial condition, the unstable region should instead by depicted as  a whole forest of competing trees which between them divide up the region. The region boundary is now divided between the canopies of several,  or perhaps many, of these trees.       Under DMS 1512908, the Principal Investigator completed a four-paper study  of KPZ universality in which a version of this Brownian behavior  for interfaces growing from such general initial conditions is proved for the first time.  Crucially, this work studies systems in scaled coordinates  that take account of the (1/3,2/3)-exponent pair for KPZ fluctuation. Included is a key estimate that controls the number of surviving trees in the scaled system at unit time,  Papers written under the grant offer several basic tools,  of which this estimate is a significant example, that realize and further raise  the prospect of obtaining sharp information about probabilistic aspects of KPZ universality  and the canonical scaled structures at the heart of this universality class.
