<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in developing a technologically advanced textile dye particle originating with plant material that will reduce water pollution, help alleviate stress on constrained water supplies, and improve factory worker health by creating a high performance, low water use natural dye for fabrics. Wet textile processing is the largest contributor to fresh water pollution worldwide. The waste-water carries a significant amount of toxic chemicals such as salts, heavy metals including chrome, and toxic biocides, organic chemicals and anions that are energy consumptive and difficult to clean. These chemicals affect the people who work with them and ecosystems worldwide. Engineering a technologically advanced natural dye and application process in the United States will satisfy a consumer demand for healthier options for themselves and their children in apparel, bedding and other textiles; will simultaneously create manufacturing, engineering and technology jobs; and will drastically reduce water use and dye pollution. The new technology will be competitive with current dyeing solutions, even at a premium cost, because of the inherent value added. It will serve as a model and supplier to disrupt a very mature industry on a global scale eventually reaching an economy of scale for mass market over 5-10 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 1 project will result in a natural dye process that is a healthy alternative to chemical based dyeing of textiles. Chemical based dyes often contain known carcinogens and pollute environments and create serious and lasting healthy problems for industry workers. The developed natural dye technology will be able to compete against chemical dyes in both performance and cost. The research will examine the effects of microencapsulating natural dye molecules in order to protect the dyes from UV light and fading with washing while retaining the environmental and health benefit of plant based dyes. Another key objective is to ensure a one-step attachment of the particles by adding "green" binder materials to foam formulations. Foam application onto textiles has high absorption rates with low moisture, therefore creating less waste, more even dyeing and 80% less water usage than commonly used water baths for dyeing. The anticipated results are that the microencapsulated dye particles will permanently bond to the textiles and give the high performance value of colorfastness while reducing manufacturing costs and using natural resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under STTR Phase I Award #1549753, Noon Design Studio successfully developed a disruptive, high performing bio based pigment and eco-friendly binding formula for cotton and viscose fibers. Our research accomplished the relevant technical key objectives listed in the STTR Phase I proposal: encapsulation of naturally derived colorants, secure binding to a cotton fabric surface, sufficient UV light-fastness and wash-fastness, and application by existing textile processing equipment.    Textiles are the second largest polluting industry after oil, mostly due to dyes.  An immense amount of fresh water is used and polluted during the coloring process. The industry is actively seeking novel solutions that are both bio based and water reducing while retaining performance qualities demanded by consumers.    Our pigment is made from agricultural waste and significantly reduces pollution and toxicity in fresh water systems by using biodegradable or biocompatible materials.  The pigment was designed for industry by being high performing, inexpensive, scalable and easily adopted into the mill by using existing and common equipment.    We developed corresponding eco-binders for the pigment to be attached to cotton fibers.  The binders do not contain any of the common chemicals used for attaching pigments such as formaldehyde, heavy metals, acrylic acid or other toxic materials.  Our binders are created from bio polymers that meet the industry's high performance needs.  Our pigment and corresponding eco-binders have been designed to work with coating equipment at the mill, as opposed to exhaust system dyeing equipment. Therefore, our formula is capable of reducing water use by 93% at the mill level. The water reduction created through the use of our formula with the coating equipment gives an immense savings to the mill looking for resource and cost reduction without capital expenditure.  Further, the water savings significantly decreases the amount of fresh water input into the mill and therefore significantly reduces overall pollution.  An additional variation of our pigment has also been developed under the award. The additional pigment was designed to be compatible with dope dyeing viscose fibers.  By fine tuning the surface properties of the pigment, it can be used in viscose solution before the fiber is drawn.  This process creates zero waste and uses zero water for dyeing.
