<AbstractNarration>Clumped isotopes are the combination of any two or more of the rare isotopes in a molecule. In the case of carbonate rocks, the combination of 13C and 18O in the CO2 released from carbonate during the dissolution by phosphoric acid has been the most extensively investigated. This has revolutionized the study of the stable isotope systematics of carbonate materials. The clumped isotope method allows scientists, with one measurement, to obtain information about the temperature of formation and the oxygen isotopic composition of the formation fluid at the same time. In addition to the clumped isotopes in carbonates, there is increasing interest in other clumped isotope systems (CH4 and O2 for example). This interest has spurred a revolution in mass spectrometric techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant progress has been made at the past four International Workshops on this topic, held in Seattle, London, Boston, and Zurich over the past six years. These meetings allow those interested in the analyses and applications of clumped isotopes to interact over a three to four day period, share methods and applications, and discuss the recent innovations in the science. The workshops have been a productive intermingling of early career and established scientists, and have resulted in significant papers and establishment of analytical best practices. Overall they have had significant positive impact upon the future of the field. Despite growing interest in and use of clumped isotopes, several problems remain to be solved. The 5th International Clumped Isotope Workshop, to be held in January, 2016, in St. Petersburg, Florida, will focus on coordinating inter-laboratory cross-calibration efforts, new clumped isotope systems, recognition of non-equilibrium clumped isotope systems, and progress in understanding clumped isotope systems in equilibrium. Exploring these topics is essential for the further development of clumped isotope techniques. NSF funding supports participants of ten or more early career scientists in this workshop.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In January 2016, a workshop was offered at the University of South Florida College of Marine Science to discuss technical aspects of a paleothermometer.  A paleothermometer allows geoscientists to estimate temperatures on Earth long before thermometers (and, in some cases, humans) existed.  This particular paleothermometer, clumped isotopes, involves two rare but stable (not radioactive) isotopes of carbon and oxygen bonded together in calcium carbonate (limestone).  The abundance of these bonds is related to temperature of formation of the limestone, however they are difficult to measure.  Hence, the workshop convened several laboratories developing this technique from throughout the world, as well as other laboratories and scientists planning on using this paleothermometer in the near future, to discuss how to best measure clumped isotopes.   This award supported travel and participation costs for 10 early career scientists.  In all, 13 scientists defined as "Early Career" (Ph.D. in process or within 10 years of having received a Ph.D.) applied to attend the workshop and 10 were selected to receive funding based on abstract submission, personal statements, and involvement with development of clumped isotopes.  The 13 applicants included 10 males and 3 females, 9 from institutions in the United States, and 4 from international institutions. Of the three that were not selected, one was not able to participate in the meeting due to financial constraints. The 10 Early-Career scientists that were supported by this grant were able to contribute to 52 abstracts submitted to the workshop.  All abstracts are searchable through Scholar Commons - http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/clumped_isotope/2016 .  Overall, there were 93 attendees registered for the meeting, including corporate sponsors and University of South Florida volunteers.  Already, 2 peer reviewed manuscripts have been published based on discussions at this workshop.   To most of the Early-Career scientists funded to attend the workshop through this grant, the opportunity was important for their careers.  Each was asked for a post-workshop synopsis outlining how the workshop helped their career aspirations.  Some excerpts include:  "Another key part of academic career development is networking and the workshop provided an excellent platform for networking with new and old colleagues. The spacious coffee/poster location was conducive to small group discussions which I found a good networking opportunity." "At the workshop I had the opportunity to meet Thermo-Fisher engineers &hellip; which in turn became an active collaboration. Currently we are preparing a manuscript for scientific publication describing a new methodology we developed. I am glad I had the opportunity to participate in the 5th International Clumped Isotope Workshop and thank the NSF and the workshop organizers for awarding me with travel funding." "Considering the future importance of clumped isotope geochemistry in paleoclimatology, it is important to note that this community is outstandingly open to new and particularly young scientists. Despite this, presenting my own work allowed me to get in contact with well-known international scientists and considerably improved my understanding of clumped isotope geochemistry." "I would never have been able to meet most of the established professors and up-and-coming researchers if I had not attended this conference." "&hellip; I consider are more helpful to prospective and less experienced attendees, such as myself, that may only now be in a position to make real wold measurements or individuals that may be considering beginning with clumped isotope analysis in their laboratories." "I am new to the clumped-isotope community and this was my first clumped-isotope workshop. In this respect, the workshop provided an excellent overview on the analytical aspects of clumped isotopes, standardization and inter-laboratory comparison, new techniques and applications. The panels and open-discussions provided a platform for the clumped isotope community to resolve inter-laboratory comparison and standardization issues that are important to my future studies." "The small scale and focused nature of the clumped isotope workshop in St. Petersburg allowed greater opportunity for me to meet and to interact with fellow researchers.  It was an ideal environment for an early career scientist, especially one in the middle of a Ph.D. such as myself, to begin relationships with potential post doctorial advisors and potential future collaborators."      Of the 3 attendees that applied but were not selected for support, 1 responded to the same question.   "The conference helped me in two ways:  It serves as a great networking event, and it also helps me to know what the newest developments are in the field of clumped isotope studies.  Both of these are important as I aim to advance my career, as it is important to both know your field and know the players in your field.  It ensures that I am staying on top of the latest advancements, often before they are published."        Last Modified: 02/03/2017       Submitted by: Brad Rosenheim]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
