<AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) as well as additional support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) and the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Programs funds the acquisition of a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer by Wellesley College. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out modern research. This instrument is used in research on small organic molecules with potential anti-cancer and anti-tubercular properties, mutation of DNA oligonucleotides, and modified nanoparticles for imaging and medicinal usages. This spectrometer is also an integral component in training female undergraduate students. It is used by the students in courses and in their research projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as: (a) measuring equilibrium constants for base pair opening in DNA duplexes containing an abasic site lesion; (b) characterizing functionalization and magnetic properties of multipurpose nanoparticles; (c) determining the structure of novel coumarin derivatives with anti-tumor properties; (d) characterizing diverse pyrazolines as potential antitubercular agents; (e) synthesizing photoreactive small molecules to aid in the understanding of a GCPR transmembrane protein structure; and (f) using NOE methods to characterize the regiochemistry of N-substituted pyrazoles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Wellesley College Chemistry Department is deeply grateful to the National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation Program for supporting the acquisition of a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer for teaching and research.  Over the past two years since its installation, hundreds of female undergraduate students have used this cutting-edge instrument to obtain data at the molecular scale, enhancing their understanding of chemistry and strengthening their confidence in using complex instrumentation.  In their Organic Chemistry classes, they have used this instrument to discover the structures of the molecules that they themselves synthesized, while in their Physical Chemistry course, they used the NMR to understand how molecules move and disperse energy.  In faculty research labs, two dozen students used the NMR as part of independent research projects in organic chemistry: exploring analogs of naturally-occurring coumarins that might kill pancreatic cancer cells in the Carrico-Moniz lab; developing active analogs of sulfa drugs to fight tuberculosis in the Hearn lab; creating methods in the Huang lab to synthesize diverse pyrazoles, molecules with a variety of pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications; and synthesizing molecules to bind to a receptor involved in diabetes in the Haines lab.  Meanwhile, the Nunez lab has been using the NMR spectrometer to investigate how damaged DNA moves and "breathes" in solution.  Results were disseminated via ten undergraduate theses, two papers, and a dozen conference presentations, providing further opportunities for students to develop their skills in writing and public speaking about their scientific work.  We anticipate that this instrument will continue to support a vibrant and enthusiastic group of young researchers for many years into the future.
