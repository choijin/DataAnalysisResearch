<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum vortices, which are like little tornados governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, are important in understanding the behavior of systems such as superfluid helium, superconductors, liquid crystals, neutrons stars and perhaps even cosmic strings in the early universe.  This project explores the behavior of quantum vortices in small (~1cm) droplets of superfluid liquid helium.  Magnetic levitation, which is the same technique being explored for high speed trains and elevators that can move in all 3 dimensions, is used to float the droplet and eliminate the influence of the walls and the motion of the vortices is imaged using tracer molecules which fluoresce when illuminated with laser light.  These studies will help us better understand the behavior of this strange form of quantum matter and will benefit studies of advanced materials such as superconductors and liquid crystals. This project will also train a new generation of scientists in technologically important fields such as low-temperature physics, fluid dynamics and advanced laser technologies. The research team plans to conduct demonstrations involving magnetic levitation and superfluid helium in various educational and outreach programs at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory to introduce these scientific concepts to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses intriguing fundamental problems relevant to the dynamics of quantized vortex lines. The objectives include a thorough investigation on how the appearance of vortices can affect the stability of a rotating superfluid drop and an in-depth study of the evolution of a vortex tangle in a wall-free environment. In superfluid helium-4, vortex lines can be directly visualized by imaging tracer particles trapped on the lines. However, producing tracers in helium at low temperatures and imaging the trapped tracers remains challenging, and the container walls can often affect the vortex-line motion. This project employs a levitated helium-4 drop as the working system, in which the vortices can be produced via fast evaporative cooling and controllable drop rotation. These vortices can be decorated with metastable He2 molecular tracers which can be imaged using a laser-induced fluorescence technique. The study of the vortex configuration in a rotating helium-4 drop helps explain the observed drop morphology and allows the derivation of the stability diagram of rotating superfluid drops. Since a levitated helium drop may serve as a model for other superfluid drop systems, such as neutron stars, the results obtained in this study may generate broad interest. Visualizing the evolution of a vortex tangle in a helium drop can facilitate the study of central questions in quantum turbulence research, such as the existence of polarized vortex bundles and the generation of Kelvin waves on vortices; these studies can directly advance our knowledge about the characteristics of quantum turbulence.</AbstractNarration>
