<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "Classification of C*-algebras, Flow Equivalence of Shift Spaces, and Graphs and Leavitt Path Algebras" that will be held from May 11-15, 2015, on the campus of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this conference is to update the operator algebra community on recent advances in the Elliott classification program for C*-algebras and related topics.  The feature activity in the event will be series of five lectures by Soren Eilers of the University of Copenhagen. These will be complemented by a small number of plenary lectures and a host of contributed talks. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A fundamental and hard problem in the Elliott classification program is the classification of (nuclear) C*-algebras with finitely many ideals.   Within this class, the class of graph C*-algebras with finitely many ideals is a key case.  This large class has historically deep connections with symbolic dynamics, and utilizes deep tools from K-theory, homology, dynamical systems, combinatorics, ring theory and other places.      This conference consisted of 5 lectures by the principal speaker Soren Eilers, an internationally reknown leading researcher in the subject.  The lectures were accessible to a wide audience, starting from the fundamentals and leading to cutting edge research problems.  A number of other speakers gave talks which supplemented the lectures of the principal speaker and explored the wide scope of this large, multidisciplinary subject.   Ample time was provided for the participants and speakers to meet and interact with each other.  A permanent conference website contains the lecture notes and slides of the speakers.   The conference was a great success.  There were a large number of participants.  There was a good mixture of  experts and nonexperts. A significant number of participants and speakers were young people and members of underrepresented groups.  Many participants commented that they learned a lot from the lectures and meeting new people, and benefitted from the resources available including those from the conference website.  Many new collaborations and research projects were initiated.  In fact, major research breakthroughs were stimulated by this conference, including the classification of all Cuntz--Krieger algebras and the solution of a fundamental question in Leavitt path algebras.  This conference is also supposed to be the first  of what is hoped to be a series of collaborations among researchers in the region.  Our partners at the University of Houston are now setting things up for a similar conference to be held at the University of Houston in the near future.
