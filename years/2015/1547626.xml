<AbstractNarration>This project will support NSF-funded investigators to participate in the upcoming NASA-funded ATom (Atmospheric Tomography Mission) project.  The objective of ATom is to map the global atmospheric distribution of particles, reactive gases, and short-lived species relevant for understanding climate.  Two instrument packages will be added to the first of four deployments of the NASA DC-8 aircraft scheduled for June-August 2016.  These instruments will provide data critical for advancing fundamental aspects of carbon and climate science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two instrument packages to be deployed are the NCAR Airborne Oxygen Instrument (AO2), which provides rapid in situ measurements of atmospheric O2 and CO2 concentrations, and the NCAR/Scripps Medusa flask sampler, which collects samples for analysis of O2/N2, CO2 concentration, CO2 isotopes and Ar/N2.  Both of these instruments are mature and have been used extensively, including on the 5 NSF-supported HIPPO campaigns from 2009-2011.  By combining these measurements with large-scale atmospheric transport models, direct constraints on the corresponding air-sea fluxes of heat, O2, and CO2 are obtained.  This research will advance a broader range of issues related to the carbon cycle and climate, such as the distribution of carbon sinks and the links between ocean biochemistry, carbon cycling, and climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this RAPID proposal was to support studies of atmospheric CO2, O2, and related atmospheric constituents on the first campaign of "ATom", a project using the NASA DC-8 aircraft to map the chemistry of the atmosphere along broad cross sections down the Atlantic and Pacific (https://espo.nasa.gov/home/atom).  The proposal allowed the successful measurement of CO2 and O2 concentrations on these flights.  These data will be incorporated with data from the follow-on ATom campaigns (supported via a subsequently-funded normal NSF award) to address key questions related to carbon and climate, such as understanding the the large-scale distribution of sinks, and understanding the relationships between carbon and heat transport by the oceans.  Results from ATom-1 reveal large-scale patterns in O2 including an excess of O2 in the northern hemisphere driven by land photosynthesis in the northern summer.  The ATom-1 campaign occurred in the immediate aftermath of the strongest El Nino event in several decades.  The data reveal strong excess of CO2 at at tropical latitudes compared to similar transects on a previous NSF-funded campaign (HIPPO) in August 2011.  This excess is almost certainly caused by drought in tropical latitudes caused by the El Nino.  The ATom-1 data may prove very useful for helping to quantify and characterize these tropical emissions.          Last Modified: 01/04/2017       Submitted by: Britton Stephens]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
