<AbstractNarration>This collaborative award will support personnel to complete a commensal search for the recently discovered Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) using the 20-m telescope at Green Bank at L-band (1.4 GHz). The project, GBTrans, will utilize existing infrastructure and development. Broader impacts of the work include research training of one graduate student and two undergrads, and outreach to high-school students and their teachers to enhance the research experience as part of the NSF-funded "Pulsar Search Collaboratory" which is run by researchers at NRAO and WVU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GBTrans will also perform extensive searches for giant pulses from known radio pulsars, and will provide constraints on the statistics of the brightest such pulses. An important capability of the instrument is its full-polarization recording, which will identify the polarization properties of FRBs and perhaps even their rotation measures.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are one of the hottest topics in current astrophysics. First discovered by a West Virginia University (WVU) unddergraduate student a decade ago in archival data from the Parkes radio telescope, there are now two dozen examples known. FRBs are randomly distributed over the sky and are bright enough to be detectable by even modest size radio dishes. So far, only one of the sources is known to repeat. Rather like the enigmatic gamma-ray bursts found 50 years ago, FRBs represent a cosmological population of sources of as-yet unknown origin. This NSF funded project has allowed us to deploy and operate an autonomous FRB detection system - called GBTrans - on the 20 m radio telescope at the Green Bank observatory in West Virginia. So far, this project has been used to search for FRBs and also to detect giant radio pulses from Galactic neutron stars. The project has engaged one graduate student, Golnoosh Golpayegani, and one undergraduate student, Ben Gregg, both working with PI Lorimer at WVU. These students are currently using GBTrans in their research to search for FRBs over the whole sky, and in targeted searches observing in parallel with NASA satellites. Although no FRBs have yet been found, we have been able to secure non-NSF funding from NASA ($20k) and the Research Corporation for Scientific Advancement ($50k) to continue observations through the end of 2018. Both Gregg and Golpayegani are working on papers describing the results of their searches to date which are aimed to be submitted in 2018. The NSF funding for this work has allowed us to collaborate with other groups at Green Bank and we are also working on a paper describing the sample of pulses from the Crab pulsar.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Duncan&nbsp;Lorimer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
