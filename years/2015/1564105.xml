<AbstractNarration>The emergence of smartphones and more generally mobile platforms as a vehicle for communication, entertainment, and commerce has led to a revolution of innovation. Markets now provide a dizzying array of applications that inform and aid every conceivable human need or desire. At the same time, application markets allow previously unknown multitudes of application developers access to user devices through fast- tracked software publishing with well-documented consequent security concerns. The science and tools for performing security analysis of applications have vastly improved over the last decade. However, market providers have limited capability to apply those analyses at scale to the massive software markets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a crosscutting research, educational, and outreach plan improving the scalability and accuracy of smartphone application analysis. The research effort focuses on the creation of new techniques and algorithms to enable analysis of large bodies of applications by reducing analysis cost and prioritizing identified security vulnerabilities by their expected impact.  Explored within the context of Android Intent analysis resolution, the team is developing efficient algorithms and study the computational complexity of matching application communication sources and sinks thereby supporting phone-wide information flow analysis, developing empirical models for estimating the likelihoods of inter-component communication, and exploring features and metrics indicating their potential security impacts communication pathways.  The approaches are being applied to a commercial markets (Apple iOS) and domains (web, desktop, and server environments) and massive application data sets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "TWC: Medium: Collaborative: Scaling and Prioritizing Market-Sized Application Analysis" project has funded a line of research that developed tools and analysis techniques to evaluate the security of smart phone applications and Internet of Things (IoT) applications and environments.  Works in smart phone application security (e.g., COAL, Axplorer) focused on refining and scaling the analysis of smart phone application implementations.  These efforts focused on generalizing the identification of logic (code) and permission flaws, and provided new methods for identifying malware or security bugs in phone apps.     Project efforts on IoT applications and devices leveraged and extended the techniques used in the smart phones.  In particular, the developed tools (e.g., Sentinel, Saint, Soteria, IoTGuard, and IoTSan) enable the analysis of not just a single deviceâ€™s logic, but the analysis of the joint behavior of an environment of diverse IoT devices.  New architectures and techniques also enabled the real-time detection of malicious activity within these environments.  Importantly, these tools provide a platform for detecting and mitigating malicious software that attack physical infrastructures&mdash;and thus introduce defenses against malware that targets devices such as wireless routers, door cameras, and smart home appliances.     This work has had measurable impact on both academic research and industrial practices.  The papers documenting this effort have received hundreds of citations and led to numerous follow-on studies.  Moreover, a pos-doc participant of this project was hired by Google to develop and employ techniques to evaluate the security of systems in devices, and a PhD working in the IoT space was hired as a faculty by Purdue University.  These systems and work continue to be highly cited and the tools made available are frequently downloaded and used in related research.
