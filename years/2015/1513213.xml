<AbstractNarration>Naming and identification is critical to the Internet today, with the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) as the glue making the Internet useable by ordinary people by mapping human-readable names such as www.nsf.gov to Internet addresses such as 128.150.4.107.  Originally a simple lookup mechanism in a low-risk environment, today naming has additional roles in the network ranging from content delivery to anti-spam systems.   DNS spans many applications because is flexible, universally deployed, and has robust infrastructure capable of supporting high traffic loads.  But DNS today faces many challenges:  needs for improved security and privacy, richer functionality; increasing dynamic content; orders-of-magnitude more names (at the top with DNS expansion and internationalization, and the edges with the Internet of Things).  Most critically, DNS is increasingly difficult to evolve, both due to the installed base of critical infrastructure, and because of increasing distance between the research community and the data and infrastructure needed to make credible contributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one year planning project will identify and provide conceptual designs for infrastructure that will counteract this ossification and catalyze research in Internet naming, identification, and trust.  The project will bring together researchers on naming, around shared infrastructure that supports:  (1) Parallel Resolution Evaluation with simultaneous and safe testing of experiments in the context of live, operational DNS, and  (2) Instrumentation And Measurement that helps share real-world DNS query and performance data, employing both technical and legal methods for ethical sharing. Community input will be obtained via focus groups and workshops. The outcomes will be clear statement of the community's infrastructure needs in this area, community-vetted designs for the infrastructure, and assessment of the risks and costs associated with the infrastructure</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The premise of CI-P: Planning for Identity and Naming Experimentation Shared Testbed (PINEST), is that a shared research infrastructure around DNS (the Internet's Domain Name System) and Internet naming can revitalize this area of Internet research.  As a planning grant, our major goal is to reduce the risks of a future full proposal. We must insure that research has zero impact on correct operation and end-user privacy. Planning also will promote initial discussions and community building to begin rebuilding this research area.  Outcomes of this work  The project has prototyped a full query measurement infrastructure for a root-server. This prototype demonstrates the viability of measurement collection at Root-server scales, as required in a full research infrastructure for Internet naming. The project has prototyped methods for appropriate data sharing, with different options for flexibility in what is shared. Data sharing will be required in a full research infrastructure for Internet naming; these initial data sharing mechanisms show that sharing is viable. Our initial steps in DNS experimentation help reduce the risk for the experimental component of a full research infrastructure for Internet naming. (Experimentation at the rates of a Root server is a major risk in a full research infrastructure.) The DINR-2016 workshop shows there is significant academic interest in areas of Internet naming, with work at many institutions with topics on measurement, tools, systems design, security (attack and defense), privacy (both general privacy, interactions with protocols such as TOR, and NSEC), and Internet-of-Things.
