<AbstractNarration>In order to support an understanding of and improvements to graduate education in ocean sciences, the PIs will develop a publication for distribution at the Ocean Sciences Meeting (OSM) to be held from February 21-24 in New Orleans, Louisiana. OSM is a bi-annual conference supported by the American Geophysical Union (AGU), the Association for Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO), and The Oceanography Society (TOS). It is the largest national gathering of ocean scientists. Florida State University proposes to publish a special issue of the TOS journal Oceanography with the title "Graduate Education in the Ocean Sciences" in March 2016. This journal will be distributed at the conference and will stimulate discussion of the challenges and opportunities facing faculty, administrators, and students in today's US graduate programs in the ocean sciences at this conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special publication will: (1) consider future research directions and workforce needs that depend on advanced education, (2) describe key elements of the graduate degree and professional development programs offered today, (3) call attention to the unique interdisciplinary and international training opportunities offered by these programs, (4) identify changes that may be needed to better support and prepare today's students for the workforce of tomorrow, (5) reflect on (and provide guidance for) meeting the challenges of recruiting and supporting a more diverse future student cohort, and (6) catalyze discussion on what both individual programs and the broader community can do to help our students prepare for successful careers and life after graduate school. The proposed set of peer-reviewed articles plus sidebars and scientist profiles will further these objectives.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This grant provided support for the publication of a special issue of Oceanography (http://tos.org/oceanography/)  magazine which is produced by the Oceanography Society (TOS).  The society was founded in 1988 to disseminate knowledge of oceanography and its application through research and education, to promote communication among ocean scientists and to provide a constituency for consensus building across all the disciplines of the field.  The magazine is published quarterly and contains peer-reviewed articles as well as news and information, meeting reports, book reviews, career profiles, and shorter, editor-reviewed articles that address public policy and education and how they are affected by science and technology.    The main purpose of this special issue was to stimulate discussion among ocean sciences faculty, administrators, and students on how to update, and perhaps collaborate on, graduate education in the ocean sciences to ensure that students are provided with the education and tools needed to contribute to a 21st century workforce that addresses pressing issues such as climate change, ocean stressors (e.g., fisheries, pollution), and natural hazards, to name a few. Volume 29 (Number 1) of Oceanography magazine was published on March 30, 2016 and contains a special issue section focused on Graduate Education in the Ocean Sciences.      The issue begins with an editorial overview and descriptive snapshot of the current graduate education landscape in the ocean sciences.  An additional seven articles and nine sidebars provide historical insight into the evolution of graduate training programs in the ocean sciences; present perspectives and commentary on the status of ocean science graduate education from a range of contributors including former government officials, current deans, faculty from a range of institutional types and graduate students; describe the challenges and opportunities for recruiting and supporting a more diverse student community; describe what professional societies, specialty networks and organizations can offer graduate students beyond the academic setting; and showcase relevant federal agency graduate fellowship programs.  Examples of innovative programs and practices at various levels that prepare students for successful careers in the ocean sciences and other facets of the workforce are presented throughout the issue in both invited articles and in shorter sidebar vignettes.  Ideas and recent recommendations from organizations beyond the ocean sciences are also included to provide a broader perspective.           Hard copies of the magazine were mailed to approximately 2,100 TOS members worldwide as well as to the libraries at major oceanographic institutions.  Full digital versions (PDF download, browser, iPad, Android, Kindle) are available to TOS members and can be purchased by any other interested party.  In addition, all articles are available online on the Oceanography website with full free access (see http://tos.org/oceanography/issues/archive.html) to ensure the broadest possible use of the published information. From the time the special issue went online in late March, through late August 2016, TOS reported approximately 4,000 hits on articles from this issue.   Topics addressed by the special issue will be presented and discussed by Drs. Susan Cook (Issue co-editor) at the Ocean Science Educators Retreat (OSER) in Baton Rouge, LA on October 5, 2016 and at the annual Ocean Industry Forum sponsored by the Consortium for Ocean Leadership in Washington DC on October 26, 2016.
