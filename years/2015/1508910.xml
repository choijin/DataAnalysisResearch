<AbstractNarration>Climate change due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become one of the most challenging issues in human society. In the U.S., electric power generation contributes about 40 % of the total GHG, 64% of SO2 emissions, 16% of NOx emissions, and 68% of mercury air emissions as well as large shares of other pollutants (such as small particulates) in 2010. It is then critically important to correctly account for emissions related to electricity generation, delivery and consumption. The emissions can be monitored and measured directly at the power plants. However, it has been called "impossible" to trace the emissions associated with electricity consumption back to generation sources. Because of this daunting difficulty, an accurate life-cycle analysis of electricity generation and usage cannot be done so far while such analysis is important to various products and processes including GHG inventories of different entities and regions.  Moreover, it has also been very challenging or impossible to carry out clear and unequivocal cost and usage allocation analysis to equally share the benefit and responsibility for all entities involved in electricity generation and delivery. The importance of equity can never be overstated when designing and implementing public policy and engineering practices for interconnected power systems that include numerous generators and cover a vast area. The proposed research work will develop the right tools to link loads and generation/emission sources, to carry out effective cost and benefit analyses, and to help develop appropriate electric energy and environmental related policies to share responsibility among different entities, and ultimately maintain transparency, equity and fairness in electric power industry. The developed methods will facilitate active customer participation and help electricity users make informed choices. This project will also help advance technology and workforce development in electric power sector, which is critical to our whole nation and future sustainable electric energy development and usage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop "disruptive" methods for real-time identification of generation and emission sources of any individual load at specific location and time. The following approach is taken: (1) A transformative, equivalent circuit model will be developed for power systems. A power system can be represented by the proposed transfer impedance based system equivalent model, which is transformative and can be used for other general circuit analyses; (2) A "disruptive" method will be developed to identify the generation sources of the total demand of individual loads at specific locations and times based on the equivalent model and phasor measurement unit or system state estimation data; (3) A novel method will be developed to identify marginal generators due to incremental demand changes based on publically available information; (4) Not only the locational marginal emissions but also the overall emissions will be accurately quantified for individual loads; and (5) An integrated economic/environmental optimal load management will be developed to achieve environmentally sensitive and guided electricity usage. The results of the project will provide the fundamental basis to ensure equity and fairness in developing and implementing public policy and engineering practices for interconnected power systems. The underlying power flow tracing technique will enable clear and unequivocal cost and usage allocation analyses to equally share the benefit and responsibility for all entities involved in electricity generation and delivery. Moreover, the outcomes of this project will quantify customer-specific emissions and enable users to perform economic/environmental load management to reduce cost and to achieve a range of environmental benefits.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the course of this project, the following outcomes have been attained:</p> <p>1. Technical Outcomes: (i) An equivalent circuit-based method of power and emission tracing in interconnected power grids. Based on the developed method, an interconnected mesh network can be converted into a series of equivalent acyclic circuits so that the contributions of generators to a specific load can be clearly and unequivocally traced from a circuit point of view without having to make any assumptions on how nodal power inflows contribute to the outflows. The method is also capable of accounting for power losses as well as transmission line constraints. (ii) A data-driven method for identifying marginal generation units and estimating marginal emissions in market-based power systems based on publicly available information. Through a systematic investigation of the relationship between locational marginal prices (LMPs) and marginal units, it has been proven that LMP information alone does not provide any direct spatial link to the marginal unit. The developed method provides meaningful cost and emission information for developing effective demand response (DR) programs and quantification of locational marginal emissions (LMEs) without compromising the confidentiality of electricity market. (iii) &nbsp;Characterization of electricity generation sources and fuel costs.&nbsp; A data-driven method has been developed to calculate the costs of various types of fuel in different regions, which 17 types of prime movers (such as steam turbine, gas turbine, hydraulic turbine, wind turbine, etc.), 39 types of fuel (such as bituminous coal, sub-bituminous coal, lignite coal, anthracite coal, natural gas, distillate fuel oil, jet fuel, nuclear fuel, etc.), and 116 different combinations of prime mover and fuel (such as steam turbine and bituminous coal, gas turbine and natural gas, combined cycle and natural gas, etc.).&nbsp; The developed fuel cost distributions have been further improved by an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model with history fuel cost data. &nbsp;The results have been used for the Locational Emissions Estimation Methodology (LEEM) developed by the PIs and can be used for developing validated, realistic, high fidelity power system network models to evaluate various new methods, algorithms and tools that have been developed recently or in the future. (iv) Temporal and spatial load management methods for cost and emission reduction. Based on the information of generation sources and related emissions obtained via the develop power tracing and marginal unit identification methods, various demand response programs have been studied and developed at different levels: centralized at transmission level, distributed at distribution/utility company level, or purely distributed at individual customer level. In addition to demand response in time frame, load management methods in spatial frame have also been developed and studied for managing new loads such as electric vehicle charging loads. The above research outcomes of the project have been reported in 15 journal papers (accepted and submitted), 13 conference papers, and one full book that was supported in part by this grant.</p> <p>2. Educational Outcomes: (i) Curriculum development and improvement. Two new courses have been developed: ECE 7860: Operation and Control of Modern Power Systems and CE 5410: E3: Energy, Environment, and Economics. Two existing courses (ECE 5430: Electric Energy Systems Engineering and CE 6270: Environmental Management and Sustainable Development) have been modernized by adding materials on the nexus of energy and environment and incorporating the new research findings of the project to enhance the educational effort in sustainable energy development. (ii) Student mentoring. Four undergraduates (Khidr Abdun-Nur, Michael Mayberry, Jason Bierbuyck and Avery English) were mentored and exposed to research experience, and four PhD students (C. Fu, T. Hu, Z. Zhao, and M. Rouholamini) were advised.</p> <p>3. Outreach Outcomes and Broader Impacts. One workshop and one competition event (co-organized with American Water Works Association (AWWA) and two IEEE conference panels have been organized, and more than 20 seminars have been delivered for promoting sustainable energy development and environmentally-sensitive energy use. Numerous discussions with local community partners (such as Detroit Downtown Boxing Gym Youth Program and Wayne State University Sustainability Office and Detroit Edison) have been exchanged to increase the community outreach engagement of the project. &nbsp;The results of the project help decision and policy makers in understanding the complicated issues interweaved among energy and environmental systems and in developing new policies and/or updating existing ones related to electric energy development and usage and environmental protection. As a result, our research will help improve the adoption of cleaner generation sources and achieve sustainable energy development. Moreover, the proposed method can help address information inequality issues and facilitate more end-users to participate in economic and environmentally sensitive and guided electricity usage. The developed courses and lab components will better prepare students for future career challenges related to energy and environment.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/02/2019<br>      Modified by: Caisheng&nbsp;Wang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508910/1508910_10382359_1570040386546_NSF1508910Image2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508910/1508910_10382359_1570040386546_NSF1508910Image2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sustainable Energy Development and Environmentally Sensitive Energy Use Supported by Power and Emission Source Tracing"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508910/1508910_10382359_1570040386546_NSF1508910Image2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sustainable Energy Development and Environmentally Sensitive Energy Use Supported by Power and Emission Source Tracing"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Sustainable Energy Development and Environmentally Sensitive Energy Use Supported by Power and Emission Source Tracing</div> <div class="imageCredit">Caisheng Wang</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Caisheng&nbsp;Wang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Sustainable Energy Development and Environmentally Sensitive Energy Use Supported by Power and Emission Source Tracing</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508910/1508910_10382359_1570041480608_NSF1508910Image3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508910/1508910_10382359_1570041480608_NSF1508910Image3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Heat rate curves of different generation sources"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508910/1508910_10382359_1570041480608_NSF1508910Image3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Heat rate curves of different generation sources"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Characterization of different generation sources</div> <div class="imageCredit">Caisheng Wang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Caisheng&nbsp;Wang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Heat rate curves of different generation sources</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508910/1508910_10382359_1570041543891_NSF1508910Image4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508910/1508910_10382359_1570041543891_NSF1508910Image4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="LEEM -
