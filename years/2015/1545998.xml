<AbstractNarration>Despite nearly a century of study, the conditions that controlled initiation of the mighty Colorado River remain poorly understood and vigorously debated. This project seeks to reconstruct the origins of the Colorado River through multidisciplinary study of the Bouse Formation, a complex sedimentary deposit that accumulated in the lower reaches of the valley during river initiation between ~ 6.0 and 4.5 million years ago. The study benefits from collaborations among university professors and students, state and federal agency scientists, a county museum paleontologist, and a local high school teacher. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's will use integrated datasets to determine if the Bouse Formation formed in a brackish marine estuary or a large inland lake isolated from the ocean, a key distinction for understanding the origins of the river. This study also explores when and how waters of the Colorado River first reached the sea. Hypotheses will be tested through study of stratigraphic architecture, sedimentology, carbonate geochemistry (including C, O, Sr, and S isotopes), and geochronology. Hypothesis tests emphasize cross-correlation of radiogenic and stable isotope data with major and trace-element chemistry in a precise stratigraphic and structural framework. The PI's will run two workshops: one to engage a broad community of geoscientists, and one to plan a future scientific drilling proposal.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project investigated the Bouse Formation of western Arizona, a highly controversial set of deposits that document a large waterbody formed during the early history of the Colorado River, as it extended southwards towards the Gulf of California about 5-6 million years ago. One hypothesis suggests the lower Bouse Formation was deposited in an estuary connecting the Colorado River with the proto-Gulf of California, whereas the other hypothesis is that the Bouse Formation was entirely deposited in a series of inland lakes. This award was a collaborative effort by scientists supporting both hypotheses to obtain new data that might resolve the controversy, which has implications from the regional geologic history of the southwestern US and the Colorado Plateau that go far beyond the Bouse itself. Our group's geochemical and paleontological data strongly supports the "lake only" hypothesis and we have produced several peer-reviewed publications documenting these findings. However, disagreements still persist among members of the collaboration. As a consequence, we also organized a workshop through this grant to discuss how sediment cores collected by future scientific drilling collected in key locations might finally resolve the debate. This meeting, held in Parker, AZ, also provided an opportunity for the project team members to begin a collaboration with the Colorado River Indian Tribes CRIT), on whose land some of the key evidence to understand the controversy exist. A final activity of the project entailed producing a short film to document the research in collaboration with CRIT, to put the Bouse controversy in the context of a broader understanding of the history of the Colorado River, for future educational use by the tribe.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/05/2021<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;S&nbsp;Cohen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1545998/1545998_10408729_1612501756538_OutcropPhotoofBouseFormationnearParkerAZ--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1545998/1545998_10408729_1612501756538_OutcropPhotoofBouseFormationnearParkerAZ--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bouse Formation outcrop near Parker Arizona"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1545998/1545998_10408729_1612501756538_OutcropPhotoofBouseFormationnearParkerAZ--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bouse Formation outcrop near Parker Arizona"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A geologist walking on outcrops of the upper portion of the Bouse Formation.
