<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to promote the progress of science by providing student travel scholarships to attend the 23nd IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS 2015), to be held in Atlanta, GA, on Oct. 5-7, 2015. The 2005 PITAC and 2007 NSF Cyberinfrastructure Vision reports make it clear that people are key to improving computational science and research and in maintaining the competitive edge of the United States. To this end, the project aims to support about 20 students from US-based universities to attend MASCOTS 2015 by defraying travel and hotel expenses for them. The conference offers opportunities for students to interact and learn about state-of-the-art research in the areas of computer networks and performance evaluation of computer systems by bringing together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in what has become a premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implication of modeling and advanced computing systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are significant growth opportunities available to the students, such as three days of technical sessions, keynotes/plenaries, panels, parallel sessions, an industrial session, and a poster reception. The goal is to improve the computing field by: exposing more students to technical experts and potential collaborators, building better relationships between students, helping students meet potential hosts for summer visits/internships, helping students meet potential post-doctoral sponsors, and encouraging the students to stay in the field. Especially, the supported students will interact with researchers who are doing key work in crucial computing areas such as systems, networking, I/O, middleware/OS, and applications. The broader impacts of the project are the opportunities for the students to gain access to contacts with academia, industry, and national laboratories, leading to useful feedback on the students' research as well as opportunities for future employment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Synopsis: The goal of this project is to enable students recruited from around the country to attend IEEE 23nd International  Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)  2015, http://www.cs.vt.edu/mascots2015/, and to learn about current and future research and development in the field. MASCOTS  2015 offers opportunities for students to interact and learn about the state-of-the-art research in the areas of computer networks and performance evaluation of computer systems by bringing together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in what has become a premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implication  of modeling and simulation-based systems. The travel grant awardees were also required to report on their experiences after the conference, and used this feedback to determine how best to continue/modify this program in future years.    Project Outcomes: The grant supported fourteen (six femal, eight male) US-based graduate students to travel to IEEE MASCOTS. The students were able to interact with leaders in the field and able to get feedback on their research, as well as establish long-term contacts with future employers.   As part of the travel grant application, the students were asked to submit a one-page write-up summarizing their research and objectives for attending the conference. We were able to accommodate all applicants. Also, almost all of the recipients were main authors for at least one paper accepted to the conference.   Activities during the conference:  The students made presentations for their papers, interacted with peers, and received crucial feedback on their research. The students also attended two keynote talks. On the first day of the conference, the PI held a research and career panel, where the travel grant awardees introduced the selected papers and commented on pros and cons of their research. Similarly, on the last day of the conference, an industrial panel was held to help student identify key areas in computer networks and performance evaluation of computer systems, which would offer interesting high-impact PhD topics. Finally, the PI and the conference technical program chairs actively helped introduce the students to leaders in the field and potential future employers.   Post conference activities: The students were encouraged to make presentations for the papers they discussed in the discussion forum and introduce the papers to their respective research groups.    Specifically, the award resulted in the following contributions:      Enabled students to: attend a key computer systems conference; interact with leaders in the field; present their research and gain feedback from peers; and receive mentoring and guidance in building a successful research career in computer systems. This field is growing and needs a cadre of new researchers and scientists. The conference travel opportunity provided by this project helps to train such future scientists.        The travel provided the students with an in-depth educational experience by giving them the opportunity to learn about the state-of-the-art in the field of computer networks and performance evaluation of computer systems.        The grant engaged students from underrepresented groups, especially women, to participate in a key computer systems conference event. Such activities are key in enabling students from underrepresented groups to be part of the computer systems research community.     Summary: The broader impacts of this project are the opportunities for the students to gain access to contacts with industry and labs, leading to opportunities for future work, including future internships. Additionally, we leverage excellent diversity programs in CS (CRA-W, VT MAOP, BPC) to encourage students from underrepresented groups to attend the conference. The opportunity affords students from US-based universities significant networking opportunities with a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
