<AbstractNarration>The U.S. has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in astronomy infrastructure in Chile, and continues to invest tens of millions of dollars more each year to operate federal telescopes.  One avenue that can foster strong relationships between the U.S.-funded observatories and local Chilean communities is an extensive public outreach effort. This award will support the Principal Investigator to organize and lead a Chile-U.S. Astronomy Education Outreach Summit as the next step to strengthening that partnership. The conference attendees will share best practices in astronomy education and outreach, with almost all of the major U.S.-funded observatories based in Chile taking part. In addition, personnel from Chilean educational and funding institutions will attend. The workshop will produce a 'roadmap' that describes the state of the art in astronomy education and public outreach, while at the same time identifying future needs. This roadmap will be used by the major U.S. astronomical facilities to guide their strategic planning. The resulting education and outreach activities will also be transferable to both the US and Chilean educational communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Chile-U.S. Astronomy Education Outreach Summit took place March 22 - 27, 2015, and brought together more than 50 participants (from 32 organizations) representing astronomy education and public outreach (EPO) professionals and stakeholders who design, direct, and implement EPO programs in Chile and the U.S., and who are responsible for policies that guide these programs.  In the next decade, over two-thirds of the world's telescope infrastructure will be located in Chile, representing an investment of billions of dollars and strong international collaboration, placing Chile on the worlds stage in this cutting-edge field.  In addition, astronomy is a rich and exciting area for public engagement, particularly with youth. It provides an opportunity for reaching national and international audiences via an iconic and inspiring field of exploration that encourages careers in science and promotes a science culture. Astronomy supports the interconnected nature of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education, the creation of new university degrees such as astroengineering, educational exchanges, and English language learning. The field has begun to contribute to wider economic and educational development in Chile, encouraging trade, public-private partnerships, dark skies stewardship, astrotourism and in Chile, and societyÃ†s identification with its clear skies as a natural laboratory unique in the world.  Against this background, the National Science Foundation (NSF), the U.S. observatories in Chile, Associated Universities Inc. (AUI), Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), the Carnegie Institution for Science, the United States Embassy, CONICYT, and Fundaci&oacute;n Imagen de Chile, have supported and promoted the Chile-U.S. Astronomy Education Outreach Summit. The initiative seeks to improve both the quantitative and qualitative impacts of astronomy education and outreach in Chile, and with its international partners, through better communication, coordination and collaboration among stakeholders in Chile and between these and other EPO entities abroad.  The Summit opened with presentations and work sessions in Santiago and then moved on to San Pedro de Atacama, home of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Observatory in Region II. It was intended that following the ALMA visit, the team would move on to La Serena. However, some of the worst flooding in northern Chile in 100 years closed airports and shut down roads, making travel impossible, forcing the group to remain in San Pedro for the duration of the Summit. Throughout the five-day event, participants attended meetings with locals, made a variety of presentations, visited ALMA, and most importantly engaged in many discussions about the current status and needs related to astronomy education and outreach in Chile, and between Chile and the U.S. and other international partners.  In the final two days of the Summit, participants identified five pillars that support astronomy education and outreach:  Education and the spread of astronomy in primary and      secondary schools The role of universities in astronomy EPO The role of professional observatories in astronomy EPO The role of astrotourism, municipal and touristic      observatories and amateur astronomers in astronomy EPO The role of planetariums and informal science centers      in astronomy EPO.   In addition, the group identified various thematic strands that cut across the five pillars, including metrics and evaluation, funding, professional development, and the role of government and the private sector.  Summit participants then broke out into five groups (pillars) to begin the development of a roadmap-like document that highlights the current status of astronomy education and outreach in Chile and current international collaborations, needs in Chile, and recommendations and areas of further exploration moving forward.
