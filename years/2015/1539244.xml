<AbstractNarration>The long-term ocean monitoring site 100 km north of Oahu, Hawaii known as station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment) has been the location of repeated observations since the late 1980¡¦s.  More recently, a deep-sea observatory, cabled to shore, was established near station ALOHA.  The ALOHA Cabled Observatory (ACO) was deployed in June 2011 and supports innovative scientific research at Station ALOHA. The ACO provides the ocean science community with essential infrastructure and access for sustained science at Station ALOHA, an oligotrophic (¡§desert¡¨) site representative of a large fraction of the global ocean. As the deepest operational cabled station, it enables the development, testing and operation for science of new ocean observing sensors and technology, from the abyss to the surface. ALOHA is one setting where it will be possible to connect the ocean from top to bottom, both literally and figuratively, to improve understanding so we can model and predict for human impacts biogeochemical and physical processes at all temporal and spatial scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past 27 years on a monthly schedule, the Hawai'i Ocean Time-series (HOT) project has been collecting ship-based oceanographic data; for the last 11 years, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) HOT Site (WHOTS) mooring has provided comprehensive meteorological and upper ocean data. These data together with those from many associated process studies form a unique, multivariate, long-term data set of the ocean state centered at one location. With the availability of relatively high power (1200 W), data bandwidth (100 Mb/s) and precise timing (1 ?Ýs), a basic suite of core observations, and a new remotely operated vehicle (ROV) coming on-line, the ACO can support new and innovative science studies, in their own right as well as to complement HOT and other Station ALOHA science. Science questions include: How much carbon is exported to pelagic depths, the benthos and the sediment? What governs nutrient injection events into the euphotic zone, and export events to the deeper sea? What are the coupled biological and physical details and impacts of mixing throughout the water column? What are the biological and physical energetics in the abyssal ocean? How well are infra-gravity wave models performing? How do marine mammal populations and behaviors change over time? Can passive acoustics be used to infer ocean temperature? What can we learn about tsunamis and seismic events from the bottom pressure? Addressing such challenging questions will require technology advances such as distributed bottom arrays and water column profiling moorings. This grant supports continued ACO operations and maintenance for the scientific community. Core instrumentation will be repaired, deployed, and maintained, including a second basic sensor package (pressure, fluorometer, and temperature/salinity). All data, including real time video and audio streams, are publically available. The ACO, the deepest operating cabled ocean observatory on our planet at 4728 m water depth, provides the infrastructure for new and exciting, globally relevant science and technology at ALOHA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ALOHA Cabled Observatory Continuing Operations and Maintenance  The ACO was deployed June 2011 to support scientific research at Station ALOHA, 100 km north of Oahu. At 4728 m, it is the deepest operating plug-and-play observatory outpost on the planet, operating now for more than 5 years. There have been three service cruises, one in November 2014 (added instruments and recovered one), a second one in September 2015 (an additional instrument package deployed; could not recover several failed instruments), and a third one in June 2018 (secondary node and hydrophone added, basic sensor package 1 recovered for repair and refurbishment, see Figure.  Several results highlight the need for continuous, sustained observations to detect rare episodic events:   Temperature data show 40 mK cold events, dynamic oscillations, and slow recovery (months to years. Oher data indicate an associated boundary layer with a scale height of about 100 m. These events are thought to be related to episodic cold overflows from a neighboring basin. Such events are likely occurring in many other abyssal locations with strong implications for climate studies.    Pressure and fluorescence/turbidity were added to the core measurements in 2015. There are events seen showing correlated high current speed and turbidity, indicating enough near bottom energy to stir up sediment. There has been one fluorescent event possibly correlated with a surface export event.   ACO pressure data were analyzed to reveal features associated with the passage of Hurricane Lester.   Small earthquake signals were analyzed to reveal new information about the oceanic crust in the vicinity.   The ACO pressure data are being streamed now to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, providing direct, realtime data for tsunami warning for Hawaii.  The ACO is providing continuous bottom ?essential ocean variable? data, specifically temperature, salinity, oxygen, velocity, and acoustics, complementing and extending the now-30 year, coarsely sampled (~monthly) Hawaii Ocean Timeseries data set.  All these data are freely and publicly available in near realtime via standard data servers (e.g., ftp and OPeNDAP).  The data services also allow collaborative programs to integrate the data.  As one example, the ACO data are presented on the Pacific Island Ocean Observing System (PacIOOS; a regional association of the Integrated Ocean Observing System) web portal and data viewer.  The ACO is a modest-scale and cost-effective cabled observatory that reuses a retired submarine telecommunication system, an outgrowth of decades of effort started by F.
