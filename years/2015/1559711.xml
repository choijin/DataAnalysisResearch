<AbstractNarration>CAREER: InN nanowire based multifunctional nanocantilever sensors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this CAREER research is to design, fabricate, and utilize InN nanowire (NW) based multifunctional V-shaped nanocantilever (VNC) sensors for detection of analyte molecules in ambient conditions, and investigation of electrical signal propagation in neurons. The approach to attain this goal involves: (i) Design, growth, and characterization of V-shaped InN NWs, (ii) Fabrication of VNC sensor arrays utilizing the V-shaped NWs, (iii) Investigation of structural and electromechanical properties of the VNCs, (iv) Multimodal molecular detection using the VNC sensors, and (v) Investigation of electrical signal propagation in neurons. Success of this project will lead to the development of technologies that can have overarching impacts in the diverse fields of defense, homeland security, environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, drug discovery, scanning probe microscopy, and neuro-medicine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The project activities are anticipated to lead to the development of a viable and inexpensive fabrication approach for NEMS sensors that at present relies heavily on expensive electron-beam or ion-beam lithography. The novel transduction method based on deflection induced gating offers an innovative solution that addresses the critical issues of scalability and large scale integration in MEMS based integrated circuits. The multimodal detection technique to be utilized in this project can significantly enhance the reliability of analyte detection scheme. With their small size, low power consumption, and high sensitivity, the VNC sensors can be easily integrated with emerging technologies such as energy harvesting and radio frequency identification devices giving rise to miniaturized next generation systems and components capable of working remotely over very long durations. The approach for the measurement of electrical signals in neurons using an array of VNC probes can lead to significant advancement of neurology and neuro-science, by opening up non-traditional means for rapid and nanoscale characterization of neuronal signal propagation in-vivo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In the educational and outreach activities, the PI plans to involve at least one undergraduate and one high school student to work on this project every year throughout its duration. Separately, he will also recruit one minority high school or undergraduate student to work on the project by participating in the SCAMP program of the university. The project activities entail collaborative and interdisciplinary research between one science and three engineering departments, which will significantly broaden the scientific and technical knowledge of all the students involved. The research results and activities will be disseminated to a broader audience through lectures in the South Carolina Citizen?s School of Nanotechnology program, development of a research website, and development of a graduate course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
