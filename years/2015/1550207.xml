<AbstractNarration>The Ocean Observing Initiative (OOI) Education and Public Engagement (EPE) Implementing Organization was established and tasked with bringing professionally collected, real and near real time data, images, and video of our Earth's oceans into both formal and informal learning environments and providing a new layer of cyber-interactivity for educators. In order to correctly focus development of educational tools, the PIs ran two front-end evaluation studies on the practices and teaching needs of the oceanographic community. While 73% of undergraduate professors said they use data in their classroom, only a small subset use real-time data with their students. Most importantly, it was determined that there is a need for further exploration into how to effectively integrate data into teaching and how to create data visualization tools that help undergraduate professors meet the demands of teaching 21st century science skills and practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to lead a workshop that will engage diverse institutions, including community colleges, Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), research laboratories, and larger research universities in an pilot intensive hands-on effort focused on developing effective teaching with data practices using OOI data assets and data visualizations tools. Participants will continue engagement virtually after the workshop as the workshop report and materials related to OOI are developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop Objectives:&lt;br/&gt;1) Crosswalk OOI Science themes presented in popular introductory textbooks used in oceanography courses. Partcipants will compare themes and concepts in the OOI scientific themes document and popular published textbooks to triangulate where OOI data investigations/activities can be woven into existing courses.&lt;br/&gt;2) Develop learning objectives and activity outlines of 5 data investigations (one per team) that could be developed when OOI data is available and accessible. &lt;br/&gt;3) Brainstorm with the teams how best to build a community of practice with long-term working relationships and collaborations on data investigation development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this workshop will make OOI data more accessible and useful for undergraduate education activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We successfully engaged undergraduate professors from diverse institutions, including community colleges, Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), research laboratories, and larger research universities in an pilot intensive hands-on workshop focused on developing effective teaching with data practices using Ocean Observing Initiative (OOI) data assets and data visualizations tools.  We completed a crosswalk of OOI themes with the most common Introduction to Oceanography (Dr. Al Trujillo, author) textbook used across the U.S.  The crosswalk document highlights connections between OOI data and the 16 chapters of the textbook.  We found that there were viable content overlaps in 14 of the 16 chapters in the Trujillo book.  This encourages the notion of using OOI to teach not only data skills, but oceanography content, using OOI resources.  We created a small community of practice among the ten undergraduate professors that attended the three day workshop.  We hope to build this community over time to develop effective practices and encourage community use of OOI resources in teaching.  Finally, we developed a series of seven activities on primary production using OOI data for presentation and piloting at the 10 undergraduate institutions.  These activities are prototypes for how data interactions can be structured for undergraduate audiences.  The format of each data activity is grounded around scaffolding students? engagement with the data towards a defined learning objective. Each begins with a Challenge Question to set the context for exploring the data. The student is then able to interact with the data before finding a more comprehensive description of Your Objective, including a Data Tip to assist in the interpretation. There are Interpretation &amp; Analysis Questions provided to facilitate the student?s ability to digest and make sense of the data based on the original question. Annotated images and resources are provided in the Background Information section for students to explore if they want more context for the data.
