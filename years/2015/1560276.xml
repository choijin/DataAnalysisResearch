<AbstractNarration>REU Site: Proactive Health Informatics&lt;br/&gt;The Proactive Health (ProHealth) Informatics Research Experience for Undergraduates site at Indiana University Bloomington will provide 10 undergraduate students with the opportunity to conduct research for 10 weeks with world-renown faculty members in the fields of human computer interaction, pervasive computing, machine learning, privacy, and technical policy. At least 5 of the undergraduate students will be from underrepresented groups, including first generation college students, and students who do not have access to research opportunities. The undergraduate students will have the opportunity to: (1) learn how to design and build new mobile or wearable health systems; (2) use the data collected from these systems to create personalized recommendations; (3) investigate possible privacy issues from collecting this data and propose solutions to protect one's privacy; or (4) understand the law implications for collecting, using, and storing this data. These projects can potentially improve the health of the broader United States population. Undergraduate researchers will learn how to: conduct ethical research; document their progress; represent themselves professionally online; prepare for graduate school; network in professional settings; appropriately disseminate one's findings through writing and presentation; and prepare oneself for future career opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The objective of the Proactive Health (ProHealth) Informatics REU Site is to train undergraduates from diverse backgrounds to become the next generation of researchers who design, develop, and evaluate intelligent, pervasive systems that empower lay people to proactively manage their health. Innovations include the design of new mobile or wearable health systems that integrate seamlessly into a person's life while providing appropriately shared, and valuable feedback. To this end, the interdisciplinary ProHealth team will  (1) train undergraduates to conduct cross-cutting computing research; (2) introduce students to graduate education and research career opportunities through preparatory workshops and one-on-one mentoring; (3) increase faculty and graduate student awareness of undergraduate research mentoring through Affinity Research Group model workshops; (4) provide opportunities for students to disseminate research results and faculty to disseminate best practices for mentoring; and (5) inspire middle and high school students to consider computing through REU panels and shadowing opportunities during computing-related summer camps.</AbstractNarration>

As evidence of this, 87%(26/30) of participants were from groups traditionally underrepresented in computing - 73% (22/30) women,&nbsp;37% (11/30) underrepresented minority groups, and 33% (10/30) first generation college students.&nbsp;ProHealth REU staff trained undergraduate students with limited research experiences - 56% (17/30) of students were from smaller liberal arts or commuter universities and 50% (15/30) completed their first or second year of undergraduate.<br /><br /></p> <p>ProHealth REU students conducted research for 10 weeks with a faculty and graduate student mentor to investigate topics around caregiving (for new mothers, older adults, and people with rare diseases); automated identification of drug-drug interactions; security data leaks for health applications; wearable and ambient sensing (on-body and within the home); bias in online physician reviews; navigating grief; identifying risk factors in cardiovascular disease; and environmental sensing impact on health. ProHealth REUs and affiliated ProHealth REUs contributed to six full conference papers - including 3 highly competitive conferences and a best paper award. In addition, they presented 3 workshop papers and placed in the ACM Undergraduate Research Competition at SIGCHI (2017 - 2nd place and 2018 - top 5).&nbsp;ProHealth REUs&nbsp;and mentors have been recognized for their academic, research, and service contributions by receiving two&nbsp;NSF Graduate Research Fellowships (graduate mentor; ProHealth REU), IU Bloomington Provost&rsquo;s Office&rsquo;s Undergraduate&nbsp;Research and Creativity Award (ProHealth REU Affiliate), 2018 Barry Goldwater Scholarship HonorableMention (ProHealth REU), IU CEWiT Outstanding Mentor (faculty mentor), and NCWIT Undergraduate Research Mentor (faculty mentor).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to regular mentoring, ProHealth REU students attended weekly workshops to learn about research, professional development, and graduate education opportunities. At the end of the summer, ProHealth REU students had completed a research paper, poster, presentation, personal web presence, video overview of their project, and many artifacts associated with each research project. During pre- and post-interviews with ProHealth REUs, external evaluators found that REU students&rsquo; experience helped them: (1) learn about new fields in computing that they otherwise had not been exposed to (e.g., human computer interaction, machine learning, and health informatics); (2) mature in their understanding of research from&nbsp;a &ldquo;solve a problem&rdquo; mentality to a collaborative, iterative process; and (3) become enthusiastic about conducting research to improve the world.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p> <p>Mentors met every two weeks during the summer to discuss the Affinity Research Group model, review external evaluator feedback, and discuss how to improve the research training and professional development experience of students. During a &ldquo;normal week,&rdquo; most mentors spent 2 hours advising REU students, 2-3 hours mentoring graduate students on how to advise undergraduates, and an hour prepping for these meetings. All mentors said that their time was well spent.</p> <p>ProHealth REU students thoroughly enjoyed engaging and giving back to the community.&nbsp;In three years, the ProHealth REU group conducted outreach with over 400 children - almost 300 from&nbsp;underrepresented groups in computing to teach them about electronic prototyping. Each year, the ProHealth REU site collaborated with the Girl Scouts of Central Indiana to teach a paper circuits and soldering session. They also worked with IU School of Informatics Computing and Engineering to teach over a 100 students each summer about paper circuits.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition, ProHealth REU site participants engaged older adults in a 1-day, 2 hour workshop at IU MiniU. The REU students prototyped a session in Summer 2017 to great enthusiasm by all involved. In post workshop surveys administered by IU MiniU, older adult students commented, &ldquo;More classes like this would be a welcome change&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wonderful helpers and terrific faculty, totally fun and awesome!&rdquo; Likewise, REU students reflected in blogs, &ldquo;We did a class for Mini U and I wish it was an all day event... I had 4 fabulous ladies at my table and they were having a blast creating their cards.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Today was Mini University!
