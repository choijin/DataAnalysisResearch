<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Structural role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in promoting recombination&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is well recognized that the linear arrangement of C, G, A, and T of DNA defines the genetic code of a cell. We also now recognize that, beyond this linear sequence, modifications to the DNA bases can also be transferred from the parent to affect how this code is interpreted in daughter cells; this is the epigenetic code. Methylation is a well-studied epigenetic marker, but the oxidation of methyl groups on cytosine, to form hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) constitutes a less common, but no less important epigenetic marker. This project aims to determine how 5hmC affects the three-dimensional structure of DNA at the atomic level, to affect recombination,&lt;br/&gt;The process by which genetic information is transferred between chromosomes in eukaryotic cells (including human cells), between a virus and its host, and to repair damaged DNAs. The results from this project will have significant impact on our understanding of epigenetic markers and their biological functions. The potential economic impact is that this understanding will allow the design of new technologies to introduce genes into biological systems by promoting more efficient mechanisms for recombination.  The project will, in addition, impact the science literacy and the training of high school students in the STEM areas by bringing hands-on experiences to the classroom of local high schools and bringing high school students onto the Colorado State University campus. A diverse cadre of graduate students will also  be trained in a STEM field.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) has recently seen renewed interests as the "6th" base of the genome. The function of 5hmC has generally been recognized as being an intermediate in the demethylation of 5-methylcytosine; however, recent mapping of 5hmC occurrence across genomes suggests that the modified base serves as an epigenetic marker and affects transcription in a tissue dependent manner. In addition, evidence suggests that 5hmC promotes recombination in vitro and in vivo, through a pathway dependent on the general nucleotide cutting enzyme endonuclease G (EndoG). The project will test the hypothesis that 5hmC plays a structural role by stabilizing a recombination intermediate (the four stranded DNA Holliday junction), which can provide specificity to EndoG, even though the enzyme does not appear to discriminate between 5hmC-modified and unmodified DNAs. The goal of this project is to test a model that 5hmC stabilizes Holliday junctions in inverted repeat sequences, thereby providing a stable intermediate for EndoG to bind and cut. The aims to achieve this goal are: Aim 1) crystallographic and calorimetric studies to determine the effects of 5hmC-modification on the structure and thermodynamic stability of DNA Holliday junctions; Aim 2) biochemical studies to determine the structural context and mechanism by which EndoG recognizes 5hmC-modifications in DNA; and Aim 3) biochemical studies to determine whether 5hmC-modifications pauses the junction to allow site specific cutting by EndoG.</AbstractNarration>
