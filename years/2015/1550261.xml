<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for an NSF and German Research Foundation workshop to foster collaborative research between the United States and Germany. Both the United States and Germany have vibrant manufacturing sectors, pervasive technology proliferation, and high wages. Both countries rank among the world leaders for technological sophistication, high technology product development and advanced manufacturing activity. Both countries have strong support for scientific and engineering research, and there are significant overlap and synergies between the funded research portfolios. While there are potential areas for collaboration, there are few venues where research topics that are mutually beneficial can be identified. This workshop will discuss mechanisms of collaborations between the United States and Germany in manufacturing research, and recommendations for the roles NSF and German Research Foundation can play in fostering such collaborations. Results of this workshop can also be useful to fostering collaborations between the two countries in other fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held in Bonn, Germany, February 10-12, 2016. About 15-20 advanced manufacturing researchers from each country will participate in the workshop. The objectives of the workshop are to: (1) examine research needs in advanced manufacturing across a range of technologies; (2) identify needs, gaps and challenges facing advanced manufacturing; (3) identify best practices of collaborations between the United States and Germany in manufacturing; (4) formulate recommendations for future joint research initiatives; (5) provide a forum for researchers from the United States and Germany to network and develop future collaborations; and (6) identify administrative / organizational / structural challenges for international collaborations observed by researchers in both countries.</AbstractNarration>
