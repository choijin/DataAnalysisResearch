<AbstractNarration>Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program (I-Corps L), this project will develop ways to increase the scale and impact of University Innovation Fellows (UIF) program at Stanford University. In higher education, there is widespread interest in developing ways to provide students with the knowledge, skills and attitudes that they need to solve complex problems of the 21st century. The University Innovation Fellows program prepares and empowers university students to make lasting changes at their schools to address this issue. Through UIF, student leaders collaborate with faculty and administrators to promote and embed innovation, entrepreneurship and design thinking to enhance the educational experience of all students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there is no single prescription for which strategies and activities will be effective in higher education, each institution can develop context-appropriate strategies based on understanding best practices, information about what has worked and not worked in similar institutions, and innovative thinking. The University Innovation Fellows (UIF) program offers faculty a way to activate selected students to work alongside them in expanding the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem on campus. The program combines online experiential training with in-person gatherings in Silicon Valley. In the training, university students evaluate the landscape of learning opportunities and resources at their schools, and design a strategic plan to transform and enrich that landscape, by leveraging experiential learning techniques. Students who successfully complete the training (and become Fellows) are motivated and prepared to work alongside faculty as change agents. This program will provide year-round support for the Fellows via webinars and networking tools that allow students to share strategies across institutions.</AbstractNarration>

However, integrating them into the existing structures and curricula -- or radically changing the existing models -- is stymied by the slow pace of change in academia. The University Innovation Fellows (UIF) is an innovative program empowers students to accelerate change, in collaboration with faculty and administrators, by expanding the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem at their schools. Over the past 5 years, 1,000 students from 185 institutions have undergone a custom training that combines experiential online learning with in-person events, preparing them to understand the landscape of learning opportunities available at their schools and giving them tools -- such as design thinking, lean startup and custom systems thinking frameworks -- to craft and lead strategic projects that will make a difference in the experience of their peers. Evaluation results showed a statistically significant increase in the innovation self-efficacy of the students that went through the UIF training. Fellows create opportunities on campus both to expose (e.g., TEDx, lectures, and workshops) and to engage (e.g., hackathons and competitions) their peers in I&amp;E and design thinking. The data shows that Fellows have affected campus environments by engaging students as well as initiating sustainable institutional change, including the creation of new learning opportunities like courses and programs, as well as attracting new funding streams and physical infrastructure.
