<AbstractNarration>Additive biomanufacturing is the process of printing 3D living constructs where stem cells interface with biomaterials. A key manufacturing challenge is establishing control of the printed biomaterial constructs to prevent stem cell differentiation. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for advancing the control of an additive biomanufacturing process (far-field melt electrospin writing). Research results will lead to producing engineered tissue constructs for regenerative medicine and, therefore, impact the health sector and competitiveness of the US biomanufacturing sector. This award also supports engineering education by integrating 3D printing into the undergraduate curriculum, introducing high school students to advanced manufacturing, and broadening participation of underrepresented groups in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a far-field melt electrospin writing process, a polymer material is drawn from a needle to a collector plate, and the processed polymer from the needle tip constitutes the charged fiber. The temperature differential between the needle tip and the plate is defined as temperature gradient; and it affects fiber deformation (that determines fiber diameter) and electrostatic repulsion between fibers (that, through relative alignment of multiple fibers, determines pore size in a 3D polymer construct). A construct with microscale fiber diameters and pore sizes can facilitate confinement of stem cells to prevent stem cells from differentiation. The first research objective is to understand effects of temperature gradient on fiber deformation and electrostatic repulsion between fibers. A multi-physics model (coupling polymer rheology and electrostatics) will be developed to predict effects of temperature gradient on fiber deformation and electrostatic repulsion. The second objective is to establish relationships between fiber deformation and fiber diameter, and between electrostatic repulsion and pore size. Scanning electron microscopy will be used to measure mean fiber diameter and pore size in an electrospun construct. The third objective is to understand effects of fiber diameter and pore size on 3D stem cell confinement. A geometrical-based model will be developed to predict effects of confined 3D focal adhesion site distribution (point contacts between electrospun fibers and colonized cells) on stem cell function. Experiments will be conducted to colonize stem cells on the electrospun constructs, and the focal adhesion distribution will be measured using atomic force microscopy and fluorescent confocal microscopy. Immunochemistry of stem cell surface markers will be conducted to confirm stem cell confinement.</AbstractNarration>
