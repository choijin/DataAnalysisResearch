<AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholars who work with manuscript materials encounter numerous difficulties beyond the obvious fact that handwriting can be difficult and ambiguous to read. The problem of dating the different stages of composition is often a significant issue, as in the case of early modern scientific and technological manuscripts, which were often separated or even dismembered and reassembled after the author?s death, as with the papers of Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo Galilei, Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton, to name just a few. A solution to the problems posed by dating large manuscript corpora would therefore be of benefit to researchers in many areas scholarship, not to mention librarians and museum workers. The present proposal aims to use Isaac Newton?s very large manuscript Nachlass as a platform for exploring multiple techniques, including computational techniques and others, for dating manuscripts and for assessing them in combination with one another.  In addition to providing important historical information that will enable scholars to come to grips with the chronological development of Newton?s chymical corpus, which is of substantial public interest as well as of scholarly interest, the tools and approaches that are to be used in this project will be transportable to all other projects that contain undated manuscript material in any field of inquiry, not just the history of science. A final impact of the proposal will be to further public awareness of Newton?s chymical research, an area that will help to stimulate interest in science in an audience that ranges from K-12 students up to professionals with widely diverse intellectual interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The techniques that are to be used in this project include comparison of parallel passages generated automatically by a barrage of computational techniques (e.g. Latent Semantic Analysis and Topic Modeling), spectro-metric analysis of inks and papers by Raman spectroscopy, comparison of watermarks by means of the latest imaging technologies, tracking of developments in orthography and handwriting, and the systematic study of citations, facilitated by the production of an authoritative electronic bibliography with hyperlinks to the citations in texts. In addition to applying these multiple techniques, the project will follow an integrative approach to assessing the data generated by them. In order to achieve this result, the project will use network graph analysis to produce visual clusters of manuscripts and passages whose respective chronological markers correlate with one another. Correlations generated by independent test-runs employing different techniques (e.g. ink-analysis and watermark-analysis) will then be compared to one another, using image graphs. In cases where a clean overlay of graphs does not result, team members will revisit the data and determine the cause of the poor ?fit.? Metrical techniques will also be developed for determining the degree of agreement that constitutes good versus poor fit. The result will be a model for determining relative chronology of the parts within large textual corpora that will be transportable to other projects.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Perhaps more than any other single figure, Isaac Newton is responsible for the creation of modern science.&nbsp; Newton co-discovered calculus with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. He was the first person to truly quantify the universal law of gravity. He also was the first person to determine that white light is actually an unaltered mixture of spectral colors. These were all radically new discoveries that completely transformed science, and in the process of that transformation profoundly altered culture and society at large.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet there are also important reasons for studying Newton?s papers beyond his massive historical influence.&nbsp;&nbsp; The celebrated scientist left a huge corpus of unedited papers that were largely unavailable to scholars until they were sold at auction in 1936.&nbsp; Auctioned by Sotheby?s in that year, the Newton manuscripts contain about a million words on alchemy and some four million words on religious topics, mostly in his own handwriting.&nbsp; The collection extended chronologically from his youth up until his maturity and beyond in the early eighteenth century.&nbsp; Nor is this all that we have in Newton?s hand: he left copious letters that have been collected in the seven volumes of his <em>Correspondence</em>, and many drafts of his scientific papers survive in the Portsmouth Collection at Cambridge University.&nbsp; &nbsp;Much of this material is undated, consisting of drafts that Newton made for his personal use.&nbsp; Because of its volume and its chronological scope (extending over some seventy years from Newton?s teenage years in the 1650s up to his death in 1727), Newton?s <em>Nachlass</em> makes an ideal platform for developing and testing methods of dating manuscripts.&nbsp; The goal of the present project was to work out a systematic battery of assays for chronological markers using the most up-to-date technologies.&nbsp; Since the dating of handwritten documents is a problem that plagues scholars over the entire spectrum of historical studies, our project has the potential of facilitating scholarship in a wide variety of disciplines and periods.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this project, we identified all the citations in our online edition of Newton?s alchemical manuscripts and then tracked down the published and manuscript sources that Newton cited. Some of these results are presented in PI Newman?s recent book <em>Newton the Alchemist </em>(Princeton University Press, 2019), but there is much more to come.&nbsp; We are creating an online authoritative bibliography of his sources with entries for each source with dates and any links to reproductions of the sources, and in the documents, we added links at every citation to their respective source in the bibliography. (See Figure 1.) When finished, we will have a linked network of Newton?s citations and sources in the documents that will help researchers study Newton?s use of sources as they read through the online documents.</p> <p>We also made significant progress in the analysis of Newton?s watermarks during this project, combining careful surveys of Newton?s paper by Shapiro (late 1980s) and PI Newman into a data store we can process computationally. We have already used watermark evidence to infer dates of composition for some undated manuscripts that share watermarks with dated manuscripts. (See Figure 2.)

These measurements open the door to an ultra-close machine reading of the text which can track shared sentences fragments and phrases to sketch out in a gross way some historical arcs in Newton?s written use of sources and ideas across different sets of the alchemical manuscripts. (See Figures 3, and 4.)</p> <p>We are also learning to use XRF spectrometry to analyze iron-gall inks with seventeenth-century correspondence at the Lilly Library, and have been able to show that we can identify different inks on the same paper, that we can detect and follow the same ink on successive letters even when the paper changes, and recognize when a single correspondent changes the ink he or she is using in a dated sequence. (See Figures 5 and 6). XRF data adds another, very useful layer of information.</p> <p>In sum, we are tracking and integrating the separate documentable threads of Newton?s effort to write about alchemy over the generation that he spent on the subject. When assembled, the separate threads will complement one another and provide us with a much clearer picture of the chronological development of his <em>oeuvre</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/07/2019<br>      Modified by: William&nbsp;R&nbsp;Newman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180184374_Figure-1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180184374_Figure-1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180184374_Figure-1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bibliographic pop-ups and authoritative bibliography entry</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wallace Hooper and William Newman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">William&nbsp;R&nbsp;Newman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180269578_Figure-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180269578_Figure-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180269578_Figure-2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Watermark details</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wallace Hooper and William Newman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">William&nbsp;R&nbsp;Newman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180363010_Figure-3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180363010_Figure-3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180363010_Figure-3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Latent Semantic Analysis Tool</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wallace Hooper and William Newman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">William&nbsp;R&nbsp;Newman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180453387_Figure-4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180453387_Figure-4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180453387_Figure-4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Network Graph Analysis</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wallace Hooper and William Newman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">William&nbsp;R&nbsp;Newman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180530186_Figure-5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180530186_Figure-5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180530186_Figure-5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">XRF of Albeville Collection</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wallace Hooper and William Newman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">William&nbsp;R&nbsp;Newman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 5</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180614587_Figure-6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180614587_Figure-6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 6"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1556864/1556864_10417705_1565180614587_Figure-6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 6"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Survey of Iron-Gall Ink Components</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wallace Hooper and William Newman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">William&nbsp;R&nbsp;Newman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 6</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Perhaps more than any other single figure, Isaac Newton is responsible for the creation of modern science.  Newton co-discovered calculus with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. He was the first person to truly quantify the universal law of gravity. He also was the first person to determine that white light is actually an unaltered mixture of spectral colors. These were all radically new discoveries that completely transformed science, and in the process of that transformation profoundly altered culture and society at large.   Yet there are also important reasons for studying Newton?s papers beyond his massive historical influence.   The celebrated scientist left a huge corpus of unedited papers that were largely unavailable to scholars until they were sold at auction in 1936.  Auctioned by Sotheby?s in that year, the Newton manuscripts contain about a million words on alchemy and some four million words on religious topics, mostly in his own handwriting.  The collection extended chronologically from his youth up until his maturity and beyond in the early eighteenth century.  Nor is this all that we have in Newton?s hand: he left copious letters that have been collected in the seven volumes of his Correspondence, and many drafts of his scientific papers survive in the Portsmouth Collection at Cambridge University.   Much of this material is undated, consisting of drafts that Newton made for his personal use.  Because of its volume and its chronological scope (extending over some seventy years from Newton?s teenage years in the 1650s up to his death in 1727), Newton?s Nachlass makes an ideal platform for developing and testing methods of dating manuscripts.  The goal of the present project was to work out a systematic battery of assays for chronological markers using the most up-to-date technologies.  Since the dating of handwritten documents is a problem that plagues scholars over the entire spectrum of historical studies, our project has the potential of facilitating scholarship in a wide variety of disciplines and periods.
