<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help owners and operators of commercial and institutional buildings to improve resource allocation by analyzing data from built infrastructure to enable smarter decision-making supported by detailed, measureable, real-time knowledge. By automatically integrating building information that is stored using various software applications and formats, this innovation enables owners and facilities managers to efficiently search for information and respond to emergency and failures, and proactively plan for operation and maintenance tasks. This innovation also applies artificial intelligence to automatically conduct big data analysis and identify opportunities to improve energy efficiency and operating performance of assets and indoor environment. Organizations can not only save operating budget by reducing equipment failures and energy waste, but also improve the quality of life and productivity for occupants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at developing middleware technology to automatically integrate and analyze both structured and unstructured data from facilities design and operations. Facilities maintenance and operating is the longest phase in the life-cycle of buildings, accounting for more than 60% of the total cost of ownership. Owners and facilities managers are faced with the challenges of efficiently managing aging and crowded building infrastructure to extend the life of assets and control costs. However, fragmented and under-analyzed building information results in most maintenance work being conducted reactively to address problems that have already caused significant loss or waste. The vision of this innovation is to develop a fully commercialized software package to enable facilities managers to be more proactive in improving building occupant comfort, aligning limited resources where they have the most significant impact, and reducing wasted energy through optimized mechanical controls. This project aims to demonstrate the conceptual feasibility of using big data analytics and machine learning to revolutionize facilities operating and maintenance decisions. The results from this applied research will include algorithms and methods to combine structured data with field collected unstructured data into qualitative and quantitative output appropriate for improved decision making.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTRODUCTION  LeanFM is transforming facility managers? access to mission-critical information and provides decision-support insights that save thousands of work hours per year and drive dramatic new efficiencies in facility operations. LeanFM utilizes a state of the art 3D visualization to simplify access and utility of facility operational data and insights using an interactive building view.  Facility maintenance crews spend up to 2 hours with every task searching for information. Urgent work takes longer than it should, backlogs grow, costly breakdowns become more common and thousands of work hours wasted each year. At the same time, facility managers struggling with fragmented and under-analyzed data are unable to predict failures or optimize preventive care based on asset condition or resource performance. As such, facilities predominantly operate in a reactive mode, addressing problems that have already caused significant loss or waste (at least $78.5B in the US alone).  SBIR PHASE 1 &ndash; CHALLENGE AND OPPORTUNITY  In this project, we originally proposed to demonstrate the conceptual feasibility of using big data analytics and machine learning to improve facility operations and maintenance decisions, enabling a more efficient and sustainable approach to facility management. However, after conducting two pilot studies, we identified a critical challenge associated with the quality of facilities operational data needed to drive data analytics forward.  This critical challenge needed to be addressed first before any data analytics could be performed.  The data challenge - Basic information, such as assets, problems and resolutions within maintenance history records, are needed to assess and predict condition of various building assets.  However, in most of the cases, such critical information is missing in maintenance databases. This is due to lack of standards for documenting information, data fragmentation across facility management systems and lack of structured building information. In order to address the prevalent data challenges that inhibit automated analyses, this project investigated big data analytics technologies (e.g., natural language processing) to automatically process unstructured data in maintenance records.  PATH TO INNOVATION - THE DATA ENRICHMENT CHALLENGE  We developed a set of algorithms based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically recognize information about asset (e.g. pump, elevator), problem (e.g. leak, noisy, outage), type of work (e.g. repair, inspect, replace), and location of maintenance tasks from work-order descriptions and spatial analyses algorithms to provide context to work-orders and enable the development of an analytics framework that would transform facilities operations to efficient, proactive and sustainable practices.  We explored the use of named entity recognition (NER) an NLP function that aims to classify words within text into categories such as type of asset, problem, or work. We found that Supervised NER requires a wide coverage of training data to increase accuracy of results however; it is impractical to manually define all possible terms people may use. Unsupervised NER is able to automatically learn new terms from available text however; currently there is no solution suitable for the facility management domain that can address work-order descriptions.  THE DATA ENRICHMENT ENGINE - BREAKTHROUGH  First, we developed a method for automatic classification of terms that would produce NER training data using a semantically-rich data repository of building entities and their relationships commonly used in architecture and construction. The results proved the approach as highly effective as per the table below.      Information   item     Precision    Recall     F1   Score       Asset type     0.91    0.28     0.43       Asset   name    0.82    0.21    0.33      Space    0.89    0.71    0.79      Location    0.85    0.44    0.58                     However, we concluded that this approach is not good enough to produce accurate models to support investment and resource allocation decisions.  We have moved to develop a guided sample selection approach instead of randomly picking the training data set, leveraging maintenance history records to prioritize terms in the training data so that terms that show highest F1 score gains are chosen first. This method proved to work!  With this new approach integrating multiple data sources to produce an automated training data set, we were able to develop NER algorithms suited for facility operational data and produce enriched, accurate data for future analyses. The primary image attached shows the extent we were able to enrich work-order data.  DATA ANALYTICS ENGINE &ndash; FEASIBILITY AND VALUE ASSESSMENT With the enriched data approach now proven effective, proceeded to validate our approach and data. We worked with facility managers to define high impact use cases and tested one such use case that would identify preventive maintenance optimization opportunities. We integrated work-order data such as planned vs. completed preventive maintenance with our reactive maintenance history enriched data such as type of asset and type of work. The enriched data proved extremely valuable in exposing preventive maintenance outliers and patterns that can potentially direct decisions to more efficient resource utilization and prolonged asset life. We demonstrated the significance of data and information-driven decision-making and the need for accurate enriched data that would enable it.
