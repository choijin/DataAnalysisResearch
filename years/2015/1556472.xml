<AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the impact of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe on twentieth century Anglophone plant morphology and biology. The researcher proposes to visit four archives to complete archival and rare book research: the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation in Pittsburgh, the Newnham College Archives at the University of Cambridge in England, the University of St. Andrews Special Collections in Scotland, and the Rudolf Steiner House Library in London. In addition to enhancing our understanding of the history of biology, the results of this project will provide a context for and exposure to different aspects of morphology for those working with morphology in education and design settings. STEM educational institutions have used morphology to encourage environmental stewardship. Morphology also has significant implications in the design sciences, particularly for biomimicry. By reaching out to educators, designers, and the broader public through lectures, a blog, and conferences, the significance of the research proposed under this grant would have a broad impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project contributes to the historical literature on science in three ways. It examines the role of scientific alienation in our understanding of the Goethean tradition within plant morphology and beyond. This will add to discussions of scientific literacy and cultural engagement with science as the concept of scientific alienation engages with the experiences of those who make claims of being marginalized as they seek to engage with scientific knowledge and practices. In addition, it examines traditionally trained and amateur scientists who engaged with Goethe's science and used his concepts to critique scientific norms and explore the relation of science to other areas of society. Finally, it shows how scientists often engage audiences at the fringe of the scientific community and well beyond it. Specifically, Goethe's scientific and larger cultural heritage in the twentieth century Anglophone world engaged with the core literature of environmental movements. Together, these themes exhibit how Goethe's reception and twentieth century morphology may be fruitful for other areas of research being pursued by historians of science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project enabled archival, manuscript, and rare book research in support of Co-PI Andre Hahn?s dissertation on the impact of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe thought on twentieth-century Anglophone morphology and plant science.  Themes included interdisciplinary collaborations between the plant sciences and mathematics and the role of popular biology as a means to circumvent institutional and professional norms.  The English botanist Agnes Arber, the Scottish naturalist and classicist D?Arcy Thompson, the English mathematicians and botanists George Kaufmann Adams and Olive Whicher, the English biologist Rupert Sheldrake, and faculty at the Nature Institute in New York constituted major research foci.  Major activities accomplished included conducting research at the Rudolf Steiner Archiv and Goetheanum Archiv in Dornach,  Switzerland. The Co-PI also conducted research in  several college archives at Cambridge University, England, for materials relating to Agnes Arber, George Kaufmann Adams, and Rupert Sheldrake.  In Scotland, the Co-PI examined  archives at the University of St. Andrews and the Zoological Museum at the University of Dundee for materials relating to D?Arcy Thompson and Agnes Arber.  In London, the Co-PI examined materials at the Rudolf Steiner House.  Additionally, he interviewed Rupert Sheldrake.  In New York, the Co-PI conducted research at the Schiller Library, the archives of the Threefold Educational Center in Chestnut Ridge, the Rudolf Steiner Library in Hudson, and interviewed faculty of the Nature Institute.   The Co-PI presented his findings at Oregon State University Biology Graduate Student Symposium held at Newport, Oregon and the Three Societies Meeting of the British Society for the History of Science, the Canadian Society for the History and Philosophy of Science, and the History of Science Society held in Edmonton, Alberta.  He also attended the conference on Mathematical Biography: A Mactutor Celebration at University   of St. Andrews, Scotland.  The Co-PI also discussed his research and archival findings with presenters and attendees at these three conferences.
