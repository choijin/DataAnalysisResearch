<AbstractNarration>In response to the fact that faculty at institutions of higher education across the nation continue to seek evidence-based reforms to improve student learning and retention in STEM disciplines, the PIs have designed a distinctive approach to incorporating active learning in large-enrollment, general and organic chemistry courses.  The project will replace traditional lectures through the implementation of new, on-line pre-lecture modules that will be linked to active in-class experiences and lab experiments.  The project will also expand the library of socially relevant, case-based learning materials that have been produced by the PIs through prior NSF support.  This approach, which integrates the Science Education for New Civic Engagements and Responsibilities (SENCER) philosophy of focusing on topics of significance to the community, has the potential to be attractive to students who are traditionally under-represented in the sciences. Moreover, the successful implementation of these new resources in large-enrollment courses could influence the way that a broad range of introductory STEM courses are taught at the college-level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Organic Chemistry I and II sequence, complementary in-class and pre-class materials on molecular bonding, stereochemistry, and spectroscopy will be designed for lecture and lab courses.  Previously developed general chemistry cases will be adapted and new ones will be designed to fit the blended learning format.  SENCER topics, woven throughout both classes, will include energy storage and production, chirality and the origins of life, and medicinal chemistry/drug design among others.  Formative and summative evaluation will investigate the effectiveness of the project in terms of increasing student interest in science, positively impacting student learning gains, and raising the success rates of students in gateway introductory chemistry courses.  In-class materials will be published through the national Center for Case Study Teaching in Science while the pre-lecture modules will be made available on the institution's chemistry case study website.  Project outcomes will be disseminated through submission to the Journal of Chemical Education or the Journal of College Science Teaching.</AbstractNarration>
