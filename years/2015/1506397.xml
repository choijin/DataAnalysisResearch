<AbstractNarration>Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. DAMA at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy is the only experiment claiming a discovery of dark matter interactions from their observation of a predicted annual modulation of the signal rate. Recent results from some experiments (CoGeNT, CRESST, and CDMS-Si) may support the light WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) interpretation, while others do not (KIMS-CsI, LUX, and XENON-100, among others). Only an experiment using NaI(Tl) can perform a model-independent test. The SABRE (Sodium-iodide with Active Background REjection) experiment would shed light on this debate and thus direct future direct-detection searches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SABRE project provides ample opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers to gain experience and training for careers in the scientific community. SABRE is consulting with the Princeton Teacher Preparation Program office to discuss potential ways to provide additional educational and professional development opportunities for local high-school students and teachers. The SABRE project engenders strong relationships between industry and academia. Their partnerships with industry enable the development of new technologies, products, and measurement techniques that will be made available to the research and industrial market at large. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SABRE R&amp;D effort, funded by this award, aims to provide a proof-of-principle for such a detector by developing NaI(Tl) detectors with lower backgrounds and a lower energy threshold than DAMA. Progress has been made in producing highly pure NaI powders that now exhibit impurities at a similar level to, or lower than, the final crystals in DAMA. The potential for further purification has been demonstrated by their crystal grower with zone-refining.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the SABRE experiment is to test the validity of the DAMA-LIBRA experiment that claims detection of a dark matter signal with sodium iodide crystals. This award supported the first step of this goal, namely,  to demonstrate the capability to grow sodium iodide scintillation crystals with very low internal radioactivity and to develop an external  liquid scintillator veto for additional background suppression for a full-scale experimental test of the validity of the DAMA-LIBRA result. The duration of the grant period included the first production of a 2-kg NaI(Tl) crystal with a lowest  level of potassium ever achieved (9 ppb), the main crystal background, which was measured by sensitive mass spectroscopy.    The NaI(Tl) crystal was produced with  special high purity Astrograde sodium iodide powder of Sigma Aldrich.  Princeton developed procedures to achieve low background, including a pre-treatment of the powder and a special ultra-clean crucible in which to grow the crystal. The crystal was then grown in collaboration with Radiation Monitoring Devices (RMD) company.  A direct confirmation of low backghround by direct counting of radiation signals in the crystal, shielded with the liquid scintillator veto, is the remaining "proof-of-principle" requirement for a full-scale SABRE experimental test the DAMA-LIBRA claim.    The research achieved during the grant report period concentrated on two goals: (1) The construction of the complete crystal-liquid scintillato veto detector system in the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy for direct counting of radioactivity in the crystals, and (2) growth of larger crystals with low internal radioactive background.    The full detector consists of a 2-ton active liquid scintillator detector in which the sealed crystal-photomultiplier tube modules are placed, all of which is surrounded by passive external shielding.   A data acquisition system records signals from the crystal and the liquid scintillator. Background from radioactivity in the crystal and from radiation sources external to the crystal is rejected by detection of coincident signals in the crystal and liquid scintillator.    The vessel for the liquid scintillator veto and the associated photomultiplier tubes and data acquisition (DAQ) electronics were developed at Princeton and shipped to LNGS in this period. The scintillator vessel is now in Hall C of LNGS being set up with external passive shielding. The DAQ electronics and software developed by Princeton is  at LNGS and operational. The scintillator fluid handling system has been designed and installation will begin soon.  A full Monte Carlo simulation of the background has been carried out with all radioactiove sources in the detector and in shielding materials included.   The crystal background, with the liquid scintillator operating in anti-coincident mode, is predicted to be 0.15 cpd/kg/keV.  The total background from all sources in the same mode is 0.22 cpd/kg/keV, which is about 5 times lower than the background achieved in DAMA-LIBRA.  The sensitivity of a 50-kg SABRE detector with the current background estimates shows that the signal of DAMA-LIBRA can be checked with high confidence (~5 sigma) in 3 years of running, and possibly in less time, or with smaller crystal mass,  if the crystal radioactivity is reduced.    During the reporting period of this award the development of the crystals has progressed.  Using Astrograde powder, RMD produced a 4.5 kg crystal which is suitable for direct counting tests.  More crystal growths and direct counting measurements of crystal radioactivity in the liquid scintillator veto are planned for summer 2018.
