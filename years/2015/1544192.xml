<AbstractNarration>Creating and retaining a robust workforce of highly-skilled engineers is very important for sustaining and improving the United States and global economies, which are increasingly reliant on technical innovation that comes from the field of engineering.  Equally important is the development of highly ethical and professional standards within this group of innovative practitioners. The School of Engineering at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) has formulated a well-balanced liberal arts core integrated with a solid and robust engineering curricular sequence that promises to: (1) improve the retention of engineering students, (2) instill highly ethical and professional standards throughout the four years of the engineering curriculum, and (3) for alumni: a) inspire and strongly encourage them to enhance their engineering knowledge and skills, and b) strive for setting challenging professional goals and achieving them in a timely manner. The architects of this curriculum model have joined forces with faculty from the Department of Sociology to construct the necessary surveying tools and procedures for a comprehensive examination of the degree of effectiveness and the timing of the different interventions and reinforcements built into this promising model. The findings from these evaluations would enable this multi-disciplinary research team to develop a much deeper understanding for further calibration of this curriculum for optimal results. The techniques, surveying tools, and procedures used for conducting this two-year study, along with a summary of the results, will be made available at the national level for potential adoption, examination of similar models, and future collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School of Engineering at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ), in close collaboration with faculty from the Department of Sociology, has initiated a research program that assesses the effectiveness of a liberal arts core program combined with a strong vertical engineering professional sequence on the professional formation of engineering students.  In this study, the multi-disciplinary team examines the influence of a number of curricular and extracurricular education interventions such as engineering-specific ethics case studies, lessons on professional licensure, interaction with alumni through a formal mentoring program, liberal arts coursework, solving open-ended design problems, internships, and/or undergraduate research experiences. The project consists of two phases: (1) creation of the instruments based on existing measures and development of new measures using qualitative methods in Year 1, and (2) pilot studies in Year 2 that are designed to validate the created instruments. Formative evaluation during these phases allows for modification of measures and timing, and may influence the delivery interventions, based on early analysis of data collected. Summative evaluation provides the validity of the instruments that can then be applied to larger populations. The objective of this initial study is to create and validate instruments that can be used to assess the effectiveness of this promising model. The instruments may be used in future research programs to evaluate the effectiveness of various factors postulated to influence professional development in engineering students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An additional area of interest focuses on how professional formation is influenced by demographic factors, and how professional formation is related to persistence and post-graduation success. Results of the planned research program provides insight into the connection between professional formation and individual characteristics that have been demonstrated elsewhere to predict persistence and post-graduation success in populations underrepresented due to gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The assessment instruments developed in this study enable professional formation within these cohorts to be better understood, potentially leading to specific interventions that strengthen professional identity for these special populations. Dissemination of the results to the engineering education community will spread the impact of the results nationally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Professional Formation of Engineers (PFE) research project aims to create a survey instrument to assess the effectiveness of existing professional formation efforts within engineering programs.  Faculty from the School of Engineering and Department of Sociology of the College of New Jersey (TCNJ) have joined forces for better implementation of this project. The proposed work includes: a) a comprehensive literature review and qualitative research leading to assessment development, b) a pilot study design, and c) validation of the assessments.  The project consists of two phases: (1) Creation of the assessment instruments utilizing current literature and qualitative methods incorporating interviews and/or focus groups in year 1, and (2) validation of these instruments using a pilot study in year 2 and in the no-cost extension.  The results and the findings of the project will be nationally disseminated and the research team would be exploring the possibilities for collaboration with teams from other universities.  In the initial stages of our work, we compiled a list of 105 published items, most of them journal articles addressing the issues of retention and success among engineering students and professionals. This literature makes it clear that a wide variety of other factors predict student success and persistence, apart from technical training, Notably, literature cites a lack of diversity by race/ethnicity and gender, but often fails to specify the mechanism for this effect.  There were four research questions in this grant:  (1) how do individual characteristics affect persistence among engineering majors and post-graduate success in an engineering field; (2) how does the liberal arts core affect persistence and post-graduate success; (3) how does the co-curricular professional sequence affect persistence and post-graduate success; and (4) what else affects persistence and post-graduate success.   To answer our four (4) Research Questions, we developed three survey instruments to account for key developmental stages: freshman year, junior/senior year, and alumni (during initial entry into the workforce, and after long-standing participation in the workforce).   It is important to note that our instruments combine previously developed and novel measures such as those developed by: Jones et al. 2010; Cech et al. 2011; and multiple items from the University of Pittsburgh School of Engineering Student Assessment System (PSESAS) (Besterfield-Sacre et al., 2005). Based on recurring patterns in our pilot interviews, we devised new measures of climate in engineering; time management; high school preparation; impressions of items in the first-year curriculum and pre-professional co-curricular sequence; personal characteristics; and differential experiences by gender, race, sexual orientation, and financial situation.  Thus, our instruments? measures can further our understanding of how program climate affects student professional formation as engineers at multiple time-points, from entering first -year students through long-term alumni.  Based on our findings through our unpartitioned spectrum of surveys, we have concluded that measures of professional identity formation from previously published studies produced similarly valid measures for first-year students. For two of these indexes (Jones?s Identification with Engineering index and Cech?s Professional Confidence index), our pilot studies produced results that replicated these as valid measures, as evidenced both by sufficiently high Cronbach?s alpha scores (&alpha;) and a normal distribution of responses and of index scores. For both indexes taken from the PSESAS survey of first-year engineers; however, indexes that were demonstrated to be reliable for first-year students were less reliable for juniors and alumni. In some cases, the indexes had lower Cronbach?s alpha values, but in others, single items had to be removed from the index to make it reliable. In a few cases, the indexes no longer seemed to have the consistency in responses.  The relatively small sample size among alumni made it somewhat less likely that we would produce reliable Cronbach?s alphas, but because one of the items (Cech Professional Confidence) met this standard and two were close (PSEAS Engineering Skills and Jones Identification with Engineering), based on our interviews, we suspect that there might be meaningful changes in how people view the profession, as measured in the PSEAS Engineering Profession index.   We want to emphasize that the main findings for this research proposal were not to identify these patterns systematically in our student and alumni populations, but to develop instruments that could measure these reliably in future research.  To this end, our greatest achievement and key outcome was the development and validation of survey instruments that could be used for future, systematic research that explores how professional identity develops and changes across the academic and professional careers of engineers.  As evidence of our interest in determining if these patterns hold in systematic samples of students and alumni, this team has already submitted a proposal to the National Science Foundation to complete and expand this work.
