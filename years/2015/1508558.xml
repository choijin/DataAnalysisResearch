<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscale materials have significant applications in electronics, solar energy conversion, catalysis, and batteries. The principal investigator had discovered a new way of synthesizing nanomaterials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. In this project supported by Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the principal investigator develops the rational design and controlled synthesis of novel and complex nanomaterials whose anisotropic growth is driven by screw dislocations. This research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational and controllable synthesis of novel nanomaterials that can be advantageous for a variety of applications, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, the research team integrates education and outreach with active research by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in research, by developing new lab modules on solution synthesis of nanomaterials for undergraduate lab courses, and by developing and conducting new nanoscience hands-on activities at the annual Wisconsin Science Festival to the general public.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Dislocation-driven nanomaterial growth is a fundamental advance that can create new dimensions in the rational synthesis of anisotropic one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and complex three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nanostructures. As a general mechanism that is applicable to any crystalline materials at low supersaturation, it is particularly powerful for growing anisotropic nanostructures of complex materials that have been otherwise challenging to synthesize using catalyst-driven growth. Building on the significant advances and classical crystal growth theory, the principle investigator exploits the advantages of dislocation-driven growth to develop the rational design and controllable synthesis of more complex nanostructures, in terms of both more complex materials, such as ternary metal oxides/hydroxides, and more complex 3D nanomorphologies and heterostructures. To address the challenges associated with controlled solution growth of ternary metal oxide/hydroxide and other complex compounds, the following specific objectives will be pursued: i) develop general dislocation-driven growth of nanomaterials using high-pressure high-temperature hydrothermal continuous flow reactors; ii) investigate the use of non-aqueous solvents for dislocation-driven growth of nanomaterials; iii) develop strategies via conversion reactions from nanomaterials grown by dislocations; iv) make nanostructures with complex geometries through dislocation-driven heterostructure growth.</AbstractNarration>

This project seeks to develop the rational design and controlled synthesis of novel and complex nanomaterials whose anisotropic growth is driven by screw dislocations. Building on our previous understanding that under low supersaturation conditions, screw dislocations can drive the anisotropic crystal growth of a variety of nanostructures, from 1D NWs and nanotubes, to 2D nanoplates and 3D nanostructures, without the use of metal catalysts, we have exploited the advantages of dislocation-driven growth to develop the rational design and controllable synthesis of more complex nanostructures, in terms of both more complex materials and more complex nanostructure morphologies and heterostructures. Specifically, we have developed general dislocation-driven growth of nanomaterials using high-pressure high-temperature hydrothermal continuous flow reactors to grow vertical arrays of GaOOH nanorods, and developed strategies to synthesize ternary oxide nanorods of ZnGa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> by converting the GaOOH nanorods, we have also made chalcogenide or nitride nanomaterials via conversion reactions from metal oxide/hydroxide nanomaterials grown by dislocations; we have rationally synthesized multidimensional nanostructures with complex geometries through controlled dislocation-driven heterostructure growth.</p> <p>Intellectual Merit: Dislocation-driven growth is a general mechanism that has been shown to be applicable to many nanomaterials grown in either solution or vapor phase. The controllable growth of complex nanomaterials we have developed took advantage of the generality and versatility of the growth mechanism and enable their applications in catalysis and renewable energy. For example, using materials synthesized through dislocation-driven growth and the subsequent conversion reactions, we have designed enhanced electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions or electrochemical oxidation of biomass molecules, and high capacity and stable battery electrodes for Li-ion batteries. The well controlled nano/microstructures made using our synthesis have also served as model systems to enable the study of the fundamental mechanisms of phase conversion and Li diffusion in Li-ion battery materials (see an attached image that was featured in a News Release about this collaborative study).</p> <p class="paragraph">Broader Impacts: The findings from this research have been published in 10 peer-reviewed journal papers.
