<AbstractNarration>This award funds research that will first evaluate the long-term record of a program designed to promote women's careers in science and then test hypotheses about the reasons for the long-term results. The Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP) developed the CeMENT mentoring workshop in the 1990s to promote women's careers in economic science. CeMENT was created as a randomized controlled experiment, and evaluation of the first three cohorts has shown that the mentoring treatment enhanced participants' academic productivity. It is hypothesized that CeMENT improved outcomes for women because it: a) expanded professional collaborative networks; b) provided tacit knowledge that improved productivity; c) created professional support networks;&lt;br/&gt;d) some other mechanism not accounted for here; or e) all of the above.  Women continue to be under-represented in the economics profession. This research will identify whether the mentoring program continues to have positive effects on the careers of women economists, and thus inform practices that seek to broaden the representation of women in the profession. The results will also help us identify specific mentoring methods that may be useful for other sciences that face similar issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economists have examined the association between networks and labor market outcomes, but few&lt;br/&gt;studies have identified the causal effects of networks because they are endogenously determined. The CeMENT program is designed to expand professional networks for both collaboration and support. It therefore provides an opportunity to examine the causal effect of an exogenous change in professional networks on the careers of female economists. The results will contribute to our knowledge of the impact of professional networks on scientific careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project updated the evaluation of the American Economic Association’s (AEA) Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession’s CEMENT mentoring program.  CEMENT was originally designed as a randomized controlled mentoring through the 2014 wave of the program.  CEMENT is a two-day workshop immediately following the AEA’s annual meeting that provides professional development advice to women who are junior economists at research-intensive universities.  Our project collected data on the publications, federal research grants, employment, and tenure status of participants and non-participants on the program.    The intellectual merit of this project was the creation of two scholarly papers.  The first, "Can Mentoring Help Female Assistant Professors?  An Evaluation by Randomized Trial," by Donna K. Ginther, Janet M. Currie, Francine D. Blau and Rachel T.A. Croson, was accepted for the 2020 ASSA Program and will be presented in the Gender and the Economics Profession session. This study evaluates differences between the treatment and control groups in tenure status and academic employment, as well as publications and grants.  The dataset covers all six cohorts of program participants.  Individuals are observed for four to fourteen years post intervention, depending on cohort, enabling us to investigate longer-run outcomes for a reasonably large sample.  Results indicate that relative to women in the control group, treated women are more likely to stay in academia and more likely to have received tenure in an institution ranked in the top 30, 50, or top 100.  In addition, women in the treatment group published more top-ranked and second-ranked papers and received more federal research grants relative to the control group.  We also developed a second manuscript, "Collaboration Networks Among Female Economists:  An Examination of Coauthorship Using CEMENT Data." This project was authored by Donna K. Ginther and Rina Na.   We examined whether the CEMENT workshop affected the number of publications and coauthors of treated women.  Our results show that treated women publish significantly more papers.  Once we control for coauthors, the treatment effect is no longer significant.  However, we find that the CEMENT workshop significantly increased the number of coauthors for treated women.  Our results suggest that the CEMENT workshop increases collaborations and coauthorships for treated women.    The broader impacts of this research demonstrate that mentoring can increase the productivity and representation of women in the tenured academic ranks at the top research institutions in the world.  Given the importance of role models in encouraging young women to study fields where they are underrepresented, the long-term impact of the CEMENT mentoring program may increase the participation of women in the economics profession.
