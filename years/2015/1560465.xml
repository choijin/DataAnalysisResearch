<AbstractNarration>This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. As such, it has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Upper Gila Preservation Archaeology Field School, located in rural southwestern New Mexico, provides hands-on training in ethically responsible and scientifically rigorous archaeological methods in the context of a long-term research project. Training is conducted within a Preservation Archaeology ethos, a philosophy integrating big-picture research, use of existing collections, focused fieldwork, site preservation, and local community outreach. Under the close supervision of a team of experienced instructors, this program offers undergraduate students an immersive environment in which to learn the fundamentals of archaeological field and laboratory work, the tenets and practices of Preservation Archaeology, and how to link their work to broader anthropological issues that have contemporary relevance. Specifically, students are trained in excavation and survey techniques, experimental archaeology, artifact processing and analysis, report-writing, and public presentation.  Based on the premise that sites are non-renewable resources, the Preservation Archaeology Field School is training the next generation of academic, private sector, and government agency archaeologists. Student recruiting targets underrepresented groups, including Native American, Hispanic, and community/small college undergraduates with limited STEM opportunities, as well as exemplary students from major academic institutions to increase the diversity of views represented in the discipline.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student efforts contribute directly to Archaeology Southwest's long term research program focused on the Salado Phenomenon in the southern U.S. Southwest during the late pre-contact period (A.D. 1200-1450). This research studies the processes of migration and social integration of culturally diverse groups during this time of upheaval and crisis across much of the Southwest. Students think critically about the values of archaeology and history to different communities and explore different ways to communicate the results of scientific research. Students present their work to various audiences through participation in outreach events for the local community, writing research reports, and presentations at professional meetings. Even for students who do not go on to pursue careers in archaeology, it is excellent training to learn valuable skills in collaboration and collegiality, critical thinking, engaging the public, and the importance of cultural resources, in an active research setting.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Thirty-six undergraduates learned field and laboratory methods at the Upper Gila Preservation Archaeology Field School REU site in rural southwestern New Mexico in 2016-2018. Twenty-three REU students were members of historically underrepresented groups in archaeology, 21 were from small or community colleges with limited STEM research opportunities, and four were veterans. REU funding allowed undergraduates from colleges and universities nationwide to participate as members of our research team (Figure 1) and gain experience in archaeological survey, excavation, experimental archaeology, laboratory analysis, and communicating results to professional and public audiences.</p> <p>Students worked with professionals from academic and Cultural Resource Management sectors to investigate the Gila River Farm site, a large adobe settlement dating to the 1300s. This investigation was part of Archaeology Southwest's long-term research on the Salado Phenomenon (A.D. 1200-1500) in the U.S. Southwest and the migrations, demographic reorganization, and community organization associated with it (Figure 2).</p> <p>Preservation Archaeology aims to minimize adverse impact to sites while maximizing research results through use of existing collections, surface survey, and targeted excavation in sites at risk for destruction or with existing disturbance. The Gila River Farm site was ideal for Preservation Archaeology because it had been heavily impacted by erosion, vandalism, and agricultural disturbance. Preservation Archaeology also seeks to engage local communities with research to help them understand local cultural resources and support preservation. Therefore, an important component of the field school was sharing results with public audiences as well as other archaeologists. All students coauthored excavation unit summaries for professional audiences, and 17 students presented posters related to their field school projects at professional meetings. Students wrote blog posts about their experiences which were read by an average of 5,780 people each field season.&nbsp;Outreach to local residents included an annual Archaeology Fair of student presentations at the site, site tours, events at two local schools, annual events at four area libraries, and an annual public lecture series at our field camp (Figures 3 and 4).</p> <p>Our team's research contributes to understanding migration and social cohesion during a period of crisis in the U.S. Southwest, in the centuries just before Europeans arrived. The late 1200s and 1300s were a time of great upheaval, as people fled social unrest in areas such as the Four Corners and ultimately settled in other regions. In their new homes, migrants had to negotiate with established residents. Some newcomers settled in enclaves at the edges of existing communities, where spatial separation and dissimilar pottery and other household items marked them as different. Over time, ideas from the migrants' former homelands blended with established local traditions- and with symbolism linked to regions farther south- to form a new ideology, which researchers have labeled Salado.</p> <p>Archaeologists see Salado ideology expressed in iconography on polychrome ceramics. This shared set of ideas allowed communities of people with different geographic origins and ethnic backgrounds to live together without obvious differences in wealth or status- at least not in their houses, household goods, and health.</p> <p>Information from our excavations at Gila River Farm is particularly useful in conjunction with data from our 2014-2015 work at the Dinwiddie site (Figures 5 and 6). Both reveal a complicated picture of the Salado phenomenon. In contrast to our earlier work in the Mule Creek area, we found no evidence of a Kayenta migrant enclave at either site. Dinwiddie had only limited numbers of artifacts like perforated plates associated with migrants. Such items are much more common at Gila River Farm, where artifacts show more expression of Kayenta heritage in one of the two major room blocks than elsewhere in the Cliff Valley. Salado polychromes at both sites included large quantities of types such as Cliff White-on-Red and Dinwiddie Polychrome, which combine Kayenta and Mogollon ceramic traditions.</p> <p>Dinwiddie residents reconfigured their village several times, showing changes in residential mobility, social relationships between residents of neighboring groups of rooms, or both. In contrast, Gila River Farm has limited evidence for remodeling, but reveals other interesting characteristics of episodic use and reuse, namely unusual assemblages of items (including bird limbs, fish bones, pigment-stained grinding stones, and axes) purposely placed in fill above the floors of residentially abandoned rooms. This surprising variability in how Salado sites and identities were constructed has made us reconsider the role of Kayenta migrants in the formation of Salado communities in the Cliff Valley relative to the Mule Creek area. Variability in the intensity of room use and how rooms were residentially abandoned has led us to reexamine the idea that residential mobility was higher in this time period than in previous centuries, an idea proposed decades ago that received little attention in more recent years. Our research highlights the variability in Salado villages and in the social processes that helped residents form cohesive communities in an ethnically diverse landscape.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/27/2019<br>      Modified by: Karen&nbsp;Schollmeyer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560465/1560465_10411689_1558998254090_Figure2cropped--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560465/1560465_10411689_1558998254090_Figure2cropped--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Students working"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560465/1560465_10411689_1558998254090_Figure2cropped--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Students working"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2: Students working together in the field.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Karen Gust Schollmeyer</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Karen&nbsp;Schollmeyer</div> <div class="imageTitle">Students working</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560465/1560465_10411689_1558997723970_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560465/1560465_10411689_1558997723970_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Map of student origins"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560465/1560465_10411689_1558997723970_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Map of student origins"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: Colleges and universities of Archaeology Southwest ?
