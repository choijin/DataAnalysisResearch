<AbstractNarration>This project is a collaboration between mathematical researchers at five universities, including young mathematicians at the early stages of their careers, who are joining forces to tackle fundamental problems at the confluence of mathematical logic, algebra, and computer science. The overall goal is to deepen understanding about how to recognize the complexity of certain types of computational problems. The project focuses on a suite of mathematical problems whose solutions will yield new information about the complexity of Constraint Satisfaction Problems. These problems (CSP's) include scheduling problems, resource allocation problems, and problems reducible to solving systems of linear equations. CSP's are theoretically solvable, but some are not solvable efficiently. The research will be aimed at identifying a clear boundary between the tractable and intractable cases, and at providing efficient algorithms for solutions in the tractable cases. Many fundamental problems in mathematics and computer science can be formulated as CSP's, and progress here would have both practical and theoretical significance. A second component of the project investigates classical computational problems in algebra in order to determine whether they are algorithmically solvable. A third component of the project is the further development of the software UACalc, which is a proof assistant developed to handle computations involving algebraic structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers shall work to decide the truth of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture of Feder and Vardi, which states that every Constraint Satisfaction Problem with a finite template is solvable in polynomial time or is NP complete. They will further develop the algebraic approach to CSP's by refining knowledge about relations compatible with weak idempotent Maltsev conditions and about algebras with finitely related clones. A second goal of the project concerns the computable recognition of properties of finite algebras connected with the varieties they generate, such as whether a finite algebra with a finite residual bound is finitely axiomatizable, or whether a finite algebra can serve as the algebra of character values for a natural duality. One of the more tangible accomplishments of this project will be a broadening and strengthening of the applicability of the UACalc software. The agenda for this part of the project includes parallelizing the important subroutines, building in conjecture-testing and search features, adding further algorithms, and further developing the community of users and contributors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was part of five university collaboration of researchers tackling fundamental problems at the intersection of logic, algebra and computer science.  This included developing new techniques in algebra and using them to shed light on problems in computer science.  Conversely, computer science ideas were used to study the complexity of problems in algebra and to improve the speed of certain algorithms in algebra.  This particular project concentrated on the latter and, in addition, the development of a substantial software tool, the Universal Algebra Calculator or UACalc}, used by researchers in the field. UACalc is freely available at http://uacalc.org.  Particular achievements include   A study of which algebras have a  difference term and how to construct one if it exits. There are both  local and global results. It was shown that there is a polynomial  time algorithm to construct such a term in an idempotent algebra, if  one exists.  The algorithm has been implemented in UACalc.    proof that there is no  polynomial time algorithm to test if an algebra has a semilattice  term. This result holds even for idempotent algebras.  On the  other hand testing for an important special kind of semilattice  term, known as a flat semilattice term, is polynomial time for  idempotent algebras.  R. Freese, J. B. Nation, M.
