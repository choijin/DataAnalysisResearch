<AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together, for the first time, all of the PIs of the NSF BIGDATA program, at a venue in the Washington DC/Northern Virginia area. The goals of the NSF BIGDATA program are to "develop new methods for deriving knowledge from data; construct new infrastructure to manage, curate and serve data to communities; and forge new approaches for associated education and training." Given the range of possible activities, there is a need and opportunity to introduce the funded project PI's to the breadth of work funded under the Big Data Research Initiative and to new potential research partners. The workshop is by invitation, and open to researchers who are currently funded through the NSF BIGDATA program. The goal of this two-day workshop is to bring together PIs/co-PIs with government and industry invitees to discuss current research, as well as identify and elaborate on new, emerging challenges, and future directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together experts in different disciplines comprising the Big Data community, funded by NSF. The meeting will identify gaps, needs, resources, and barriers related to Big Data research, and also develop a forward-looking research agenda that will identify future directions in this area. The workshop will provide current PIs with opportunities to showcase and discuss their current work; establish new collaborations; develop knowledge of available research and infrastructure resources; and gain insight into new areas of research. The broader impact of this meeting will be the ability to more broadly share research results in the foundational as well as application aspects of big data in society.</AbstractNarration>
