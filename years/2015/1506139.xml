<AbstractNarration>This award will provide participant and infrastructure support for early career scientists and graduate students to participate in the seventh BOOST workshop that is planned to take place August 10 - 14 at the University of Chicago, Il.  The main goal of this workshop is to bring together people with an interest in particle physics and the eventual discovery, possibly at the LHC, of particles whose existence is not predicted in the Standard Model (SM).  This interest will focus on patterns that can be experimentally recognized in particle jets arising from decays of massive, beyond SM particles decaying to lighter systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the study of signatures in particle jets for boosted decays of heavy systems, other questions that lie at the forefront of our understanding of beyond SM physics will also be examined.  The 2015 workshop is expected to draw participation from approximately 130 physicists divided between experimental collider physics from both theoretical end experimental aspects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The scientific thrust is basic research that affects many areas of modern science and technology.  A better understanding of the potential connections between new fundamental particles will lead to determining their impact on the early universe. The program will offer a stimulating environment for interaction between diverse groups of scientists and will contribute directly to training of young US scientists.  The LHC has become, in recent times, a scientific endeavour of broad interest and familiarity to many citizens of the world.</AbstractNarration>

Approximately 30-40 members of the community were attracted to the event by means of social media and "word-of-mouth." The panel discussion included two female experimental particle physics faculty members, one graduate student, one postdoctoral scholar from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and one visiting theory faculty member.
