<AbstractNarration>In the United States 50 percent of all energy produced is consumed by buildings and 75 percent of all electrical power is used for the operations of buildings. The functions of building skins are traditionally limited to be passive in nature such as serving as thermal and moisture barriers and modulators of sunlight. There is a need for innovative strategies to reduce energy consumption in buildings. The objective of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to harness the inherent properties of smart materials to explore the interaction of these materials and their potential to be used in active and multifunctional building skins. Smart materials provide the opportunity to imbue building skins with more dynamic capabilities namely, to regulate functionalities such as gas exchange and purification (oxygen, carbon dioxide, and common urban air pollutants), to modulate porosity, to reduce thickness of thermal barriers, and to harvest energy and water from the air. If successful, it will address the resource, energy, and labor intensive infrastructure systems that currently serve a building's utility functionalities. This exploratory project will engage interdisciplinary student teams during design studios and workshops (a) to investigate the interaction of smart materials within innovative building skins, and (b) to fabricate and test these smart material interactions. A team of material scientists, engineers and architects will pursue this endeavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory project fundamentally rethinks the way buildings are designed and operated. It is envisioned that building systems that integrate their functionalities through self-monitoring and adjusting their properties and behaviors according to external environment to attain a desired outcome and drawing inspiration from physiological systems in the natural world. Smart materials, such as shape memory alloys, bi-metallic strips, stimuli-responsive polymers, dendritic or star polymers, and piezoelectric materials, will be explored for self-regulating behavior. The methodology will involve graduate and undergraduate students from the disciplines of Architecture and Materials Science and Engineering including students from underrepresented groups and offering significant benefits to them. The project will pursue research and test active, transparent and multifunctional building skin proto types using smart materials that can interact with and react to their environment.</AbstractNarration>

Our technique includes laminating a soft and stretchable material called "EcoFlex" to a cut, temperature-responsive polymer. Our proposed hybrid-surface can transform from a very rigid to very flexible composite. The soft material allows the surface to stretch and the shape memory polymer to harden into place. (b) We discovered a novel method for producing responsiveness and promoting <strong>reversible shape-changing characteristics on a wooden surface</strong> by laminating an epoxy resin-based polymer onto kerfed wood. The outcome is a wooden surface with improved mechanical properties and self-transforming capacity. Wood as a sustainable and very commonly used material in architecture can become a vital part of adaptive design and smart material technologies through this technique. (c) We developed a method to create a temperature-responsive wood composite by making a <strong>viscous shape memory liquid and coating</strong>. In comparison to our laminating technique, the coating offered better control of the geometry and polymer ratio in our composite. The original shape of the composite does not need to be flat by this technique while we were able to control distributing the polymer across the surface. (d) We developed a method to make a temperature-responsive surface that can transform from a <strong>2-dimensional plane surface to a 3-dimensional curvilinear surface</strong>. We applied the results of our study on kerfing algorithms to cut the shape memory polymer we fabricated in the lab. As a result, we were able to program shape memory behavior by controlling geometry through relief-cutting patterns--and glass transition temperature through chemical mixture ratios.
