<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education on the role of specially arranged external disturbances in creating novel electronic states in materials. Topology in the context of condensed matter systems provides a way of understanding how electrons are organized in a material, as well as predicting robust properties of how they move through and along the edges of the material. The concept has become increasingly recognized as an important facet of the physics of condensed matter systems. In this project, the PI will explore how topological characteristics of electronic states in materials can be manipulated using periodic time-dependent disturbances, such as light or electric and magnetic fields that vary in time. The resulting systems are generically known as Floquet systems, and they share the ability of supporting "textures," regions where discrete properties, such as the direction of the intrinsic magnetism of the electron, vary in ways which, when combined for the system as a whole, lead to patterns with interesting properties. The research is focused on ways to understand and predict when such patterns should be present, and furthermore in developing useful models of how such reorganization and patterning of microscopic properties leads to measurable electronic consequences. The PI will also explore, in the case of Floquet systems, the possibility of exploiting textures as possible resources in quantum information processing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be conducted with the full participation of graduate students, who will be trained in modern methods of condensed matter physics, preparing them for careers in science and technology. Scientists from the US and abroad will be collaboratively involved in the work. In addition, the PI will be involved in an educational initiative specifically for high-school students from rural and/or low-income areas in Indiana: the creation of an online introductory physics course for Indiana high-school students without access to an Advanced Placement physics course. Included will be discussions about the remarkable modern materials relevant to this proposal, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education on the roles of topology in Floquet materials. Floquet systems are defined by periodic time-dependent potentials, for example by shining strong, circularly polarized light normally onto a two dimensional electron system. In some cases such potentials can induce texture and topology in a band of states, which may not be present, or may have a different form, in the corresponding static system. The PI seeks to answer fundamental questions about these systems. The research will include studies of edge-state structure and transport properties, which appear to be related in a more complicated way than in analogous static topological systems. As part of this, the PI and coworkers will explore topological invariants that directly address transport coefficients, and investigate how they relate to the edge states they support. Studies of disorder effects, including localization and disorder-induced transitions among different topological states, will be undertaken. Also explored will be new concepts in optically generated "valleytronics" which might be realized for certain Floquet systems. The studies will also include simpler models with an eye towards defining density matrices for Floquet systems, with the eventual goal of developing methods in which contacts and/or thermal baths need not be explicitly included in modeling a Floquet system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Textures can also be present in real space, and have particularly interesting realizations in quantum Hall systems, for which they carry physical charge. In the project, such physics will be explored in multicomponent Dirac systems, in particular graphene and topological insulator surfaces, where different possible broken symmetries may compete to yield the lowest energy ground state. Textures introduced by doping such systems away from integer fillings should result in states that combine different types of orderings in spatially non-uniform patterns. These systems offer rich phase diagrams and novel transitions, both quantum and thermal, between different phases. The PI and collaborators will seek to fully characterize and understand such systems. In addition, an exploration of edge theories of thin topological insulators in which interactions induce coherence between transverse surfaces will be conducted. This impacts the spectrum and physical behavior of electrons at the edge both at the mean-field level, and when fluctuations of the surface ordering are incorporated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be conducted with the full participation of graduate students, who will be trained in modern methods of condensed matter physics, preparing them for careers in science and technology. Scientists from the US and abroad will be collaboratively involved in the work. In addition, the PI will be involved in an educational initiative specifically for high-school students from rural and/or low-income areas in Indiana: the creation of an online introductory physics course for Indiana high-school students without access to an Advanced Placement physics course.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The central theme of this project was to uncover new classes behaviors of electrons in materials where quantum effects play a dominant role.  These effects can take many forms, and often induce remarkable and sometimes useful phenomena: controllable magnetic properties, new modes of storing or transporting quantum information, or dramatic changes in the collective state of the electrons when parameters are tuned by small amounts. Our theoretical studies uncovered several such behaviors, but mostly focusing on materials whose correct description requires elements of topology, an area of mathematics that focuses on the large scale, robust structure in the objects it describes.   Some of our studies focused on systems known as topological crystalline insulators, where the topology forces the material surface to host states that conduct electricity, even as the system bulk cannot.  We discovered that this behavior can be exploited to create a level of controllable magnetism when magnetic impurities are added to the mix, in particular allowing for low-dissipation, electrical control of the magnetic orientation.  At a more fundamental level, the topology of the electrons yields surprising, long-range effective magnetic interactions with important consequences for what happens when thermal fluctuations are large enough to introduce domain walls and other defect structures into the system.  Another set of studies focused on how periodic drives can shape the properties of these systems.  In graphene, a highly conducting two-dimensional material, a combination of light sources can be used to filter electrical flow across the system based on "valley."  Valley degrees of freedom are one type of two-level system that has been proposed as a platform for quantum information, and our proposal would allow such information to be transferred across a device.  In another study, we demonstrated that voltage noise &ndash; inherent fluctuations that occur whenever a device is connected to a voltage contact &ndash; can be used to discover the class of topology in which a temporally driven electron system may reside.  Another set of studies focused on twisted bilayer graphene driven by circularly polarized light, which we found endowed the electrons with topology not present in the static system.  This offers a platform for completely new types of electron states, fractional Floquet Chern insulators.  In addition to these, we considered the behavior of electrons in strong magnetic fields in a variety of graphene systems, where quantum Hall effects can be observed.  These systems have textured excitations which can often be important at experimentally attainable temperatures, and we considered their impacts both at the edge and in the bulk of the system.  Our theoretical studies provided frameworks by which experimental data in single-, double-, and tetra-layer systems can be understood.  They also offered interesting predictions for magnetic orderings with important consequences for heat flow through such systems, offering new ways to interrogate these systems.  These studies summarize our accomplishments with respect to intellectual merit.  The project also had a number of broader impacts.  Among these was the training of young scientists, both students and postdocs, who will ultimately join the STEM workforce of our nation.  In the course of this work, they learned to work effectively as part of a collaborative team, and to communicate their results to peers, more senior scientists, and non-expert audiences.  In many cases they also had the opportunity to interact with diverse, international collaborators, helping them and us as a physics community to build and maintain connections that benefit our nation’s scientific endeavors.  Beyond these, the PI engaged in other activities of broader significance.  Indiana University’s Physics Department hosts a Bridge Program, which brings in students from underrepresented groups, usually of disadvantaged backgrounds, and helps prepare them for applications to Ph.D. programs, in the course of a two year master’s degree program.  The PI was highly involved in this work, mentoring several students in the course of their studies.  In addition, the PI participated in outreach activities for young, budding scientists: children from the Bloomington community who attended our "IU ScienceFest".  This annual activity, for which the PI helped organize the activities in an electricity and magnetism room, welcomes the public for a day of demonstrations, hands-on science play, and brief science talks, with the goal of getting young people and their parents interested in and excited by all facets of science.
