<AbstractNarration>The project embeds a CI Engineer into four University of Pittsburgh research centers providing a resource for cyberinfrastructure engineering on existing projects and consulting on the use of campus and national cyberinfrastructures to advance center missions and objectives.  Research centers are the nexus for campus collaborations and serve as "virtual science organizations" in the University.   These centers provide a rich locus for engagement and development of cyberinfrastructure use cases and best practices for the use of shared facilities and information sharing among large collaboration teams.  The selection of centers with different missions and objectives provides an excellent test bed from which to develop the role of the CI Engineer and influence future support models.   The project integrates the knowledge and experiences derived from the center engagements into a CI-Consultant curriculum for use in workforce training and student education.  Sharing of the CI-Consultant curriculum with peer institutions contributes to the development and maturation of the CI Engineer role at large.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes from this project included a Research Computing Education @ Pitt (RCE@PITT) initiative from the newly formed School of Computing and Information to provide graduate students, postdocs, researchers, faculty, and staff the opportunity to learn the computing skills and techniques needed for data and computationally instense research.  This initiated a recurring workshop series called Data Basics starting in the Fall of 2018.  The workshop series is being given again this year in 2019.  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeX4XlWEx-R_zk8qNDf0TxmzC32-esdLycrT7WEAqC66Y1IdA/viewform  The content for the workshops are available to the public at: https://github.com/RCEatPitt  Another outcome of the project was the decision to invest in a Globus subscription plan.  A Globus HIPAA BAA subscription plan allows us to use Globus to develop data services to manage the sharing and movement of both protected and non-protected data.  Campus CI practitioners and developers can use the Globus software, online (SaaS), and other evolving components for creating solutions to managing the sharing and transfer of both non-protected and protected data.   An additional outcome of this effort was the implementation of a Jupyter Notebook Server in our HPC cluster managed by the Center for Research Computing.  Dr. Matt Burton, acting in the role of the CI Engineer spearheaded the effort with others in CRC.         Last Modified: 10/04/2019       Submitted by: Brian Stengel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
