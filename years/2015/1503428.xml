<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. One significant challenge facing elementary STEM education is the varied preparation of English-language learners. The project addresses this with an innovative use of engineering curriculum to build on the English-language learners' prior experiences. The project will support teachers' learning about strategies for teaching English-language learners and using engineering design tasks as learning opportunities for mathematics, science and communication skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's cross-disciplinary approach is grounded in both inquiry-based science education research and bilingual cognition research. These complementary foci bridge research areas to highlight how engineering experiences for students can capitalize on bilingual students' experiences as problem solvers. The project will develop teachers' ability and instructional efficacy for both STEM and bilingual student instruction. The project adapts a previously developed curriculum for engineering education by adding resources and tools to support bilingual students. The research design primarily measures teacher-level phenomenon such as implementation of instructional strategies, STEM self-efficacy and ability to address the academic development of bilingual students through engineering design activities. Data collected include classroom observations, teacher surveys, focus groups, and teacher interviews. Student assessments will be piloted in the final year of the project.</AbstractNarration>

EL instructional capacity as measured by both efficacy and ability.</li> </ol> <p><strong><em>Goal I: </em></strong>The DTEEL curriculum, materials, resources, and tools (RMT) are publicly accessible on the project website (<a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/dteel">https://sites.utexas.edu/dteel</a>), and are aligned to current state science, math (TEKS) and English proficiency (TELPAS) standards, as well as national science standards (NGSS). In addition to the comprehensive <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/dteel">DTEEL website</a>, the team developed a <a href="https://utexas.app.box.com/s/f7duq6w9dp9szo09poogigsxjiwwavtr">Teacher Handbook</a> to support DTEEL implementation with a wide range of students. Along with the handouts and supports provided in the DTEEL lesson plans, the handbook explains key engineering and language acquisition frameworks for participating educators. The open-access format was selected to secure DTEEL as a readily-available resource in broadening engineering participation for EL students and other underrepresented groups.</p> <p><strong><em>Goal II:</em></strong> DTEEL provided elementary educators at two school sites with professional development (PD) on issues of linguistic and instructional equity for EL students via training in an engineering education curriculum. Data collection targeted teachers? perceptions of their own STEM instructional capacity, focusing on engineering in particular, and their beliefs about EL students? STEM aptitude. At the classroom level, our findings suggest that engineering instruction may be particularly well-suited to empower teachers to facilitate bilingual English learners? language acquisition and STEM literacy simultaneously through its interactive, hands-on format (Fern?ndez et al., 2019). However, at the school level, our findings are somewhat more complex, suggesting that educators? successful incorporation of inquiry-based instructional approaches may depend less on their beliefs about their own STEM capacity, and more on a variety of institutional constraints, i.e., the allotment of instructional resources and time (Callahan &amp; Sampson, In Process). Repeatedly, our participants were more likely to reference the institutional challenges that prevented their full incorporation of the activities, than their actual individual capacity. In fact, several participating educators demonstrated considerable STEM insight, knowledge, and aptitude (i.e., one teacher designed and built furniture for regional competitions), but still struggled to find time to implement the lessons. Ultimately, we suggest that the greatest challenges to participants? uptake of the DTEEL curriculum lay in the organizational constraints of their schools, not their own STEM capacity. To this end, schools? institutional constraints may inform educators? professional self efficacy, and in turn, their professional decision-making processes regarding mobility and retention (Lindo &amp; Callahan, In Process). If, as a society, we hope to broaden STEM participation for all, our experiences and our analyses suggest that we must carefully reconsider the external mandates and pressures imposed on public school leaders, educators, and students.</p> <p><strong><em>Goal III:</em></strong><em> </em>In addition, insights suggest that equity-oriented PD can, in certain contexts, serve as a catalyst for organizational change, influencing teachers? and school leaders? understanding of linguistic and instructional equity (Callahan et al., Under Review). That said, educators and school leaders alike must remain aware of the institutional structures that may impede equity-oriented reforms. Specifically, we found a disturbing disconnect between educators? discussions of EL students and their understandings about race and racial equity; specifically, institutional structures served to obscure the need to address the perpetuation of racial and linguistic stratification (Hurie &amp; Callahan, 2019). Educators? perceptions of EL students? STEM abilities were embedded in their beliefs about color blindness and individual merit, reflecting institutional power structures.</p> <p>Ultimately, while findings from the DTEEL project suggest the important potential of both open-ended inquiry and engineering education for broadening EL students? STEM participation, we also suggest that future researchers carefully consider the institutional and organizational factors that may prevent educators? successful uptake of innovative instructional approaches, much less equity-oriented curricula.</p> <p>References:</p> <p class="EndNoteBibliography">Callahan, R.
