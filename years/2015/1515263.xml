<AbstractNarration>There are persistent challenges to properly managing waste in countries throughout the world.  This study aims to characterize a wide variety of energy by-products contained in cement-based waste forms, waste barriers and concrete products pertinent to China and the United States in order to predict material durability, contaminant retention and environmental safety.  This research will be conducted in collaboration with Professor Pin-Jing He, a leading expert in waste management, and his research team at Tongji University in Shanghai, China.  By assimilating the knowledge of waste management from different countries and experiences, more efficient experimental techniques and improved material characterization can be developed for complex waste forms and barriers.  Results from this study will be implemented to support improved decision making tools for waste management across both countries and to promote beneficial reuse of these materials which can reduce the carbon dioxide footprint for material production and the mining of raw materials while ensuring environmental safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Degraded and non-degraded waste forms, secondary materials used as supplemental cementitious materials, and concretes containing these secondary materials will be analyzed to improve understanding of the physical-chemical microstructure using a variety of advanced microscopy techniques including scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), synchrotron radiation for micro x-ray fluorescence and micro-x-ray diffraction, and scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy.  Specifically, the impact of the beam interaction volume in SEM-EDS will be investigated to better understand the limitations of this type of analysis for heterogeneous and complex waste forms and barriers.  The effect of particle size and phase composition will be investigated by first analyzing uniform pure elements and then by analyzing more complex phases including oxides, minerals, and the waste forms and barriers.  Algorithms will be developed to account for the effect of the beam interaction volume on material analysis.  These results will be used to help characterize the complexity of the waste forms and barriers, improve material analysis utilizing SEM-EDS, and to better understand the degradation mechanisms such as carbonation and oxidation which can impact the long-term performance of these materials. This NSF EAPSI award was funded in collaboration with the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this research was to characterize a wide variety of energy and industrial by-products from China and the United States and their resultant cementitious waste forms using a several different, but complementary experimental methods. Theses experimental methods include XRD, XRF, TGA, SEM-EDS, and a pH-dependence leaching test.  The combination of these techniques is a useful approach for understanding the initial chemistry of the energy and industrial by-products, the microstructure of cementitious materials containing these by-products, and how material composition impacts degradation in cementitious materials.  Under the direction of Professor Pinjing He and Professor Hua Zhang at Tongji University in Shanghai China, ten different types of coal-combustion fly ashes, three different types of granulated blast furnace slags, and six different resultant cementitious materials from the United States and China were characterized using experimental equipment available at the host institute. Significant differences were observed between coal-combustion fly ash materials from the various sources within the United States, and more differences were observed between these materials and the coal-combustion fly ashes from China.  These differences included particle morphology identified by SEM-EDS and particle composition characterized by SEM-EDS and XRF.  Differences in material alkalinity and constituent leaching properties characterized by the pH dependence leaching test were also observed.  SEM-EDS, TGA, and XRD analysis revealed that the differences in the coal-combustion fly ashes impacted the extent of degradation in cementitious materials prepared with the different types of fly ashes.  Compositional differences were also identified between the granulated blast furnace slags.  Results from this projects are being used for further collaboration between the awardee and hosts to characterize additional energy and industrial by-product materials. They will also be utilized to assess the impact of the beam interaction volume in SEM-EDS in order to accurately characterize heterogeneous materials.  In addition, these results are being used in geochemical speciation modeling to predict the long-term structural, hydraulic, and chemical performance of cementitious materials containing energy and industrial by-products in infrastructure and nuclear waste management applications.
