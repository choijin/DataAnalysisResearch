<AbstractNarration>The University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) site of the Center for Integrative Materials Joining Science for Energy Applications (CIMJSEA) seeks to close the gap between material development and weldability and to develop scientifically based methodologies for assessing material weldability and joinability that span from the nanometer to millimeter length scales over a wide variety of materials, while educating and developing a new generation of materials joining engineers and scientists.  The program seeks to identify&amp;#8232; critical joining-related challenges to ensure alignment of research projects and to explore&amp;#8232;the development of materials specifically tailored for manufacturing. Research will be relevant &amp;#8232;to the future and existing manufacturing. The UTK site specialties include materials development, crosscutting capabilities that include multi-scale characterization&amp;#8232;and modeling, as well as a new thrust area in additive manufacturing. The latter has the potential to benefit society in a multitude of ways including reducing scarce and dwindling raw materials.  Proficient new engineers will design by building layer-by-layer instead of by subtraction, allowing for unlimited possibilities in design complexity.  The program will reach out to a large age span of students, from elementary school onwards, by organizing and coaching younger students through LEGO league competitions, establishing and maintaining open 3D printing laboratories on campus, and by supporting Senior Capstone Design activities.  &lt;br/&gt;Technical efforts of the UTK site will foster innovations in welding, materials joining and&amp;#8232;additive manufacturing technologies through interdisciplinary research, bringing together design, robotics and automation, process control, materials science, advanced characterization and high-performance computational modeling. The research at the UTK site includes large-scale additive manufacturing and joining polymer matrix composites&amp;#8232;to metals.  In combination with existing joining technologies the efforts of the UTK site will create an environment where the development of hybrid material systems is accelerated and will be focused&amp;#8232;on the scale-up of proven laboratory developments relevant to automotive, aerospace, and energy applications. The research will promote scientific discoveries related to the thermo-mechanical-chemical properties of interfaces between these constituent materials and advanced in situ and ex situ characterization techniques will be applied to understand issues such as cyclic thermal and&amp;#8232;stress loading, residual stress development, and microstructural evolution. The end result will be a steady flow of fundamental research at the crossroads of joining and additive manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) joined The Ohio State (lead site), Colorado School of Mines, and Lehigh University as a new site in the existing Center for Integrative Materials Joining Science for Energy Applications (CIMJSEA).  During the lifetime of the award the UTK site attracted new industrial members and established a variety of projects supported by the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) including projects focused on characterization of additively manufactured parts, computational modeling of panels joined by friction stir welds, joining of hybrid materials, and process innovation in large scale additive metals manufacturing and non-gravity aligned gas metal arc welding.  Through supplements the UTK site was able to support two veterans and a teacher in participating in the research projects.  After three years of existing as a Phase I I/UCRC the UTK site progressed to joining the others sites at a Phase II level.  The phase I research projects supported graduate students in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering.  After five years some of the students have either recently completed or are close to obtaining their PhD degrees and several students obtained thesis or non-thesis masters based on center supported research.  In addition to the UTK CIMJSEA students participating in the winter and summer IAB meeting by presenting oral and poster presentations they presented their results at a variety of professional conferences including the EPRI Welding and Repair Technology for Power Plants 12th International Conference and the Joint Neutron and Nanoscience User Meeting.  Research during the duration of the award included developing an integrated sensor suite for adaptive wide groove welding,  system architecture for adaptive feedback welding in V &shy;groove welding, piping and welding automation through sensor and model&ndash;based adaptive control, using neutron diffraction experiments to map residual stresses in GRCop&shy;84 parts fabricated by select laser melting, and finite element modeling of friction stir welds in Al panels.
