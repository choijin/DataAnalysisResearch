<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemical Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs,  Virginia Polytechnic Institute &amp; State University will acquire an X-Ray Photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) for use in energy related research and education.   XPS quantitatively determines the elemental/chemical composition, empirical formula, and electronic state of elements within materials. The data from this analytical technique will be used to explore emerging energy technology and significantly improve the understanding of the effect of surface chemistry on efficacy. This will impact the energy field from storage to generation.  The award will also enhance the education and training students in energy solutions.  A multi-level education plan will introduce the fundamentals of XPS and its application to solve current scientific problems through laboratory modules and a summer short-course.  It will be used in a collaborative relationship with Radford University and Roanoke College.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation will enhance research across disciplines, especially in areas such as (a) preparing low cost, high efficiency solar cells; (b) studying artificial photosynthetic metal organic framework thin films; (c) producing hydrogen photocatalytically from methanol; (d) investigating pseudocapacitors and solid oxide fuel cells; (e) studying conducting soft materials for energy storage and conversion; (f) developing flexible solar cells; and (g) preparing polymer-supported water reduction photocatalysts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI, Award 1531834) enabled the acquisition of a Physical Electronics (PHI) VersaProbe III scanning X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) microscope. The new system is ranked as the most sensitive and highest resolution XPS capability of its type currently available. At the time of installation, it was the second instrument of its kind in the United States. It features superior micro-area measurements, sputter depth profiling, and elemental mapping, and has wide applications including the characterization of&nbsp;powders, thin films, and polymers. With the acquisition of the instrument, the Chemistry Department at Virginia Tech established the Surface Analysis Laboratory (SAL) staffed with a full-time technician to handle sample measurement, operations, and repairs as needed. Since established the centered has serviced eight companies and five neighboring institutions, including Allegheny College and East Tennessee State University. The facility also has provided measurements for eight departments over two colleges within the University. Overall, the instrument is used for over 2000 hours of operational time during the academic year (2017-2018). In the one and half year period that the instrument was operational (installed and technician in place), data collected on the instrument contributed to 13 publications with a focus on energy applications (e.g. batteries and catalysis). These articles were featured in many leading periodicals including the Journal of Materials Chemistry, ACS Energy Letters, and Advanced Energy Materials. The instrument has since been noted as critical in four external grant proposal submissions. Additionally, the manager of the SAL applied for and was awarded a Development Grant to communicate the capabilities of the SAL to prospective users at the 65<sup>th</sup> International American Vacuum Society Meeting. Beyond the research mission, the instrument is heavily used in the undergraduate and graduate curriculum in the Chemistry Department. For example, two courses visited the SAL this semester ? Physical Inorganic Chemistry and Instrumental Analysis (pictures provided). The MRI has critically impacted Virginia Tech?s research portfolio, established connections with local companies and neighboring institutions, and elevated our undergraduate and graduate curriculum. With the sustainable laboratory that the program established, the impact of the instrument and grant will continue to grow for years to come.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Amanda&nbsp;J&nbsp;Morris</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1531834/1531834_10395258_1543590527470_SAL--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1531834/1531834_10395258_1543590527470_SAL--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Engagement Surface Analysis Laboratory"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1531834/1531834_10395258_1543590527470_SAL--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Engagement Surface Analysis Laboratory"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Physical Inorganic Chemistry students visit the Surface Analysis Laboratory in fall 2018.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xu Feng</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Amanda&nbsp;J&nbsp;Morris</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student Engagement Surface Analysis Laboratory</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
