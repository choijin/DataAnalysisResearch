<AbstractNarration>1548107&lt;br/&gt;Michigan Technological University&lt;br/&gt;Minerick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one year EAGER will explore a new and potentially transformative approach to small volume protein separations called surface isoelectric focusing (sIEF). sIEF offers the potential for simpler, cheaper, quicker, and sensitive analysis by operating 100 times smaller than previous IEF techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will expand knowledge in isoelectric focusing to separate and identify amphoteric molecules, e.g., proteins, at very high resolution, which is fundamental to medical diagnostics of proteopathy diseases involving protein abnormalities and pharmaceutical screening of therapeutic proteins. IEF in larger scale slab gels is resource, labor, and time intensive being replaced clinically by smaller volume, genomic and affinity approaches. Glycoengineering of therapeutic proteins has been shown to improve molecular stability, regulate physicochemical and pharmacological properties, and improve pharmacokinetics with better absorption, longer circulation times, and decreased clearance rates. This work could produce the knowledge necessary to lead to the beginning of an sIEF tool which could interface seamlessly with therapeutic protein libraries. The result would be rapid screening and valuable charge and isoelectric point information to aid with the development of therapeutic proteins.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this project was to explore the feasibility of microscale surface isoelectric focusing (sIEF).  Using a microprinting instrument (BioForce Nano eNablerTM), we previously demonstrated we could print &lt;60 &mu;m wide gel lines on a glass surface between two microfabricated working electrodes ~300 &mu;m apart.  This project aimed to optimize and to reduce pH compression and band distortion with carrier ampholyte pH gradient microgels for sIEF.   Objective 1 significant results include that broad pH gradients (pH 3-10) can be established in sIEF gel lines with PharmalyteTM, which was verified via direct imaging of the pH gradient.  Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) were successfully focused in the gels.  Optimizations achieved improved resolving power; two methods including electrode passivation and additive chemical co-printing were introduced to sIEF.  The methods suppressed electrolysis near electrode surfaces as well as protein-protein and/or protein-surface interactions, respectively. For electrode passivation, a 50 nm hafnium oxide (HfO2) layer was deposited on the electrode and device surfaces via sputter deposition.
