<AbstractNarration>Non-technical abstract: &lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation chooses the research that it funds based on Intellectual Merit (the potential to advance knowledge) and Broader Impacts (the potential to benefit society). Scientists recognize that the Broader Impact merit criteria as defined by NSF are essential for building the public support necessary for science to flourish.  This project creates a website that will consolidate the wide range of broader impact activities in Condensed Matter Physics, a field that has had a transformative impact on society, leading to the development of transistors, computer memory and light emitting diodes (LEDs). By acting both as a resource and a repository, it will make the implementation of broader impact activities both more efficient and effective.  The wide range of broader impact activities include scientific breakthroughs, patented inventions and start up companies made possible by NSF funding. It also features the work of scientists who are enthusiastic ambassadors for their field, giving public talks, increasing diversity, developing scientific curriculum for students and teachers, and inspiring the next generation to pursue careers in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:  &lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impact merit criteria as defined by NSF are essential for building the public support necessary for science to flourish. Condensed matter physicists (CMP) have made transformative impacts on our society that are often invisible to the public. Communicating the societal benefits of our research is often a challenge because CMP consists of many independent research groups for whom effective engagement in the public arena is not necessarily a forte. Other broader impact activities, such as engaging K-12 students and teachers to increase scientific literacy and strengthen the workforce in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields, may be very effective; but are often isolated and short in duration. A recent workshop on broader impacts attended by PIs supported by the NSF Condensed Matter Physics Program, resulted in the formation of a committee to advance the broader impacts of the CMP community in ways that go beyond what an individual group can accomplish on its own. This project funds the first initiative from this committee, the creation of a website to increase the visibility of CMP and to make the implementation of broader impacts more efficient. The site has two sides, a public side for communication of exciting scientific discoveries and their enabling technologies to the broadest audience and a private side for communication about broader impact activities among condensed matter researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This small grant supported the PI as a contributor to an effort to enhance the broad impacts of research funded by the NSF program in Condensed Matter Physics.  The primary outcome of this grant has been guiding scientists to communicate more effectively with the public about the impacts of their research.  A key way we have done this is to develop the web site 'funsizephysics.com' which contains a large number of posts describing breakthroughs made with funding through the National Science Foundation in language that is accessible to the public and with engaging graphics.    The range of posts on funsizephysics extends from vortices in superfluid helium to bioelectricity to solar energy to liquid crystals to tubulent fluid flows.  Researchers are regularly making discoveries, but they are typically only communicated through professional journals or a very few high profile results that make it into major media outlets.  We wanted to create a better way for researchers to communicate the discoveries they are excited about and provide them with the guidance they need to make them understandable and engaging for the public.  We have seen regularly that it is the discoveries in condensed matter physics of twenty or more years ago that have become the technology that has transformed our lives.  We want to improve the ways researchers communicate to the public the breakthroughs of today that will become our new technologies in the decades to come.
