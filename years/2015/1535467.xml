<AbstractNarration>1535467 &lt;br/&gt;University of Connecticut &lt;br/&gt;McCutcheon, Jeffrey  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel funds are requested to partially support approximately 50 graduate students to attend the 2015 Annual Meeting of the North American Membrane Society (NAMS 2015) Conference in Boston, MA from May-June 2015. The NAMS annual meeting is one of the preeminent global membrane meetings. The latest developments in the membrane field from leading academic, governmental, and industrial research labs are presented for the first time for evaluation by the membrane community. The organizers anticipate a total of approximately 400 membrane researchers from all over the world representing industry, government, and academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funding will provide partial support for student participation in the 2015 NAMS Conference. NAMS meetings provide a unique opportunity for students to share their accomplishments with peers and more senior members of the community. The feedback they receive can help direct their work and provide encouragement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The North American Membrane Society (NAMS) is the only professional society in North America that promotes all aspects of membrane science and technology. This ranges from fundamental studies of membrane material science to process application and development.  NAMS promotes further development and understanding of membranes and membrane processes through:  organization of national and international meetings, presentation of short courses and workshops, support for student travel to NAMS Annual Meeting, promotion of graduate student research, and publication of the Membrane Quarterly.   The Annual Meeting is considered by many of our members to be our most important contribution to the membrane community. Critical to the success of that meeting is the large student attendance that we not only promote and encourage, but support through a subsidized registration fee.  This fee, which is around $250, fails to cover the costs of the meeting for the individual, but NAMS has taken it as part of its mission to support student attendance at the meeting in order to promote the career development of the young talent in the membrane field.  This grant from the National Science Foundation has allowed us to do even more. With this $10,000 grant, we have supported nearly 100 students with additional funding which has lowered the cost of attendance even further.  By providing this funding directly to students, we reduced the effective fee to a mere $150, which, for a 4 day meeting with a variety of student activities (a mentorship lunch event, poster award session, student award speaking session) is a real bargain.  What this ultimately enables is greater student attendance at the meeting as research advisors are able to send more students due to the low cost.   The North American membrane Society has a long history of encouraging student attendance at its annual meeting which has created a strong mentorship culture within the organization.  The National Science Foundation's support of student attendance at this meeting helps support this culture.
