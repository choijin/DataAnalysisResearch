<AbstractNarration>Historically, the study of "special functions" originated in the fact that quite a few functions of interest in applications turned out to be members of a single family, the hypergeometric functions; more recently, the Painleve transcendents have also begun to play a significant role in applications.  Under previous grants, the investigator constructed and studied so-called "elliptic" analogues of these functions (a significant generalization that includes most of the generalized hypergeometric functions and generalized Painleve transcendents in the literature), as well as their implications for the more classical special functions.  The current project continues this work, and aims to provide a more solid conceptual framework by relating elliptic special functions to noncommutative algebraic geometry, which is a relatively recent variant of algebraic geometry, one of the fundamental disciplines within mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This connection is based on a new construction of noncommutative rational surfaces in terms of difference operators on elliptic curves (giving a discrete analogue of D-module theory), giving rise to a (functorial) relation between linear elliptic difference equations and sheaves on the noncommutative surfaces.  The Painleve equations (and generalizations) are most naturally interpreted as flows in moduli spaces of differential equations, so one expects their elliptic analogues to be related to moduli spaces of difference equations, and thus to moduli spaces of sheaves.  In particular, the investigator expects to be able to leverage the existing literature on noncommutative algebraic geometry to understand the structure of such moduli spaces, as well as various natural maps between them (e.g., twisting by line bundles).  In addition, since the new construction of highly-blown-up noncommutative rational surfaces is considerably more concrete than the previously existing constructions, the investigator expects the project to contribute significantly to our understanding of such surfaces in their own right (as well as their derived categories). Finally, several of the difference operators that arise in the construction are univariate analogues of operators that appeared in earlier work of the investigator on elliptic analogues of Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials; this leads to a multivariate analogue of the construction with connections not just to those elliptic analogues but also to certain integrable systems and to an elliptic analogue of the "double affine Hecke algebras" of Cherednik.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Painlev&eacute; transcendents are a family of special functions (satisfying certain nonlinear differential equations known as the Painlev&eacute; equations) which have gained special prominence in the past decade and a half (through relations to random matrix theory and combinatorics in particular).  A number of generalizations have been studied, and the main purpose of this grant was to continue the PI's work in understanding the structure of these generalizations, both enabling further generalization to be done, and clarifying the nature of the Painlev&eacute; equations themselves.  The main approach is via the "isomonodromy" interpretation of these equations, the so-called "isomonodromy" interpretation, which uses the transcendents to parametrize a particularly nice family of linear differential equations (with mild singularities and fixed "monodromy").  A similar interpretation exists for various generalizations of the Painlev&eacute; transcendents, with differential equations replaced by difference equations of various kinds. The Painlev&eacute; equations themselves arise in this way as isomorphisms between families of equations with specified singularities, and a key observation of the PI's work is that these families can be reinterpreted in terms of (noncommutative) algebraic geometry: difference/differential equations become sheaves on noncommutative surfaces, in such a way that most of the information about the singularities is encoded in the surface itself.  In particular (fully developed in the generic case of symmetric difference equations on elliptic curves, with a manuscript dealing with the remaining cases nearing completion, and in the process proving a number of new results in noncommutative geometry), the (discrete) Painlev&eacute; equations are just the noncommutative analogue of twisting by line bundles, and a number of natural constructions (e.g., the Fourier transform and the power series method for solving ODEs) also have geometric interpretations.  Further work involves looking at the derived categories of such surfaces. In particular, the relation between the isomonodromy approach to discrete Painlev&eacute; equations and the original, purely commutative geometric approach of Sakai turns out to be mediated by a derived equivalence between certain noncommutative deformations of elliptic surfaces and corresponding commutative deformations.  This derived equivalence extends to general noncommutative deformations, giving rise to a large family of new isomonodromy interpretations of the Painlev&eacute; equations.  Moreover, this family of derived equivalences degenerates to a nontrivial special case of a derived equivalence arising in geometric Langlands theory, suggesting that there should be analogues of geometric Langlands in which connections on vector bundles are replaced by discrete analogues.  In other words, one expects that moduli spaces of 1-dimensional sheaves on (suitable) noncommutative surfaces should admit noncommutative deformations, and that there should be a rich family of equivalences between the derived categories of those deformations.  This is still almost entirely open; beyond the 2-dimensional case; the PI has been able to show are that any moduli space of sheaves on a noncommutative rational surface admits an infinitesimal noncommutative deformation (i.e., a Poisson structure), and has given a (conjectural) construction of a full family of deformations in one special case (sheaves of rank 1 on a generic surface) which one expects to be derived equivalent to the 1-dimensional cases of interest.  The main tool for the latter construction is an elliptic analogue of double affine Hecke algebras, likely to be of interest in its own right.  In the course of the present grant, the PI also graduated two PhD students and mentored a postdoc.       Last Modified: 09/20/2018       Submitted by: Eric M Rains]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
