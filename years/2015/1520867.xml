<AbstractNarration>This research is motivated by the fact that there exist few quantitative measurements of the strength of shaking close to the epicenters of large earthquakes.  Information on how strong the ground will shake is critically important because structural engineers use this information to design earthquake-resilient structures.  We will further develop and apply a new approach for predicting the strength of shaking in future earthquakes that doesn?t rely on recording earthquakes directly, but uses the ambient seismic field for that purpose.  The ambient field consists of seismic waves in the solid Earth that are generated by wave action in the ocean.  We can use these to develop ?virtual earthquakes? using ground motion sensors deployed at a location on the Earth where we expect future earthquake rupture to occur.  Virtual earthquakes quantify the shaking that will occur when such an earthquake happens.  Specifically, our research will advance this method by improving the calibration of the strength of shaking, applying it to areas of particular concern where we expect the shaking to be strong and potential problematic for buildings, and by extending the technique to shorter periods, which are important for earthquake-resistant design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground motion prediction is an area of key importance for earthquake seismology as it is where the multi-disciplinary endeavor of understanding earthquake behavior meets the societal concern of mitigating earthquake losses.  We propose to improve and apply a new method for predicting spatial variations in ground motion using the ambient seismic field to construct virtual earthquakes. The virtual earthquake approach is possible because the waves that comprise the ambient field, and the waves in large earthquakes, propagate through the same complex geologic structure and are affected by it in the same way. While this approach does not account for nonlinear effects, and does not address earthquake source characterization, it does provide a genuinely new way to predict the complex linear wave propagation effects that strongly influence the intensity of earthquake shaking.   The proposed research seeks to improve the accuracy and applicability of the virtual earthquake approach by: (1) improving the reliability of measured amplitudes, (2) exploring complex basin effects that have not been incorporated into ground motion prediction equations, and (3) pushing the technique to shorter periods that better overlap the period range of primary earthquake engineering concern. Continued development of the virtual earthquake approach for ground motion prediction is essential for it to realize its full potential. We will continue our collaboration with scientists at&amp;#8232;the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo and at ISTerre, Grenoble.  We will also work to develop an emerging collaboration with scientists and engineers at Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, in Mexico City.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ If we put a seismometer on the ground the output will not flatline because the Earth is always shaking.  This shaking comes from many sources.  Earthquakes are the most obvious; however, other shaking results from sources that are often referred to collectively as noise, and this noise is present at all times.  Noise sources include ocean wave action, wind, vehicular traffic, and even air traffic, which all generate seismic waves. Even though these waves arise from causes other than earthquakes, they propagate through the same Earth and hence the same complex geologic structure, as do seismic waves from earthquake.  The premise behind this research is that we can use waves from these other sources to anticipate the strength and variability of shaking in waves from earthquakes because they are both subject to the same influences. We call this method 'the Virtual Earthquake Approach' because we construct the wavefield that would have been caused by an earthquake, but we do it in a virtual sense by using recordings of waves from these other sources.  By doing so we can anticipate shaking in future earthquakes, which is important for designing structures that will resist earthquake damage.     Under this grant we refined the virtual earthquake approach and validated it against earthquake data.  To obtain more accurate results from analysis of the noise data we developed several technical improvements that reduced sources of bias that can lead to inaccurate results.  In doing so we discovered an approach that allowed us to get more accurate results and to get them with less input data, which means we have to average our results over less time.  This is helpful to the virtual earthquake approach, but it is also more broadly useful to the use of data from noise sources for imaging the Earth?s interior.  Because our solution converges with less need for time averaging, it can be used to get better resolution of time-dependent changes, which is an important and growing subfield of seismology.       We applied the virtual earthquake approach to the magnitude 5.4 Borrego Springs, California earthquake, demonstrated that it faithfully reproduced the observed waveforms from that event, and demonstrated that our improved method made the match more accurate.  We also applied the virtual earthquake method to the Kanto Basin, which underlies the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area.  We discovered that the basin strongly amplifies seismic waves from earthquakes, and that the reflection of waves off the boundaries of the basin contribute to the duration of shaking (Figure 1).  This is important because structural engineers have recently realized the contribution of the duration, as well as the amplitude, of strong shaking as an important predictor of building damage.      The virtual earthquake approach stands as an alternative approach to conventional earthquake ground motion prediction. It is not a complete solution because it only works at relatively low frequencies; however, these low frequencies are particularly important for understanding how high-value/high-risk structures, such as tall buildings and bridges, respond to earthquake shaking.
