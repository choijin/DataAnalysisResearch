<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be in enabling a new class of smaller, more efficient, and cheaper motor drives to be built. Since the motors use 43% - 46% of the world's electricity, any improvement in efficiency has the potential to have one of the greatest impacts on overall electrical energy efficiency due to the shear amount of power this application uses. Motors using this technology will be variable speed enabling energy saving opportunities in many applications. A decade ago, there was a push for integrated drive and motor products, but this failed, at least in all but the smallest motors. The primary reasons were the drive was more expensive and often larger than the motor itself in high power applications. This created a situation where it did not make technical or commercial sense to integrate the drive and the motor. Since that point the cost and size of the drives has reduced significantly, but the opportunity for widespread integration cannot be realized until significant additional size and cost reduction is achieved. This proposal will show a path that this integration works for many applications in the 40-1000kW size range. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project includes a new approach to multilevel motor drives.  This multilevel technology has not found commercial applications in lower power, lower voltage (&lt;1000V) applications, with traditional two level inverters dominating the market. This is driven by the abundance of established designs as well as the simplification and robustness of control. As control and semiconductor size and costs continue to reduce, the size and cost of these devices are dominated by filters and thermally driven packaging.  With the advances in low size and cost digital control it now becomes possible to implement multilevel technologies at lower voltage and power levels. This implementation in a regenerative configuration will dramatically reduce the filter requirements as well as improve efficiency in both the drive and the motor. The efficiency improvement in conjunction with distributing the switch heat more widely will allow smaller more compact thermal solutions. Therefore, this approach will dramatically reduce the size and cost of the largest and most costly items at the expense of increasing the size and cost of the smallest and lowest cost items.  This program will develop methodologies and designs that can achieve power densities that are 5-10 times higher than commercially available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Compact, efficient, and low cost motor drives have a wide range of applications driving variable speed induction and permanent magnet motors and generators.  The development of a smaller, more efficient variable speed drive would revolutionize the industry.  This NSF phase I project's goal was to develop the base technology for a revolutionary topology that would make significant progress on size and efficiency.  The key goals of the project were i) complete a design and simulation of the electrical topology, ii) complete a design and simulation of the control algorithm, and iii) complete a detailed thermal analysis on the design to insure robustness.  A design of a compact efficient variable speed drive was accomplished that met the targets of the program.  The design completed has the potential to change the game in variable speed drives in multiple markets.  These designs were accomplished while meeting all the program technical objectives.  The significance of the design will allow a new generation of variable speed drives that can achieve a definitive impact in many different markets.  A patent was filed on the base technology that will allow strong protection for the design.  The techniques developed in this program have the potential to decrease the amount of electrical noise dissipated into the environment.  The FCC does not regulate under 150kHz because with today's technology it would be too expensive to do so.  This technology has the potential to make it cost effective and reduce the amount of electrical noise in the environment.  This will make the world healthier with less interference problems.
