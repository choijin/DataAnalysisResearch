<AbstractNarration>Tsunamis create major geohazards for highly populated coastal areas.  Mitigating tsunami risks is important for society and requires accurate source forecasting and modeling, including non-seismic near-field sources such as Submarine Mass Failures (SMFs), which are prevalent in some areas (such as the US East Coast), and performing runup/inundation mapping using propagation models.  Tsunami inundation maps can be used to develop or revise zoning plans in order to make coastal communities more resilient.  The methods developed in this project will improve tsunami hazard assessment and warning from subaerial slides (originating above water level) and SMFs, and could be adopted as the new standard for such analyses, in operational tsunami hazard assessment and inundation mapping work (e.g., such as done under the auspice of the US National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation program), and in new tsunami warning systems for non-seismic near-field sources; this could ultimately save lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team will collaborate with foreign partners (at the University of Marseille (France), University of Dundee (UK), and British Geological Survey (BGS, UK)) to develop, implement, and experimentally validate the next generation models for deformable landslides and resulting tsunami generation.   Subaerial slides entering the water column as well as SMFs originating underwater will be considered.  The project team will study a range of slide rheologies, with particular interest in dilatational granular flows and in fragmenting, blocky cohesive soil layers.te  Modern computational methods such as GPGPU-based Lattice Boltzmann schemes, will also be investigated with an aim to improving model efficiency and making models able to perform faster-than-real time simulations during near-field events, in order to issue early warning.  In this respect, model predictions of seafloor motion and surface wave response will be studied in light of ongoing parallel efforts on High Frequency Radar and hydroacoustic detection methodologies.  In collaboration with the BGS, new models will be applied to historical landslide tsunami case studies, where tsunami impact was measured (PNG 1998, Unimak 1946, and Ritter Island 1888 events), in order to achieve both a better understanding and modeling of landslide tsunami generation, as well as developing field benchmarks that can be used for model validation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we have developed a new model for coupled landslide and water column motion for the purpose of better modeling tsunami generation by submarine landslides or other types of slumping motions.  The model is formulated in regular horizontal/vertical cartesian coordinates (as opposed to the bottom slope-oriented coordinates often employed) in order to facilitate coupling between the model for the slide and water column.  Model accuracy in this approach depends on the careful accounting of vertical acceleration.  This step is achieved by developing a non-hydrostatic formulation for the slide layer, retaining both local and advective acceleration effects in the vertical slide motion. We have carried out a number of applications of the model for historical, measured, or hypothetical events in order to examine model accuracy and sensitivity to choices of model parameters.  Cases for which measured results are available include the 1975 Kitimat, British Columbia slide (Figure 1), and the recent 2018 volcanic cone collapse at Anak Krakatau, Indonesia (Figure 2).  Models performed reasonably well in comparison to measured data. (We remark that these comparisons are often difficult due to incomplete knowledge of bathymetry and geological conditions, both before and after events).  Studies of the Anak Krakatau event are continuing. As part of the hazard analysis being carried out for the US East Coast, additional efforts have been focused on the paleo landslide event, Currituck, which appears as a depositional feature on the continental margin off the Virginia/North Carolina coast, and a hypothetical event on the West Bahama Bank margin (Figure 3), where the geological record shows the presence of former events and the presence of an unfailed slope with similar properties to the previously failed areas.  Both of these events are important for East Coast hazard analysis, and our ongoing investigations of them assist in both evaluation of model sensitivities and in the development of probabilistic hazard assessments. Work on improving the theoretical and numerical frameworks for models has been carried out.  The model FUNWAVE, used for tsunami propagation and inundation studies, has been ported to GPU architectures, which will greatly improve execution times.  The effect of water compressibility has been studied.  Compressibility causes detectable changes in tsunami propagation speed, and also allows for the generation of acoustic signals which travel at the relatively faster sound speed and could possibly used in warning systems for landslide motions.
