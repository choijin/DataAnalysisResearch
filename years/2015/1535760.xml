<AbstractNarration>Hurricanes are among the most destructive and costliest of all natural disasters. As population continues to increase in coastal regions where the threat is highest, so does the possibility for greater disasters, as demonstrated by hurricanes Katrina, Ike, or Sandy. This risk can be devastating for entire communities, for the insurance industry, which ultimately must pay for a significant portion of the incurred losses, for local and state governments who have to struggle with the impact on their populations and economies, and for the nation as a whole. The implementation of affordable solutions to mitigate damage requires a quantification of the wind forces causing this destruction, and models that relate wind forces to the capacity of man-made structures to resist them. Full-scale measurements are required in order to calibrate and improve the models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed wireless multi-sensors network system has the capability of measuring pressure and temperature on a roof, collecting data (rate up to 1400 samples/s) and sending it to a server to process and publish on the web in nearly real-time. The focus of this proposal is to enhance the capabilities of prior innovation to characterize wind loads on full-scale residential structures during actual hurricanes. The deployment will leverage on the state-of-the-art in wireless sensors networks, cloud computing and social media to seamlessly manage and scale efficiently data streams as the velocity and volume of the source data grows unabated. In this proposal the team plans to add a smart data acquisition to the system which will allow faster data rates when the winds change fast and slower data rate when winds change slowly. This will help to avoid unnecessary data storage and economize the sensor duty cycle. The unique aspect of the system is it has not only the wireless and networking capabilities, but it also has several in-situ controls such as individual sensor remote control, self-negotiating communication, and excellent data throughput, precision, and accuracy; it is robust, reliable, and portable, and allows simultaneous deployment on multiple residences in case of a hurricane landfall.</AbstractNarration>

This sub-system is referred to as the <em>field installation</em> and it is responsible for performing sensing, measurements and data acquisition. The submerged pressure sensor would be connected to a sensor head unit via a long cable (approximately 5-7 m long). The second sub-system is the <em>communication network</em> that connects individual WSN field installations to a central server.

In case the real-time link fails, all the data is stored locally in the memory, which can be retrieved after the storm passes or when the connection is reestablished.

A Control Client application is used to monitor status, control individual or group of endpoints (sensor nodes), display sensor data in real-time, and generate logs of sensor data. In the proposed prototype, the sensor head unit can be interfaced with a buoy so the sensor head unit is always above water or the sensor head unit can be constrained to a post, pole, or column for a pier. If a buoy is preferred for the purposed of recording sea level rise, it would be anchored to a location to ensure there is minimal movement of the sensor and less strain on the reinforced cable connection. The sensor head unit will also contain a GPS chip which would uniquely identity each sensor units in the network as well as provide an exact location in real time. In an event of failure of one or multiple sensor units, the remaining sensor units in the network will continue to perform flawlessly. The battery pack in the sensor head unit will last more than 5-7 days (on normal operation mode) on a single charge (a metric to validate during field testing of the prototype).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/19/2016<br>      Modified by: Chelakara&nbsp;S&nbsp;Subramanian</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1535760/1535760_10357797_1482182190303_NSF2016OutcomesFigure1Capture--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1535760/1535760_10357797_1482182190303_NSF2016OutcomesFigure1Capture--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project Outcomes Figures"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1535760/1535760_10357797_1482182190303_NSF2016OutcomesFigure1Capture--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project Outcomes Figures"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figures 1  A Setup for Water Level WSN Testing</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sunil/Subramanian</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Chelakara&nbsp;S&nbsp;Subramanian</div> <div class="imageTitle">Project Outcomes Figures</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1535760/1535760_10357797_1482182297333_NSF2016OutcomesFigure2Capture--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1535760/1535760_10357797_1482182297333_NSF2016OutcomesFigure2Capture--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project Outcomes Figures"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1535760/1535760_10357797_1482182297333_NSF2016OutcomesFigure2Capture--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project Outcomes Figures"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2 Schematic of the Storm Surge WSN Prototype</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sunil/Subramanian</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Chelakara&nbsp;S&nbsp;Subramanian</div> <div class="imageTitle">Project Outcomes Figures</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
