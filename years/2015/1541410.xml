<AbstractNarration>The University of Cincinnati (UC) is establishing a Campus Cyberinfrastructure Engineer and Educator (CI2E) FTE. The CI2E works side by side with UC's researchers and students to facilitate the use and integration of local, regional and national cyberinfrastructure components with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) research.  The CI2E improves STEM education in the classroom and in the laboratory by providing relevant curriculum and guest lectures; opens new opportunities for research partnerships between universities and industry; and promotes commercialization and job growth.  The CI2E helps the university fulfill the research pathways identified in the university's Third Century strategy, including research in engineering, climate change, clean water and sustainability, analytics, high-energy physics and medicine. The UC CI2E provides educational outreach opportunities to encourage women, first-generation college attendees and underserved populations to explore careers in sustainable networking and the future of big data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CC*DNI Campus CI2E FTE facilitates collaboration across the UCScienceNet, identifying opportunities and bottlenecks and recommending strategic upgrades to our existing campus cyberinfrastructure to create a highly functional and integrated whole. The CI2E works with researchers to utilize software defined networking (SDN) and OpenFlow resources to achieve optimization and the high-throughput capacity required to achieve UC's STEM education and research goals funded by the NSF, NASA, DOE, DoD, USEPA, USGS and private industry in many disciplines. S/he leads UC's ScienceDMZ, IPv6, BCP 38 and related network security efforts.</AbstractNarration>
