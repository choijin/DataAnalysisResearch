<AbstractNarration>Energy within the Earth is released on faults that can either rupture abruptly, causing hazardous earthquakes, or slip slowly in largely aseismic events that can last from hours to years.  Slow-slip phenomena occur frequently in Cascadia, responding to and modifying conditions along the plate interface beneath the locked region where the next mega-thrust earthquake will occur.  The specific physical processes that govern slow-slip behavior also determine the state of the potential rupture surface nearest to the major population centers in the Pacific Northwest. Discriminating between the different rheological models and mechanical treatments that have been proposed to explain slow slip is challenging because many of them can reproduce the primary characteristics of slow slip events, such as propagation speeds, stress drops, and recurrence intervals. This makes all models that can reproduce these features equally plausible.  The recent discovery of "secondary" slip fronts that occur in conjunction with slow slip provides a new opportunity to distinguish between competing models. Accordingly, this project will characterize secondary slip fronts by determining their spatial extents, slip velocities, and stress drops.  These diagnostics will then be compared with modeled secondary slip fronts to determine which of the competing model formulations is able to reproduce the observations and provide a window into changing fault conditions beneath the Pacific Northwest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slow-slip phenomena require the slip rate to increase to observed speeds, typically 10 to 100 times the plate rate, but refrain from accelerating fast enough to generate seismic waves.  The specific physical mechanisms responsible for imposing this speed limit are in dispute.  Our research combines observational and theoretical components to examine the influence of tidal stress changes on slow-slip processes, thereby offering an objective test of several competing model treatments that have succeeded in reproducing the first-order characteristics of slow slip (e.g. slip speeds, stress drops, etc.). The proposed observational effort will use Principle Component Analysis on a low-frequency earthquake dataset from Cascadia to systematically quantify the length scales, time scales, propagation speeds, and propagation directions of secondary fronts that immediately follow passage of the main slip front.  The theoretical effort will incorporate shear and normal stress oscillations into slow-slip simulations that include rate-and-state formulations and dilatancy hardening.  The observational catalog that we assemble will be used to test and refine model treatments that seek agreement between predicted and actual characteristics of secondary fronts that propagate along the Cascadia mega-thrust.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Strain within the Earth is released on faults that can either rupture abruptly - causing hazardous earthquakes - or slip slowly in largely aseismic events that can last hours to years.  The physical mechanisms that govern the transition between slow, aseismic and fast, seismic slip are not well understood.  This award supported basic research into slow, largely aseismic slip events that occur on the Cascadia Subduction Zone and the Parkfield section of the San Andreas fault.  The first part of the research focused on cataloging features of slow slip events known as secondary slip fronts.  These small earthquakes occur within the actively slipping portion of the fault after the main slip front associated with the large, multiday slow slip event has passed.  This work systematically analyzed the weak seismic signature of slow slip events and cataloged the diagnostic features of these events such as spatial scale, propagation speeds, etc.  Though the secondary fronts have been observed in multiple subduction zones, the specific mechanism responsible for their generation is enigmatic. Several studies in different tectonic environments have shown that slow slip events are extremely sensitive to small stress changes resulting from the solid Earth and ocean tides.  Tidal stresses also appear to be linked to the generation of secondary slip fronts, with a disproportionately large number occurring during times of thrust-promoting tidal stress on the subduction interface in Cascadia.  This second component of this research explored the relationship between tidal stresses, slow slip, and secondary fronts by integrating observations of secondary slip fronts in Cascadia with numerical modeling of slow slip modulated by tidal stresses.  The results gave insight into the structure and conditions on the deep roots of fault (where slow earthquakes typically occur).  This award resulted in the support and training of two undergraduate students a graduate student, a postdoctoral researcher, and an early career, female PI.  Undergraduate student Little anticipates publication of a manuscript in 2018.  Additionally, PI Thomas gave several talks on hazards associated with the Cascadia Subduction Zone at local libraries, civic organizations, and around the Universtiy of Oregon campus.
