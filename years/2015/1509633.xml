<AbstractNarration>The interaction of geometry and analysis dates back to at least the eighteenth century, and yet continues to be an important and highly active field of mathematical research. The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire to understand certain properties of the physical world such as angles, distances and properties of certain shapes. Differential geometry was developed to use the tools of calculus to understand the geometry of curved spaces--for example, the curvature of space by matter as predicted by general relativity, or the properties of soap bubbles (which turn out to be related to the equations describing black holes). In the same way that Descartes realized that plane geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential geometry can be studied using techniques from analysis, especially differential equations.  The research in this project involves disparate problems from geometry and mathematical physics but are united by the role played by mathematical analysis in their study.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The functional determinant of an elliptic operator is a problem originating in spectral theory and mathematical physics, and the analysis of the particular problem the PI considers is a variational problem leading to a fourth order elliptic equation. The associated Lagrangian is unbounded, and the existence of solutions and their qualitative properties is highly nontrivial. Similar equations are used to model the properties of thin films. Another problem the PI studies concerns the moduli space of Riemannian metrics that are critical points of functionals given by the integral of quadratic curvature quantities. In work of the PI with J. Viaclovsky, they constructed new examples of critical points, but this construction naturally leads to various conjectures about the moduli space of solutions. An important example of a quadratic curvature functional is the Weyl functional. Critical points are called Bach-flat metrics, and include important examples such as self-dual metrics. One moduli space problem the PI studies is a question of Singer about the linearized problem for self-dual manifolds of positive scalar curvature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Broader Impacts:  The PI's research supported by the award has contributed to the basic existence theory for a class of differential equations arising geometry and physics.   Moreover, although the problems studied by the PI appear in particular contexts, they are representative of problems in mathematical analysis that arise in various areas of mathematics and the physical sciences.   The PI also began supervising two PhD students during the period of the award (Samuel Perez-Ayala and Aaron Tyrrell), and one postdoc (Antonio Ache).   The PI also co-organized several mathematical meetings (one in 2017 and two in 2018).   The PI delivered invited lectures at 15 different instutitions to disseminate his research, about half at international meetings.      Intellectual Merit:  The PI's reasearch on partial differential equations arisiing in geometry and physics resulted in new insight on the existence problem for equations arising in the AdS/CFT correspondence in quantum gravity (joint with Q, Han and S. Stolz).   In a related project, with G. Szekelyhidi, we showed that one could always constuct local solutions, even if global solutions may not exist.   In joint work with Streets and Kelleher. the PI proved new quanitiative estimates for the Yang-Mills functional, which is of importance in both mathematical physics and the study of four-dimensional topology.   The PI also made progress on understanding the space of solutions for a partial differential equation arising in the geometry of four-dimensional spaces.
