<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to innovate a kilo-Hertz to mega-Hertz three-dimensional sensing technique with camera-pixel (Âµm-level) spatial resolution for rapidly occurring mechanical and biological events such as explosions or live beating hearts. The approach involves bridging superfast sinusoidal phase-shifting techniques with digital-light-processing (DLP) projectors using an optical defocusing technique. Specifically, this research will examine the image-generation mechanism of unmodified, inexpensive DLP technology to capture required patterns precisely and rapidly and will theoretically and experimentally explore the defocusing technique to overcome the limitations of the existing high-speed, three-dimensional sensing techniques. The educational goals are to encourage the participation of diverse groups, including underrepresented students, and to integrate the outcomes of this research into educational activities. The approach is to reach out to K-12 students and the general public during Iowa State public events, to develop a repository of three-dimensional videos and data for education, and to provide students with summer internship opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge obtained from this research will have many benefits to society. The addition of a three-dimensional sensing kit and videos to K-12 curricula along with the enrichment of both undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula will enhance optics, biology, and sensing education. Partnering with Virtual Reality Education Pathfinders will allow this research to inspire at-risk students to explore their options in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields. Furthermore, the superfast three-dimensional sensing technology will lead to major breakthroughs in fields important to public health and safety.  Three-dimensional sensing of organs in medicine will offer more accurate diagnoses and provide surgeons with more intuitive situational awareness during robotic surgeries. Three-dimensional data for structural tests will aid the earthquake-resistant structures community in designing safer buildings for people to work and live in.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>3D sensing techniques for static or quasi-static events have been extensively studied over the past few decades. However, it remains challenging to capture rapidly occurring events. The state-of-the-art high-speed 3D sensing technique is either at low spatial resolution at low temporal resolution or prohibitively expensive. These limitations have severely hindered the use of 3D sensing techniques to facilitate numerous studies (e.g., live mouse-heart studies for cardiac mechanics research, requiring 1 kHz or better temporal resolution and spatial resolution within a few micrometers). The research pioneered the 3D sensing field by increasing its temporal resolution to a few magnitudes higher while maintaining its highest possible spatial resolution (camera-pixel level). This research has proved the hypothesis is that the binary defocusing technique can simultaneously achieve better accuracy, higher speed, and more flexibility for 3D optical sensing. Furthermore, this research demonstrated that such an advanced 3d optical sensing technology benefit disciplines of many.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, this project has led to the following research outcomes:&nbsp;</p> <p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proved that the binary defocusing technique can simultaneously improve sensing speed and resolution.</p> <p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed various superfast 3D sensing methods to achieve tens of kHz 3D sensing rate at camera pixel spatial resolution and micrometer accuracy.&nbsp;</p> <p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed methods to achieve 3D sensing at multiple scales ranging from micrometer to meter range.</p> <p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed multi-modal 3D sensing techniques that can simultaneously measure 3D surface geometry, color, and temperature in real time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed superfast 3D sensing system to measure extremely rapidly changing events (e.g., flapping wing robots, beating hearts), and to further analyze mechanics of the events (e.g., heart surface strain, robot wing strain) at unprecedentedly high-spatial and temporal resolutions.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The developed technology could transform many fields by providing quantitative measure of physical objects including monitoring, sensing, and control for intelligent machining and inspection.

We have also developed various real-time 3D sensing systems that were demonstrated to K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as to the general public. Furthermore, the superfast 3D sensing technology could lead to major breakthroughs in fields critical to precision medicine and homeland security, could facilitate the current law enforcement; and could also benefit the manufacturing industry. For instance, measuring and analyzing cardiac surface mechanics at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution could significantly advance basic research of mechanisms of cardiac health and disease by providing a physiology system capable, for the first time, to connect many aspects of cardiology. Ultimately, such a technology could propel the development of a novel life-saving method for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases at an early stage. In addition, commercializing 3D sensors could bring great economic benefits to the United States. The PI has founded a startup company that plans to make such advanced 3D sensors commercially available.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/19/2018<br>      Modified by: Song&nbsp;Zhang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1531048/1531048_10147190_1532055829889_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1531048/1531048_10147190_1532055829889_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Surfast flapping wings mechanics measurement"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1531048/1531048_10147190_1532055829889_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Surfast flapping wings mechanics measurement"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Experimental result of flapping wing robot measurement at 5,000 Hz.
