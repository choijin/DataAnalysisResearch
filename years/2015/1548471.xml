<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project results in democratization of silicon-based internet of things (IoT) microelectronics systems.  It enables more affordable and easy to configure solutions, rapid time to market of customized chip systems, and application of microelectronic systems in ultra small form factors. The technology developed in this proposal will become the foundation of new application-specific integrated systems built using pre-fabricated silicon chiplets. The business model being pursued is based on a virtual store model where customers select chiplets/components, form factor, and then receive immediate feedback of electrical and mechanical models, price, and delivery time. Additional monetization in the field is also possible using field programmability mechanism. Features included in our technology and business model address the high-mix need of IoT in a novel manner by designing a general-purpose active silicon interposer for long usage life span by programming it for specific applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project includes development of a unique active silicon interposer solution to enable Internet of Things (IoT) through three-dimensional  (3D) chip stacking in an affordable, small form factor. Low cost printed circuit board (PCB) and assembly technology has form factor limitations. Justifying the design time and cost for using an application specific integrated circuit chip on an IoT system are way too large to be relevant. PCB designs are easy to copy and vulnerable to tampering.  Powered by its innovative 3D integration technology, programmable silicon interposer architecture, and power-management hooks, we address IoT needs by enabling a single package system that includes three key components of IoT hardware: computing, communication, and sensing. The research will result in a production flow for synthesis of chip systems for IoT devices with off-the-shelf silicon components being combined into an integrated system using our interposer. This activity will advance knowledge and answer questions on the feasibility of low cost chip-on-chip assembly reliability, interposer programmability, and high volume commercialization of such systems.</AbstractNarration>
