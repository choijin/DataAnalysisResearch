<AbstractNarration>Exponential improvements in computing performance known as the Moore's law, that drove economic growth in the 20th century, are now perceived to be stalled due to fundamental barriers of power dissipation and bandwidth associated with electronic circuits. The workshop will explore future possibilities of new types of logic circuits and interconnects to address the technical challenges associated with low power computing. Specifically, the Electrical Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) Division in the Engineering Directorate at NSF, and the Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF) Division at the Computer Information Sciences and Engineering (CISE) Directorate at NSF are holding a workshop in collaboration with the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) to explore the future research directions in the domain of low power electronics as may be required to satisfy the needs of next generation computing by the semiconductor industry. The invitation only workshop will assemble leading experts in the field from both academia and industry research laboratories for a period of two days. The workshop will generate a report which may form the basis for NSF and SRC to formulate new programs and/or modify existing programs in the area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For nearly four decades, rapid advances in computing have been enabled by advances in Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) transistor technology. CMOS technology is now approaching its fundamental limits, and as a result, some important measures of progress in computing have already slowed.  Since 2005, Semiconductor Research Corporation, through its Nanoelectronics Research Initiative, has therefore partnered with NSF to jointly fund research exploring new materials, device concepts, and circuits with the potential to take computing beyond what is possible with the long-established CMOS technology. This research has generated ideas and insights for further, more focused development.  The Workshop for Energy Efficient Computing demonstrated that many potentially important research directions are still unexplored. Workshop participants identified many directions in device research with the potential to greatly increase the energy efficiency of computing. Furthermore, the agreed that such advances must be accompanied by the exploration of computer architectures that optimally exploit the characteristics of the new and emerging devices. The workshop recommendations are expected to aid NSF in developing solicitations for new research proposals.  The Nanoelectronics Research Initiative (NRI) of the Semiconductor Research Corporation partnered with NSF in running the workshop. Workshop participants were experts chosen from top research universities and from industrial R&amp;D organizations of the NRI member companies.
