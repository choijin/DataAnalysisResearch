<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar 2015" that will be held on October 10 and 11, 2015, on the campus of the University of California-San Diego.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the twenty-third installment of the West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in the theory of operator algebras. Some of the foci of the 2015 event are the following: the Elliott classification program for C*-algebras; rigidity for ergodic actions and von Neumann algebras; subfactors and their invariants; graph C*-algebras; free probability and its applications; quantum groups. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
