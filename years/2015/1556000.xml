<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Louisiana State University to develop an instrument for localized sampling of genomic material from single cells in tissue.  The proposed spatially resolved single cell genomics instrument will enable studies of cellular processes on a single cell level with high resolution. The instrument will facilitate local sampling of single cells and determination of genetic differences from cell-to-cell within a heterogeneous population. It will enhance the ability to study the genomics of stem cell development and the study of genetic mosaicism in the brain, which has important implications in understanding neurological diseases and their treatment. The project will involve students and teachers as well as undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs in several initiatives that will advance STEM education and career development in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. The results of the project will be disseminated using an array of social media platforms that are aimed at demonstrating the capabilities of the approach broadly to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genetic differences between individual cells cause differences in their biological function; however, extracting DNA and RNA from large numbers of cells obscures important information about individual cells. High performance next-generation sequencing can be performed on isolated cells, but only after they have been extracted, which loses the information about their location in the organism. This project is aimed at creating a device that can extract material from single cells while preserving its location in the tissue. The instrument uses an atomic force microscope to image the tissue and high-precision tip-enhanced laser ablation to select material for quantification and sequencing. The material is sampled with high precision from individual cells in spatially selected regions. The project goals are construction of the laser ablation system, automated imaging and sample collection, and demonstration of the instrument with breast cancer tissue samples.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project was aimed at developing a device for precise imaging and sampling of genetic material from single cells in tissue. The instrument uses an atomic force microscope to image the tissue and high-precision tip-enhanced laser ablation to select material for genomic analysis from regions that are smaller than a single cell. Genetic differences between individual cells cause differences in their biological function; however, extracting DNA and RNA from large numbers of cells obscures their unique genomic and transcriptomic information. High performance next-generation sequencing can be performed on isolated cells, but only after the cells themselves have been extracted, which removes the information about their location in the organism. The instrument developed in this project can image tissue using atomic force microscopy and uses high-precision laser ablation for high precision sampling of selected regions.</p> <p>The tip-enhanced laser ablation system uses an atomic force microscope (AFM) for surface imaging and ablation (Figure 1). A high resolution image of a flat surface can be recorded by tapping the tip against it and measuring the value of the tip deflection. The AFM has an open sample stage which allows a laser to be directed at the gold coated silicon tip which has a diameter of 80 nm. As the tip moves up and down at a distance of 15 nm above the surface, a pulsed laser is fired which heats the tip and transfers the energy to the sample. The rapidly heated sample is ejected from the surface and is collected on a metal wire or small liquid droplet. The heating is rapid and large molecules such as DNA and RNA are not damaged and can be collected and further analyzed.</p> <p>The effect of laser irradiation on the AFM tip was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 2 shows a SEM image of the tip before and after laser irradiation using a green pulsed laser (532 nm wavelength). The diameter of the tip after laser irradiation increases to approximately 1000 nm, but it can still be used for imaging. One of the main goals of this project was to find the best laser wavelength for precision sampling of DNA and RNA from cells and tissue. A thin film of the molecule anthracene was used to test the system and craters were ablated with wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared regions (Figure 3). The upper heat map images show the laser spot&nbsp; and the lower images are reconstructed 3D plots. The largest craters were obtained at 500 nm wavelength (Figure 3b). This result means that an inexpensive green laser can be used for ablation.</p> <p>Another study was done to see whether the wavelength absorbed by the surface changes the size of the ablation crater. Three dyes with absorption at different wavelengths were ablated and the size of the crater was measured. The dyes were rhodamine B which absorbs yellow-green light (around 550 nm), methylene blue which absorbs red (650 nm) and IR 797 which absorbs infrared (800 nm). The ablated crater volume and dye absorption are plotted in Figure 4. The result shows that the absorption of the dye surface does not drive the ablation: heating of the tip is followed by transfer of the energy to the surface.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tip-enhanced ablation was used to capture DNA for genomic analysis. DNA is a large and fragile molecule that is easy to break when heated or irradiated with a laser. One of the main goals of this project was to see whether tip-enhanced ablation could remove DNA from small spots without fragmentation. A test was made with 3200 base-pair plasmid DNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. The system was used to ablate and capture the DNA which was collected on a small wire suspended above the surface. The green laser wavelength was used since it has the highest efficiency.&nbsp;</p> <p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed on the collected material and the results are shown in Figure 6. DNA ladders of known size flank the gel lanes; the ablated DNA is on the left and control samples are on the right. Despite the laser heating, the DNA is captured intact and viable for PCR amplification from spots 1 &mu;m in size.</p> <p>The significant results of this project are precision sampling of DNA using a pulsed visible laser and processing of the captured material for PCR and other genomics methods. The ablation method can remove DNA without damage and is an easily implemented and general approach.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/23/2020<br>      Modified by: Kermit&nbsp;K&nbsp;Murray</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556000/1556000_10410132_1588300619847_F1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556000/1556000_10410132_1588300619847_F1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Atomic force microscope laser ablation setup"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1556000/1556000_10410132_1588300619847_F1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Atomic force microscope laser ablation setup"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
