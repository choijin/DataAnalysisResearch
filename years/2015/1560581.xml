<AbstractNarration>The project addresses recent studies on the state of U.S. and international scientific inquiry, which identify a trend towards increased collaborative, interdisciplinary, and international research and the increased quality and importance of the products resulting from this research framework. However, studies on the practice of collaborative science also demonstrate that, while digital communication is an important component of team research, face-to-face interaction is also needed to successfully advance the research, which can be a challenge to achieve when the investigators are scattered across the U.S. and in other countries. This program addresses this need and advances collaborative scientific inquiry, and strengthens cooperation and collaboration among scientists nationally and internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports three years of research team seminars in cultural anthropology, biological anthropology, and archaeology that will be hosted by the School for Advanced Research (SAR), an advanced research center for anthropology and allied disciplines. The program will support at least two seminars each year for research teams that need focused time together to discuss, synthesize, and analyze the results of their collaborative research and to develop plans for successful completion of their projects. Eligible research teams will be those in which the primary focus is on a question of anthropological importance, but the teams may be interdisciplinary and international in scope. Seminars will be selected through an annual competition held in February. With the funding provided by NSF, SAR will cover all domestic and international transportation to Santa Fe for up to 10 participants, as well as lodging and meal expenses for the research team to meet in the SAR Seminar House for three days. Research Team Seminar organizers will be expected to develop a meeting schedule in advance and provide SAR with a report after the seminar concludes describing the activities and results.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With the generous support of the National Science Foundation (NSF), the School for Advanced Research (SAR) hosted six Research Team Seminars on our historic campus in Santa Fe, New Mexico over a three-year grant period. The seminars provided a rare opportunity for researchers to take time out of their regular work lives and come together for one week in a peaceful, quiet setting to learn from each other and talk about ways they can work together to advance thinking and understanding in an area of study they are all working in. Sixty researchers from the United States and other countries including Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the Netherlands, and Africa, took part in the seminars.</p> <p>&nbsp;The seminars resulted in different outcomes including plans to write and publish scholarly books and journal articles, making presentations at conferences and meetings, and continuing to work together on joint research projects. The seminars also focused on timely topics that have important implications for everyday life. For example, one seminar focused on the new field of epigenetics, which looks at variations in genetic traits passed from parents to children that can be influenced externally by factors such as nutrition, exercise, sleep, the environment, and traumatic events. As a result of their discussion that looked at children born to mothers pregnant with them during a drought in Kenya versus children not born during the drought, this group is now working on developing a standard approach to conducting epigenetic research and data collection. This is highly relevant because it has implications for diseases such as Alzheimer?s, cancer, and mental health disorders. They will be developing a research paper for publication and sharing information at conferences and meetings.</p> <p>&nbsp;Understanding the past can influence the future, as we learned from a seminar that looked at how syphilis evolved. Researchers discussed how diseases such as syphilis interact with humans by looking at the history of syphilis and different types of treatment over time. Their work has great potential to advance our understanding of communicable diseases and their impact on society in both the past and the present. The research team will be preparing a journal article, developing a workshop for scientific meetings, and has long-term plans to develop a book.</p> <p>&nbsp;A final example of the significant work that resulted from our NSF grant is a seminar that discussed what conditions need to exist for Aboriginal tourism ventures to develop into lasting businesses that deliver economic, social, environmental, and cultural benefits. The research team?s work will contribute to the literature on indigenous rights and self-determination, as well as offer best practices and lessons learned from Aboriginal tourism ventures in Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Mexico, and the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;SAR is grateful for the NSF?s support. Supplying a place and giving researchers the time and resources to come together to work on topics that increase both our past and current understanding of humankind is important to our ongoing evolution. The seminars are also important for advancing the field of anthropology and encouraging collaboration among researchers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/02/2020<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;Ryer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560581/1560581_10417649_1583186406370_Photo1.Oct25-27,2016RTSGroupPhoto--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560581/1560581_10417649_1583186406370_Photo1.Oct25-27,2016RTSGroupPhoto--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Research Team at SAR's Seminar House, Santa Fe, NM"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560581/1560581_10417649_1583186406370_Photo1.Oct25-27,2016RTSGroupPhoto--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Research Team at SAR's Seminar House, Santa Fe, NM"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Seminar Topic: Reassembling The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians: Toward a Collaborative Critical Edition of Franz Boas and George Hunt?s Pioneering 1897 Monograph, October 25 ? 27, 2016.</div> <div class="imageCredit">The School for Advanced Research</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paul&nbsp;Ryer</div> <div class="imageTitle">Research Team at SAR's Seminar House, Santa Fe, NM</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560581/1560581_10417649_1583187413515_Photo2.April4-6,2017RTSGroupPhoto--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560581/1560581_10417649_1583187413515_Photo2.April4-6,2017RTSGroupPhoto--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Research Team at SAR�s Seminar House, Santa Fe, NM"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560581/1560581_10417649_1583187413515_Photo2.April4-6,2017RTSGroupPhoto--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Research Team at SAR�s Seminar House, Santa Fe, NM"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Seminar Topic: Aboriginal Tourism: Prospects for the Development of Diverse and Sustainable Indigenous Enterprises in the Americas, April 4 � 6, 2017.</div> <div class="imageCredit">The School for Advanced Research</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paul&nbsp;Ryer</div> <div class="imageTitle">Research Team at SAR�s Seminar House, Santa Fe, NM</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560581/1560581_10417649_1583187490420_Photo3.Oct31-Nov2,2017RTSGroupPhoto--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560581/1560581_10417649_1583187490420_Photo3.Oct31-Nov2,2017RTSGroupPhoto--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Research Team at SAR�s Seminar House, Santa Fe, NM"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560581/1560581_10417649_1583187490420_Photo3.Oct31-Nov2,2017RTSGroupPhoto--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Research Team at SAR�s Seminar House, Santa Fe, NM"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Seminar Topic: Open Property Regimes as Complex Adaptive Systems, October 31 � November 2, 2017.</div> <div class="imageCredit">The School for Advanced Research</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paul&nbsp;Ryer</div> <div class="imageTitle">Research Team at SAR�s Seminar House, Santa Fe, NM</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560581/1560581_10417649_1583187574983_Photo4.Apr3-5,2018RTSGroupPhoto--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560581/1560581_10417649_1583187574983_Photo4.Apr3-5,2018RTSGroupPhoto--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Research Team at SAR�s Seminar House, Santa Fe, NM"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560581/1560581_10417649_1583187574983_Photo4.Apr3-5,2018RTSGroupPhoto--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Research Team at SAR�s Seminar House, Santa Fe, NM"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Seminar Topic: The Evolution of Syphilis: A New Approach to an Old Debate, April 3 -
