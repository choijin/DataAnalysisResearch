<AbstractNarration>The project entitled "School on Stochastic Analysis, Financial and Actuarial Mathematics with Applications, in conjunction with the third International Conference on Mathematics," will be held from April 22nd to May 3rd 2013 at the University of Buea located in the city of Buea in the South West Region of Cameroon. The school will take place from April 22nd to April 29th, while the conference dovetails the school from April 30th to May 3rd.  The goals for the project are to bring together leading mathematicians and distinguished professionals from the US and Europe whose specialties involve financial mathematics, stochastic analysis and actuarial mathematics to give expository lectures and present new advances that have real-life applications. They will inform and educate students and faculty members, provide a medium for the exchange of information and ideas among mathematical scientists, promote research that can lead to new mathematical and computational methods and techniques for science, industry, and society, and provide a medium for mathematicians from the US and Europe to actively engage in the development of mathematics and mathematical research with colleagues in Cameroon and Africa in general. The school will provide individuals with interest in mathematical finance and stochastic analysis a focused opportunity to learn new concepts, discuss relevant questions, form mathematical and interdisciplinary networks, initiate new problems and tackle collaboratively defined problems, and explore the possibility of extending their collaboration beyond the school and conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of the project are in the educational training of a future generation of mathematicians for a global world, through the expository lectures to be given; the equipping of students and educators in sub-Saharan Africa with skill sets that can be useful in studying and understanding the economic challenges of the growing economies in these regions; the initiation of research collaborations between US and European mathematicians and mathematicians from the Central and Sub-Saharan African region; the creation of local and regional professional networks of mathematical scientists in Africa; and the exposure of US students and faculty to an international educational and cultural experience. The school/conference website is http://bueaconference.com/buea-summer-school/ and it will serve as the initial means of disseminating presentations and other materials as well as the source point for post-school/conference networking.</AbstractNarration>

AIMS Cameroon is one of the AIMS institutes, originally founded in Cape Town, South Africa in 2003. As noted on their website (http://nexteinstein.org/), AIMS is a NEXT Einstein initiative, connecting a network of Pan African Centers for Excellence, aimed at fostering and enabling talented students from Africa to develop into independent thinkers, innovators and problem solvers to help drive the continent's scientific, educational and economic future.
