<AbstractNarration>At the very time our society struggles to adapt to changing climate, respond to loss of biodiversity, and respond effectively to other environmental challenges, the next generations of scientists are increasingly excluded from the primary laboratory for understanding these issues. Field education, studying real plants, animals, and landscapes, provides foundational learning for biologists. But educational opportunities for field study have decreased dramatically in the past couple decades. This workshop will address this growing crisis by convening a select group of professionals to clarify reasons for the drastic declines in field study opportunities, and to formulate specific strategies to remove these obstacles. This can potentially have far-reaching and critical impacts on biological sciences training throughout the U.S.and lead to a rebirth of field study opportunities. Two specific tangible outcomes will emerge from the workshop: 1) A clearly written white paper which can be widely distributed to academic institutions and museums, posted on websites, and, 2) a summary article to be published in a widely-read professional scientific journal. Through these communications, ideas on how to promote field study will be made readily available to decision-makers at a wide variety of institutions throughout the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The loss of field studies is a global, broad-based problem, one that is especially critical to biological sciences training.  This workshop will develop a strategy of "best practices" for instructors, administrators, and the community of biodiversity scientists, with the goal of guiding the successful reintegration of field organismal-based courses in curricula. The workshop will address this educational crisis in two phases. In the first phase, a select group of participants-- including faculty and senior administrators from a variety of institutions, and with a range of experiences, including risk management --will be convened to delineate the specific obstacles that have discouraged institutions from supporting field studies, and then outlining specific strategies to overcome these obstacles, while clarifying best practices. A clearly written white paper will be produced, for wide dissemination. In the second phase of the workshop, a subset of the original group will re-gather to write an article for publication in a journal of wide dissemination.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Nature is the best classroom for learning how nature works.  Until recently, that was a given in biology education.  But in recent years, this self-evident approach to learning about nature has declined in American higher education.  Biology education has increasingly been limited to the lecture hall and laboratory, and shut off from the natural world itself.          Thus, at the very time our society struggles to respond appropriately to immense environmental challenges, such as loss of biodiversity and habitat shifts due to climate change, the next generations of scientists are increasingly excluded from the primary laboratory for understanding these issues: field studies with real organisms, interacting in real ecosystems. Field education provides foundational learning for several key biological science disciplines, including: ecology (how organisms and their environment interact), systematics (how organisms are related to each other), biodiversity studies, and conservation biology (how to save species from extinction and habitats from damage).  Field studies underpin the technical and conceptual aspects of these disciplines&mdash;and thus encourage the continued healthy growth of these fields.  Loss of field studies erodes the capacity of science educators to teach the complexity of our world, and diminishes a key opportunity to inspire future scientists and the general public with passion and caring for the beauty and mystery of the world.   Facilitating a rebirth of field study opportunities in American higher education has potentially far-reaching, positive effects for future biodiversity research, and, more broadly, for an enlarged sense of environmental stewardship among the general public.         This project addressed this fundamental problem in the training of biological scientists in the United States&mdash;the loss of field study opportunities&mdash;by convening a working group of 13 educators and practitioners with a range of backgrounds.  The group included faculty and senior administrators from a variety of institutions:  large universities and small colleges; institutions where field studies have declined and those where fieldwork is still an active component of the educational landscape; and non-profit field study programs. The working group included those with experience mentoring students in a variety of field settings and academic contexts (e.g., undergraduate and graduate courses), as well as those with other specific, relevant experience: managing a biological field station; serving on university animal use regulatory committees; and, those with legal perspective on liability and risk management. Care was taken to assure gender balance and representation of traditionally underserved perspectives.  We gathered for an intensive 4-day facilitated workshop dedicated to delineating the specific obstacles that have discouraged some institutions from supporting field studies, and then outlining specific strategies to overcome these obstacles. We developed a strategy of "best practices" for instructors, administrators, and the community of biology educators, with the goal of guiding the successful reintegration of field organismal-based courses into curricula.        Two months later, three of the participants re-convened for a 3-day retreat to begin writing a professional paper on these subjects, and over the next several months the entire group contributed to the writing and editing of this manuscript.   This effort resulted in a paper, "Teaching Biology in the Field: Importance, Challenges, and Solutions," which has been accepted for publication in the peer-reviewed, professional journal, BioScience.            Several other projects resulted in tangible products to spread the word about the importance of field studies to a variety of audiences:     ?  A summary article, "Why Field Studies Matter for Teaching Biology," is forthcoming in the British journal, Scientia.     ?  Collaboration with a free-lance writer led to a cover story in Orion magazine -- "Into the Field" derived directly from the working group gathering; all quotes in the article came from interviews conducted at the meeting.     ?  We developed a ten-minute documentary film, "Why We Teach In The Field" (currently in the final stage of production), which features interviews with experienced field educators, all of who are working group members.     ?  To address one of the specific challenges identified--uncertainty among college administrators about risk management--we created a manual, Saying Yes to Environmental Field Studies: A Guide to Proactive, Successful Administration and Operations, and made it available for free download.      ?  We created an internet platform for sharing materials to support field studies, including all materials above, as well as a participatory forum ("Share Your Story") for practitioners and students.         Collectively, these outcomes can foster renewed dialogue about effective life sciences education, contribute to a rejuvenation of field studies in American higher education, and infuse society with a deepened sense of caring for the world.
