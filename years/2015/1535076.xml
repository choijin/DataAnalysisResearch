<AbstractNarration>This project brings together an interdisciplinary team with the vision of exploiting digital manufacturing methods, including 3D printing and ink-jet printing, to synthesize structural materials with exceptional mechanical properties.  It has long been understood that the fine-scale structure of materials -- the microstructure -- can affect mechanical properties, and this has been exploited in both materials processing and in creating composite materials.  However, such effort has historically been limited in the range of microstructures that could be explored.  The vision here is to overcome this limitation by adapting methods of digital and additive manufacturing -- which emerged and have largely been used as tools for prototyping -- to make structural materials with superior mechanical performance.  The investigators specifically focus on fracture because of its existential engineering importance and because it raises deep scientific questions.  This project will provide for the training through research involvement of doctoral students as well as undergraduate researchers in an interdisciplinary setting, and a new opportunity for engaging K-12 students and for promoting STEM education amongst underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fracture is a free discontinuity problem, and homogenization and optimal design of such problems is a long-standing intellectual challenge.  In this project, new theoretical and computational approaches addressing this challenge will be pursued.  The free boundary problem will be regularized using a variational fracture field approach, and crack propagation will be studied subject to a new surfing boundary condition.  Optimal design of the microstructure will be pursued through parametric optimization and topology optimization applied to trajectories.  Innovative approaches will be explored to adapt prototyping methods to the synthesis of structural materials with designed microstructures.  While 3D printing and related methods for plastics have gained considerable attention, these strategies will be pursued here to synthesize structural ceramics at the appropriate size scales.  Finally, emerging experimental methods, including digital image correlation, X-ray computed tomography, and confocal microscopy, will be employed to provide both insight into and validation of the theoretical studies of the complex process of fracture in heterogeneous materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary.  The project designed heterogeneous or composite structural materials with exceptional mechanical properties, and used  digital methods of material synthesis including 3D printing and ink-jet printing to synthesize them.  It represented an interdisciplinary collaboration between materials science, mechanics, applied mathematics and computational mathematics, and used a closed-loop materials by design approach involving the forward problem of computing the effective toughness of a material with a given microstructure, the inverse problem of designing a microstructure to optimize toughness, strength and stiffness, synthesizing the microstructure with contemporary methods of additive manufacturing and then evaluating the performance.  The project also had a multipronged outreach program.  Intellectual merit.The project developed a new understanding of effective toughness of heterogeneous materials.  Since fracture is a free discontinuity problem sensitive to critical points of the energy, it can not be characterized by the classical approaches of defining effective properties which often relies on variational principles.  We developed a new approach that defines the effective toughness as the peak energy release rate over the solution to the free discontinuity problem subject to a surfing boundary conditions.  A key component of this was to show the existence of an effective far-field path-independent J-integral.   This led to a number of new fundamental insights regarding the fracture of heterogeneous media.  We showed -- first through theory and then validated quantitatively through experiment -- that  heterogeneity in the elastic modulus leads to toughening through two mechanisms, stress fluctuation and renucleation.   We also showed that asymmetry in the microstructure could be exploited to give rise to asymmetry in toughness: this led to the experimental demonstration of a `fracture diode' that allowed cracks to propagate one way but not the other through the medium.  Other results included the discovery of anomalous anisotropy of layered materials and new insights into adhesion.  We also extended the variational fracture field model to elastic-plastic materials using a variational formulation of plasticity, and this led to new insights into ductile fracture. We then used this definition to study optimal design.  We used parametric optimization to develop a particulate composite with higher toughness than either constituent with stiffness comparable to the stiffer constituent.  This composite was synthesized using 3D printing and the superior properties verified.   We have used our experience with layered materials and parametric optimization to design a tough and strong medium -- the product of the effective toughness and effective strength exceed those of the constituents by an order of magnitude.  We plan to test this experimentally with the ceramic-polymer composites described above in the final months of the project.   We also developed a framework for topology optimization in such evolutionary problems: we began with a free discontinuity problem of peeling that led to new adhesive patterns, and are currently extending it to the free discontinuity problem of fracture. We have pursued a two-prong strategy to synthesize ceramics using both slurries and pre-ceramic polymers.  Pre-ceramic polymer printing has been expanded through a collaboration with Tobias Schaedler and Zak Eckel at HRL Laboratories (formerly Hughes Research Laboratories), which has provided the ability to print with a siloxane-based photosensitive preceramic polymer system. These polymers can ultimately be converted into a silicon oxycarbide ceramic through a pyrolysis process.  Proof of concept prints have been produced and were evaluated for mechanical toughness.    Broader impact. The project provided five doctoral students (two completed and currently with Amazon 126 and Schlumberger) and one postdoctoral scholar the opportunity to work in an interdisciplinary setting.  The project also provided research opportunity to five undergraduate students and two high school students.  Three graduate students involved in this project taught an after-school class in the John Muir High of Pasadena Unified School District. The results of the project are being disseminated through 14 journal publications, and numerous conference presentations (including those by graduate students and postdocs).  We also organized an informal workshop on `3D printing for novel mechanical properties'.  Finally, there were numerous contacts with industry including repeated visits to  Corning and Asahi Glass Company, and a close collaboration with HRL.  The project has resulted in two issued patents.       Last Modified: 11/01/2019       Submitted by: Blaise A Bourdin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
