<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) for Accelerated Adaptive Learning for STEM education.  For the first time, the brain computer interface using Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband will be applied to the learning strategies based adaptive learning.   Electroencephalogram is a none-invasive method for measuring brain wave pattern for identification of electrical activities in the brain. The proposed learning system will provide five learning strategies - apprentice, incidental, inductive, deductive and discovery with real-time learner analytics.  The EEG headband based BCI for adaptive learning will provide real time neuro feedback to learners for identification of optimum learning strategy.  It is expected that the direct collection of brain wave data using multi-channel EEG headband will lead to faster convergence to optimum learning strategy for learners to reach the maximum learning outcome. This approach will allow us to combine brain wave analytics with the real-time statistical inference to improve performance of the learner.  The combination of brain wave data and multivariate correlation analysis of the learner performance will enable validation of the proposed BCI approach for accelerated adaptive learning. With the growth of EEG headband technology and low energy blue tooth interface it will be possible to commercialize proposed approach for STEM education in schools and colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brain Computer Interface for accelerate adaptive learning using EEG headbands will break numerous new technical grounds. For the first time the brain wave data of the individual learner will be used to identify personal learning preferences and learning strategy. The distribution of Alfa, Beta and Gamma brain waves will provide wealth of information on the brain state of the learner exposed to the differentiated learning strategies. The BCI approach will lead to accelerated identification of learning strategy for the best learning outcome based on the real- time brain wave analysis for individual learners. The proposed project will also provide unprecedented opportunity to assess effect of neuro feedback on the learning outcome of the STEM students.  This project will spark a new technology trend of brain wave adaptive learning that will yield numerous new applications and products for high-stack learning and training. The brain computer interface based adaptive learning will also help students with cognitive disability (autism spectrum), ADD and ADHD as study aid for educational programs. The brain wave adaptive learning with data-driven feedback will be extremely useful for improving completion and graduation rates for STEM education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF SBIR 1549256 project titled "Brainwave Adaptive Learning for Accelerated STEM Education" had following goals:  The innovation introduced the game-changing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based brain-wave adaptive learning technology to improve science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. The EEG headband  is used to measure brain-wave signal of the  student while he/she interacts with the adaptive coursework.  The brain-wave signals are then  analyzed in real-time to determine the best learning strategy for the student. For the first time to our best knowledge, the brain wave data of the individual student is used to identify personal learning preferences and optimal learning strategy using a brain computer interface created by an EEG (Electroencephalogram) head-band for the STEM education.  The distribution of Alpha, Beta and Gamma brain waves provide wealth of information on the brain state of the learner exposed to the differentiated learning strategies; and provide unprecedented opportunity to assess effect of neuro feedback on the learning outcome of the STEM students.   Following research and development activities were carried out during Phase I of the project:  Implemented the brain computer interface (BCI) using the EEG Headband (Muse) and developed the first app to collect real-time brain-wave data while students are engaged in the adaptive physics STEM course.  Designed, developed, deployed and field tested "Mastering Fundamentals of Physics Adaptive Course" with sixteen modules (concepts) to test the efficacy of brainwave adaptive learning in comparison with analysis of the click-stream data. Adaptive Physics course was used to expose students to the five distinct differentiated instructional strategies &ndash; apprentice, incidental, inductive, deductive and discovery while recording brain-waves and click-stream data. The combination of brain wave and click stream on adaptive course provided us with unprecedented information to identify learner behavior in real time. Developed the real-time brainwave mobile (iOS and android) application that gives bio-feedback and collects EEG activity data while students interact with the adaptive physics coursework.  Collected initial field trial data from 30 students belonging to the ages 18-40 at the University of Massachusetts, Boston while they learned the adaptive Physics STEM coursework. Big-data analytics results were simultaneously recorded and analyzed from the field trials conducted on target student samples &ndash; including multiple correlation matrix for predictor variables, relative importance of predictor variables and characteristics equation for the outcome variable were calculated for the sample with N = 30. Analyzed brainwave data to get results on predicting the learning strategy to be able to compare them with big-data analytics driven outcome for the same student.   The Phase I research led to following major findings:  The brain wave adaptive learning with EEG headband BCI has statistically significant correlation (R= 0.72) to identify the best learning strategy in two short 25 minute sessions and one 25-minute exam session which is confirmed by the click-stream data analytics over one week. The brain-wave approach significantly reduces time for the identification of best learning strategy and is thereby able to accelerate adaptive learning for individual learners. The real time neuro feedback to students on best learning strategy has potential to enhance learning outcome for a cohort of students.  The comparison of brain-wave analysis of best learning strategy is consistent with the big-data analysis conducted based on the click stream data collected form the  same adaptive physics course.  The work proposed in the technical plan of Phase I was successfully completed within the given time and budget.
