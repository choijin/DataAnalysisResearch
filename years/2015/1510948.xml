<AbstractNarration>PI:  Shengbai Zhang / Hao Zeng&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1510948 / 1510121&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sun represents the most abundant potential source of sustainable energy on earth.  Solar cells for producing electricity require materials that absorb the sun's energy and convert its photons to electrons, a process called photovoltaics.   Recently, materials based on inorganic-organic halide perovskite materials have achieved promising solar energy power conversion efficiency, and can be made from earth-abundant elements using low-cost, solution based processing methods.  However, these perovskite materials contain lead, which is toxic, and degrade in the presence of moisture, which prevents their commercial use.  To address these limitations, this project will develop and study the performance of a new class of perovskite materials which do not contain lead and are stable in moisture.  This project will also provide educational and outreach opportunities, including the development of a student-designed nanotechnology display as part of the permanent Physics and Art exhibit at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, as well as development of various hands-on solar cell kits for K-12 students in the Buffalo area public schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photovoltaic (PV) materials based on inorganic-organic halide perovskites have achieved power conversion efficiencies of nearly 18%, which are now comparable to CIGS and CdTe thing film solar PV materials.  However, current inorganic-organic halide perovskite materials contain lead and are unstable in moisture.  The overall goal of this research is to design and synthesize new ionic photovoltaic absorber materials based on non-halide perovskites that eliminate the use of lead and are stable in moisture.  The proposed research has two objectives. The first objective is to understand the physics and chemistry of organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials that determine their power conversion efficiency and photo-induced degradation in water.  Based on the fundamental understanding obtained under the first objective, the second objective is to design, synthesize, and characterize the photophysics of new ionic PV absorbers based on the non-halide chalcogenide perovskites which do not contain lead, as well as molecularly doped CuxS compounds proposed by a materials-by-design approach.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>(1) Cation splitting is a successful approach in designing solar materials. The high-performance I-III-VI<sub>2</sub> chalcopyrites can be considered as derived from II-VI zincblendes by splitting two 2+ cations into one 1+ and one 3+ cation. The approach can be further carried out by splitting two 3+ cations into one 2+ and one 4+ cation. The advantage is that the crystal structure and local chemical environment of the parent materials are largely preserved, resulting in similar electronic and optical properties. In contrast to cation splitting, anion splitting has been rare. We explored the anion-splitting approach with the aim of developing Pb-free perovskite solar materials, which have attracted significant attention in recent years due to the rapidly increased efficiency of solar cells based on these materials.</p> <p>As in Figure 1 (left panel), we start from CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> and replace Pb with non-toxic Bi while splitting the three I per f.u. into two I and one chalcogen element (S, Se or Te). According to our first-principles calculation, including spin-orbit coupling, such replacement could yield semiconductor with suitable band gaps for PV (Figure 1, middle panel). In addition, the resulting materials, e.g., CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>BiSI<sub>2</sub>, are shown to preserve or even improve the properties of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>. For example, the optical absorption in the visible light region can be significantly enhanced (Figure 1 right panel).</p> <p>(2) Hybrid organic inorganic perovskite solar cells based on CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> and its variants have drastically increased in efficiency over the years and now are competitive with Si-based devices. Despite this increase, significant issues remain due to the instability of these materials. Recently, double halide perovskites which use a pair of 1<sup>+</sup> - 3<sup>+</sup> cations to replace Pb<sup>2+</sup>, such as Cs<sub>2</sub>InSbI<sub>6</sub>, and chalcogenide perovskites, such as BaZrS<sub>3</sub>, have been explored as potential replacements. Motivated by these works, we explored double chalcogenide perovskites with an aim to identify novel photovoltaic absorbers that can replace CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>. Machine learning methods are used to classify materials as potential absorbers using data from periodic table. A random forest algorithm achieves a cross-validation accuracy of 86.4% on the constructed data set. Over 450 possible replacements are identified with Ba<sub>2</sub>AlNbS<sub>6</sub>, Ba<sub>2</sub>GaNbS<sub>6</sub>, Ca<sub>2</sub>GaNbS<sub>6</sub>, Sr<sub>2</sub>InNbS<sub>6</sub>, and Ba<sub>2</sub>SnHfS<sub>6</sub> as the most promising alternative.</p> <p>(3) We proposed another approach to designing solar absorber based on intercalation-induced metal-to-semiconductor transition. We start from an electron-deficient metallic framework. Then, a semiconducting state is achieved through intercalation (Figure 2 Left). We have chosen the Chevrel phase, Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub> (see Figure 2 middle panel), where 3D-connected Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub> clusters form a framework to accept intercalated atoms. Possible sites for intercalation are marked by red and blue balls. On the basis of this approach and first-principles calculations, we propose a solar absorber, Al<sub>4/3</sub>Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub>, which is a semiconductor with a 1.18 eV indirect gap and 1.35 eV direct gap. Comparison of optical absorption with GaAs and Si shows superior absorption over the solar spectrum, which is a result of the parallel bands across the band gap, as highlighted in Figure 2 right panel by thick lines.</p> <p>Al<sub>4/3</sub>Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub> can be obtained by reversible Al intercalation into the Chevrel phase Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub>, which represents the essential process for a rechargeable battery. The unique properties of Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub> could thus be utilized in a monolithic device that integrates an Al-ion battery with a solar cell where Al<sub>4/3</sub>Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub> serves as a dual-function Janus material for both energy generation and storage. The principle here is expected to be applied to the design of other higher-performance Janus materials.</p> <p>(4) In addition to design of solar-cell materials, we take TiO<sub>2</sub> and C doping as an example to demonstrate the concept of kinetics-stabilized doping. Thermodynamic stability is a main concern when designing dopants for semiconductor materials, which usually face the so-called "doping bottleneck". Defects complexes could significantly enrich the possibility of dopant design, but may suffer from instability as entropy is against the formation of such complexes. We found that C<sub>2</sub> dimer substituting for two O, (C<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2O</sub> in Figure 3, exhibits strong binding (&gt; 2.5 eV) between the two C atoms, which could significantly enhance its kinetic stability to survive high-temperature annealing. With a reduced band gap of about 1.4 eV straddling water redox potentials (Figure 3), carbon dimers could be ideal for kinetic doping of anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> to enhance its visible-light activity. Molecular doping using C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> as C precursors has been proposed to introduce the carbon dimers into TiO<sub>2</sub>.</p> <p>The outcomes of this project are expected to generate broad impacts to other research fields especially those relying on semiconductor materials. Intercalated framework materials could possess low thermal conductivity due to the scattering of phonons by relatively randomly intercalated atoms. Also, the electronic conductivity can be enhanced by the amount of intercalated atoms, which serve as dopants. Kinetic doping using molecular dopants opens a new avenue doping semiconductors, which will significantly enrich our capability overcoming the "doping bottleneck" for many important semiconductors.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Shengbai&nbsp;Zhang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1510948/1510948_10372702_1572486438174_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1510948/1510948_10372702_1572486438174_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1510948/1510948_10372702_1572486438174_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(left) A schematic illustration of split anions, (middle) calculated band gap, and (right) imaginary part of the calculated dielectric function, signaling a high light absorption.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Shengbai Zhang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Shengbai&nbsp;Zhang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1510948/1510948_10372702_1572486513904_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1510948/1510948_10372702_1572486513904_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1510948/1510948_10372702_1572486513904_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(left) Calculated density of states showing a metal to semiconductor transition with aluminum insertion, (middle) the atomic structure of the Chevrel phase (Mo6S8), and (right) calculated band structure.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Shengbai Zhang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Shengbai&nbsp;Zhang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1510948/1510948_10372702_1572486582651_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1510948/1510948_10372702_1572486582651_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1510948/1510948_10372702_1572486582651_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(left) Carbon doping-induced bang gap changes in TiO2 and (right) a stable carbon dimer structure, substituting for 2 oxygen atoms.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Shengbai Zhang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Shengbai&nbsp;Zhang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
