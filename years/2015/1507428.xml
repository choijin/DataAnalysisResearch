<AbstractNarration>The 10th Conference on Bayesian Nonparametrics is going to be held during June 22-26, in Raleigh, NC. Providing travel support to junior researchers who do not have access to other sources of funding to attend the conference is key to maintaining the current leadership of American institutions in this field. The conference will also provide American researchers opportunity to exchange ideas with leading researchers from elsewhere in the world such as Europe, Asia and Latin America. Many of the invited speakers including a plenary speaker are women. More women and minorities will be highly encouraged to take part in the conference by providing them local support obtained through funding from the National Science Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian nonparametrics has evolved as one of the fastest growing areas of research in statistics. Its application areas include genetics, finance, survival analysis, sociology, networks and machine learning. The primary objective of the conference is to bring together experts and young researchers, theoreticians and practitioners, who use Bayesian nonparametric techniques. The conference has a well-structured balanced program covering various areas of the subject. The scientific committee of the conference consists of renowned international experts on Bayesian nonparametrics and related topics. The meeting will include three overview plenary talks, twenty four invited talks, several contributed talks and two large contributed poster sessions. The poster session and some slots for contributed talks are especially reserved for young researchers. In addition, the conference will provide opportunities for young researchers to disseminate widely the results of their work by facilitating the publication of peer-reviewed papers and a proposed special issue of a leading statistics journal.  Funding from the National Science Foundation will support participation of students, post-doctoral scholars and junior faculty members working in U.S. institutions to participate in the conference.</AbstractNarration>
