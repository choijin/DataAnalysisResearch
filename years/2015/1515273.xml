<AbstractNarration>The use of organic materials in electronic devices is an attractive option for creating the next generation of devices and technologies.  Using organic materials can reduce the manufacturing costs and enable flexible devices with widely controllable properties. The interface between the organic material and the inorganic material it is deposited on plays an important role in determining the properties of these devices.  This research will seek to explore and control the structure of these organic-inorganic interfaces to promote better interface design. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Kenji Sakurai, an expert on x-ray reflectivity measurements, at the National Institute for Materials Science in Tsukuba, Japan. This collaboration offers the opportunity to have access to unique x-ray reflectivity equipment and expertise that will advance the understanding of the structural dynamics of controllable organic molecular films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The molecular-scale structure and environment of a monolayer of functional organic molecules on inorganic substrates has an important impact on the electronic and optical properties of the interface. This project will develop techniques that will allow these properties to be dynamically controlled through the use of external optical stimuli and probed through time-resolved x-ray probes. Dynamic control of molecular conformation would allow charge transfer mechanisms and rates to be manipulated.  However, there is currently insufficient structural insight available to enable this control. The key challenge is to develop characterization techniques that match the length scale and time scale of this problem. To address this challenge, this research will develop precise time-resolved structural x-ray probe capable of probing monolayer thick samples on timescales of seconds to minutes. This development will allow measurement of the monolayer structural dynamics and enable dynamic structural control of the interface between functional organic molecules on inorganic substrates.</AbstractNarration>
