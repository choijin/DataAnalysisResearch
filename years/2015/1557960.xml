<AbstractNarration>The Emory Department of Mathematics and Computer Science REU Site will provide research experiences for undergraduates interested in arithmetic geometry, combinatorics, and number theory.  Organized by Ken Ono (with assistance from rotating colleagues), the program plans to train 8-10 undergraduates annually in the summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018.  The participants will be chosen after a nationwide search.  Recruitment will target participants from underrepresented groups as well as participants from institutions that do not offer similar STEM research activities for undergraduates. The REU program will enable undergraduate students to enjoy an enhanced learning experience, including research projects and seminars. The overall goal of the Emory REU in Arithmetic Geometry and Number Theory is to attract talented undergraduate students to careers in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research problems will be accessible and cutting edge, and they will be related to analytic number theory, elliptic curves, Galois representations, modular forms, partitions, and quantum modular forms. These fields have implications to real world problems involving internet security, modeling in physics and other physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

The participants later earned numerous honors including a 2018 Morgan Prize, 2018 Rhodes Scholarship and the 2019 Alice T Schafer Prize.The training of these students represents the most significant broader impact of the program. All of these students have committed themselves to careers in STEM fields, with most pursuing a graduate degree in the mathematical sciences.  The intellectual merit of the program is best measured by the research produced these students. These students published 21 papers on arithmetic geometry, distribution of primes, elliptic curves, moonshine for finite groups, partition functions.   Their most notable findings include:  The construction of moonshine for all finite groups, extending beyond the framework of the sporadic finite simple groups. Framework for universal partition functions (i.e. congruences and exact formulae) Bounded gaps in primes in Beatty sets, Sato-Tate sets, and Chebotarev sets. Arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in primes in Beatty sets, Sato-Tate setsm and Chebotarev sets. Exact formulae for power moments for elliptic curves over finite fields. Calculation of Hodge numbers for Hilbert schemes of surfaces.        Last Modified: 10/01/2019       Submitted by: Ken Ono]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
