<AbstractNarration>Tree mortality is becoming increasingly widespread throughout the U.S. as a function of increasing temperature and drought.  Large-scale tree die-off can feedback to affect climate through changes in water balance and surface reflectance (albedo).  This project will use the Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) to study the effects of tree mortality on local climate, and link this information to earth system models to study "teleconnections" in which ecological changes in one area influence climate and associated ecological responses in another.  The project will develop the first large-scale assessment of forest vulnerability to drought-induced tree mortality based on species-specific temperature response functions determined in previous experiments.  These results will be combined with analysis of vegetation structure from NEON AOP data and modeling of climatic feedbacks.  This activity will provide a prototype for a new approach to continental-scale science capable of quantifying ecoclimate teleconnections and risks of tree die-off across NEON Domains and which can be broadly applied to other major types of land transformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will synthesize pre-existing climate and remotely sensed (LiDAR and hyperspectral) observations relating surface properties to fluxes (albedo, latent heat fluxes) to estimate how the changes in vegetation force the atmosphere.  This information will be used to evaluate how this forcing impacts other NEON Domains through ecoclimate teleconnections. The approach initially focuses on forest die-off as a rapid ecological change with direct linkages to climate signals. It will develop the first large-scale assessment of drought-induced tree mortality based on experimentally determined temperature sensitivities, and will improve constraints on ecoclimate teleconnection predictions through incorporation of NEON AOP data. Deliverables include 1) a current assessment of the likelihood and magnitude of die-off by Domain; 2) quantification of impacts of tree die-off in one Domain on others via ecoclimate teleconnections using model experiments; and 3) estimation of associated Domain by Domain risks of die-off impacts from a given Domain. The project also provides professional development for post-docs and early career scientist and has a broad outreach component through an art-science collaboration and seminars at the Biosphere 2 that reach &gt;100,000 visitors/year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Overview  To advance to continental-scale science, ecologists need not only new observing infrastructure such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), but also to incorporate climatological processes at scales that span from local to global. At its core, this Grand Challenge requires considering connectivity across NEON Domains via ecoclimate teleconnections, in which ecological land surface changes in one area influence climate and associated ecological responses in another. NEON data provide critical new information on responses of surface-to-atmosphere interaction to vegetation change. However, NEON data streams can address this Grand Challenge and the need to understand large-scale connectivity only if they are strategically linked to coupled atmosphere-vegetation models. A specific approach is needed that links NEON data with other relevant data and coupled atmosphere-vegetation models to form hypotheses on if and how a given NEON Domain is affected by large-scale ecological change in one or more other Domains through ecoclimate teleconnections. This project prototyped the needed approach&mdash;building on recent advances in modeling and field characterization (including from NSF Macrosystems Category 1 award EF-1340624)&mdash;by targeting the overarching hypothesis: Broad- scale changes in ecological cover in one domain or other parts of the globe influence atmospheric circulation and thus climate and associated ecological and environmental processes in others.    Intellectual Merit  Synthesis of pre-existing climate and remotely sensed (LiDAR and hyperspectral) observations relating surface properties to fluxes (albedo, latent heat fluxes) were used to estimate how the changes in vegetation force the atmosphere, and then systematically evaluate how this forcing impacts other Domains through ecoclimate teleconnections. The approach focused on forest die-off as a rapid change with direct linkages to climate signals.

Broader Impacts  This project advanced NEON Science Strategy by enabling ecoclimate teleconnection assessment and providing a prototype approach and associated analysis of NEON data to the community; by providing professional development for Post-docs and early career PIs; and with broad outreach via an art-science collaboration, seminars at Biosphere 2 (&gt;100,000 visitors/year), MSU Science Festival, and organization of a NEON Macrosystems Biology special session at an international meeting.
