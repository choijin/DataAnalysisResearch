<AbstractNarration>Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program, (I-Corps L), this project will develop ways to achieve more widespread use of effective methods for helping undergraduate students and faculty gain greater benefits from undergraduate research experiences.  Collaborating with faculty on research can be transformative experiences for undergraduate students. Research participation can increase students' confidence and enthusiasm leading to improved academic performance and stronger career focus. Working with faculty on research also helps students create credentials for future research and professional opportunities.  Some work also indicates that, for undergraduates, the personal connections with faculty and graduate students are more important than the actual research content. The quality of faculty mentoring has a significant influence on the benefits of research participation for the student.  However few faculty are able to develop optimally effective mentoring practices on their own.  This project will use a set of effective practices about mentoring and have been developed to help undergraduate students and the faculty with whom they will collaborate. Topics address issues of recruiting, training, and communication.  The program is a series of units, for use by both the mentor and mentee, that explain core topics and help build the type effective mentor-mentee relationship essential to achieving the greatest benefit to the student for undergraduate research. This I-Corps for Learning project will develop approaches to enable this mentor-mentee training program to be easily implemented across a wide spectrum of undergraduate institutions across the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relationships that undergraduate students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics cultivate with a research mentor have the potential to be among the most formative and influential relationships of their lives. It is known that a students' educational and career persistence is empowered by confidence and critical thinking skills gained during hands-on experiences. Research mentors are a key to bolstering a mentee's  confidence and developing that mentee's critical thinking skills. Immersive formal research programs, such as the NSF's Research Experience for Undergraduates, are high-quality learning experiences that combine research and career development activities in group settings. Universities may also have their own formal research programs that also facilitate hands-on lab experience. The mentoring experience (faculty member/undergraduate student, graduate student/undergraduate student) can vary widely in quality and there is a concern that research mentees often do not receive the quality of holistic mentoring that is possible. This can be attributed to mentors not having access to, or knowledge of, educational materials and a lack of time for mentors to develop and assess their own program. By increasing the widespread implementation of effective mentoring practices, this project will help to improve the effectiveness of student-faculty research collaborations throughout STEM education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through our experiences with undergraduate engineering and science students, we identified a potential opportunity to boost performance for students who are at a critical stage in their academic career (most often when they enter their sophomore year) and who have midrange grades (they have done "ok" but not excelled).  We learned that many in this group lack the confidence and/or enthusiasm needed to successfully complete an engineering or science degree.  We found that we can bring these students into a laboratory setting to work on small research projects to boost confidence, gain enthusiasm about engineering and science, and create credentials for future research and professional opportunities.  In fact, we learned that the personal connections with faculty and graduate students are more important than the actual research content -- this is in contrast to most undergraduate research programs that focus on the project.  We have learned many lessons about mentoring over the years and have developed a set of standard procedures that we now follow with all new undergraduate students in our laboratory. We have captured our experiences of recruiting, training, and mentoring this group of students as a program that we seek to share with other universities.  The program is a series of modules, for use by both the mentor and mentee, that explains core topics and helps build the mentor-mentee relationship.   The "Valley of Death" refers to the fact that most science/technology innovations wither before translation into products. Accordingly, the National Science Foundation launched the Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program to guide the entrepreneur past the common perils that doom translation, mostly lack of understanding of the market for the innovation. Most entrepreneurs fail to answer the basic questions of i) who will use my product (customer)?, ii) how will they use it (form)?, iii) how will they find it (customer acquisition)?, and iv) how much will they pay (cost)?  The I-Corps program follows the evidence-based customer discovery process, coined "Lean Startup", to answer these questions by refining assumptions made about a business model surrounding an innovation.  A key element in the training is to talk with more than 100 people that have an opinion about the potential product.  We participated in the August 2015 I-Corps L program, with the goal of identifying methods of propagating our instructional approach to improving the experience for new undergraduate researchers. The educational innovation was a curriculum of "mix and match" research training modules for research mentors and undergraduate mentees that addresses both research fundamentals and professional development. Over the course of the 7-week program, we completed 108 interviews with individuals from academia, industry, government, and professional organizations, in order to learn about current methods of undergraduate research training, oversight of training, and means of influencing training. Information gathered during the 7-week program was used to create, augment, delete and, ultimately, evolve hypotheses about content and form needed by educators. We started with the na&iuml;ve belief that the learning modules worked well for us so everyone would want to use them. We found that many faculty members believed they were providing good mentoring for their students. Several had developed "one-off" training approaches, but had not validated or shared them with others.  It was also found that graduate students commonly perform the role of research mentor and are often times not trained for this position.  Both groups enthusiastically welcome readily accessible training tools, but desire them in a form that the mentees and graduate student mentors can use without intensive faculty oversight.  We learned by talking with commercial entities that there are direct competitors as well as channels that could be used to deliver content quickly and efficiently. We learned from talking with faculty members that they have full autonomy to adopt new teaching tools but scarce resources to pay for them. On the other hand, in talking with administrators, we learned that they have budgetary power but that power is generally limited to shifting resources between programs (and not creating new ones).  Administrators are interested in "increased science, technology, engineering, and mathematics undergraduate retention and graduation rates"; hence, a training program meeting this objective would be worthy of investment.  From these interviews, it was found that in order to have successful adoption of educational innovations, a "bottom-up" approach that starts with faculty and student buy-in and moves to a request of administration must be followed.   The I-Corps process allowed us to re-evaluate our educational program with unbiased viewpoint and to refine the technical content and delivery.  We highly recommend that this line of inquiry be a regular part of biomedical education.              Last Modified: 01/01/2017       Submitted by: Karen L Burg]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
