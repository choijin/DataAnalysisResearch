<AbstractNarration>The investigator will numerically model the environment around stars that are gravitationally bound to each other rather than in isolation.  This question is important because most stars are found in pairs or multiple star groups, not isolated like our Sun.   The investigator notes that our nearest stellar neighbors, Alpha, Beta and Proxima Centauri are in a group of stars.  This proposal will explore the conditions that any planets around these stars may experience due to the interaction of the outflows of material from the stars. The investigator will model the environmental conditions in multiple-star systems; the models can be tested by appropriate observations of the Centauri group.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will strongly connect undergraduate students with this research project. The investigator will also mentor first year undergraduate students, who will work on this project through the auspices of the "Women in Science Project" at Dartmouth College. This program encourages more women to pursue a career in STEM through early exposure to hands-on research experience, role modeling, and mentoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will study the region of interaction of stellar winds with the surrounding interstellar medium; a region the investigator calls the 'astrosphere'. In particular, the research focuses on astrospheres of binary stars, which have the additional feature of wind-wind interactions between the two stellar winds. Both the wind-wind and the wind-ISM interactions produce shocks and associated radiation/particle interactions. The investigator?s central theme is the ramifications for any planets that might be associated with the system. Effects can include the planet's thermal and chemical atmosphere structure, and over the long-term erosion of the planet's atmosphere, as is thought to have happened with Mars. The interaction of magnetized solar winds with the planet's magnetic field also affects cosmic ray transport and exposure Such effects are important for shaping the expected properties of a planet's atmosphere, and studies of those atmospheres will become important during the coming years when current lists of recently discovered exoplanets will be observed in more detail.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><br />Every star loses some of its mass in the form of a stellar wind that flows from the star into outer space. Stellar winds from solar-like stars and stars with smaller mass than the Sun are too low-density to be observed directly from afar. Yet they interact with the similarly low-density interstellar medium (ISM), creating an astrosphere. The inside of an astrosphere is occupied by stellar wind material, and the outside is regulated by interstellar gas. Just outside of the astrosphere, neutral hydrogen has a region of higher density called the hydrogen wall that is related to the strength of the stellar wind and the relative ISM velocity. The hydrogen wall imprints an extra absorption component in stellar hydrogen lines in high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectra. This is key in determining the strength of otherwise unseen stellar winds. The Sun's heliosphere is well explored and serves as a prototype astrosphere; its heliospheric hydrogen wall has been mapped out in some detail in the past.<br /><br />Dozens of astrospheres in the solar neighborhood have been explored through HST spectra, with the analysis using numerical models of astrospheres that represent the astrospheric physics through multiple fluids. Multi-fluid models are necessary because ionized and neutral populations of the astrosphere are not in equilibrium with each other. Past work has explored astrospheres due to single stars just like the heliosphere. As an important step forward, this NSF project addresses the modeling of (quite common) situations where there are two stars in orbit around each other (binary), both emitting stellar winds that ultimately merge and interact with the surrounding ISM, forming a hydrogen wall. The prototype example is the alpha Centauri system, which is the Sun's nearest galactic neighbor: Two solar-like stars in an elliptical orbit around each other (80 year period), while embedded in a warm, partially ionized ISM. (Proxima Cen is far outside this region.) The two winds interact with each other; the head-on collision of the winds creates a collision disk region where most of the kinetic energy is converted into heat, and the colliding winds are redirected away from the axis connecting the stars. The collision disk stream further collides with astrosphere boundaries (termination shock), creating a turbulent mixing of the outer astrosphere boundaries, and a time dependence of the astrosphere and the hydrogen wall. The attached images illustrate a typical output of a simulation run (time snapshot), and provide an overview of the regions and boundaries.<br /><br />Intellectual merit. <br /><br />The project models the alpha Cen system as well as other astrospheres of binaries in a detailed, comprehensive way that enables the analysis of the various regions of a binary astrosphere as a function of time. The simulations depend on parameters such as the binary masses and orbit, stellar wind parameters, and ISM environment parameters. Fundamental neutral/plasma physics can be learned from these three-wind interaction regions, for example how the collision disk interacts with the outer astrosphere. The models are able to predict observations such as astrospheric hydrogen absorption components and a particular X-ray emission from astrospheres, all as a function of time, which can guide future observation proposals including those involving alpha Centauri.<br /><br />Lastly, the project was undertaken expressly to characterize the plasma and neutral surroundings of stars in a binary system. More and more exoplanets are discovered around binaries, and it is important to characterize their "interplanetary environment" to assess questions surrounding exoplanet atmospheric mass loss, and habitability in general.
