<AbstractNarration>This Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) project will develop a new approach to improving the teamwork skills among engineering students. Engineering graduates need strong teamwork skills to be productive members of the nation's technological workforce. However, developing teamwork skills is both difficult and time-consuming. This project will further develop a novel self-contained activity capable of improving teamwork skills among first-year engineering students. The activity is inexpensive, requires only a maximum of three hours class time, and can be prepared and graded quickly by instructors.  Initial pilot testing shows that the activity is effective and increases intrinsic motivation of students. Effective teamwork skills such as task coordination and intra-team communication are improved. The array of activities pursued WILL result in students who, on average, have personally incorporated teamwork skills.  Development of teamwork skills thorough efficient activities WILL result in habits of effective teamwork behavior. The methods are preferable to simply telling students how to work in teams which rarely results in lasting effects. This personalized experience WILL result in a longer-term retention of important teamwork skills. This project will clarify the effectiveness of this teamwork development activity and refine the program to ensure easy and effective implementation by other educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typically, students do not retain strong misconceptions regarding what is defined as good teamwork, but rather are ill informed or lack experience on how to best approach a teamwork situation. A team at the South Dakota School of Mines has developed an interactive simulated teamwork exercise capable of improving teamwork skills from a constructivist point of view. As a simulated exercise, the fear of failure is lowered and the stress and impact of team discourse is eliminated. By engaging in the activity as intended, the students build upon their own knowledge base to reinforce and establish good teamwork practices. Important components to ensure the success of the constructivist approach are alignment, reflection, and feedback. If the activity does not align with the learning goals, either learning will not happen, or wrong concepts will be learned. Reflection reinforces what is learned for longer-term retention, while feedback on reflections reassures ideas generated by a constructivist approach are validated by an expert and are worth retaining. By triangulating reflections with quantitative assessments, the project team aims to show the effectiveness of this activity in a number of universities across the country and to show the adaptability and adoptability of this activity by other educators aiming to improve the teamwork skills of their students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ While board games may be seen as something fun and a release from the rigors of the STEM profession, we have explored how important they can be to teaching STEM professionals the value of teamwork and the different aspects of teamwork.  This study used the commercial board game, Pandemic, to train engineering students on effective teamwork.  Students would first play the game without any knowledge as to why they were playing or what they were meant to learn. Through guided reflection, feedback, and presentation of formal aspects of teamwork, students could see what was effective and why in addition to identifying poor practices and the detriment of those practices.  The students would again play the game, but this time equipped with the knowledge of effective team practices.  The training exercise would conclude with a reflective memo. The students were prompted to reflect on what they learned, where they need to grow, how the game paralleled real life teams, and why teamwork is vitally important. After a minimum of 6 weeks, the students filled out a teamwork assessment instrument to gauge how well their teamwork skills improved.  One of the goals of this work was to show the exercise does improve teamwork skills.  We hypothesized the activity was equally effective for all groups based on gender, race, discipline, and institution type and the activity would improve their teamwork abilities over the long term as compared to those who did not have the exercise.  We found a statistical difference between freshmen who participated in the training and those who did not. As such, the activity does have impact. Unfortunately, we found senior-level students performed equally well with and without the training exercise.  As a result, we only accelarated growth, but the end point was approximately the same.  We believe continual reinforcements and other game-based activities could make senior students even more prepared for the workplace than the current state.  With regards to race, no difference were found with or without the activity. Some disciplines gained more from the activity than others, but all gained something as a whole.  A similar result was found for institution type.  With regards to gender, without the activity, no differences exist. However, women outperformed males if they engaged in the activity. This may suggest using Pandemic as a training exercise can improve confidence in women engineers and improve their self-identificaiton as an engineer.
