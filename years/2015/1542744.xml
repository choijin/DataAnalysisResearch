<AbstractNarration>This project provides support for Exploring Advanced Placement Opportunities in Engineering: A Workshop on Designing a Universal, Exchangeable and Transferable (DUET) Credit, to be held at the University of Maryland College Park (UMD) in the Spring of 2016. The overall goal is to contribute to the development of a secondary-school level course in design that would expose students interested in engineering and architecture to the design process. The workshop will explore issues and barriers associated with realizing this goal. Follow-on to the workshop will be a series of interviews to calibrate the issues and barriers against the experience of practitioners and policy makers. The workshop would initiate research that could ultimately open the credit doorways for expertise earned across formal and informal design activities covering a range of programs from PLTW to Maker Spaces. Creating an equivalency process for design across learning and practice settings (e.g. engineering, education, architecture) has the potential to broaden the diversity of students, encouraging them to take the first steps towards understanding and practicing design; and to receive recognition. Aligning the pathways for credit to be earned and universally accepted, in the context of the formal and informal learning environments available for design,  would open many academic and career pathways for all students, teachers and practitioners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will create a unique opportunity for leaders from the education, engineering, workforce and policy communities to convene and share ideas on how to achieve universal acceptance of earned credits for the introductory study of design. The workshop will draw approximately fifty participants from six different sectors: K-12, community colleges, four-year institutions of higher education, industry and not-for-profits, government and policy, and non-government funders and foundations affected and impacted by a transferable credit for design that have applied design thinking within their occupations. The proposed one-and-a-half-day workshop will be organized and conducted by UMD in collaboration with Morgan State University and followed up by individual interviews documenting 1) core design Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) for a universally accepted credit for design; 2) identification of the critical pathways and barriers within these pathways for a universally accepted credit for design; and 3) use of Logic Modeling to organize the findings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) has raised the ?ante? to place engineering design to the same level of importance as the scientific method across K - 12 education. NGSS stresses the inclusion of engineering design into K - 12 curriculum with the expectation that students develop the related skills of critical thinking to apply their mathematics and science knowledge.  The implementation of NGSS will require a major re-skilling of teachers at all K-12 levels.  As more and more US states implement engineering design into their K - 12 curriculum, the opportunity exists to create 'earned credit' for engineering knowledge, skills and abilities at the high school level. In addition, the door is 'open' for a process to earn at the pre-college level, transferrable college credit for engineering design.      "Universally recognized credit pathways" clearly must extend beyond students, teachers, and the teachers of teachers since students also gain design knowledge and critical thinking skills from clubs, extracurricular activities, jobs and internships and want to be given credit for their level of knowledge and competency wherever the skills came from and employers need to know that new employees can do what they need them to do regardless of where they picked up the skills.    "Credit" currently includes both academic credit established by schools through grades, credentials and certifications established by third party evaluators such as the College Board and credentialing organizations, and the more subjective estimations of a student?s? knowledge, skills, and achievements conveyed letters of recommendation.    To be "universally recognized", grades, standardized test scores, and credentials need to have specific meaning to the community colleges, technical schools, universities, and potential employers who make judgments based on them regarding admissions, hiring, and placement.   This suggests that a student?s basket of credentials ideally should take into consideration all learning and skills development whether it comes from the classroom or not.  The efforts to create an AP Introduction to Engineering course may turn out to be the most important credit pathway for engineering design because it is likely to be used by community colleges, universities, and even technical schools to make comparative assessments of high school graduates? level of knowledge of engineering design, ability to apply math and science, and mastery a variety of soft skills.   If it comes about, it is likely to lead to a standardization of technology education at the high school level and to force engineering schools to develop a more common understanding of what an engineer should know after completing such a course.
