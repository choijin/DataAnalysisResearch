<AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to provide partial support for the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee (IOOC) support office hosted at the Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL). The IOOC Support Office will continue to provide project management and meeting support services for the IOOC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interagency collaboration is essential to achieve ocean science and technology priorities and, in particular, for planning and coordination of an ocean observation system. The IOOC support office provides administrative assistance the federal agencies on all of the IOOS planning activities. An IOOC that is able to effectively support these goals will make meaningful contributions to broader societal goals related to climate, maritime operations, natural hazards, national security, public health, ecosystems, and natural resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through FY16-18, the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee (IOOC) established several task teams addressing critical needs for ocean observing systems and launched the planning for OceanObs?19, a decadal conference that galvanizes the global ocean observing community to address wide-ranging scientific and technological challenges. The IOOC continued its successful implementation of executive and legislative requirements set by the National Ocean Policy, Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observing Act, and Office of Science and Technology Policy.  The IOOC task teams made several major accomplishments. These teams are designed to provide subject matter expertise on an ocean observing topic. Below is a list of the four major task teams supported during the period of performance:  The Animal Telemetry Network (ATN) Task Team developed an implementation plan to determine how the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) can assimilate animal telemetry efforts into a system to deliver critical information on biological resources and ecosystem functions, as well as oceanographic data that will complement and enhance existing observing capability. The Animal Telemetry Network Implementation Plan 2016-2021 was cleared and released to the public by OSTP on December 22, 2016.   The Glider Task Team?s mission was to enable increased engagement with the glider community and to advance the coordinated use of glider observing systems to meet global, national and regional sub-surface observing requirements. The task team hosted the first U.S. Underwater Glider Workshop on January 18-19, 2017. A major outcome of workshop was the consensus on the importance of formally creating an Underwater Glider User Group to encourage sharing and cooperation within the glider community. A post-workshop report of recommendations to the IOOC and language adopting a user group was approved by the OSTP.  The second Glider Workshop, focused on best practices and international collaboration, will be held at Rutgers University in May 2019.   The G7 Ocean Action Task Team received committee approval on their scope of work to address the current suite of international collaborative mandates and initiatives derived from the G7 Ocean Experts Mandate, Horizon 2020, and the Transatlantic Gallway Declaration. The US is supporting the working groups addressing the development of an initiative for enhanced global sea and ocean observation required to monitor climate change and marine biodiversity, e.g. through the Global Argo Network and other observation platforms, while fully sustaining and coordinating with ongoing observation and  strengthening collaborative approaches to encourage the development of regional observing capabilities and knowledge networks in a coordinated and coherent way, including supporting the capacity building of developing countries.
