<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Towson University will acquire a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)  system.  The system will be used to analyze the composition of complex materials obtained from various sources including samples from environmental sources, chemical reactions or biological origins. In this system, the liquid chromatograph (LC) separates the mixture into its individual components. Then the mass spectrometer (MS) ionizes the components and determines their mass by measuring the mass to charge ratio (m/z) of the ions. This is a widely used analytical tool to identify what is the composition of a mixture or material. The instrument will be used by students in their research, training them with sophisticated, modern instrumentation. Students in laboratory courses will be trained to use it including students in the only BS Forensic Chemistry program in Maryland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will be used in research projects, such as (a) investigating the formation of disinfection by-products in drinking water resulting from reactions between so-called inert constituents of herbicide formulations and chemical disinfectants; (b) analyzing chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols; (c) improving polymer-based controlled-release technology for anti-herpetic drugs; and (d) improving traceability of cocoa through chemometric analysis of chemical signatures.</AbstractNarration>

The research activities described below, based on the work of five tenured professors (PIs Margulies, Sours, Stitzel, Kautzman and Sivey), underscore the intellectual merit of this grant and span the areas of analytical chemistry, environmental chemistry, and molecular biology. The acquisition of this advanced instrument was essential in attracting and supporting the research of two new, tenure-track faculty members (Reber, Nesbitt) in the areas of synthetic and bioanalytical chemistry.  This instrument has been used to further the goals of the following projects:  Project 1 (PI Sivey) examined the environmental fate of often-overlooked "inert" ingredients in pesticide formulations. UPLC-MS/MS experiments provide important insights into the chemical structures of pesticide transformation products in complex environmental systems.  Project 2 (PI Kautzman) centered on analysis of the chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols present in ambient samples. Assessing the chemical composition of aerosols permits an analysis of sources and chemical transformations that occur as a function of aerosol aging, which improve estimations of the global warming effects of aerosol species.   Project 3 (PI Margulies) employed UPLC-MS/MS to characterize and improve the performance of a polymer-based controlled-release technology for anti-herpetic drugs.  This technology is anticipated to be an effective in vivo drug delivery system for applications beyond Herpes.    Project 4 (PIs Sours and Stitzel) improved traceability of cocoa by "fingerprinting" through chemical signatures.  Methods of determining provenance based on chemical signatures within the bean or processed forms of cocoa (such as liquor, paste, powder) were identified and could increase the traceability of cocoa, ultimately improving the cocoa value chain.   Additional Projects: Two new tenure-track faculty members have initiated research projects supported by the UPLC-MS/MS.  One project (Nesbitt) focused on analysis of small neurochemicals important in modulating brain function. Neurochemicals are sampled using microdialysis probes, making samples easily compatible with UPLC-MS/MS. Detecting and qualifying multiple neurochemicals simultaneously from small brain regions could allow for discovery of neurochemical correlations associated with brain function, disease, and behavior.   The second project (Reber) used UPLC-MS/MS to obtain exact masses for the intermediates in a synthetic route to a safener degradation product.  The UPLC-MS/MS has also been used to characterize several new compounds in route to a cyclopropenone-containing natural product.   These projects have produced one published peer-reviewed manuscript.  Two additional manuscripts are in preparation and will be submitted by December 2018.  Data collection for a fourth manuscript is nearing completion, and methods for three projects are being developed.  Faculty have presented three invited talks, and students have presented two posters at national conferences, and one poster at the local level.  These projects have garnered ~$6,000 in competitive internal grants for faculty and ~$2,500 in competitive internal grants for students, as outlined below. Acquisition of an UPLC-MS/MS was also central to the success of two subsequent NSF awards (#1651536 and #1703796) to TU faculty valued at over $800,000.  In addition to the aforementioned scientific advancements, access to the UPLC-MS/MS  has also  1) supported current and projected future student demand for research experiences, 2) provided hands-on instruction with modern instrumentation in advanced laboratory courses, 3) supported existing research endeavors and enhanced competitiveness in securing additional funding, 4) augmented the ability of the TU Chemistry Department to attract high-quality students and faculty, and 5) enhanced the training of a diverse, highly skilled scientific workforce in the State of Maryland and the broader Mid-Atlantic region.
