<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to unravel how matter in our Galaxy is transferred from stars, which create the majority of the chemical elements, to interstellar space. The PI and her students and collaborators will examine the chemical composition of material that eventually will create new solar systems.  This will provide insight into what becomes of the elements ejected from stars, including elements that are essential for life. The research is highly interdisciplinary, involving both observational and laboratory studies that interrelate astronomy, chemistry, planetary science, and physics. This research will be almost entirely conducted by graduate students, and this lab has been a fruitful training ground for future scientists.  The PI is also involved in the development of interdisciplinary courses in the physical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass loss from circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars and the more advanced, planetary nebulae (PNe) stage, is a major avenue by which the interstellar medium (ISM) is enriched in gas, dust, and the heavier elements. The chemical and physical characteristics of circumstellar shells and subsequent PNe thus have major impact on the overall life cycle of dense material in the ISM. The goals of this project are (1) to probe the physical and chemical properties of circumstellar envelopes and planetary nebulae to determine the extent of their molecular composition, and (2) to examine their morphological structures through radio/millimeter-wave astronomical observations. A further aim is to identify new molecules in these objects, in particular refractory species possibly linked to dust grains such as TiOH or FeC2, using laboratory spectroscopy followed by additional observations. The O-rich circumstellar shells to be studied include those of the supergiant S Persei and the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars TX Cam and R Cas, which will be investigated using the highly sensitive ALMA-type receivers at the Sub-millimeter Telescope (SMT) of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO), and the new ARO 12 meter ALMA-prototype antenna. Other molecules will be sought with the ARO facilities, with the purpose of examining the revolutionary concept that diffuse clouds are being populated with remnant molecular material from PNe.</AbstractNarration>

This white dwarf star emits extreme amounts of ultraviolet radiation, which is destructive to molecules and ionizes the surrounding gas ejected from the star. Planetary nebulae are known for their bright, ionized material which is visible to the eye, as shown in Figure 1. In this figure, an image in visible light of the planetary nebula M1-7 is shown, which clearly exhibits a bright center and a double-lobed bipolar structure. Our research has clearly demonstrated that molecular compounds of many different types exist in the planetary nebulae, mixed with the ionized matter, as shown in Figure 2. Here an image of the <span>HCN</span> molecule is shown, made with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), on the scale given by the red circle in Figure 1. The molecular gas traces the bright central part of M1-7. Our research therefore challenges many former ideas and theoretical predictions that molecules cannot exist in high radiation regions. Our observations of planetary nebulae has shown that interstellar chemistry is far more robust than previously thought, and that the molecular content of the universe may be far larger than any current predictions.</span></p> <p><span>Another aspect of this research has concerned the study of the chemical and physical properties of very massive stars- stars 30-40 times more massive than our sun. These types of stars are rare in our Galaxy, and eject massive amounts of material, which form an envelope around the star. &nbsp;We have used observations of molecules in the envelopes to unravel some of the stellar properties. We have found, for example, that phosphorus-containing molecules are common in these stars. &nbsp;We were also able to identify an unusual new chemical compound, vanadium oxide, or <span>VO</span>, in the envelope of the massive star <span>VY</span> Canis <span>Majoris</span>. This molecule contains the highly refractory element vanadium, which is thought to be condensed into the solid state in the form of dust grains. The appearance of <span>VO</span> suggests that the mass loss form <span>VY</span> <span>CMa</span> is very violent, causing dust grains to vaporize. The very energetic process by which massive stars eject material is not well-understood.</span></p> <p><span>During this project, we have also conducted laboratory spectroscopic measurements of unusual chemical compounds that might be present in interstellar space. We create these highly reactive radical species in the gas phase under near vacuum in special reaction chambers, and record their spectral fingerprints. One such instrument, a Fourier transform spectrometer, is shown in Figure 3. The radicals investigated live for fractions of seconds on Earth, but may be quite common in space because of its near-vacuum conditions. During this project, we measured the spectral fingerprints of such unusual compounds such as aluminum <span>dicarbide</span> (<span>AlC</span></span><sub>2</sub><span>), potassium oxide (KO), chromium carbide (<span>CrC</span>) and titanium oxide (<span>TiO</span>).
