<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professors John K. Snyder and Linda H. Doerrer of Boston University (BU) are developing a strong, healthy pipeline of young researchers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, which is critical to our national well-being. The REU site at Boston University hosts ten students each summer for a ten-week, state-of-the-art research program in the chemical sciences as applied to the general areas of human health and quality of life.  The focus is on providing research opportunities for students from four-year colleges, and especially, community colleges with little or no research opportunities. This REU program provides a full immersion laboratory experience that not only helps to train undergraduates in the research culture, but also stimulates young scientists to pursue research careers in STEM fields. Bringing this research opportunity to under-represented groups is a major emphasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the REU program at Boston University is in the chemical sciences, with research projects addressing problems in biology at the molecular level. Participants work in newly renovated laboratories.  They have access to the synthetic, analytical and computational resources of BU's leading research centers. The projects available to the participants cover the wide range of endeavors within the chemical sciences, including the design and synthesis of new nanomaterials for diagnostics and drug delivery, investigation of protein-protein interactions, design and synthesis of new drug candidates, spectroscopic detection and identification of human pathogens, computational modeling of protein aggregation, and many others. REU students choose from among 24 groups in BU's Departments of Chemistry, Biology, or Biomedical Engineering where they experience the breadth of chemistry-related research and are motivated to pursue careers in science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong>To remain intellectually and economically competitive in today?s world, the United States needs to invest in the size and diversity of its science and engineering workforce. In order to achieve this goal, as a nation, we must identify, encourage and develop scientific talent from populations long ignored ? under represented minorities, recent immigrants, and other economically disadvantaged, yet talented students. In keeping with this need, the goal of this REU program is to train undergraduates in and motivate them to pursue scientific careers. With REU experiences, students from 4-year colleges and community colleges with little or no research opportunities, will gain valuable research experiences, and smoothly transition into STEM careers.&nbsp; The track record from recent grant periods confirms the effectiveness of the NSF-REU program in general, and our program in particular, in addressing the need for a strong, flush pipeline of talented undergraduates seeking careers in scientific research. In this past grant period, 34 students were supported by this grant, including partial support for two students who had also received MARC funding which covered about 50% of their expenses. Of these students, 33 were first generation in college, and fifteen were community college students. Of the 18 students who completed their Bachelor?s degrees, ten have gone on to PhD programs in chemistry, biochemistry, or biophysics, two have entered medical school, and one is now a high school chemistry teacher. The remainder are now employed in the biotech or pharmaceutical industries. In the nine years combined of our REU programs, we have now hosted 96 students, 36 of whom have gone on to various graduate programs, and eight of whom have entered medical (7) or dental schools (1); four have become high school chemistry teachers. Our REU program focused on the theme of basic research in the chemical sciences addressing biological problems represents one of the most important interdisciplinary scientific fields today. Interdisciplinary training and a teamwork mentality were stressed during the summer internships, with a broad exposure to ALL aspects of interdisciplinary research. The career paths of our REU alumni, as with all successful REU programs is strong evidence of this critical training program in our society. These internships provide a pathway for talented students who need a level playing field so their latent skills can be allowed to shine.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/29/2019<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;K&nbsp;Snyder</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560152/1560152_10412869_1560438925403_Scott_Tria2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560152/1560152_10412869_1560438925403_Scott_Tria2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2016 - Group with Dr. Scott Tria (Novartis)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560152/1560152_10412869_1560438925403_Scott_Tria2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2016 - Group with Dr. Scott Tria (Novartis)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Eight (of 11) 2016 REU Participants with Dr. Scott Tria (Novartis).
