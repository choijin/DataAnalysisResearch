<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, the Teaching for Equity in Appalachia in Mathematics and Science, TEAMS, is recruiting undergraduate majors in mathematics, biology, chemistry, geology, or physics or mathematics or science professionals and preparing them to become grades 9-12 Mathematics or Science teachers. The project is funding 20-30 teachers over 4 years. In this project, Appalachian State University is collaborating with members of the Appalachian Public School Partnership, including Alleghany,  Alexander, and Avery County Schools.  Specific to the project is a focus on preparing teachers for the cultural contexts of teaching mathematics and science content in rural schools and development of leadership capacity among Noyce teachers through mentoring and course experiences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is based on the work of Shulman Pedagogical Content Knowledge developed in 1987 as further defined by Ball and Bass in their work of 2002, Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching, and the UTeach model developed  and practiced at the University of Texas at Austin. In addition to their Bachelor's degree in a science or math major, the Scholars will earn a Graduate Certificate in Secondary Teaching and a licensure for secondary teaching in the appropriate area.  Special attention will be paid to the formation of teacher cohorts in acknowledgement of the isolation often felt by teachers in the small rural schools typical of the area they will serve. Research concerning effective means of recruiting and retaining teachers in these small rural areas will be done using a mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative data collection) approach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The TEAMS (Teaching for Equity in Appalachia in Mathematics and Science) program at Appalachian State University, a Robert Noyce Scholarship program (National Science Foundation DUE: 1540830) supporting extraordinary mathematics and science majors in becoming teachers reflects the following outcomes related to its initial proposed aims.   Intellectual Merit:  In the TEAMS proposal, we expected to examine interactions of novice teachers and their mentors, particularly around culturally relevant pedagogy and opportunities to explore how rural community cultures interact with particular topics.   It was anticipated that understanding these interactions would contribute to better understanding teacher retention in rural areas.   Outcomes: During the initial implementation of the project, two developments in mentoring changed our approach in the project.  First, new state policies provided mentors to novice teachers in their school locations, increasing the likelihood that Scholars would receive mentoring that was appropriate for their school contexts beyond what program mentors could provide.  Additionally, Appalachian joined the Beginning Teacher Support Program, a state wide mentoring program for teachers within their first three years of teaching. As a result, the program was able to offer all new teachers access to the Beginning Teacher Support Program and to ensure the provision of a mentor regardless of location.  Mentoring did provide support for retention; in fact, the clustering impact of teaching in a school or district in which there were other Scholars or other teachers who had worked with the Scholars during their teacher education program was particularly effective. We continue to collect data on this as our beginning teachers participate in the network.   Broader Impacts: The TEAMS program has sought to better understand the needs of rural school partners related to secondary mathematics and science teaching.    Outcomes: A number of findings have impacted programmatic offerings and advising. Few partners offer more than one or two physics classes per year, meaning that teachers must teach multiple disciplines.  As a result, we have collaborated with the PhysTEC project in the Department of Physics and Astronomy to create a physics education minor that enables graduates in other licensure areas to develop capacity for teaching physics, creating the flexibility our partners need and marketability for teaching in rural areas.  While we originally sought to target professional development activities to rural teaching, we discovered that the rural context was interwoven in teacher education programming on our campus already and instead sought to promote opportunities in more targeted ways that aligned with our focus on rural.   Additional Outcomes:  After experimenting with multiple means of communication, we found our electronic newsletter to be effective in distributing information, and it has become a feature available to all program directors to share across all secondary mathematics and science students.  Further, we have recognized the key role that outreach can play in recruitment and that extracurricular activities can play in developing leadership and teaching capacity.  Expanding opportunities to engage in community and school outreach and exploring options for interacting with learners outside of the formal classroom have become key parts of advising Noyce Scholars.
