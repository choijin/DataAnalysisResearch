<AbstractNarration>1546589&lt;br/&gt;RPI&lt;br/&gt;Belfort&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER proposal is potentially a high risk high payoff effort as it involves a transformative, new approach to reduce non-specific protein-membrane surface interactions. Recently the PI discovered that membrane surface chirality influences filtration with protein solutions. A molecule is considered chiral if there exists another molecule that is of identical composition, but which is arranged in a non-superposable mirror image, i.e. similar to human hands.  Non-specific protein adhesion or protein fouling occurs with synthetic membrane filtration in bioprocessing, with marine structures and with medical devices. This undesired adhesion of proteins is a major technical and economic challenge. Reducing these limitations with chiral surfaces would be significant and have broad impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes that the surface should have the same chirality as a protein (the chiral hypothesis). The goals of the research are to (i) confirm, expand and investigate the role of chirality with respect to protein resistance, and (ii) determine if chiral membranes can fractionate enantiomers for small molecules. This radically different approach to possibly reducing protein fouling is in its early stages and is potentially transformative for bioprocessing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broader Impact: An exciting area of industrial separations in which synthetic filtration membranes have not been commercially applied is in the fractionation of enantiomers (i.e. a pair of chemical compounds whose molecular structures have a non-superimposable mirror-image relationship to each other like the D- and L- enantiomers found in nature), especially in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.  There are two methods by which enantiomerically pure chiral compounds can be produced.  The first is a selective reaction where the use of special synthetic methods result in the production of only one enantiomer.  These methods generally involve highly specialized catalysts and synthetic methods, which may preclude their use on any large scale industrially.  The second is the resolution of a racemic mixture (i.e. a solution of say 50% of each D- and L-enantiomers) into pure enantiomers through the use of a separating agent.  The prevailing separation method employed is chiral chromatography, in which enantiomers have different binding affinities for the chiral stationary phases (also called chiral resin) contained in these columns and therefore elute at different times.  High performing chiral resins contain three-dimensional chiral structures like those found in naturally occurring or synthetically made stereoregular polymers.  Chiral resins take advantage of a so-called three-point interaction, in which one interaction must be stereochemically dependent. These interactions usually entail combinations of p-p interactions and hydrogen bonding or even metal coordination.  The use of packed-bed chromatography, however, is severely limited by production capacity since the velocity of enantiomers through the column is very slow and it dilutes rather than concentrates the desired enantiomeric product.  A solution to this low production capacity and dilution problem would be to replace packed-bed chiral chromatography with synthetic membrane filtration, where flow rates could be greatly increased and the desired enantiomeric product is concentrated rather than diluted.  The challenge is to develop membranes with chiral selectivity to compete with chromatography.  This project has developed such chiral selective membranes, while educating and training graduate and other students (undergrads in chemical engineering and high school students from the QStar Program in the Capital district, NY).  Intellectual Merit: During this two year EAGER project, two approaches were used. The first approach during year 1, chiral monomers were grafted onto plasma treated poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membrane filtration step. PES membranes were chirally modified to separate chiral bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin. The unusual complexity of these biomolecules made it very difficult to draw informed conclusions on the chiral separation of these membranes. These proteins have many different chiral centers, hydrophobic, and charged regions which masked the chiral effect.  As a result, the experimental setup was simplified during the second year. In order to decouple the parameters affecting chiral separations in the first year, we: (1) used small molecule amino acid containing feed streams instead of proteins and (2) prepared chiral "ligand-exchange membranes" (membrane grafted with 3-D chiral structures with chiral copper-proline complexes).  Using pure D and L-phenylalanine instead of proteins in the feed stream, we verified that chirality is indeed the separating factor in these membranes since the only difference between the amino acids is one chiral center. These novel ligand exchange membranes fractionated chiral feed streams with acceptable separation factors. Ligand exchange chiral centers have previously been successfully used for chiral chromatography separations, but have not previously been applied to membranes.
