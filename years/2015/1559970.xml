<AbstractNarration>The past decades have produced enormous advancements in biological sciences that have increased the understanding of the human body and led to a host of new research opportunities, ranging from drug design and the development of next-generation medical implants to facilitating remote medical care. Students from a range of engineering disciplines are primed to meet the challenges presented by these new research opportunities and can apply their diverse knowledge, experiences and skills to improve an array of human health concerns. The REU Site: "Advancing Human Health: From Nano to Network" at the University of Rochester will provide intensive research experiences for underrepresented minority and women engineering students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, Hispanic-serving Institutions, and non research-intensive institutions. The aim is to provide beneficial mentoring to these students, to help retain and encourage them to pursue such research in future graduate programs and industry careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the Site is the substantive and meaningful involvement of underrepresented minority and women undergraduate students in high-level research. As a nurturing tier-1 research institution, the University of Rochester (UR) will provide exemplary undergraduate research experiences to students who are particularly underrepresented in the STEM fields. The REU Site program will help students develop a personal investigative learning style, practice and learn appropriate research methods and ethics, and develop strong oral and written communication skills. The primary focus will be full-time hands-on scientific research as a member of an established research team. Participants will complete an independent research project in one of the following areas: 1) biomaterials, 2) medical optics for breast cancer, 3) biomedical ultrasound tissue engineering, 4) auditory engineering, 5) dental biomechanics, 6) polymers for biomedical applications, 7) biosensors, 8) robots for rehabilitation, and 9) optics for medical applications. Each student will have a specific research problem, a faculty adviser, and a professional adviser in the UR Kearns Center. The program will include: high level research opportunities for students historically underrepresented in engineering (at least 75% of the participants); extensive professional development opportunities; career development and a demystification of the graduate school process; and a range of networking and mentoring opportunities. The students will also be exposed to other research areas through a series of oral presentations and engagement in a poster session.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over the past 3 years, the REU Site: Advancing Human Health from Nano to Network has assisted 36 students in increasing their exposure to high quality research and mentorship in a set of multi-disciplinary fields. Over the course of 3 years, we have worked with over 20 faculty members who have submitted over 40 projects for REU students to work on. Seventy-two percent (72%) of the participants were underrepresented minority in STEM. Through the creation of a holistic summer research community at our institution, students were provided exposure to research, professional development and cultural diversity which helped inform their experiences. From three years of evaluation data, we found that 73% of REU participants indicated that they benefited greatly from learning how to use tools and a variety of techniques to answer research questions in the field of engineering through the REU site. Seventy-five percent (75%) of REU participants indicated that they benefited a great extent from the program?s ability to teach the participants to understand how researchers think and work on problems. Participating in the program provided the largest benefits to students increased academic self-confidence (75% of participants) and learning to work independently (78% of participants). All 36 participants attended the required professional development workshops led by graduate students and faculty. In addition, 67% participated in GRE prep and signed up for continued graduate admissions assistance. Lastly, all 36 REU participants completed a faculty-led research project and presented a poster and lighting talk at the end of the summer to the University of Rochester Community.</p> <p>&nbsp;Please enjoy this overview video that shows the work of our scholars presenting at our annual summer undergraduate research symposium: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Az6rIfbfWw" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/-Az6rIfbfWw</a>.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Beth&nbsp;Olivares</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559970/1559970_10459593_1582903842005_reu-nano-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559970/1559970_10459593_1582903842005_reu-nano-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student works in lab"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559970/1559970_10459593_1582903842005_reu-nano-2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student works in lab"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student researcher with faculty member</div> <div class="imageCredit">UR communications</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Beth&nbsp;Olivares</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student works in lab</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
