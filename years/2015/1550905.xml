<AbstractNarration>In June 2014, with support from NSF, the first ComputEL workshop was held in conjunction with the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) in Baltimore, Maryland. The goal of that workshop was to serve as an initial meeting point between computer scientists and computational linguists active in ACL and documentary linguists engaged in work on endangered languages. This proposal seeks to build on lessons learned in the first ComputEL workshop, and to encourage new collaborations between the two research communities. Contemporary efforts to document the world's endangered languages are dependent on the widespread availability of modern recording technologies, in particular digital audio and video recording devices and software to annotate the recordings that such devices produce. However, despite well over a decade of funding programs dedicated to the documentation of endangered languages, the technological landscape that supports the activities of those involved in this work remains fragmented, and the promises of new technology remain largely unfulfilled. Moreover, the efforts of computer scientists, on the whole, are mostly disconnected from the day-to-day work of documentary linguists, making it difficult for the knowledge of each group to inform the other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second ComputEL workshop will address this state of affairs by bringing together field linguists and computer scientists to explore how computational techniques and tools can be created to better aid in the analysis of endangered languages. A particular focus will be on how to facilitate the process through which research results in this domain can be developed into software that is well-supported for use by those documenting endangered languages in the field. The workshop will be co-located with the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) in Austin, Texas, in October 2016. This will allow it to reach a wider audience than would otherwise be possible, while taking advantage of its location to involve participants from nearby areas. On the first day, participants will take part in discussions as part of a closed meeting that will be designed to lay out a near-term agenda for the improved application of computational methods to the study of endangered languages. The second day will consist of research presentations scheduled jointly with the main EMNLP conference. The papers from the workshop will be published in the Association for Computational Linguistics conference proceedings, and an additional report will be produced summarizing the conclusions of the closed meeting. Smaller speaker communities worldwide will benefit from the results which will support better documentation and preservation of endangered languages.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2017, the ComputEL-2 workshop was successfully held at the campus of the University of Hawaii Manoa, co-located with the International Conference on Language Documentation &amp; Conservation (ICLDC), a major conference in the documentary linguistics and endangered language communities. At the workshop, 12 research papers were presented in oral form, and 11 were presented as posters. Remarks and a Q&amp;A session were held by the NSF DEL program manager. Two panel discussions were held, along with multiple break sessions. The workshop succeeded in bringing together members of the computer science and documentary linguistics communities along with community-based indigenous researchers. Papers were subsequently published at the open-access ACL Anthology.  In 2019, the ComputEL-3 workshop was successfully held at the campus of the University of Hawaii Manoa, again co-located with ICLDC. At the workshop, 19 research papers were presented in oral form. A discussion session was held, along with multiple break sessions. The workshop succeeded in bringing together members of the computer science and documentary linguistics communities along with community-based indigenous researchers. Papers were subsequently published at the open-access ACL Anthology.  This project succeeded in its primary goal of bringing together of participants from three diverse communities (computer science - especially natural language processing /  computational linguistics; linguistics, especially documentary linguistics; and indigenous and endangered language communities) in order to initiate cross-polination of ideas and methodologies.   By co-locating the ComputEL workshops with ICLDC increased the actual impact of this project by drawing in to ComputEL various participants of ICLDC from the documentary linguistics and endangered language community who ordinarily would not attend events in the computer science and *ACL communities. Within the disciplines of NLP/CL, the impact of this project can directly observed in dozens of publications presented at the ComputEL workshops. This project provided a concrete venue where work at the intersection of endangered languages and NLP could be presented.  Importantly, this project provided a space for discussion between participants of these various communities; this space allowed for a sensitive exchange of assumptions, hopes, and fears amongst these very disparate communities.   Participants from the NLP community were made aware of the historical perspective of indigenous language communities, and were made sensitive to the fears of some such communities of outside exploitation. Participants from the documentary linguistics community were able to communicate pain points in the documentation pipeline to members of the CS and NLP/CL communities; collaborations growing out of such collaboration are likely to make an impact on valuable but time-consuming tasks such as transcription and search capabilities for indigenous communities of historical written and oral archives of community elders.
