<AbstractNarration>1535931&lt;br/&gt;Silver, Pamela    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from the National Science Foundation is requested for the 'Synthetic Biology: Engineering, Evolution and Design (SEED) Conference 2015' to be held at the Boston Park Plaza in Boston, MA from June 10-13, 2015. The SEED Conference is being organized under the auspices of the Society of Biological Engineering of the Americal Institute of Chemical Engineers. The conference provides leadership in the development of Synthetic Biology and serves to broaden participation by appealing to broad sectors in industry and academia focusing specifically to include young investigators and those outside of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEED2015 is the second in an annual series of meetings held to address researchers from industry and academia in the area of Synthetic Biology. The field of Synthetic Biology is highly interdisciplinary with faculty and students spread across departments that focus on engineering (biological, chemical, electrical, mechanical, civil, computer science) and basic science (biology and systems biology, chemistry, physics. The conference provides a forum for discussions on Synthetic Biology across these disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is co-sponsered by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division and by the Synthetic and Systems Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology.</AbstractNarration>

This was the second conference of the SEED series that focuses on advances in the science and technology emerging from the field of synthetic biology.  We broadly defined this as technologies that accelerate the process of genetic engineering.  The conference highlighted new tool development, as well as the application of these tools to diverse problems in biotechnology, including therapeutics, industrial chemicals and fuels, natural products, and agriculture, with systems spanning from in vitro experiments and viruses, through diverse bacteria, to eukaryotes (yeast, mammalian cells, plants).  The SEED Conference Series is the first conference series to serve as a regularly occurring meeting that functions as a reliable place to pull together the involved disciplines to organize and exchange advances in the science and technology in the field.  SEED 2015 was made possible in part due to a generous National Science Foundation, Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (NSF CBET) for Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering.  Grant 1535931 ("Synthetic Biology: Engineering, Evolution and Design (SEED) Conference 2015") supported the registration and/or travel expenses of some of students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty that presented their work at SEED 2015.  Expanding from the first conference, SEED 2015 brought together 413 attendees from academia, industry, government/national laboratories and professional organizations.  The conference boasted about 45 speakers, including a dedicated student session and keynotes consisting of Pam Silver (Harvard University), Jennifer Doudna (UC Berkeley), Martin Fussenegger (ETH Zurich).  There were also over 195 posters presented across two poster sessions.  The conference was organized by a team of experts in the field of synthetic biology.  Led by the chairs, Dan Gibson (Synthetic Genomics/J. Craig Venter Institute) and Pam Silver (Harvard University), the organizing committee helped design the program through topic and speaker selection, and the steering committee helped ensure the quality of all abstracts and speakers.

The diverse application areas extend the expertise further, needing people from areas such as plant biology, agriculture and soil science, environmental science, medicine, and the chemical industry.  SEED 2015 represented the interdisciplinary topics of synthetic biology with the following sessions:  Systems Modelling Biomedical Applications Biological Circuits and Context Metabolism, Metabolomics and Engineering Metabolism Sensors Advancing Synthetic Biology Tools, Automation and Analytical Technologies DNA and RNA Based Synthetic Biology Minimal Systems Biological Parts Microbial Communities and Microbiome Genomics     Additional information on the conf...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
