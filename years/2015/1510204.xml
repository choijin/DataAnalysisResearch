<AbstractNarration>Topology is the study of objects up to rubbery stretching, and geometry the study of rigid bodies. The goal of this project is to understand certain fundamental problems in these areas by combining surprising relationships between them with deep connections to other areas of mathematics and computer science. Both topology and geometry are becoming more important to applications such as data mining, and this project includes collaboration with computer scientists as well as developing software for exploring aspects of these problems which will be freely available to other researchers via the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on four topics. The first is effective Mostow rigidity and torsion growth, specifically, the extent to which topological and geometric properties of hyperbolic 3-manifolds can be varied independently. The second is the computational complexity of finding the genus of a knot in the 3-sphere, in particular whether it can be determined in polynomial time. The third question is whether there exists a word-hyperbolic surface-by-surface group. The final topic is to elucidate the relationships between Heegaard-Floer homology, group orderability, and taut foliations for 3-manifolds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of the work done under this grant aimed to elucidate the relationships between the topology and geometry of 3-dimensional manifolds in their &lrm;myriad of guises.  One key finding of the PI with Jeffrey Brock is a very closed linkage between topological versus geometrical measures of the size of surfaces in 3-dimensional manifolds; this was part of the research focus of effective Mostow rigidity and torsion growth.  Another key finding of the PI with Marc Culler is a systematic method for studying actions of 3-manifold groups on the line using only two-by-two matrices. The latter work was expanded upon by PhD student Xinghua Gao and here the motivation was understanding the relationships between Heegaard Floer homology, group orderability, and taut foliations for 3-manifolds.  Additionally, study was made of knots (loops of rope in 3-space), particularly of the properties of large random knots in the work of PhD student Malik Obeidin; one specific result was that the hyperbolic volume of a random alternating knot grows linearly in the number of crossings.  Another focus of this grant was computational experiments, including the continued development of the program SnapPy for studying the important class of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  Additionally, the PI made a census of exceptional Dehn fillings, a topic which has been a major focus of the field in the last forty years.
