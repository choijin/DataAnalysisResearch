<AbstractNarration>Through its project, Engineered for Success: Engineering Technician Training for Rural Arizona, Yavapai College (YC) will implement enhancements to its Applied Pre-engineering Program to increase capacity, improve student learning, and respond to industry's need for highly-skilled engineering technicians. As indicated by the project title, the focus will be on improving opportunities for students in rural Arizona communities.  A new pathway leading to certification as an Integrated Systems Engineering Technician will be incorporated into an existing Applied Pre-engineering Program. The new pathway will help students gain a deeper understanding of complex systems and how they are connected and work together. The introduction of problem-based learning (PBL) pedagogy will help students connect diverse knowledge from multiple courses to solve real-world challenges.  New internship opportunities will give students exposure to the actual work environment. Nine stackable industry-recognized credentials, three certificates and two Associates Degrees will give students options for employment in middle skills jobs or additional postsecondary education.  Outreach events targeting rural high school students will be expanded and a summer Robotics Camp for middle school girls will be instituted with the aim of increasing enrollment of female students in the program. A marketing campaign will improve parents', teachers' and students' access to information about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers and training programs. The improved Applied Pre-engineering Program, which will include an early college program for high school students, will incorporate best practice student support strategies, such as on-site tutoring and expanded access to applied learning using modern equipment.  The actions to be undertaken in this project were determined as a result of a preliminary assessment of the YC Applied Pre-engineering Program that was developed and implemented based upon the STEM Pathways Guide, which was developed by Science Foundation Arizona (SFAz).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goals of the Engineered for Success: Engineering Technician Training for Rural Arizona project are to: 1) produce more qualified engineering technicians to meet workforce demands, and 2) improve engineering technician education.  Strategies for accomplishing these broad goals include, but are not limited to, assuring technician training meets industry needs by engaging an Industry Advisory Council, increasing enrollment and course capacity, raising awareness and interest through targeted outreach efforts, and improving teaching to more strongly demonstrate relevance and practical industry applications.  Attainment of anticipated outcomes will be assessed using institutional data to measure quantitative impacts of the project (e.g. enrollment, degrees/certificates completed, demographic changes, etc.) and surveys to gauge  qualitative impacts (e.g. changes in teaching practices, student attitudes/perceptions).  As a member of Science Foundation Arizona's STEM Pathways Network, YC will seek to demonstrate the applicability of and expand knowledge about the organization's STEM Pathways Model through this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Goal 1: YC will produce more qualified engineering technicians to meet workforce demand.   Goal 1 Findings - There is still more demand from companies than there is student interest in the areas.  That is an interesting lesson learned as it pertains to goals of this grant. The jobs are there, but student willingness to enter these programs has been spotty, despite plenty of marketing.  YC very much put effort into marketing the programs, and when an unanticipated company came forward looking to hire as an upstart, students benefitted from the program and a guaranteed placement.  When that company went under, YC lost a great deal of momentum. What is troubling is that this happened even though we had other companies at the table with slots available.  When the company (RESA) collapsed, YC did step up and get those students impacted access to scholarships if they wanted to continue the program.  Some took advantage of it, and just graduated from the program this May, as they opted for the full degree at that point instead of the certificate that they were previously in.  I do not have information on how their job seeking is going, as COVID has been a monumental setback on many fronts, especially when it comes to companies hiring right now.   Although Yavapai College did a considerable number of changes to the program, and produced more technicians, we were unable to produce enough technicians to meet the workforce demand.  Students were readily employed by a variety of companies in both rural Arizona and the metropolitan Phoenix area, but with the rapid advancement of automation across all industries, it is becoming clear that this is a herculean effort, and there are now bidding wars for graduates.  We just don't have enough. That said, there also aren't enough programs in Arizona to meet the needs that continue to grow.  Our understanding is that this is a nationwide issue.  YC does have strong partnerships with 7 local high schools who send students to the college for the program. However, most convert to the core engineering track upon graduation from high school instead of the Engineering Tech track.  This is an issue that YC is addressing through increased dialog with the students on the front end of program entrance.    Goal 2: Improve engineering technician education (technical skills and general STEM preparation) and success by implementing new and instructional approaches and student support services.   Goal 3: Improve engineering technician education by increasing industry engagement.  Goal 2/3 Findings -  In 2017, YC brought together 4 different industry advisory boards to re-tool portions of the programs and create a more rounded technician. The groups were from welding, automation/electrical instrumentation, industrial plant maintenance, and CNC machining.  This worked very well, and the dynamic was interesting to watch, as we allowed them to look at all of the courses that were related to the area, and carve out what they thought were the most relevant for a technician.   Not everyone emerged a winner, but YC did get consensus on what we needed to do to get the best degree and certificate that we could have.  YC was surprised that the group did not select our robotics courses, but they indicated that they did not see enough of it yet to warrant being "all in". We have brought the discussion back around again, and it looks like there is enough momentum to make that change going forward.  We have already ordered our first robotic welding machines to help in this process.   By stepping aside and letting industry make the decision on how the program needed to look, we learned a lot about not only how they feel about each other's areas, but how territorial they can be with their areas.  There was a lot of give and take, and the Dean served more as a "moderator" for the process, guiding the group through areas where they seemed to reach an impasse.   YC is continuing to see program benefits dealing with companies that have the need for trained employees.  A recent company, Combat Systems, is relocating to our area from San Diego due to the programs that we have to train their employees.  They have broken ground on a new facilty, and will open in April of 2021.  They have asked us to participate in paid internships, much like what this grant focused on.  We hope that this new company moving to Arizona will generate interest in the area. We are losing far too many of our grads to the large metropolitan areas.
