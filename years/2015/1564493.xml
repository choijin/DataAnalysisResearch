<AbstractNarration>This award supports collaborative research efforts in the area of materials science by an interdisciplinary team comprising pure mathematicians, applied mathematicians, computer scientists, and physicists. Answers to natural questions about the stability and rigidity of material structures involve understanding the geometry of their components.  Recent advances in materials synthesis have emphasized the need for a deeper understanding of the geometric stability of physical structures at the atomic scale and the need for insight at all scales, from atomic to macroscopic. Key mathematical tools for this analysis come from the area of "rigidity theory," which studies the mathematical properties of discrete sets of points with the distances between certain pairs of points held fixed or constrained by distance inequalities. Rigidity theory lies at the nexus of discrete geometry, graph theory, and algorithms, and it has deep connections to semidefinite programming and convex geometry.  This project aims to deepen understanding of the stability of material structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic explanation of tunneling between asymmetric stable configurations of two-dimensional disordered materials, such as glass. Construction of accurate mechanistic and computational models requires deep mathematical analysis and development of appropriate algorithms. A second goal is to develop methods for predicting the stability, configurational entropy, and kinetics of small short-ranged-potential systems in three dimensions. Examples of such distance-constraint systems include small molecular structures, as well as colloidal clusters, containing a few particles bound together by reversible attractive interactions, modeled as sticky spheres. What kinds of rigid configurations are there, and what are computationally feasible tests for their rigidity? How do these particles move and the structures deform? There is a tight link between rigidity theory and the general convexity and duality properties of the positive semidefinite cone, a central concept in numerical optimization. Finding a recursive decomposition of a generically rigid framework into rigid subsystems is a longstanding problem. Additionally, matroid theory, important in rigidity theory, has made the characterization of rigid systems more approachable and more algorithmically efficient. Rigidity theory could have implications for algorithms for low-rank matrix completion as well. These connections, questions, and implications will be explored in this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     A tensegrity is a finite collection of points in a Euclidean space, where some pairs of points are joined by inextensible cables, while some other pairs are joined by struts that cannot be shortened in length.  The cables and struts constrain the possible shape of the configuration of points.  There is wide range of definitions that can be applied to what it means to be rigid. The most fundamental is infinitesimal rigidity, which essentially linearizes the distance constraints, and asks that these linear equations have a unique solution corresponding only to translations and rotations. In the engineering literature this is very basic and is commonly understood to mean rigidity.  There is also the very basic question as to whether there is another configuration in the same dimension, not congruent to the given configuration, that still satisfies the distance constraints. If there is no such configuration, then we say that the tensegrity is globally rigid in its given Euclidean space.  A very simple example of this is a square with a cable on each edge, and a strut for each diagonal.  This tensegrity is both infinitesimally rigid and globally rigid in the plane.  Indeed, if the cables and struts are reversed it is still infinitesimally rigid, but not globally rigid in the plane.  Another important concept for tensegrities is universal rigidity. That means that there is no other configuration, other than congruent copies, in any higher dimension that satisfies the cable and strut distance constraints.  The square with cables on edges is not only globally rigid in the plane, but it is universally rigid as well.  Universal rigidity has a surprisingly complete description as shown in  ?Iterative universal rigidity? in Discrete Comput. Geom. 53.4 (2015), pp. 847?877 by Connelly and Gortler.  Furthermore, the notions of global and universal rigidity are closely related.  A configuration of points is called generic if there is no non-zero algebraic polynomial relation among its coordinates.  Computing whether a tensegrity is globally rigid for a given configuration can be quite difficult.  But if the configuration is generic, it can be much easier.  Indeed, for a tensegrity, whose configuration of points is generic, computing its global rigidity can reduce to the calculation of the rank of a matrix that is part of determining its universal  rigidity.  Indeed, ?Generically globally rigid graphs have generic universally rigid frameworks? in Combi- natorica 40.1 (2020), pp. 1?37, by Connelly, Gortler and Theran shows some of the intimate connection.    Tensegrities have been built as pieces of art and exhibited in museusms all over the world, especially by the artist Kenneth Snelson.  The struts seem to hang in mid air.  Their rigidity is nicely explained in terms  infinitesimal and universal rigidity.  It's why they don't fall down.  But there are other instances where the concepts of rigidity come to play.  If a packing of circular disks are in the plane, the condition that the disks do not overlap can be regarded as strut constraints between their centers.  So if the packing lies in some container, when its density is maximal, this has the effect of rigidifying at least a portion of the packing, and the tools of rigidity theory can be brought to bear.  For example "Packings of equal disks in a square torus". (English in Discrete Comput. Geom. 58 (2017), no. 3, 614?642. by Connelly, Funkhouser, Kuperberg, and Solomonides, (including three undergraduates at the time) showed that that any packing of a finite number of equal disks in the square torus (that is, the quotient of the plane by the integer lattice) has density smaller than pi/sqrt{12)=0.9069.  And ?Rigidity for sticky discs? in Proc.

This is a key part in the famous Koebe?Andreev?Thurston (KAT) theory of circle packings that formed a basis of Thurston?s approach to his theory of three-manifolds.
