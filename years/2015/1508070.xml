<AbstractNarration>Investigators in the field of molecular recognition study the non-covalent interactions between two (or more) molecules with the aim of understanding the driving forces behind these associations. With this information in hand, it is possible to develop a set of rules for the design of molecules (ligands) capable of specific binding interactions with other target molecules (receptors). DNA has long been viewed as an important macromolecular target for the binding of small molecule ligands, and indeed there are numerous examples of natural and designed molecules that associate with the minor groove of DNA. However, no general paradigm currently exists for the design of major groove-binding small molecules. Since most of the DNA-binding proteins that regulate cellular processes associate with the major groove of DNA, a great need exists for the development of major groove ligands that may directly influence DNA binding-initiated cellular events. Using the tools of fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry, this study helps uncover a set of design principles for crafting such ligands from simple carbohydrate and aromatic starting materials. The project also provides hands-on training in organic synthesis, molecular spectroscopy and microcalorimetry for undergraduate and graduate students, including those from groups traditionally underrepresented in science. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the project may lead to new procedures and protocols that can be adapted for use in the undergraduate chemistry laboratory curriculum at Northridge, which is expected to increase student interest in interface sciences such as chemical biology, bioorganic chemistry and medicinal chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bicyclic aryl C,O-glycosides are naturally occurring molecular wedges that may be used as rigid intercalating scaffolds to position functional groups in proximity to the discriminatory edges of the A/T and G/C base pairs in the major groove of DNA. The unique architecture of this ligand allows an examination of the utility of base-complementary functional groups at C.2 and C.4 of the carbohydrate unit for sequence specific DNA binding. The research project involves: (1) the synthesis of a series of bis(morindone-C,O-glycosides) containing patterns of carbonate, carbamate, guanidine and carbamimidate recognition elements complementary to the 4 base-pair sequences 5'-CGCG-3', 5'-CATG-3', 5'-CGGC-3', 5'-CAAC-3', and 5'-CGTG-3', respectively, (2) the assessment of both the DNA binding affinity and sequence selectivity of the ligands for diverse nucleic acid polymers and DNA hairpins using fluorescent intercalator displacement assays, (3) the measurement of the thermodynamic parameters (deltaH and deltaS) for the tightest ligand-DNA combinations using isothermal titration calorimetry in order to optimize the structure of the ligands, and (4) the evaluation of the ability of these ligands to inhibit the binding of the transcription factor AP-1 to its consensus site by EMSA assay, which may shed light on the potential usefulness of this class of compounds for regulating cellular processes.</AbstractNarration>

It was envisioned that such a structure would allow the optimal interaction of the molecule with the edges of the base pairs, which are an information-rich site on the surface of DNA; this is also the crucial first step in being able to develop agents capable of binding specific regions of DNA known to influence the expression of genes. The first total syntheses of the glycosides alvaradoin E and F, uveoside, and 10-epi-uveoside were accomplished in 11 steps from suitable carbohydrate and aromatic precursors (see overview1, Figure 1 and Scheme 1).<br /><br /></li> <li>The four molecules were evaluated for the DNA-binding ability by established spectroscopic techniques. In comparison to a reference compound known to associate strongly with DNA, these four glycosides were shown to possess poor affinity for DNA. Further experiments utilizing the technique of isothermal titration calorimetry, which measures the heat absorbed or released upon binding, confirmed that the four glycosides associate only weakly with nucleic acids. The calorimetry results also indicated that the carbohydrate units, which are highly hydrophilic (possess a strong association with water) disfavor binding in the grooves of DNA, which are hydrophobic (water-avoiding), and that this tendency is not efficiently offset by the presence of the hydrophobic aromatic units. Furthermore, it was found that the four glycosides possess significant affinity for proteins (such as human serum albumins, HSA), indicating the potential for off-target binding and thus motivating a move away from this structural scaffold for the future development of DNA-binding molecules (see overview2, Figures 2 and 3).<br /><br /></li> <li>To further pursue the development of DNA major groove-binding agents, we prepared monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, and sterically bulky derivatives of the triphenylmethane dye crystal violet (CV); these molecules possess hydrophobic aromatic rings and positively charged dimethylamino groups capable of interacting with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA.&nbsp; Unlike the C-glycosides described above, these molecules were easily prepared in two steps from commercially available starting materials (see overview3, Figure 4).<br /><br /></li> <li>The CV derivatives have been evaluated for DNA binding affinity, sequence selectivity, and binding mode by spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques. It was found that trimeric derivative <strong>1e</strong> binds DNA with high (10<sup>8 </sup>M<sup>-1</sup>) affinity in the major groove; furthermore, it prefers to bind non-alternating AT-rich DNA sequences over GC-rich DNA by almost an order of magnitude. This is indicative of shape-selective binding, with the sterically bulky molecule associating more strongly with the wider major groove of AT-rich DNA over the narrower major groove of GC-rich DNA (see overview3, Figure 5). Building on this result, we evaluated the binding of monomeric CV derivatives containing a series of bulky structural elements "toluyl" (methylphenyl) and "naphthyl" rings in place of phenyl rings. It was found that a mononaphthyl CV derivative displayed both good affinity and very good sequence selectivity for DNA, preferring to bind the AT-rich oligonucleotide A5T5 over the GC-rich oligonucleotide G5C5 by greater than an order of magnitude (a factor of 22; see overview4, Figure 6).&nbsp; Due the small size of the molecule, this level of sequence discrimination is remarkable, and motivates further exploration of shape-selective binding of DNA by small molecules as a means of developing gene-regulating agents. </li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/03/2020<br>      Modified by: Thomas&nbsp;Minehan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1508070/1508070_10391896_1604453399687_overview1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1508070/1508070_10391896_1604453399687_overview1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="overview1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1508070/1508070_10391896_1604453399687_overview1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="overview1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1 and Scheme 1</div> <div class="imageCredit">Thomas Minehan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Thomas&nbsp;Minehan</div> <div class="imageTitle">overview1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1508070/1508070_10391896_1604453452814_overview2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1508070/1508070_10391896_1604453452814_overview2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="overview2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1508070/1508070_10391896_1604453452814_overview2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="overview2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figures 2 and 3</div> <div class="imageCredit">Thomas Minehan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Thomas&nbsp;Minehan</div> <div class="imageTitle">overview2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1508070/1508070_10391896_1604453587038_overview3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1508070/1508070_10391896_1604453587038_overview3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="overview3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1508070/1508070_10391896_1604453587038_overview3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="overview3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figures 4 and 5</div> <div class="imageCredit">Thomas Minehan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Thomas&nbsp;Minehan</div> <div class="imageTitle">overview3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1508070/1508070_10391896_1604453655591_overview4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1508070/1508070_10391896_1604453655591_overview4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="overview4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1508070/1508070_10391896_1604453655591_overview4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="overview4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 6</div> <div class="imageCredit">Thomas Minehan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Thomas&nbsp;Minehan</div> <div class="imageTitle">overview4</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
