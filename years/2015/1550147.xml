<AbstractNarration>Although plate tectonics provides a first-order explanation of the origin of mountain belts, the tectonic processes that drive surface the uplift and exhumation of mountain belts are not well understood. Even less well understood are the interactions of between uplift, erosional processes, and climate that shape the mountain landscape. This project uses state-of-the art to examine the interaction of tectonics, erosion, and climate in the Peruvian Andes to test new and controversial ideas concerning the uplift of the Andes. The project advances desired societal outcomes through: (1) full participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM through support of an female researchers and students plus outreach programs to high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities; (2) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with STEM through participation of outreach programs that provide research experiences for high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities ; (3) development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through undergraduate and graduate student training and support of several early career researchers; and (4) increased partnerships through international collaboration. The Division of Earth Sciences Tectonics and Geomorphology &amp; Land Use Dynamics Programs and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering supported this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth's surface topography responds directly to mantle processes and plate tectonics, controls surface drainage and sediment transport patterns, and influences atmospheric circulation and climate. As the type example of ocean-continent subduction-generated high topography, the Central Andes are critical to evaluating geodynamic models of orogenesis. Although previous studies of the structural history, past elevations, and incision record have provided important insights on surface uplift, these studies also suggest a disparate range of uplift histories and associated tectonic drivers. Current geodynamic models for Andean orogenesis include: (1) continuous late Cenozoic crustal thickening and shortening, resulting in gradual surface uplift and canyon incision; (2) late Cenozoic delamination of South American lithosphere, resulting in rapid surface uplift and a late Miocene pulse of incision; and (3) early Cenozoic contraction-driven crustal thickening, resulting in near modern elevations in the west by late Eocene and propagating deformation eastward through the Cenozoic. To distinguish between models, this project uses: (1) stable isotope analyses of volcanic glasses and soil carbonates to provide quantitative estimates of paleoelevations over time, coupled with geochronology to constrain timing; (2) isotope-enabled general circulation modeling to determine how changing elevations affected climate and to quantitatively interpret stable isotope data, constrained by modern elevation-isotope and climate-isotope relationships; (3) data-validated fluvial erosion modeling to predict the erosional response to different models; and (4) fluvial and lacustrine sedimentology and sediment provenance to identify changes in drainage system extent and basin development. By synthesizing these data, the research team will quantify surface topography and erosion during orogenic evolution and distinguish between proposed tectonic and climatic controls.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary objective of this project was to better understand the elevation history of the Wester Cordillera in Southern Peru. The Western Cordillera is a mountain belt containing active volcanoes (Figure 1) resulting from subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate.  In southern Peru, another mountain belt, the Eastern Cordillera is separated from the Western Cordillera by a high elevation, internally drained plateau, the Altiplano.  The hydrogen isotope composition (typically reported as &delta;D values) of ancient water is commonly used to determine past elevations because in many regions &delta;D decreases substantially with increasing elevation. The first component of this study was to investigate the modern relationship between &delta;D values of water and elevation in this region. We chose to focus on soil water because it provides an approximation of the average isotopic composition of rainfall. We excavated soil pits (Figure 2) across the Andes in southern Peru to collect soil samples from 80 cm depth for measurement of soil water &delta;D values.   Samples of volcanic deposits from explosive volcanic eruptions (ignimbrites) were also collected (Figure 3).  The &delta;D values of volcanic glass from these deposits were also measured, providing information about past elevations of the Andes.   Our sampling allowed us to reconstruct profiles of &delta;D values across the Andes for modern and recent times and extending back 25 million years. The modern profile of the Andes exhibits large variations in &delta;D values. The region between the coast and crest of the Western Cordillera is exceptionally dry and is associated with high &delta;D values. &delta;D values decrease abruptly near the crest of the Western Cordillera, remain low, but variable across the Altiplano and the increase down the eastern flank of the Eastern Cordillera. We have determined that the abrupt &delta;D shift at the crest of the Western Cordillera represents the mixing between air masses. Moisture from the Amazon is carried over the Eastern Cordillera, across the Altiplano but does not make it any further than the crest of the Western Cordillera. Moisture from the Pacific Ocean is almost entirely recycled as it moves across the hyperarid region to the southwest of the WC crest (Figure 4).  Some Pacific moisture is funneled up large, Pacific-draining canyons and reaches the WC crest where it mixes with Amazonian moisture (Figure 5).  The alignment of the highest topography with this moisture-source divide suggest that we can identify where the highest topography was in the past by studying the &delta;D values of ancient meteoric water recorded by volcanic glass. Our results suggest that before 15 million years ago the crest of the Western Cordillera was 100 km further inland from the Pacific than it is today. The migration of the crest to its current position occurred within a couple million years.  These findings and some of the fundamentals of field-based investigations of mountains, including their influence on climate, was communicated to 18 University of Texas students on a week-long field trip across the Peruvian Andes (Figure 6).
