<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics &amp; Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Lin Pu of the Department of Chemistry at University of Virginia is developing new enantioselective fluorescent sensors for the recognition of chiral amines in perfluorocarbon solvents (fluorous phase).  These sensors are used to facilitate the high throughput screening of chiral catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines that are useful in the synthesis of organic compounds of pharmaceutical and biological importance.  This project provides extensive education and training for graduate and undergraduate students in areas such as organic synthesis, spectroscopic study, and catalyst development.  This group also participates in an outreach program to carry out chemistry-based demonstrations for elementary school students and teachers.  This outreach program is dedicated to providing inquiry-based chemistry instruction at the elementary school level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enantioselective fluorescent sensors containing perfluoroalkyl chains are expected to be more soluble in fluorous solvents than in common organic solvents.  They are used to conduct the enantioselective fluorescent recognition of functional chiral amines such as diamines, amino alcohols and amino acids in fluorous solvents.  Pseudoenantiomeric pairs of such sensors are prepared.  In each pair there are two sensors having the opposite enantioselective fluorescent response with two distinctively different emission wavelengths upon interaction with the two enantiomers of a chiral amine substrate.  These sensors are applied to chiral catalyst screening.  A fluorous solution of a pseudoenantiomeric sensor pair are used to extract the products, generated from the chiral catalyst screening experiments conducted in common organic solvents or aqueous solution, into the fluorous phase.  Because only the sensors and their adducts with the chiral products could be dissolved in the fluorous phase, the interference of other species such as reagents, catalysts and starting materials is minimized.  Through fluorescent measurement, both the yield and enantiomeric composition of the chiral products is simultaneously determined.  The structure of the sensors is modified in order to conduct the enantioselective fluorescent recognition of un-functionalized amines.  The fluorous phase-based fluorescent detection of this project has potential to be automated to conduct high throughput catalyst screening.  Under the direction of PI, graduate students and undergraduate students of diverse backgrounds are recruited to conduct research in organic synthesis, spectroscopic studies, and catalyst development. Students will learn many laboratory skills that are useful for their future employment and allow them to make contributions to the society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this research project is to develop fluorescent probes for the enantioselective recognition of chiral organic molecules in fluorous phase as well as in other phases and to apply these fluorescent probes in catalyst screening.  These probes generally contain four structural components:  (1)  1,1’-Binaphthyl structures are used to provide the chirality for enantioselective recognition;  (2)  Electron-deficient carbonyl groups such as aldehydes and perfluoroalkyl ketones are incorporated in order to bind with various functional chiral amine substrates by colvalent bonding;  (3)  Metal ions such as Zn(II) are introduced to turn on the fluorescence of the chirality-matched probe-substrate adducts;  (4)  Additional groups are introduced to tune the solubility of these probes in the fluorous-phase, common organic solvents and aqueous solution.  Highly enantioselective fluorescent recognition of chiral amino alcohols, diamines and amino acids have been achieved.   For example, the bisbinaphthyl-based compound 1a has exhibited highly enantioselective fluorescent enhancement with a number of common free amino acids in an organic solvent.  A perfluoroalkyl group is introduced to make the fluorous-phase soluble probe 1b.  This probe shows highly enantioselective fluorescence response toward structurally diverse amino acids in a biphasic fluorous/aqueous system.  It can be used to determine the enantiomeric compositions of amino acids and also allows the amino acid enantiomers to be visually discriminated.   This probe has been applied to evaluate the enantiomeric composition of the amino acid product generated in an enzyme-catalyzed asymmetric hydrolysis of a racemic amino ester.  The ee’s obtained by the fluorescence measurement under the biphasic recognition are close to those determined by HPLC. This demonstrates that the fluorous phase-based fluorescent probe can be used to screen the reaction conditions for the asymmetric synthesis of amino acids.  A diblock copolymer, poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether-block-poly(L-lactide) 3, is used to solubilize the water-insoluble probe 2 in aqueous solution to make a micelle encapsulated fluorescent probe.  This probe can be used to recognize lysine with both chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity in aqueous solution.  Compound 4 is made of the 1,1’-binaphthyl structure in combination with a coumarin unit.  In the presence of a chiral amino acid, compound 4 shows large fluorescence enhancement with both enantiomers at one excitation wavelength but highly enantioselective fluorescence enhancement at another excitation wavelength.  This distinctively different fluorescence responses at two different excitation wavelengths allow the determination of both concentration and enantiomeric composition by using only one probe.  The fluorous phase soluble probe 5 and the amphiphilic polymer-supported probe 6 are also obtained to conduct the enantioselective recognitions in multiple phases.  In this project, structurally novel fluorescent probes have been developed for the enantioselective recognition of chiral compounds.  These probes have shown potential as a rapid analytical tool in chiral catalyst screening.  This project has trained a number of graduate students, undergraduate students, and visiting scholars/postdoctoral fellows in the fields of organic synthesis, optical analysis, and polymers and materials chemistry.  About 32 research papers have been published in peer reviewed journals to communicate the research findings in the laboratory to the public.  Students working on this project have also participated in the Chemistry LEAD (Chemistry Learning through Experimentation and Demonstration) program.  This outreach group at the University of Virginia (UVA) is dedicated to providing inquiry-based chemistry instruction at the elementary school level.  The graduate students in this program from the UVA Department of Chemistry including those in this laboratory have made many visits to classrooms in local elementary schools.  These students have led short experiments to engage the students in hands-on chemistry investigation in each visit.  They have also organized annual chemistry camps in the UVA Department of Chemistry for youth.           Last Modified: 05/31/2020       Submitted by: Lin Pu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
