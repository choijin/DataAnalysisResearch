<AbstractNarration>Cryptographically formatted digital data that can securely emulate functions provided by traditional forms of currency are known as cryptocurrencies.  Like traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies can be generated, used to conduct transactions, and destroyed. Cryptocurrencies are poised to change commerce over the Internet and beyond.  Following the unprecedented success of well-known cryptocurrencies, there are several hundred variations and some entirely new cryptocurrencies that are, taken together, valued at several billion dollars in 2015.  As the 'second generation' currencies gain traction, the landscape of cryptocurrencies their uses for online payments and their public acceptance is changing quicker than ever before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal covers three broad areas:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measurement: For deployed and emerging crypto-currencies, this proposal will develop techniques to discover network structure and understand how network structure affects other properties of the currency system.  The techniques will also measure how mining power interfaces with the network, how mining algorithms affect the topology, and whether miners are omitting certain classes of transactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis: The measurements will generate a longitudinal view of multiple cryptocurrencies, enabling comparison between topological structure across time and across currencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design: Deployed cryptocurrency networks and computation power structure is susceptible to previously theorized attacks, where attackers gain advantage by being able to propagate information faster than others.  This work will lead to new protocols that mitigate or even eliminate these types of attacks, regardless of how many nodes attackers control, how these nodes are situated in the network, and how the computation power in the network is distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cryptocurrencies seem inevitable, with some having passed a "tipping point" in social mindshare and being used for everyday commerce.  New currencies are being continually introduced, and being traded for U.S. Dollars and other "hard" currencies; these networks are increasingly poised to have a financial impact and our designs are meant to eliminate structural protocol faults that have been identified.  The data resulting from this work will generate "birds-eye" views of different currency networks across time and will be made publicly available for the research community.  Broader analysis of these datasets will result in deeper and foundational understanding of cryptocurrency networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cryptocurrency networks such as Bitcoin rely on a peer-to-peer overlay  network to broadcast transactions and blocks.  We have developed tools  for observing this network, and inferring participant behavior based  on our observations.  We have also developed tools for secure  execution on smart devices, as these are are increasingly used for  storing cryptographic secrets.     For Bitcoin measurement, we have developed TxProbe, a novel technique  for reconstructing the Bitcoin network topology. TxProbe makes use of  properties o how Bitcoin processes out of order, or "orphaned"  transactions. We conducted experiments on Bitcoin testnet that suggest  our technique reconstructs topology with precision and recall  surpassing 90%. We also used TxProbe to take a snapshot of the Bitcoin  testnet in just a few hours. TxProbe may be useful for future  measurement campaigns of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency networks.     As part of our measurements, we instrumented the deployment of an  anycast service, the D-root nameserver, in order to characterize a the  performance of a reliable, critical service in the Internet. In the  process, we developed a measurement method to compare the "anycast"  inflation and "unicast" inflation of different anycast deployments:  anycast inflation is the difference in RTTs between to the chosen site  and the site with lowest latency; unicast inflation is the difference  between the RTT to the site with lowest latency and the predicted  latency by distance to the geographically closest site. This study of  inflation is based on prior studies of path inflation due to BGP and  places the performance pathologies of anycast in context: the  situation is far worse than the usual "BGP doesn't care about  performance" explanation. To correct this inflation, we proposed  static "hints", added as community tags to BGP advertisement,s that  can help route selection. In this proposed fix, each BGP advertisement  for anycast prefix includes geographic locations of sites that are  reachable through the route. When selecting routes, ASes can choose  the route towards the geographically closest site. We characterized  the propagation of community tags as a means of estimating the  effectiveness of these hints by collecting BGP routes towards the  prefix announced from PEERING testbed from 20 RouteViews route  collectors.     We have also designed new techniques for secure computation on mobile  and IoT devices. The sensing, computation, and communication  capabilities of modern smart devices provide users with rich  functionality and utility through the interaction of software with the  various I/O peripherals available on the devices. Much of the data  that software collects and processes from these I/O peripherals is  sensitive in nature, such as the user's location or password inputs,  cryptocurrency wallets and keys. While users should naturally be able  to exercise control, there are two fundamental issues that limit their  control in practice. First, existing systems do not provide support  for users to express their policies either due to incomplete settings  (e.g., cannot prevent app access to motion sensors on Android) or  limited expressivity (e.g., can enable/disable location, but not  adjust data resolution). Second, even when there is support for a  desired policy, there is little to no assurance that it is being  enforced; large platforms, such as in the case of smart devices, have  been shown to be hard to secure as a whole. Our work allows users to  verifiably assert policies over computations their smart devices can  undertake.
