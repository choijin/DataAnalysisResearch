<AbstractNarration>The 12th Brauer Group Meeting will be held Monday - Friday, June 8 -12, 2015 at the Pingree Park campus of Colorado State University.  This location is approximately one hour outside of Ft. Collins, CO, USA.  At the 12th Brauer group meeting formal talks will be given by senior level researchers as well as by young researchers, including graduate students, post-docs and young faculty. The primary goal of this conference is to bring together established and beginning researchers to collaborate and share insights on problems of interest involving the Brauer group in its many forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brauer group is an abstract algebraic group studied by mathematicians with a wide variety of interests. Algebraists often study the Brauer group in its role as a directory of division algebras over a field, ultimately with the goal of understanding arithmetic complexity in fields. Open questions relate to simplicity of description, expression in terms of cyclic classes, and the search for a reasonable definition of dimension for fields and for algebraic groups such as PGLn. Algebraic geometers study the Brauer group as an important invariant of a scheme arising from etale cohomology. This point of view goes back to the 1960's and Grothendieck, who suggested problems that are still actively being investigated. Recently deep connections have arisen between Brauer groups of schemes and stack theory, and these are being used not only to attack some longstanding open problems, but to serve as inspiration for new problems and approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information see the conference web-site: http://torsor.github.io/brauer/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The study of the Brauer group is a subject that has continued to broaden and deepen over the years, bringing together a rich collection of techniques and perspectives from various mathematical disciplines. The major goal of the project, was to hold a conference focusing on the Brauer group June 8-12, 2015 at the Pingree Park campus of Colorado State University.   The conference featured formal talks to be given by senior level researchers as well as by young researchers, including graduate students, post-docs and young faculty, and in addition provided informal settings outside of talks in which participants could collaborate on new ideas. The Brauer group conferences have a strong tradition of inclusiveness to younger researchers, and a commitment towards making an environment which is supportive of women as well as of researchers with families.   The conference was a overwhelming success. We have held these meetings many times prior and this meeting in particular seemed filled with young, enthusiastic participants who gave great talks and made connections with senior researchers.  As is typical, we brought together researchers from all over the country and abroad.  These researchers ranged from senior researchers at the forefront of their field to young researchers and graduate students, plus many more in-between.  The structure of the conference left the mornings open for study or collaboration and this was extremely successful.  The conference facility was nearly always filled with participants making new collaborations or working on established ones. In the afternoons and evenings conference participants gathered to listen to talks from all levels of researchers.
