<AbstractNarration>PI: Cankui Zhang (Purdue University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Yona Baguma (National Agricultural Research Organization, Uganda) and Henry Wagaba (National Crops Resources Research Institute, Uganda)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anthropogenic emissions of gaseous nitrogen (N) have become a severe problem worldwide. Although much is known about the alteration of physiology and growth of plants exposed to pollutant gases, most of these studies are observational, from an ecological perspective, and do not address the possibility of using gaseous nitrogen to augment plant growth. If successful, this EAGER project will harness and exploit known molecular mechanisms of uptake and transport of soil N to facilitate these processes for airborne N. The results generated from this exploratory and high risk research may also point the way to similar strategies for N use in other species and for other important gaseous pollutants. This project will foster intellectual and technical exchange in U.S. and Africa in the area of molecular plant physiology to develop novel strategies for "pollutant" utilization in important crop species such as cassava, rice and potato. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain air pollutants, including ammonia and nitrogen dioxide, are absorbed by leaves and are potential sources of nitrogen (N) needed for plant growth. However, plants did not evolve to take up these compounds from the air, and even if the nutrients are absorbed they may not be utilized correctly. Indeed, it has been noted primarily by ecophysiologists and forest biologists that these aerial nutrients stimulate shoot growth under certain conditions. However, it is also the case that the newly formed organic compounds are not transported out of the leaves, sequestering not only the absorbed N, but much of the carbon (C) derived from photosynthesis. As a result, root growth is inhibited, leaving the plants susceptible to drought and other stresses. In addition, the edible parts of crop plants, including tubers, do not benefit from nutrients if they stagnate in the leaves. To address this challenge, this EAGER project will develop and test novel molecular strategies for increasing the absorption and transport of aerial-derived nitrogenous compounds in potato, cassava and rice using select candidate genes identified in model plants such as Arabidopsis. All data and resources developed in this project will be available to the public. DNA sequences will be deposited at GenBank.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ammonia (NH3) are two of the major nitrogenous compounds released into the atmosphere by recent anthropogenic activities. It remains unclear how plants respond to these pollutants. Even if these compounds can be taken up by the plants, they may not be effectively used because plants did not evolve to take up these compounds from the air. The goal of this project was to elucidate the physiological and molecular pathways that are involved in the response to these gaseous nitrogen compounds and dissect whether increasing uptake and transport of these gaseous nitrogen can increase plant growth. Rice, potato, cassava, and poplar trees were used in this study. We found that the growth of rice was improved in response to NO2  and manipulation of the transport of nitrate further improved the biomass accumulation of this species. 15NO2 feeding experiment showed that leaves indeed absorb gaseous nitrogen and part of the absorbed nitrogen moved from the shoot-to-root. Multiple physiological pathways, e.g., carbohydrate, amino acid, hormone synthesis, were involved in the responses to NO2.  However, similar treatment did not improve the growth rate and biomass accumulation in potato. In addition to these two plants, we also grew poplar tree as a representative to study how woody species respond to NO2. To our surprise, the growth of poplar was also significantly improved although the leaf nitrogen transport mechanisms differ between herbaceous and woody plants. In cassava, we found that the manipulation on NO2 uptake and transport in cassava did not improve the growth; however, a simultaneous manipulation on leaf cell uptake and metabolism of NH3 significantly increased biomass accumulation when these plants were grown in the greenhouse.     Our study showed that the response of plants to these two gaseous pollutants is species dependent and both herbaceous and tree species could benefit from the fumigation of gaseous nitrogen. Simultaneous manipulation of nitrogen uptake and movement as well as a few other physiological processes identified from this work may lead to more significant improvement for plant growth and biomass accumulation under these pollutants.     This project trained one research scientist (USA), one PhD student (USA), one technician (Uganda), two undergraduate students (USA), and three visiting scholars (USA). The training areas included gene cloning, transgene construct preparation, plant transformation, enzymatic analysis, RNA Seq library preparation and data analysis, photosynthesis measurement, carbohydrate analysis, phloem transport measurement, stable isotope labeling, etc. Co-PI Dr. Henry Wagaba in Uganda was invited to the US for a week.
