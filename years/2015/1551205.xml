<AbstractNarration>The Math-to-Industry Boot Camp is an intense six-week session designed to provide training and experiences that will be valuable for enriching the experiences of doctoral students focused on areas of pure mathematics. Domestic students across the U.S. will be eligible to apply to participate in this program which will enhance the typical pure mathematics doctoral program through the provision of courses in areas such as data analysis and mathematical modeling.  Additionally, the students will work in teams on projects and will be provided with soft skills training. They will be able to interact with industry participants at various points in the program.  Students successfully completing the program will gain an appreciation of the usefulness of mathematics for solving real-world problems and will be empowered to make an informed career decision. The boot camp will take place at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications  on the campus of the University of Minnesota.  The outcome of this project is the development of a powerful work force that meets the needs of industry, and ultimately contributes to the economic well-being of the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed boot camp has been designed to enhance the training of Mathematics Doctorates by providing the students with skills and experiences that are valuable for seeking positions in industry and business, or for recognizing the relevance of mathematics in industrial or government settings.  The program will  expose students to careers outside academia and position them to make informed career choices.  The camp starts with the basics of programming, in languages and environments such as Java, Python and Matlab.  There will be a module on data analysis, followed by a module on mathematical modeling.  This is followed with two team projects.  Both projects will be goal oriented but open-ended, with the second being posed by industry practitioners.  Soft-skills training, such as project management, running meetings, making "elevator pitches,"  effective presentations, and report writing for non-scientific audiences will be provided.  Students will be mentored throughout the six-week period and will have ample opportunity to interact with industry participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The primary goal of the IMA Math-to-Industry Boot Camp is to provide graduate students in the Mathematical Sciences with training and experience that are valuable for internships and employment outside of academia.  Students in their first through to their final year of PhD programs and from both pure and applied mathematics are invited to apply to the program which consists of   Technical training in computer programming, statistics, machine learning, optimization, and modeling.   Professional training in teamwork, project management, presentation skills.   Two goal-oriented team projects, including one under the guidance of industry or lab scientists.   Networking opportunities with mathematical scientists working in industry.   Career and job search advice.   The program ran for four summers starting in 2016.  A total of 123 graduate students from 32 states participated in the program.  Of the student participants, 55 were women and 10 were from under-represented minority groups.  From the first cohort of 32 students, 23 are currently employed in industry or government, with the rest holding academic positions.  From the second cohort of 32 students, 15 are currently employed in industry or government, 10 are in academic positions, and the rest are still working towards their PhDs.  While the outcome from the third year is harder to analyze since about a third of the cohorts have not graduated, we can report that 15 of 32 have found employment in industry and government.  A number of students, while not having graduated, have reported that they have obtained industrial internships.  The list of employers range from small start-ups to established entities such as Amazon, Google, Target, Microsoft, Schlumberger Doll Research, Lockheed Martin, Cargill, MathWorks, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Sandia Lab, Pacific National Lab, Lawrence Livermore Lab, National Institute for Standards and Technology.  This snapshot gives a picture of the success of the program. Another outcome of the program is that it has served, and will continue to serve, as a model for preparing graduate students in the mathematical sciences for careers in industry or government.  One mentor from Novartis, who participated in the program in 2017, offered a similar program to graduate students in the Boston area in 2018.
