<AbstractNarration>1507358 (Ju)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal brings an extensive suite of experimental tools to study the reaction phenomenon of basic fuels that exist in more complicated fuels. These new tools developed at Princeton University allow researchers to look at the phenomenon with sensitivity that has not previously existed, especially under high-pressure conditions common in engines.  The principal investigators propose to involve graduate students in the research and outreach activities using the Princeton Energy for Community Certificate Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new, highly sensitive, quantitative mid-IR FRS (Faraday Rotation Spectroscopy) combustion diagnostic method for HO2 and OH will be developed. The proposed mid-IR FRS/IR-LAS integrated photolysis flow reactor will provide transformative capabilities and enable accurate quantification of key elementary reaction rates at low and intermediate temperatures. The measured HO2/OH, and other intermediate species, flame speeds, and elementary rate constants will fill the gap of knowledge of the current understanding of combustion kinetics at low temperature and high pressure, and will play a critical role in developing a validated, high pressure and low temperature kinetic mechanisms for the following common and important base fuels: methyl formate, methanol, and dimethyl ether (DME). The obtained high pressure methanol, methyl formate, and DME kinetic mechanisms will form the base mechanisms for other larger hydrocarbon fuels, alcohols, biodiesels, and esters.</AbstractNarration>
