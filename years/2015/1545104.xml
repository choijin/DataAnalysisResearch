<AbstractNarration>Strategic decision-making for physical-world infrastructures is rapidly transitioning toward a pervasively cyber-enabled paradigm, in which human stakeholders and automation leverage the cyber-infrastructure at large (including on-line data sources, cloud computing, and handheld devices).  This changing paradigm is leading to tight coupling of the cyber- infrastructure with multiple physical- world infrastructures, including air transportation and electric power systems.  These management-coupled cyber- and physical- infrastructures (MCCPIs) are subject to complex threats from natural and sentient adversaries, which can enact complex propagative impacts across networked physical-, cyber-, and human elements.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose here to develop a modeling framework and tool suite for threat assessment for MCCPIs.  The proposed modeling framework for MCCPIs has three aspects: 1) a tractable moment-linear modeling paradigm for the hybrid, stochastic, and multi-layer dynamics of MCCPIs; 2) models for sentient and natural adversaries, that capture their measurement and actuation capabilities in the cyber- and physical- worlds, intelligence, and trust-level; and 3) formal definitions for information security and vulnerability. The attendant tool suite will provide situational awareness of the propagative impacts of threats. Specifically, three functionalities termed Target, Feature, and Defend will be developed, which exploit topological characteristics of an MCCPI to evaluate and mitigate threat impacts. We will then pursue analyses that tie special infrastructure-network features to security/vulnerability.  As a central case study, the framework and tools will be used for threat assessment and risk analysis of strategic air traffic management.  Three canonical types of threats will be addressed: environmental-to-physical threats, cyber-physical co-threats, and human-in-the-loop threats. This case study will include development and deployment of software decision aids for managing man-made disturbances to the air traffic system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Daily, the United States? air transportation system is used by several million passengers travelling on tens-of-thousands of aircraft. Safe and efficient operation of this system is the responsibility of air traffic controllers and managers distributed across the country, who must oversee an enormously complex agglomeration of physical-world and cyber assets using only a limited set of forecasting and decision-support tools.  Traditionally, traffic managers have been primarily concerned with addressing severe-weather disruptions.  However, several high-profile incidents have shown the myriad other disruptions, ranging from cyber threats (both failures and attacks) to drone intrusions and operator fatigue-related events, are increasingly impacting traffic management.  These myriad disruptions are extremely difficult to manage because they are unpredictable, encompass heterogeneous elements in the air transportation system, and fall outside operators? traditional expertise.  The purpose of this project was to develop the techniques and tools needed to assess and respond to the heterogeneous threats impacting the modern air transportation system.  The main research outcomes (intellectual merits) of the project were: 1) the development of a telescoping family of models for simulating the impacts  of potential threats across the cyber, physical, and human components of the air traffic system; and 2) the construction of a set of software tools for quantitatively assessing the spatiotemporal impacts of putative threats, and in turn designing management resources to limit the impacts.  Additionally, the project achieved a number of broader impacts, focused around: 1) developing educational resources (e.g. course notes, projects) related to automation and decision-support for the modern transportation infrastructure and 2) student-led technology transfer to stakeholders in the air transportation system.
