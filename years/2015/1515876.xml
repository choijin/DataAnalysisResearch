<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to better understand the final fates&lt;br/&gt;of massive stars.  At the end of their lives, all stars more than&lt;br/&gt;roughly ten times the mass of our Sun build an iron core which&lt;br/&gt;collapses from the size of the Earth to the size of a city once&lt;br/&gt;its mass exceeds a critical limit.  In many cases this results in an&lt;br/&gt;luminous, supernova explosion, but there is increasing evidence&lt;br/&gt;that this is not the only outcome.  This work will (a) discover&lt;br/&gt;or set useful constraints on the fraction of massive stars that&lt;br/&gt;produce a black hole without a supernova explosion; (b) clarify&lt;br/&gt;the boundary between the least luminous supernova explosions and the&lt;br/&gt;variability of massive stars that does not lead a supernova explosion; and (c)&lt;br/&gt;measure the properties of these stars just before their deaths,&lt;br/&gt;including pioneering studies of their variability.  The project&lt;br/&gt;will advance our scientific understanding of these massive stars&lt;br/&gt;while training the next generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research steps for a better understanding of the fates of&lt;br/&gt;massive stars include using unique, multifaceted observational and&lt;br/&gt;theoretical approaches. The centerpiece is a project using the&lt;br/&gt;twin 8.4m Large Binocular Telescope to monitor all the massive&lt;br/&gt;evolved stars in 27 nearby star-forming galaxies.  The primary&lt;br/&gt;goals are to:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Discover or set interesting constraining limits on the&lt;br/&gt;   fraction of core collapses that fail, producing a black&lt;br/&gt;   hole without a supernova explosion;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Measure the properties of SN progenitors while pioneering&lt;br/&gt;   studies of their variability and binarity;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Explore the boundary between the faintest SN and stellar&lt;br/&gt;   outbursts, in particular by better understanding the nature of&lt;br/&gt;   the SN "impostors" and the SN2008S class of dusty transients.&lt;br/&gt;While doing so, the project will advance the training of students and&lt;br/&gt;post-docs and broaden the public's understanding and interest in science,&lt;br/&gt;aided by their fascination with stars and their complicated roads to&lt;br/&gt;death.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The primary goal of the project was to better characterize the deaths of stars roughly 10 times the mass of our Sun and up.  In particular, the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) was used to search for failed supernovae, massive stars becoming black holes without a dramatic explosion.  Basically, the project looks for a massive, luminous star to vanish.  This project is presently the only practical way to identify the formation of a black hole, and it has found one excellent candidate (see image from STScI).  There is also considerable interest in the pre-supernova behavior of the massive stars which do explode, because some post-explosion data can be interpreted as requiring the stars to undergo some sort of pre-explosion eruption. We can search for such eruptions in the LBT data, and we have found no evidence for unusual behavior from the stars prior to explosion.  Most of these massive stars are believed to be in binary systems, so we also tried to better characterize the multiplicity of these systems.  In particular, we searched for binaries consisting of a star with a non-interacting neutron star or black hole. We know of many systems where the two are interacting because the interactions make them identifiable.  We developed a method to find  non-interacting systems and discovered one excellent candidate for a non-interacting black hole binary.  A broad range of additional projects were carried out.  Broader Impacts: In total, we produced 34 papers led by graduate students and 15 led by post-docs as part of their training.  This included working with 9 Ohio State graduate students.  Understanding the fates of these massive stars is crucial to other areas of physics, including the new field of gravitational wave astronomy.  Any prediction or understanding of the origins of these gravitational wave events depends on the details of failed and successful supernovae and the role of binaries (triples, etc.) in the evolutionary history of massive stars.  The broader public is fascinated by black holes, and our failed supernova/vanishing star received broad public attention both in its original NASA press release (see image from STScI, https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2017/news-2017-19.html) and then again during ``Black Hole Week'' where it was one of the stories  featured on the NSF WWW pages  (https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/blackholes/).
