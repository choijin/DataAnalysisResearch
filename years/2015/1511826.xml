<AbstractNarration>#1511826&lt;br/&gt;Saleh, Navid &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nano-scale metal oxides are one of the most prepared and used engineered nanomaterials with applications in electronics, optical devices, and medical processes and devices. Nano-scale indium tin oxide (nITO) is one such doped metal oxide particle that is used heavily in electronic display modules such as touch screens, electronic inks, and organic light-emitting diodes.  Manufacturing processes and end-of-life disposal events for these products might serve as exposure pathways of nITO to humans and the natural environment and thus raise concerns for eco- and nano-toxicity. This project systematically assesses the influence of crystal properties (at the atomic scale) on the environmental health and safety of nITO. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to determine key physicochemical properties and band gap energetics of nITO as a function of the concentration and distribution of tin doping and to elucidate mechanisms for fate, transport, transformation, and toxicity of these nano-scale bimetallics. This study will address the following aims: (1) synthesize nITO with tunable band structure via control over dopant concentration and distribution; (2) sample preparation and characterization of nITO for a range of tin doping to gain detailed understanding of crystal structure, bimetallic morphology, and colloidal properties; (3) examination of aggregation kinetics, fractal dimension, and porous media transport as a function of ionic strength and organic matter composition; (4) evaluation of microbial toxicity (to planktonic and biofilm cells) and toxicity mechanisms using band gap energetics and ROS measurements; (5) assessment of chemical transformation of nITO and evaluation of fate and toxicity of the transformed materials.  This study will be the first of its kind, using changes in fundamental electronic and physicochemical properties of nITO caused by controlled variations in tin doping distribution and concentration at the atomistic level to elucidate mechanisms of fate, transport, and toxicity in aquatic environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will generate critical and fundamental knowledge to better understand the environmental implications of a highly concerning and commercially important next- generation nanomaterial, nITO.  nITO, that are utilized as transparent catalysts in touch-screen devices with higher recycling rate and relatively short lifetime, necessitate understanding their environmental safety.  The results obtained from this project will result in direct societal benefit by providing better understanding of nTO environmental health and safety.  In outreach and education aspects, the PIs will continue their strong track records of recruiting students from underrepresented groups.  At least one graduate student from an underrepresented group will be attracted via the University of Texas at Austin?s Diversity Mentoring Fellowship, while undergraduate women and minority students will be brought into this cutting-edge nanomaterial and microbiology research utilizing the University's Graduates Linked with Undergraduates in Engineering (GLUE) and the Texas Research Experience (TREX) programs.  Multi-pronged outreach activities at San Juan Diego High School (which has 85% Hispanic students) will have profound educational impact on the high school students through seminars and hands-on experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Nano-scale indium tin oxide (nITO) and similar bi-metallics are emerging as a multifunctional material class with an already-substantial commercial presence. Though the use of bi-metallics is beneficial in optoelectronic industries, their environmental impacts must be evaluated. The main goal of this project was to synthesize, characterize, and assess environmental interactions of nITO; in particular, we examined electronic properties, aggregation, dissolution, and interaction with bacteria. The project has trained three graduate and two undergraduate students, and more than 200 middle and high school students (residents of low-income <em>colonias</em> in the El Paso area) have been impacted by project outreach. Project results are being published through five peer-reviewed journal articles (2 published, 2 in review, and 1 in preparation). Project results also were disseminated via seven national and international conference presentations. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong></p> <p>In this project, indium oxide (IO) and tin-doped indium oxides (8% and 10% dopant, uniformly distributed) were synthesized and modified with a surface ligand, producing negatively charged materials. The project also utilized commercially procured IO and nITO (5% and 10% dopant) without ligand modification to evaluate the role of dopants on their behavior; these materials with bare surfaces were positively charged. Electronic properties, aggregation behavior, dissolution propensity, and impact on microbial viability were evaluated for these nanocrystals.</p> <p>The results indicated that tin dopants alter the electronic band position and band gap magnitude of indium oxide crystals. Tin dopants increase the apparent optical band gap. The apparent optical band gap increased by ~0.4 eV (from 3.8 eV for 0% Sn to 4.23 eV for 10% Sn) for the in-house-synthesized nanoparticles and by 0.1 eV (from 3.6 eV for 0% Sn to 3.7 eV for 10% Sn) for the commercial nanoparticles.</p> <p>In general, tin dopants reduce colloidal stability of indium oxide nanoparticles in water. However, the reduction in stability (or increase in aggregation propensity) scales with the amount of tin dopant if tin is uniformly distributed throughout the crystal (vs. dopant clustering or dopant metal oxide precipitation onto the parent crystals); this was demonstrated in aggregation studies with in-house-synthesized nanoparticles possessing uniformly distributed dopant. The commercial samples showed reduced stability with incorporation of tin, but the aggregation behavior of the 10% Sn-doped nITO deviated from the trend, showing a slight increase in stability. X-ray diffraction analyses revealed the presence of cassiterite (tin oxide crystals) on the 10% Sn-doped commercial nanoparticles, which likely caused this deviation.</p> <p>The project developed a data analysis method to quantity particle stability of polydisperse samples (common for commercial materials). The method utilized cubic quantile regression, and it reduced the effect of outliers in the aggregation history. This new method will allow the critical coagulation concentration of polydisperse materials to be estimated with a higher degree of confidence.</p> <p>IO and nITO were found to be relatively insoluble in water. Only indium metal was observed to dissolve from nITO crystals (i.e., no Sn dissolution). Doping of Sn in In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> appears to slightly reduce the solubility of In(III) at pH 6. Flow-through atomic force microscopy experiments corroborated the low solubility.</p> <p>IO and nITO showed low levels of bacterial toxicity.&nbsp; When exposed to nanoparticles with 0% and 5% Sn-doping, viable <em>Escherichia coli</em> declined only slightly relative to the control without nanoparticles (&lt;0.25 log); however, exposure to 10% Sn-doped nITO resulted in nearly 2.5-log reduction in viable <em>E. coli</em>. Dose-response studies with 10% Sn-doped nITO showed an inverse correlation between <em>E. coli</em> viability and nanoparticle concentration (over two orders of magnitude), likely caused by nanoparticle aggregation at higher concentrations.</p> <p>The results highlight that metal oxide environmental studies should consider the role of dopants (intentional or incidental dopants) in fate, transport, transformation, and biological interaction. Results also indicate that dopant quantity and the form of dopant incorporation (i.e., atomic vs. crystalline) can strongly influence the properties of Sn-doped indium oxide nanocrystals.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>:&nbsp;</p> <p>Doped nanocrystals typically acquire a unique atomic arrangement that is distinctive from the undoped parent crystals. Metal oxides often are intentionally doped (for band gap engineering) but also can be doped incidentally during preparation; thus role of dopants on metal oxide behavior should be carefully evaluated. The overall outcome of the project has yielded a consequential conclusion:&nbsp; tin dopant amount and form (i.e., atomic vs. crystalline cassiterite) influence the environmental behavior of indium oxide nanocrystals. The transferability of this conclusion against the entire class of metal oxides is dependent on future systematic studies.</p> <p>Several students, including graduate and undergraduate students gained training as part of this project. Middle and high school students, mostly of Hispanic origin and residing in low-income <em>colonias</em> near El Paso, were impacted by outreach activities.
