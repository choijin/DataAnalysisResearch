<AbstractNarration>The complexity of embedded computing systems is increasing at a rapid rate due to both advances in technology and the increasing demand for complex applications. A wide variety of these systems employ multi-core architectures to keep up with the demand for performance under stringent power and thermal constraints. Adaptation to the dynamic changes in the application is critical to improve overall performance, energy efficiency as well as reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although dynamic adaptation (reconfiguration) techniques have received considerable attention from various domains, they are not employed in real-time System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. This is due to the fact that real-time systems may consist of critical tasks with soft or hard deadlines, and the dynamic reconfiguration overhead may adversely affect the critical tasks. Missing deadlines may lead to performance degradation or even catastrophic failures in these systems. The proposed research will develop automated tools and techniques to address three fundamental challenges in exploiting dynamic reconfigurations in real-time multitasking systems: i) lack of a comprehensive framework that can synergistically exploit the advantages of dynamic reconfiguration of computation, communication as well as storage, ii) lack of efficient real-time scheduling techniques in the presence of dynamic reconfigurations techniques, iii) lack of dynamic reconfiguration that considers a wide variety of design and optimization constraints. Rather than focusing on one optimization objective or specific domain, this research takes a comprehensive approach by considering synergistic effects of computation, communication as well as storage to optimize overall performance, energy and reliability without violating real-time constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make significant broader impact in several fronts. The proposed approaches can enable a wide range of energy-efficient and low-cost embedded systems. Reduction in energy consumption directly relates to significant improvements in operating lifetime for battery powered mobile devices. Similarly, reduction in temperature improves system reliability. Embedded systems with dynamic reconfiguration capabilities will have two major impacts.  One being low-cost and high-quality everyday appliances for the public, and the other is improved efficiency of safety-critical devices such as biomedical and military equipment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The vast majority of computing systems today uses multicore System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. Three important aspects of these systems are the target applications, accelerator-rich heterogeneous hardware architectures, and optimization constraints.  Applications: State-of-the-art computing systems perform multiple tasks, and are heterogeneous in nature in terms of task deadlines (none, common or individual), task characteristics (periodic/aperiodic, preemptive/non-preemptive, etc.) as well as underlying computing paradigm. There are also a wide range of multitasking systems, such as workstations and servers, where the overall performance rather than the individual task deadlines are of interest.   Hardware: The complexity of multitasking systems is increasing at a rapid rate both due to advances in technology and the demand for ever more complex applications in the areas of communication, multimedia, networking, and entertainment. A wide variety of real-time systems employ multi-core architectures to keep up with the ever-increasing demand for performance under stringent power and thermal constraints. Consequently, embedded systems are becoming highly heterogeneous computing platforms, which include multiprocessor system-on-chip (MpSoC), touch displays, modems, flash memory, camera, GPS modules.

The complexity of real-time scheduling in the presence of multicore architectures is further aggravated by the aperiodic nature of some tasks, resulting in the inability to predict their arrival sequence prior to execution.  Design Metrics: Developers are faced with the daunting challenge of designing, optimizing, and verifying such systems in light of the combined effects of increased system complexity and real-time constraints. Minimizing power and energy consumption under performance and temperature constraints are among the most important optimization goals in multitasking systems. Minimizing energy consumption will also improve battery life and cost due to the relaxed requirements on cooling, power supply and voltage regulators. Similarly, energy and thermal optimizations will improve the reliability and lifetime of the system.

Various semiconductor companies have utilized the tools and results from this project on their internal designs. This research has led to one special issue, one keynote, over ten journal articles, and several premier international conference publications, including one best paper award.  Education Activities and Disseminations of the Results: This research project provided a training opportunity for five Ph.D. students - one of them started a tenure-track faculty position in Fall 2020; three of them are in technical leadership positions in semiconductor companies; one of them plans to graduate this year and apply for a faculty position.   This project also supported two M.S. students and ten minority undergraduate researchers (including four women) through the NSF-sponsored Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. Three of these REU students plan to pursue graduate study and applied for Ph.D. admission recently.

Finally, the dynamic reconfiguration framework and power-temperature models developed in this project are released to public through the project and lab webpages.
