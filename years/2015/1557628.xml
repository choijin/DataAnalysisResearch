<AbstractNarration>Astronomers have studied the radio waves that come to us from the universe since the 1930s.  One &lt;br/&gt;fascinating phenomenon that has been measured in radio light is a faint, diffuse glow which covers the &lt;br/&gt;entire sky.  This glow is best described as the "Radio Synchrotron Background", where the term &lt;br/&gt;"synchrotron" refers to particles making radio waves when they spin around magnetic fields.  Interest in the "Radio &lt;br/&gt;Synchrotron Background" has been rekindled recently because of new measurements.  This radio glow &lt;br/&gt;presents a mystery because it is difficult to explain how it came to be there with known astrophysical &lt;br/&gt;processes.  It represents one of the mysteries of contemporary astrophysics.  While there have been &lt;br/&gt;many publications in the literature on this topic, there has not yet been a scientific workshop.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will hold the first scientific workshop on the radio synchrotron background, which will bring &lt;br/&gt;together scientists working in these overlapping fields to discuss the radio synchrotron background in &lt;br/&gt;person for the first time.  There are implications for many areas of active research in contemporary &lt;br/&gt;astrophysics.  The workshop will inspire new collaborations and new lines of inquiry, and may spur &lt;br/&gt;future meetings on the topic.  This project funds travel support toward allowing scientists to attend the &lt;br/&gt;workshop as well as for a talk for the public and for a report for the scientific community on the &lt;br/&gt;outcome of the meeting.  The workshop will be held at the University of Richmond.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Radio Synchrotron Background is a newly re-appreciated astrophysical phenomenon which has been &lt;br/&gt;a subject of great interest to many in the community. Combining the ARCADE 2 balloon-based absolute &lt;br/&gt;spectrum data from 3-90 GHz with absolutely calibrated single-dish diffuse radio surveys at lower &lt;br/&gt;frequencies reveals a radio synchrotron excess that is several times brighter than was expected by &lt;br/&gt;many.  The origin of the radio synchrotron background is one of the mysteries of contemporary &lt;br/&gt;astrophysics.  It is difficult to produce the observed level of surface brightness by known processes &lt;br/&gt;without violating constraints.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existence of the radio background at the observed levels presents profound challenges for our &lt;br/&gt;current understanding of radio emission in the Galaxy and the universe.  As demonstrated in many &lt;br/&gt;recent publications, there are implications for many areas of astrophysics, including cosmic ray &lt;br/&gt;propagation, galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields, the radio to far-infrared correlation, radio source &lt;br/&gt;counts, X-ray source counts, quasar luminosity functions, dark matter annihilation, polarization of &lt;br/&gt;foregrounds in microwave background maps, population III stars, mergers of clusters, and many more.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will feature plenary sessions made up of multiple presentations by attendees &lt;br/&gt;interspersed with and question and discussion periods centered around different topics that study of &lt;br/&gt;the radio synchrotron background touches.  The visual component of individual presentations, in the &lt;br/&gt;form of PDF, PowerPoint, or similar files will be made available on the Web.  Additionally, a report will &lt;br/&gt;be prepared for the scientific community on the outcome of the meeting.  The priorities identified in the &lt;br/&gt;report will be determined by consensus of the meeting attendees as synthesized by the organizing &lt;br/&gt;committee.  Finally, new collaborations and working relationships will be established.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The radio synchrotron background is the total level of radio frequency light that we measure on our sky if we look out with a low enough resolution so that the output from individual sources is all washed together.  It represents the total level of radio light we receive that is sent out by everything in our universe.  The radio synchrotron background presents a mystery in astrophysics because there is a discrepancy between what it ought to be if we add up the brightness of all of the known types of sources of radio emission in the universe, and the level that it actually is measured to be, which is quite a bit higher.  This discrepancy for the radio background is unlike the analogous backgrounds in infrared, optical and ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma-ray light, where the source populations are well characterized and understood, and trace the known large scale structure of the Universe.  Possible resolutions to this mystery include a class or classes of heretofore unknown very numerous radio emitting sources in the universe, or a reworking of our understanding of the large-scale properties of our Galaxy.  This project, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, brought together scientists working on these issues for the first time at an international workshop hosted at the University of Richmond to exchange ideas and chart a course for future progress toward solving the mystery.  At the workshop, which was held in July 2017, scientists from universities, NASA centers, and laboratories from across the United States and around the world presented, discussed, and debated their ideas and priorities.  The workshop reached a consensus on the importance of several proposed future measurements which will help make progress toward resolving the mystery of the radio synchrotron background.   The project also included an outreach talk for the public in Richmond, VA, and the workshop has been summarized for the scientific community in a published journal article that was written with the help of an undergraduate student.
