<AbstractNarration>This proposal is to fund a conference on isoperimetric problems on manifolds with density to take place at Williams College in Williamstown, MA on February 6, 2016. This conference will bring together experts in the field with newer researchers, graduate students and undergraduates interested in this area. The conference will provide the opportunity for researchers at all levels to interact, learn from one another and network. The slides from the talks will be posted on the website so a broader audience can reap the benefits. Every effort will be made to encourage and support women and underrepresented minority participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of manifolds with density has seen a dramatic increase of interest in recent years. Manifolds with density were fundamental in the proof of the Geometrization Conjecture and new advances have continued to push the field forward. This conference will allow researcher to set a roadmap for further critical developments.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference website is at http://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/csilva/FrankFest-2016.html</AbstractNarration>
