<AbstractNarration>The CC*DNI project expands Boise State University's research network by establishing two Science DMZs connected to the Idaho Regional Optical Network (IRON). The Science DMZs are located on the edge of the University network and at the Idaho Computing Consortium site, hosted at the Idaho National Laboratory Supercomputing Center. Utilizing Software Defined Networks (SDN), OpenFlow Switches and an OpenFlow Controller, Boise State enables IRON to switch data traffic at a high throughput rate between researchers at the University and the High Performance Computing (HPC) equipment at the National Laboratory. This enhanced regional research network provides a fast, extremely secure and dynamic network environment for the larger data sets our researchers are analyzing with parallel computing using University, National Science Foundation and Department of Energy assets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing the monitoring software perfSONAR framework throughout the regional optical network allows constant monitoring of throughput, performance and latency issues. Improving the control, speed and ease of transferring large data sets is imperative to advancing Boise State research as the scope and volume of data increases and as the University increasingly relies on distributed and national Cyberinfrastructure assets. The SDN switches and controller allow high transport speed across the regional optical network that is normally slower due to the latency of routed traffic. Reliable high speed data traffic is the infrastructure that researchers expect as they expand large scale data intensive scientific research. This project enhances the high performance computing throughout the Idaho research community, the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computer Consortium and XSEDE.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Although Boise State has a 10 Gbps connection to the Idaho Regional Optical Network (IRON), previous science data transfer speeds in and out of the university were limited to a maximum theoretical throughput of approximately 2.5 Gbps.  This limitation is due to the border firewall and its impact on big data transfers.  Performance metrics collected using perfSONAR nodes on each side of the firewall, over the period of one month,  clearly show this maximum throughput limitation.  It is also notable that this maximum throughput is achievable with LAN latency times of less than a few milliseconds.  After implementing the Science DMZ, a significantly increased throughput rate is evident in a series of perfSONAR tests, including cross tests between the campus network behind the border firewall, the Science DMZ, and a perfSONAR node at another institution on IRON.  The Science DMZ has a physical presence in two campus buildings, Riverfront Hall and the City Center Plaza.  The Science DMZ at both locations is connected by a dedicated 10 Gbps fiber link.  perfSONAR test results show a throughput capability of 9.4 Gbps across the Boise State Science DMZ.   A perfSONAR node was placed on the firewall-protected campus network for continual monitoring.  Testing between the campus network and perfSONAR node on IRON and managed by another institution, demonstrates the previous baseline performance with a firewall in the path.  Outbound throughput is 2.2 Gbps and inbound is 2.0Gbps.  This demonstrates a reduction in performance when latency is increased, compared to the low-latency 2.5 Gbps baseline.  Testing between the Science DMZ and another perfSONAR node on IRON yielded results of 7.4 Gbps outbound and 3.9 Gbps inbound.  Two different types of tests were also performed inbound which yielded performance of 7 Gbps from two other sources?those results will be addressed in the Globus Performance Summary section.  The difference in between the 3.9 Gbps inbound throughput observed with perfSONAR testing versus the 7.0 Gbps inbound observed with Globus are indicative of a restriction either on the regional network, or the other institutions perfSONAR node.   By implementing a Science DMZ, Boise State has increased throughput capacity as measured by perfSONAR testing from a maximum of 2.5 Gbps to at least 7 Gbps, with a potential of 9.4 Gbps with properly tuned external resources.
