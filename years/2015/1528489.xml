<AbstractNarration>It is expected that in 25 years, Americans who are 65 years or older will account for about 20% of the whole population. As smart cities are also expected to become a reality within the same timeframe, starting to address the needs and concerns of such a large group becomes an essential part of the design of a future smart city. Here we specifically address the mobility needs of the elderly and those with limited means of transportation. We consider multiple small vehicle options that might provide on-demand or scheduled means of door-to-door transportation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF-EAGER project focuses on examining basic research aspects of sensing and tracking potential sources of vehicle pedestrian collisions in densely crowded situations and socially acceptable distance for collision avoidance. The project will be providing input to the OSU/Columbus Global City Teams Challenge activity SMOOTH (Smart Mobile Operation: OSU Transportation Hub) and related demonstrations and help develop a working system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key innovative contributions of this EAGER project are: development of a unifying framework for sensing and tracking in mixed traffic situations, acceptable automated driving within pedestrian zones, and evasive road maneuvering to avoid colliding with conventional human driven vehicles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   We are envisioning Smart Cities of the future having a      core where the majority of transportation will be on foot. Some people will      need individual automated service for assisted mobility in these pedestrian areas.   Other Smart Cities challenges involve the expansion of commuting or public infrastructure based transportation modalities and the first-mile and last-mile problem faced by commuters, especially those with limited personal mobility.    Even today, the elderly and mobility impaired would be      aided with door to door, on-demand automated service.    Two automated platforms (one for four and one for a      single person)  were developed and equipped with LIDAR, camera, IMU and GPS  sensors and with high-speed communication capabilities.  These were reasonable proof-of-concept      examples of green technology for  slow electric vehicles that could be used in pedestrian      areas.  The single-rider one especially could be used for on-demand       transportation for the mobility-impaired in first-mile, last-mile       situations.  A central control center was also invisioned that would, through web or cellphone applications, provide reservation, routing, and status information to users.     One key research objective was to study the interaction of these small autonomous vehicles with pedestrians in a dense pedestrian environment.  An obstacle avoidance approach was developed for      avoiding pedestrians in a "socially acceptable" manner. This      approach was tested in simulation and on an automated vehicle.  Models and simulations of pedestrian and crowd motion were also developed.     Tests were performed on the Ohio State University      Campus, with hardware infrastructure (for communication) and a software      architecture, for on-demand service software was established.  It conformed to the National ITS architecture to maintain the benefits of potential cooperation with other ITS systems.
