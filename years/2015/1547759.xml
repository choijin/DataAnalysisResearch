<AbstractNarration>This RAPID project addresses critical questions of how people respond to disasters and subsequent relief efforts.  Disasters strike unexpectedly, anywhere in the world, and are not possible to avoid.  The study of disasters in one part of the world contributes to understanding how they unfold and how people respond to them elsewhere because of the broad similarities they share.  Although disaster research has grown considerably, there is still much to learn by collecting information quickly and efficiently, before it is lost.  For example, does access to resources or resourcefulness play a great role in disaster resiliency? This project will provide information of great value that will guide future response to disasters of all types in the U.S. and abroad. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Steven J. Folmar of Wake Forest University will explore disaster response and mental-health resiliency in Nepal following the April 25 and subsequent earthquakes. The main goal of this project is to determine how disaster victims respond to crises, tracing the pathways by which some people experience emotional trauma while others demonstrate resilience.  The investigator will conduct research on people from different sectors of society, in urban and rural communities in Lamjung District, Nepal that have experienced varying degrees of destruction caused by the April earthquake. The investigator will collect data from 1) direct observation of relief efforts, 2) interviewing 100 individuals recounting their earthquake and post-disaster experience, and 3) surveying mental health status among 300 youth and comparing current measures of their mental health with measures taken from them during a previous study.  Since, with the passing of time, critical data on how disaster recovery is experienced by victims are lost, it is imperative to gather data as soon as feasible.  Regarding intellectual merit, collecting empirical information during, not after, the period of recovery equips the investigator to develop theory that directly reflects first-hand information from survivors, which is rare in disaster research. In terms of broader societal impacts, results from this project will help inform global disaster relief efforts, enhance the resilience of survivors and contribute to the development of much-needed mental health response efforts through the sharing of findings with NGOs and the Government of Nepal at the time they are needed most. Lastly, it will provide training for researchers to conduct similar studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ RAPID: Psychological and Social Resilience in Post-Earthquake Nepal had important outcomes related to the conduct of the project and to the results of the data collection and analysis.  Related to the conduct of the project, the team of the PI and 3 research assistants (RA) successfully gathered impressive amounts of quantitative and qualitative data during the first 4 months of the award.  In the field, we obtained responses to follow-up survey interviews of 172 (59%) youth from a total of 297 orginially two years earlier.  We updated respondents' measures of anxiety and depression and recorded changes in their living conditions, including those resulting from the effects of the April 2015 Earthquake. All data were entered and checked for accuracy in the field.  We visited all four field sites for periods of 8 to 12 days each, recording observations of and in key locations in each site, such as schools, clinics, police stations and small neighborhoods.  We conducted quick visual surveys of conditions in each.  We also conducted 87 in-depth interviews which we audio-recorded and transcribed in the field.  Translations are on-going at this time and are being conducted in the United States.  The data have undergone processing and management during the past 8 months at Wake Forest.  Quantitative data have been imported into SPSS for storage, transformation and analysis.  They are currently being analyzed.  The more voluminous qualitative data are still being entered into digital format and processed.  Much of the data, mainly our field notes, have also been coded and processed for initial analysis.  Managing these data will take an additional 4 to 6 months before being complete.  To date two presentations have been conducted on preliminary results of this project, the first at the Himalayan Studies Conference in Austin, TX in the spring and the second at the 3rd Forum of the International Sociological Association in Vienna, Austria in the summer.  Both presentations were ethnusiastically received and resulted in invitations to publish the finding.   The first focused on the effects of social status, i.e. caste and ethnicity, on how the earthquake affected people. In this presentation I presented the somewhat surprising and counter-intuitive finding that young people of high social and economic status (members of the high castes) suffered more from the earthquake than did youth from middle (the Gurung ethnic group) or low social and economic status (Dalits or low caste people).  Although the reasons for this finding are complex, the important take-away message is that Dalits' depression and anxiety was the most severe to begin with and the earthquake only worsened the situation marginally.  It is unlikely, however, that the Dalit mental health situation will rebound quickly or reach the much more robust levels of the high caste groups.  The High Castes suffered relatively more from the earthquake but their baseline was at a much healthier level to begin with.  The second presentation focused on gender.  The findings were remarkably similar to the first presentation and were similarly surprising.  Boys' mental health fared worse than girls' did as a result of the earthquake.
