<AbstractNarration>This is a proposal to fund airfare for U.S. students to participate in the International School/Symposium for Space Simulations (ISSS-12), held in Prague, Czech Republic. ISSS-12 is the synergistic combination of a noted international school with world-class instructors and an international space plasma physics symposium during which related cutting-edge research is discussed. The planned school offers an exciting opportunity for U.S. students to get hands-on experience with complex plasma simulation codes and to obtain copies of some of the basic codes at its completion. In the subsequent symposium, students are exposed to research using these same and additional cutting-edge simulation technologies. Throughout this experience, students have the opportunity to network with an international cadre of researchers and students both one-on-one and in small groups.  This school and symposium approach has proven over the years to be very effective in maximizing the knowledge that students gain but, in addition, it creates an environment that enables these same students to establish international contacts and build future collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strong relevance of ISSS-12 to international STEM-related workforce issues makes it of potential interest to the Global Venture Fund program housed in the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE). GVF agreed to co-review the proposal with the NSF Geospace section.  Although OISE normally does not support international symposia, ISSS-12 was judged to be a solid investment in 10 junior US researchers/students who will gain an exceptional early-career opportunity to interact with the Czech research community, which is strong in plasma physics and related areas.  Furthermore, Czech research infrastructure is world class, with existing simulators, an Institute of Plasma Physics, HILASE, and a newly built EU-funded facility called ELI. Thus, this destination is an important investment in the junior US participants? professional future.   To make this opportunity available to U.S. students, the GVF joined with NSF Geospace to provide funding for this proposal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided funding for 11 undergraduate and graduate students, and post-docs from the United States to travel to the 12th International School/Symposium for Space Simulations held July 3-10, 2015 in Prague, Czech Republic.  Air fare was paid for these 11 US attendees and they were accomodated locally with other students and post-docs from around the world.  All of the students attended a very intense week of ISSS-12 with the schedule including several hands-on tutorials in space simulation techniques and also presentations by top scientists illustrating the use of these simulations in ongoing cutting-edge research.  Some of the more advanced student attendees presented posters with their own research and were able to gain valuable feedback on their work from experts in the field.   In general the students' experience at ISSS-12 was very positive.  An informal survey taken after the meeting was finished revealed that the students enjoyed the meeting and felt they had gained knowledge not only in basic simulation techniques, but also benefited from seeing how these simulations are used in a practical sense by space scientists in active research projects.  The students also found the interactions with other international students to be invaluable both socially and as future potential contacts.  One of the main outcomes is that the experience of attending ISSS-12 has resulted in many of the US attendees becoming interested in pursuing graduate studies in space plasma physics and careers in space science.  As with previous ISSS meetings, ISSS-12 has fulfilled its goal of training the next generation of space scientists in the use of plasma simulations and some will become leaders in the field.  The funding from this NSF grant has allowed this process, which has been going on for over 30 years now, to continue successfully into the future, enhancing and improving the space science community.
