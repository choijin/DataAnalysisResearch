<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to understand how plant species in Acadia National Park, Maine are responding to climate change. Research in southern New England has found a connection between phenology - the timing of biological events - and species loss in plant communities. Plants with flexible flowering phenology (i.e. blooming earlier in warmer years, and later in cooler years) are less likely to decline in abundance or disappear from the landscape. In Acadia, the researchers used historical data from the late 19th century to record patterns in species loss over the past 120 years. This project will monitor leaf out and flowering phenology in Acadia to record how plants are responding to changing temperatures and explore connections between phenology and species loss. The researchers will work with undergraduates from Maine colleges and universities to monitor leaf out and flowering phenology for thirty plant species on three observational transects that traverse three peaks within the National Park, as well as three experimental transplant gardens along an elevational gradient along one peak. In addition, the researchers will develop a citizen science opportunity for hikers to participate in this research on the three peaks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a demonstrated connection between advancing spring plant phenology and warming temperatures in temperate northeast North America. However, plants display differential phenological responses to warming depending on taxa, population, habitat, elevation, and/or geographic location. Phenology is a key plant trait included in many climate vulnerability assessment methods, but its use in these assessments has not been rigorously evaluated, in part because researchers need a better understanding of the environmental controls on phenology at a species level. Here this is achieved through an interdisciplinary approach merging historical ecology, observational and experimental fieldwork, and citizen science in Acadia National Park. In this project, observational monitoring on transects will quantify the relationship between spring temperatures and shifts in phenology at the species level for a community of thirty common plant species in Acadia. Researchers will use these results to facilitate a regional comparison of phenology and species loss for conspecific populations in Acadia versus Concord, Massachusetts. Three reciprocal transplant gardens at three elevations on one peak will test the relative effects of environmental cues and genetic differences at the population level on spring phenology for three understory plant species in Acadia. This project will further our understanding of the ecological effects of climate change, educate visitors about climate change research, and inform resource management in Acadia National Park.</AbstractNarration>

The grant provided three years of funding for Dr. Caitlin McDonough Mackenzie, who is currently a post-doctoral researcher, and supported two College of the Atlantic undergrads each summer, providing them with valuable field experience. The project had three main activities and outcomes:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>First, we analyzed floristic change for vascular plant species on Mount Desert Island and Acadia National Park, Maine over the last 125 years. We tracked changes in abundance for over 900 species on MDI, and wrote a literature review comparing floristic change across 12 additional sites in New England and New York. Nearly 16% of all taxa recorded in 1894 on Mount Desert Island are now locally extirpated, a rate of species loss that fits a regional pattern of floristic change in the Northeast, but seems surprisingly high for a 100-year-old National Park.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Second, we quantified plasticity in leaf out and flowering times for nine common plant species across elevation gradients on three mountains in Acadia National Park over a three year period and developed a monitoring scheme whereby hikers can continue to record phenological data as a part of a citizen science program. Most understory species in Acadia have earlier leaf out and phenology in response to warmer local spring conditions. We demonstrated that the relationship between phenology and temperature, which is important to know for climate change predictions, can be determined in just a few years if sites are sufficiently variable in microclimates.&nbsp;This data was also supplied to a research group at the University of Massachusetts at Boston to calibrate satellite data on leafing out times in mountainous areas.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Third, we transplanted populations across an elevation gradient in Acadia National Park to assess the role of local adaptations in leaf out plasticity. In this experimental manipulation we found that local environment, not local genetic adaptation, drives leaf out times in Acadia. The research highlighted the use of experimental gardens in climate change research.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We also analyzed the&nbsp;journals of L.S. Quackenbush, a hunting guide in mid-twentieth century rural Aroostook County, Maine, as an opportunity to incorporate historical ecological data into climate change research.&nbsp;&nbsp;We found that his leaf out and flowering phenology observations are closely tied to spring temperatures.
