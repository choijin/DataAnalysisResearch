<AbstractNarration>While there is broad agreement that indigent defense counsel is vital to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system, there is relatively little understanding of the effect resources have on the process of providing defense and on criminal justice system outcomes.  This project will take advantage of a financial crisis in Louisiana to better understand the production function of indigent defense systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From January 2015 through June 2016 the public defender systems in 25 of Louisiana's 42 judicial districts are expected to fall into insolvency on a rolling basis, and will balance their budgets by restricting services delivered to indigent defendants in juvenile and criminal cases.  There will be substantial variation across districts in the extent, timing, and specific indigent defense service restrictions imposed.  This project will quantitatively assess the impact of these restrictions on both defense effort and case outcomes in three of the larger districts.  Interviews from key judicial stakeholders will be done to provide a deeper understanding of the quantitative results, as well as to assess the impacts of restrictions in districts too small to analyze quantitatively.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             This project examined the effect of public defender funding cuts on the indigent defendants who relied upon their services.  We found that the funding cuts caused significant delays in assignment of counsel, that many defendants spent a significant additional amount of time unrepresented in jail as a result of these delays, and that the cuts resulted in assignment of cases to lawyers who were not qualified to practice criminal law.              This project used a mixed-methods approach to provide detailed accounts of what happened in two judicial districts in Louisiana&mdash;Orleans and Bossier/Webster&mdash;where the local public defender office experienced significant cuts in 2015.  To measure the impacts these funding shortfalls had on defendants, we interviewed key stakeholders in two judicial districts in 2015 and 2017, and analyzed relevant data from these two jurisdictions.              We find that the Orleans and Bossier/Webster public defender offices both cut back their staff significantly. The Bossier/Webster public defender responded to these staff cutbacks by refusing to accept certain cases, and local judges assigned these cases to attorneys from the private bar who often had no experience in criminal law.  Due to judge delays in appointing these cases out, the 64 defendants assigned a private bar attorney in Bossier/Webster waited 50 days longer to receive representation than they would have if their case had been handled by the public defender. Many of these defendants were imprisoned while they waited for attorneys to be assigned.   Even after the staff cutbacks, the Orleans public defender office at first continued to accept all assigned cases, increasing the caseloads of their remaining attorneys, who, even before the additional cases, already had caseloads that were well above recommended levels. The Orleans staff cutbacks were compounded by the fact that many of the attorneys that left were more experienced.  Eventually the Orleans public defender office began to waitlist and refuse certain cases.  Between December 2015 and September 2016, 539 defendants facing felony charges were placed on a waitlist and waited a median of 28 days for an attorney to be assigned to them.  Sixty-eight percent of these defendants were imprisoned while they waited.              It was more difficult to measure the impacts the cuts had on the outcome of the defendant’s cases. Our interviews revealed local stakeholders’ perceptions of the impacts these cuts might have had, but these perceptions were often mixed and appeared to be based on an assumption that the office was operating optimally before the funding cuts. The most definitive way to determine the impact on defendant cases is through quantitative causal analysis. Unfortunately, we were unable to find suitable control groups in Orleans and thus could not identify whether the increased public defender caseloads and delayed appointment time had a detrimental impact on defendants’ cases. In Bossier/Webster we used a matched-pair research design to examine whether defendants who had their case appointed out to a private bar attorney with no criminal law experience had worse case outcomes than their co-defendants who were assigned to the public defender.

While we controlled for the observable differences between co-defendants, there may be unobservable differences between the co-defendants we cannot control for which may cause us to underestimate the impact of having an attorney with no criminal law experience.              Regardless of the limitations noted above, our results provide conclusive evidence that the funding cuts that occurred in Bossier/Webster and Orleans resulted in defendants spending significantly longer amounts of time in jail unrepresented, and led to defendants being represented by attorneys that were not qualified to practice criminal law.  Both of these findings suggest that cuts to public defender funding have significant effects on the fair operation of the criminal justice system.
