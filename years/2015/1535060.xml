<AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the impact of research on the Social and Ethical Implications of Nanotechnology (SEIN) over the last fifteen years. The goal is to determine the extent to which the publications, insights, and conclusions of that research has been useful to populations beyond academic disciplines in the humanities and the social sciences, where SEIN research has been done. The PI will interview stakeholders and decision-makers in four target populations: business and industry; law, especially intellectual property law; science and technology research and development; and science policy and regulation. The core research questions of the project include the following. What is the extent to which SEIN research is useful to these populations? Are there ways to improve on the utility of this research for them? How can the results of this project, the insights and recommendations that are generated from it, serve to inform STS research on other forms of emerging science and technology? The PI will broadly disseminate his research results to enhance understanding of science and technology, especially in formats that reach policy makers in business, industry, and law. He will also bring to light successful instances of substantial benefits of SEIN research, and to recommend ways for other researchers in STS to plan early to accomplish similar benefits in their research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will interview 60 to 80 stakeholders in business, law, science, and science policy to ascertain whether they are familiar with SEIN research in four areas: ethics in nanotechnology, public engagement with nanotech, issues of fairness and social justice, and the history and development of nanotechnology. For those who are familiar with these features of SEIN research, the PI will query the manner and the extent to which they use it in their decision-making. For those who are not familiar with these elements of SEIN research, he will inquire how this kind of research might be formatted and delivered to facilitate their being used. There will be a second round of interviews to gather the perspectives of leaders in SEIN research in the US, especially those whose work was made possible by funding from US government agencies. A third round will interview a sample of SEIN leaders in the EU and Canada to discern whether they have been more successful than US researchers in disseminating their results to populations outside of academic disciplines in the Humanities and Social Sciences. It is intended that the results of this work will also be useful for stakeholders in other topics of emerging science and technology, e.g., Synthetic Biology or mapping the human brain.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report The Value of SEIN Research: NSF Award 1535060 Submitted by Chris Toumey, Ph.D., 9 May 2017     "The Value of SEIN Research" examined whether research on nanotechnolgy from the humanities and social sciences [known as SEIN, for "societal and ethical implications of nanotechnology"] reached certain persons who make nanotechnology happen, and whether it influenced their work.  During 2015-16, the Principal Investigator and the graduate research assistant interviewed sixty persons in these four groups:  [A] Persons in U.S. government science policy related to nantoechnology, e.g., program directors who serve as liaisons from their agencies to the National Nanotechnology Initiative [n = 14];  [B] Academic scientists and engineers working in nanotech [n = 16];  [C] Persons in nano-related start-ups, all of whom are scientists or engineers [n = 14];  [D] Attorneys in intellectual property law who steer nanotech inventions through either the patenting process or regulatory processes [n = 16].  Almost all interviews took place face-to-face in these locations: Seattle WA; Chicago IL; South Bend IN; Philadelphia PA; Boston MA; Washington DC; Research Triangle Park NC; Charlotte NC; and Atlanta GA.  The interview instrument focused on interviewees' knowledge of thess four topics: [1] research and publications about ethics in nanotechnology; [2] public engagement with nanotechnology; [3] fairness in nanotech; and, [4] the history and development of nanotechnology.  Regarding ethics in nanotech, we imagined that there could be a spectrum of ethical issues that have been explored in more that two hundred publications on that topic.  But we found that almost all interviewees acrsoss the four groups tended to see ethics in nanotechnology as a matter of avoiding environmental risk.  While we agree that this is desirable, it means that a large body of literature on ethics in nanotech has failed to reach those populations.  Regarding fairness in nanotech, we imagined another spectrum of issues, bue we found that most interviewees across all four groups tended to see this topic as environmental justice.  Interviewees were knowledgeable and sincere about environmental justice, but again we concluded that research and publications on this topic have failed to reach those groups.  Regarding the history of nanotechnology, we found that knowledge of this topic varied according to the professional responsibilities of the four kinds of interviewees.  U.S. government scientists had strong reasons to be informed about the history.  Academic scientists and engineers, along with those in start-ups, had either narrowly focused knowledge [e.g., history of carbon nanotubes, or quantum dots, or microelectronics], or very little knowledge at all. IP attorneys had reasons why the history of nanotech was irrelevant to their work.  Interviewees' comments about public engagement were negligible.  The interview also asked this: "if you are not very familiar with reseach and publications in those areas, are there ways for the people who do this research to package and deliver it so that you can see it and use it?"  Two recommendations arose repeatedly.  First, those who do this research [i.e., those in the humanities and social sciences] should have their findings published in scientific journals and magazines where scientists and engineers can easily find them.  Secondly, those who do this research should organize sessions at large scientific meeings like the American Association for the Advancement of Science where it is convenient for attendees to hear their presentations.  This leads to a suggestion: the NSF criteria for Broader Impacts could include credit for satisfying those two recommendations from the interviewees, especially for awards in the STS program.  Principal Investigators would accept a responsibility to communicate findings and insights from their research to the scientific communities they study.  The results from "The Value of SEIN Research" have resulted in four presentations at academic venues, plus two commentaries in Nature Nanotechnology.  One more piece will appear in Nature Nanotechnology in July 2017, and a longer paper will appear in the October 2017 proceedings of the Society for the Study of New &amp; Emerging Technologies [S.NET].  We note that it is extremely difficult to generate publications within the one-year timeframe of a project like this because there is very little time to do so after the fieldwork is completed.  Nevertheless, we accept a responsibility to publish results beyond that time limit.  Both of our 2017 publications will appear after the no-cost extension ended, and it is possible that we will continue to publish results over the next year or so.
