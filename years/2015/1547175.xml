<AbstractNarration>This EAGER project develops computational tools to enable lab-on-a-chip devices that can be optically actuated using smartphones and tablets. Low-cost, portable lab-on-a-chip systems can impact a wide variety of applications including biomolecule production, point-of-care medical diagnostics, newborn screening, and biochemical sensing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed algorithms and software will coordinate the motions of droplets of chemicals on light-actuated digital microfluidic (LADM) chips by using moving patterns of projected light to optically actuate the droplets.</AbstractNarration>

Algorithms for the assignment and trajectory planning of multiple robots with variable goal formations in 2D and 3D. The developed new algorithms compute the optimal assignments and collision-free trajectories of multiple robots to move from an initial formation to a variable goal formation (where the shape of the goal formation is given, and both its scale and location parameters can be optimized).

Algorithms for line coverage, the inspection of linear environment features using multiple robots. Linear features include power lines and road networks, which can be modeled as line segments; all points along the segments must be inspected. When the features are distributed over large areas, this necessitates the use of multiple robots (e.g., drones) simultaneously to complete the coverage tasks in a timely manner while respecting robot resource constraints (e.g,, battery life).

The algorithms and software for multi-robot coverage can impact disciplines such as earth and ocean sciences by providing the capability to rapidly perform remote sensing using multiple drones.
