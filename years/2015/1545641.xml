<AbstractNarration>"Big Data" has emerged as a new approach to computing that is transforming science, engineering, medicine, health care, finance, business, and ultimately society itself. The IEEE International Conference on Big Data 2015 (IEEE BigData 2015) provides a leading venue for disseminating the latest research in big data research, development, and applications. The conference will take place in Santa Clara, California from October 29 - November 1, 2015. The conference co-chairs are Dr. Laura Haas (IBM), and Prof. Vipin Kumar (U. Minn.). The program committee co-chairs are:  Dr. Howard Ho (IBM), Prof. Beng Chin Ooi (National Univ. of Singapore), and Prof. Mohammed J. Zaki (RPI). This award will help support travel of Ph.D. students at U.S. universities who are primary authors on full papers that have been accepted to the technical program or are participating in the doctoral student symposium. Special efforts are being made to recruit and fund women and minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference solicits high-quality original research papers in any aspect of big data, including infrastructure, management, search and mining, security and privacy, and applications. Contributions will advance the state of the art in techniques, algorithms, and systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the conference homepage: http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2015/</AbstractNarration>

The award was a total of $800, sent to participants, as participant support, after proof of participants attending IEEE Big Data 2015 and presenting their paper.  The selection process was rigorous: only first authors of accepted papers were considered, and only Ph.D. or postdoctoral students were further considered. The candidates were ranked based on the average review score of their paper, so as to ensure a fair and blind process of selection.   Out of the top 27 candidates that were provided support to travel to Big Data 2015 and present their paper, 46% were women. The majority were Ph.D. students. The majority of awardees were students studying in U.S. institutions, specifically, 55%. In total, the awardees represented 7 countries, including the U.S.  The organizers of IEEE Big Data 2015  were very grateful to NSF for the continued support of this premiere conference by providing through these awards the opportunity to many first author students to attend IEEE Big Data 2015 and present their papers. This is often a seminal and informative experience for many graduate and postdoctoral students, and it also enriches the conference atmosphere with fresh perspectives of future scientists and researchers.
