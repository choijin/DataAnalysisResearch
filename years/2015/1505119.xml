<AbstractNarration>Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at her home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.  The award to the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff  has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The project will focus on constructing a mathematical model on superconvergence of the nonconforming finite element method (NCFEM) for second-order elliptic problems by L-squared projection methods. This project will enhance the research experience and training of undergraduate students in mathematics at the institution. Additionally, a course in Finite Element Methods will be developed and offered as a topics course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use L-squared projection methods to improve the convergence rate of an existing finite element solution so that the new approximation is closer to the exact solution than the existing finite element solution. The objectives are: to obtain mathematical theories for the superconvergence of NCFEM using various element spaces for the second order elliptic problems with the homogeneous essential Dirichlet and natural Neumann boundary conditions; to write computer programs to perform numerical approximations to support the theoretical results; and to investigate existing theoretical results for the superconvergence of the conforming finite element method for second-order elliptic problems by the L-squared projection method. Finally, mathematical theories will be tested with real world data for the Laplace and Poisson equations, which are used in modeling heat conduction, seepage through porous media, irrotational flow of ideal fluids, and other applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF HBCU-UP RIA grant provided many opportunities to the Principal Investigator (P.I.), Dr. Anna Harris, and her 18 research assistants (RAs) who are all underrepresented minority and/or female undergraduate students to enhance their research and teaching in computational mathematics at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB). The P.I., her collaborator, Stephen Harris, and her RAs developed theories and procedures to more efficiently solve certain complex mathematical problems.  They wrote computer programs in the computer language MATLAB to perform numerical experiments to support and verify their theoretical results.  The numerical method that they developed enhanced the accuracy of existing numerical approximations and saved significant computational time and cost, offering real world benefits in solving these complex problems. The P.I. trained and mentored a total of 18 underrepresented minority and/or female undergraduate students as her RAs during the project period, 8/1/2015 &ndash; 7/30/2018.  Each RA acquired at least one computer language programming skill and each can efficiently produce professional poster and oral presentations. The P.I., RAs, and their collaborator wrote three manuscripts to report their results to the mathematical community.  The P.I. and/or RAs also presented their research work at various meetings/conferences: 1) 2016, 2017, and 2018 UAPB Faculty, Student, and Staff Annual Research Forums; 2) 2016, 2017, and 2018 Mathematical Association for America (MAA) regional conferences; 3) 2017, 2018 IDeA Network Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) conference; 4) 2016 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) reginal conference; 5) 2017 and 2018 HBCU-UP/CREST PI/PD meetings; and 6) 2017 Emerging Researchers National (ERN) conference.    The P.I. and RAs have been actively recruiting high school students and UAPB undergraduate students to become Mathematics or Mathematics Education majors.  Their research work and enthusiasm created a positive atmosphere for others to study in STEM areas.              Last Modified: 07/04/2018       Submitted by: Anna Harris]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
