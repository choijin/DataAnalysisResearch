<AbstractNarration>Currently, the access to microscopes is limited to laboratories. Although there are low cost microscopes, these microscopes are generally of a low optical quality, and are quite bulky to carry around.  In many cases, these microscopes only work with samples mounted on glass slides before being able to see what needs to be seen. This I-Corps team believes there is an untapped market for customers who want to bring around their own microscopes, both for curiosity and for professional purposes. By coupling with a wireless-ready device, the proposed technology ?DotLens Microscopy? enables easy sharing and documentation. The primary motivation of the project is to enhance K-12 STEM education in the US. DotLens microscopy will enrich the current science curriculum by lowing the barrier of access to microscopes, both in the classroom and in the field, thereby improving teaching effectiveness and student learning.  Ultimately, DotLens microscopy may help inspire a new generation of children and young adults to consider STEM fields as their future career path, by demonstrating the transformation of a smartphone into a microscope. The simplicity, versatility and flexibility of DotLens microscopy on virtually any camera-ready mobile electronic devices will enable a wide range of innovative formal and informal education activities. As for industrial and professional applications, DotLens microscopy provides imaging quality competitive to professional imaging systems at a fraction of the cost and weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DotLens is a revolutionary polymer lens that can transform any smartphone or tablet camera into a microscope with a magnification from 5 to 150 times and resolution approaching 1/100th the width of a hair. DotLens can be simply attached to any camera port in a fashion similar to contact lens for human eyes, and its microscopy capabilities can find a variety of applications, for example, vision aid for the elderly, biological imaging, and classroom usage in K-12 education. DotLens is manufactured by a proprietary 3D printing method, producing high quality lenses with precise magnification. The team's goal is to refine the market research and develop strategies to address individual vertical segments, including pricing analysis, competitor analysis, distribution channels, etc. The team will engage in interviewing potential users such as researchers, academicians, students, teachers, and other professionals their user experience and acceptance. Ultimately, the team would like to introduce DotLens microscopy to the international arena, and provide it at affordable cost for all whom can benefit from it.</AbstractNarration>

The captured image or movie can be readily stored, processed, wirelessly transferred, and shared on social media, thereby providing great synergy in the age of mobile communication and wearable electronics. In the course of this project, we have interviewed hundreds of potential customers and identified numerous B2C targets including: students, teachers, researchers, field laboratories, doctors, nurses, and engineers. For these, our main value proposition was simply to address their need for high-quality, low-cost, portable microscope setup for observation, analysis, and data sharing. We have also discovered that value-added product can be envisioned by bundling and incorporating into existing curriculum via textbook publishers and distributors who already have an established customer database. We have engaged McGrawHill, Nasco, VWR, and other established companies for direct product incorporation. On one hand, they can provide us with all the necessary channels to our desired customers without diluting our brand, and on the other hand, we can provide them with added-value on their existing core products. We have managed to have the product included in Nasco&rsquo;s catalog. We have confirmed that the proposed product would be highly popular in the educational tool industry, but also identified that the best approach would be teaming up with existing education tool developer or vendors who have effective and efficient channels of distribution. The final result was a &ldquo;GO&rdquo; for this project. A company has been established by the PI. The company has started selling the product via a website. Potential customers include individuals, students, parents, teachers, and school representatives.</p> <p>This project has substantial broader impact. Among the already identified applications, education is an exciting one where both commercial success and significant impact in revolutionizing education can be envisioned. We have worked with two local schools: Alief ISD (Dr. Garcia) and The Village School (Science Department Chair: Mila Taylor). With AISD, short curriculum was developed and piloted. With Village School, the smartphone microscopy technology was introduced in science projects of IB program. PI has been actively involved in student advising, student mentoring, adding smartphone microscopy related materials to the current curriculum, and disseminating research results to a board audience. Two PhD students are actively involved in research related to smartphone microscopy. The basic training for research such as independent thinking, presentation and writing is conducted. PI has mentored a team of undergraduate junior/senior from the Wolff Center of Entrepreneurship to develop a case study and a business plan for the proposed commercialization. The PI has mentored several undergraduate student researchers (4, 1 female, 1 Hispanic). All these efforts have deepened our understanding of how smartphone microscopy can be applied in STEM education, as well as furthering our insights in developing new functionalities and imaging modalities for other applications outside the scope of this project. The project is by far the best for attracting students at all levels. Often time it also receives the most attention in any academic or non-academic lectures and talks. These features have been taken advantage of by PI to work with many students and individuals to understand the strength and weakness of the proposed technology. All participants learned something about science and engineering through this process. This technology enables individual to appreciate there is a microscopic microcosm around him/her which often is missed. This technology also represents a cyber-physical-chemical integration that is currently lacking in the commercial domain.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/25/2017<br>      Modified by: Wei-Chuan&nbsp;Shih</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
