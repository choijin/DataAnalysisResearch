<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the dynamic coupling processes between the Earth's mesosphere and thermosphere. It will yield estimates of the momentum and energy contribution by gravity wave breaking processes occurring in the mesopause region to the thermosphere. Specifically, the mesospheric secondary gravity wave momentum/energy transport and coupling processes in the Southern hemisphere's upper atmosphere will be studied. This project continues an international collaboration involving scientists from the United States and New Zealand. An undergraduate student will be involved and mentored during the project. Results will be made widely available to the scientific community and general insights communicated to the public.&lt;br/&gt; This work will utilize existing ground-based optical imaging, spectrometer and radar measurements combined with space-based measurements in order to investigate the occurrence and characteristics of secondary gravity wave coupling between the mesosphere and thermosphere. The project will build upon recent observations at Mt. John Observatory, New Zealand of secondary gravity waves generated by gravity waves breaking at a lower altitude region in the mesosphere near 100 km altitude. The New Zealand region is a known "hotspot" of gravity wave activity in the southern hemisphere, a region of the globe under-represented in terms of upper atmospheric observations.</AbstractNarration>
