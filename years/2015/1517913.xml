<AbstractNarration>The ability of microbes to convert organic materials (feedstock) into a vast array of chemical products makes them ideally suited as chemical factories. Advances in this technology require redirecting natural and engineered metabolic pathways (i.e. the pathways of chemical reactions in the cell) towards the production of the desired chemical.  One means of redirecting microbial metabolism is to manipulate the pathways so that the desired amount of metabolites flows toward the desired pathway at the appropriate time.  This is akin to opening a valve to permit the flow of chemicals into a factory at the appropriate time and in the appropriate amount. In this study a set of bioengineering tools will be developed for detecting accumulation in a microbe of a signalling molecule and for detecting the depletion of a nutrient in the growth medium. When the targeted concentrations of the signal molecule or nutrient are reached the expression of specific metabolic pathways will be altered appropriately to increase production of the desired chemical. This toolkit will be made broadly available to synthetic biology and metabolic engineering researchers. Workforce training and development will be provided to young career (undergraduate and graduate students) scientists through an interdisciplinary research experience.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been great interest in developing strategies to control the flux of metabolites at the appropriate time and in the appropriate amounts to optimize yields of microbially synthesized chemicals. To achieve high product yields requires balancing the need for increasing cellular biomass with the diversion of metabolites towards the synthesis of the desired product. An ideal system would allow dynamic control of metabolite flow towards product synthesis without the need for any user-provided inputs. This project aims to develop and analyze the use of autonomous metabolite valves to control the appropriate flux of metabolites through a heterologous pathway at the appropriate time.  In contrast to other systems that rely on exogenous amendments to control metabolite flux this system will rely on the intracellular accumulation of microbially synthesized signals or the depletion of a specific nutrient in the growth medium. At targeted concentrations of the signal molecule or nutrient, gene expression will altered to increase the flux of metabolites toward synthesis of the desired product. The objectives of this study will be to: 1) develop and analyze quorum sensing-based metabolite valves; 2) develop and analyze metabolite valves based on the natural phosphate starvation response; and 3) integrate the quorum sensing and phosphate starvation valves into a single strain to assess system compatibility.  While a specific metabolic pathway will be investigated for valve performance as proof of concept, it is also envisioned that these devices will be useful for more general physiological studies such as the impact of metabolic shifts on cellular behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded jointly by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems.</AbstractNarration>

To do so, we first employed quorum-sensing systems that would repress the expression of an essential endogenous gene as a function of culture density.  Applying the control system to a pathway for myo-inositol synthesis resulted in improvements in product titers that ranged from 20% to 5.5-fold greater than the wild-type control.  Further extension of the pathway to produce glucaric acid revealed that the valve strains were able to produce significant amounts of product while the controls only generated acetate in shake flask cultures.  We also showed that the improvements resulting from the valves were consistent across multiple production scales.  We next integrated this system with a second layer of control, in which the valve was combined with metabolite-driven regulation of the expression of a pathway enzyme.  When integrated, these two methods were roughly twice as effective as either applied in isolation.  Lastly, we have begun to add multiple layers of dynamic gene control at multiple points in a given pathway. This involves building additional quorum-sensing systems to enable autonomous modulation of gene expression, and then combining multiple tools together in the same strain to allow synergistic boosts in pathway productivity.  Our preliminary results from this last extension of the work are quite exciting and should be published within the next year.  Overall, this work significantly expanded the area of ?dynamic metabolic engineering,? as we increased the scope of products targeted as well as the mechanisms to achieve regulation.     Broader impacts:  This project partially supported two graduate students, the first of whom received his doctoral degree in the summer of 2017 and is currently employed full-time in the biotech industry.  The second student continues to matriculate in the doctoral program at MIT.  An undergraduate student also worked on the project for one year.  The main work arising from this project was published in two high-profile journals:  Nature Biotechnology (2017) and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA (2018).  The former manuscript has been cited 79 times in 2 years, reflecting the impact of the work.  We have also completed several material transfer agreements distributing strains arising from this work to other research laboratories.  Finally, this work has been presented at several university seminars and conferences over the past 3 years, being well-received each time.  Collectively, this indicates that the funded research has had a significant impact on the broader science and engineering community.
