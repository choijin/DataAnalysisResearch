<AbstractNarration>This research project will contribute significantly toward development of computational methods for shallow water and related models. Special attention will be paid to applications arising in oceanography, in atmospheric sciences, and in hydraulic, coastal, civil, and enhanced oil recovery engineering, in which rapid changes in the bottom topography, Coriolis forces, friction, nonconservative terms, and uncertain phenomena have to be taken into account. The problems under study include rainwater drainage and flooding in urban areas, shallow water models of turbidity currents, multilayer flows, and shallow water models with uncertain data. The new tools under development promise to have great potential in designing coastal protection systems and investigating the effects of sediment transport on shelf drilling platforms as well as contributing toward the development of flood mitigation systems and planning of new urban areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is aimed at developing accurate, efficient, and robust numerical methods for shallow water equations and related models, with particular reference to problems that admit nonsmooth (discontinuous) solutions and involve complicated nonlinear waves, moving interfaces, and uncertain data. Shallow water models are systems of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) that are derived using physical properties such as conservation of mass and momentum, and hydrostatic or barotropic approximations. Naturally these models, especially in the cases of high space dimensions, require development and implementation of special numerical techniques such as numerical balancing between the terms that are balanced in the original system of PDEs (development of well-balanced schemes), ensuring positivity of all fluid layers (this is absolutely necessary for both accurate description of dry and near dry states and enforcement of nonlinear stability), operator splitting methods, interface tracking approaches, and others that will be in the focus of the research project. The development of new techniques will be based on high-order shock-capturing finite-volume schemes, accurate and efficient ODE solvers, and stochastic Galerkin methods, utilizing major advantages of each one of these methods in the context of the problems under study.</AbstractNarration>

The major outcomes of the project are briefly summarized below:     The PI has considered the two-dimensional system of shallow water equations with Coriolis forces and focused on the case of a low Froude number, for which we have designed an asymptotic preserving numerical scheme. The unique feature of the new method is that it is uniformly consistent, stable, robust and efficient for a broad range of (low) Froude numbers.  The PI has constructed a new moving-water equilibrium preserving numerical method for the one-dimensional Saint-Venant system of shallow water equations. Several numerical tests were performed to verify the ability of the proposed scheme to accurately capture small perturbations of steady states. The PI has developed a new numerical scheme for the non-hydrostatic version of the Saint-Venant system. The designed scheme is both well- balanced (capable of exactly preserving the "lake-at-rest" steady state) and positivity preserving. The new method has been used to study ability of the non-hydrostatic Saint-Venant system to model long-time propagation and on-shore arrival of the tsunami-type waves.  The PI has studied the two-component Camassa-Holm equations as a model for the long-time water wave propagation. Compared with the classical Saint-Venant system, it has the advantage of preserving the waves amplitude and shape for a long time. A new numerical approach has been introduced for the underlying system and tested in a number of numerical experiments. The PI has studied shallow water flows in river systems.
