<AbstractNarration>Chaminade University is an undergraduate university with a special mission of serving Native Hawaiians and students from the US-affiliated Pacific Islands. This Kûlia (Hawaiian: to strive) project will offer innovative educational approaches to prepare the next generation of Hawaiian and Pacific Islander scientists to lead the development of practical and policy-based solutions to Pacific regional challenges. These innovative approaches include a focus on "big data" and the curricular infusion of indigenous knowledge to promote a culturally-inclusive learning environment for cutting-edge science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kûlia is an inter-institutional effort (The Chaminade University of Honolulu and the University of Hawaii at Hilo) that will leverage domain science, diversity/equity and data science expertise. The project will address the IUSE aims of improving STEM-learning environments, broadening participation, and building a professional STEM workforce for tomorrow. Three specific activities will be undertaken. First, the two semester introductory biology courses required of all science majors at Chaminade will be converted to authentic, semester-long, research classrooms, with the goals of: promoting early engagement in research classrooms and creating a research mindset for students; increasing student persistence in science majors; closing an initial gap in the existing inquiry-based curriculum; and providing a vehicle for crowd-sourcing faculty research projects. Second, authentic, semester-long, culturally-inspired research projects, will be piloted in senior biology courses. These research classrooms will be framed by indigenous Hawaiian traditional knowledge. Third, recognizing that skills in big data manipulation, analytics and visualization are central to success in tomorrow's scientific workplaces, a core set of data lifecycle modules will be embedded throughout the curriculum and tools will be developed for assessment of student competencies in gathering, organizing and analyzing large, complex data sets. Kulia will provide new tools for small undergraduate institutions, especially Minority Serving Institutions, to confront the emerging digital disparity that threatens to exclude their students from access to, and success in, tomorrow's STEM careers. To help assess the effectiveness of this suite of curricular innovations the project will employ several approaches including use of the Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) survey and the Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) instrument.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Chaminade University of Honolulu (CUH) is a Federally-designated Native Hawaiian-serving and Minority-serving institution. CUH is a university of opportunity, providing an excellent education for students who have socioeconomic barriers to higher education, and to students from Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) communities that have been historically disenfranchised from college and careers for which a college degree is needed, including STEM careers. The <em>K&#363;lia</em> project addressed the I-USE program aims of improving STEM-learning environments, broadening participation and building a professional STEM workforce for tomorrow that is inclusive of Pacific students and their cultures. The <em>K&#363;lia</em> project supported dramatic changes to our undergraduate science courses. First, we updated these courses to &lsquo;research classrooms&rsquo;, ensuring that every student had access to the experience of research early in their college careers. At the upper division, we converted courses to semester-long research projects that are place- based, addressing Pacific problems and connecting students both to research methodology and the science that is needed in their community and home. These efforts demonstrate intellectual merit through the development of sophisticated and innovative new course content. They also broaden participation through making research experiences available to all, not just students whose privilege and outside commitments allow them to participate in summer research immersions. Second, we have brought indigenous Hawaiian and Pacific culture into the STEM classroom, incorporating traditional knowledge, place-based projects and indigenous ways of demonstrating knowledge. These efforts are focused on broadening participation through increasing inclusion and decreasing &lsquo;outsider&rsquo; status of Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders and students who are not privileged in STEM. Third, we addressed the &lsquo;digital divide&rsquo; head-on, by developing data science/big data modules that are embedded in a range of undergraduate courses to provide exposure to this emerging field which is revolutionizing STEM. These efforts demonstrate intellectual merit through the production of an innovative suite of curriculum resources that incorporate big data sets and their analytics and visualization into undergraduate courses in biology, environmental studies and forensics.
