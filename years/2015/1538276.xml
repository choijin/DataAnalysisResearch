<AbstractNarration>Seismometers are sensitive to tiny ground motions generated by distant earthquakes and other phenomena. As has long been known, in the absence of earthquakes, these instruments also record a background 'hum', a low level seismic signal originating in the earth that has energy cycling every 6-300 seconds. Broad waves called "infragravity waves" moving through the ocean are the source of most of the 'hum', imparting cyclic pressure on the seafloor as they travel through the seawater. This general relation between ocean 'forcing' on the seafloor and Earth's seismic 'hum' is understood, but how much is generated along the shallow margins of the ocean versus within the deep ocean basins, and why? This project investigates the relationship between the source region(s) of the 'hum' and the passage of major storms. It explores whether the shape of the coastal slopes influences how much hum energy is produced. In order to accomplish the work, seismometers both on the seafloor and on the continent will be used to combine information from the signals detected across the array of instruments, and point toward the location where the seafloor forcing occurred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a collaboration between seismologists and oceanographers, the spatial variability of infragravity wave (IG) energy levels, the influence of ocean storms on that pattern, and the generation of microseisms and Earth's long period "hum" will all be documented.  Broadband seismic and pressure spectra from the Cascadia amphibious array will be analyzed. Numerical models will be employed to explore the range of possible wave behaviors across the continental shelf. The coupling between wind-driven ocean waves, IG waves and the seafloor will be studied in a near-coastal region of the Pacific Northwest.  The results of this study will contribute to the characterization of IG noise levels on the ocean floor, link this variability to the near shore IG wave climate, and provide guidance for future off-shore deployments of seismic and pressure arrays. Improved understanding of the sources of Earth?s hum may help design approaches to using long period seismic noise data for the study of deep earth structure. The west coast of North America is uniquely suited for this purpose as it is has been documented as a strong source region for the "hum". A graduate student will play a significant role in this cross-disciplinary research, obtaining experience in array processing techniques such as stacking, beamforming, and back projection.</AbstractNarration>

Using seismic array analysis and back-projecting the seismic energy from seismic stations located around the Pacific ocean, averaged over 3 hour intervals, on a 5o x 5o grid, we show that the first 2 storms efficiently generate hum sources that follow in time and space the propagation of IG waves along the coast towards the north, as well as towards the open ocean. In contrast, the 3rd storm produces insignificant levels of hum. The direction of approach of the storms with respect to the west coast of north America is therefore an essential indicator of the efficiency of hum generation. We also find that shorter period hum is generated along the coast, while longer period hum extends far into the ocean basin, in agreement with what is expected from interactions of IG waves with the ocean floor (since longer period IG waves reach deeper below the ocean surface).  Combining information about the direction of propagation of storms in the north Pacific, with higher resolution IG wave models may make it possible to determine the distribution of hum sources, to first order, at high resolution, which will be useful in improving the resolution in studies of earth's mantle structure that rely on ambient noise tomography .
