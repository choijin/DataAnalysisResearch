<AbstractNarration>This research project is concerned with spectral theory of operators arising in mathematical physics -- in quantum mechanics, for example, the spectral values of appropriate operators give energy levels of associated quantum states.  One witnesses the currently growing interest in studying various spectral theory issues of novel materials science.  Such topics, known for a long time to be related to physical properties of metals and semiconductors, received a new boost due to the recent development of novel materials and metamaterials, such as graphene, topological insulators, carbon nanotubes, and photonic crystals, to name a few.  Addressing these is the main thrust of this research.  This project will lead to the development of techniques and results crucial for novel materials science, condensed matter physics, chemistry, and photonics.  Graduate students will be involved and trained in this important interdisciplinary area of research.  Running a series of international workshops on mathematics of novel materials science is also planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The variety of interconnected problems approached can be grouped into four broad areas, the first concerning the Geometry of Dispersion Relations (DR) in periodic media.  Here various issues such as existence and number spectral gaps, generic behavior and location of extrema of DR, irreducibility of DR, and existence of Dirac points will be addressed.  All these problems are at the heart of understanding properties of metals and semiconductors, as well as novel materials such as 2D crystals (graphene, graphynes, etc.), topological insulators, and photonic crystals.  The problem of overcoming the known topological obstacles to the existence of bases of Wannier functions (important for numerical computations) will be also attacked here.  A second area to be addressed concerns threshold effects, which arise near and at the relevant edges of the spectrum.  These include, in particular, precise asymptotics of Green's functions, homogenization, Liouville type properties, and design of materials slowing down light.  The third area concerns thin structures and will address issues of modeling and properties of thin graph-like or surface-like structures.  These arise naturally in modeling photonic crystals, photonic waveguides, quantum wires, and other applications.  The fourth area is devoted to nodal patterns (Chladni figures) of Dirichlet and Neumann eigenfunctions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project was devoted to various analytic mathematical issues arising in mathematical physics and novel material science. One can mention as the areas of impact solid state physics, novel materials, such as photonic crystals, nano-materials (graphene, nanotubes, graphynes), and topological insulators, as well as general mathematics areas of differential equations and spectral theory.  Spectra (which define most other properties) of various popular nano-materials (graphene, graphynes, nano-tubes) were described. The important issue of manufacturing materials with prescribed so-called stop bands (the feature that makes semi-conductors work) was addressed and a novel technique of designing such bands was introduced.  Besides nano-materials, other cases of interest (arising in photonic crystals and micro-electronics) are thin branching two-dimensional structures. While graph models for the graphene-type materials are well known and widely used, no appropriate model has been derived for such structures. The first such model was derived in the project.  Many properties of novel (and old) crystallin materials depend upon the behavior near an edge of the energy (or frequency) spectrum. The situation at the lowest energy has been well understood, while other spectral edges (of importance for instance for graphene type materials, novel wonderful topological insulators, or for designing slowing down light materials) are much harder to study. In the project, several advances have been obtained here, e.g. in terms of describing "most probable" behavior, structure of solutions, etc.  Another example of a "spectral edge" effect is the classical Liouville theorem on counting solutions. An apparently unrelated another classical counting Riemann-Roch theorem was now included as a part of the new Liouville-Riemann-Roch result obtained in the project.  The so called Wannier functions provide a powerful tool in numerical study of crystallin matter. It was shown by D. Thouless (winner of Nobel prize for topological materials) that in many cases a basis of such functions does not exist, due to a topological obstacle (this was a part of his Nobel prize winning work).
