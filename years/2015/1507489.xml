<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  Many properties of crystalline materials, such as metals, ceramic, and electronic materials, are controlled by crystal defects.  Dislocations are crystal defects containing long lines of disrupted atomic arrangements of their various crystal structures.  The motion of these dislocations is responsible for controlling the strength, ductility, and fracture behavior of structural metals and alloys, while in functional materials dislocations are often responsible for breakdown in optical and electron properties, often leading to reduction in lifetimes.  This research program is developing a new approach to mapping dislocations.  The research uses electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to image near surface dislocations.   This imaging is combined with focused ion beam (FIB) milling to cut a series of nano-scale sections through volumes of interest.  The images of each section are combined into 3-dimensional maps of the dislocations through volumes on the scale of tens of cubic micrometers.   Mapping of the dislocations associated with nano-indentations is facilitating a better understanding of the crystal-to-crystal dislocation motion necessary for deformation of arrays of crystals and responsible for fracture initiation at crystal boundaries.   Combining this enhanced understanding with computer simulations of dislocation motion is enabling enhanced prediction of material fracture behavior and lifetimes.  The research program supports the broad professional training of a postdoctoral research associate, carried out under a formal mentoring plan, in complement with undergraduate research.   The postdoctoral and undergraduate research support is leveraged to expose K-12 students and educators to science and engineering through the SEM Education Program (MSU-SEMED) program at MSU, which allows K-12 students and their teachers to be introduced to materials science though a hands-on experience with electron microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  This research project is developing a novel approach for tomographic mapping of the nano- to micro-scale distribution of dislocations in small volumes.  The technique combines focused ion beam (FIB) milling with electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI), a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique that allows dislocations to be imaged in the near surface region of bulk materials, to collect serial sections of dislocation images through a volume of interest, which are then reconstructed into a 3-D map of the dislocation structure.  Mapping at this scale addresses a gap in our current technology, with smaller volumes being assessable with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with similar dislocation densities and x-ray tomography assessing much larger volumes with much lower dislocation densities.  The development is focused on three technical tasks: 1) establishment of the FIB sectioning parameters necessary to achieve an optimal combination of high quality FIB polished surfaces with a high FIB sectioning throughput, 2) collection of serial ECCI images through deformed volumes under optimized electron channeling conditions, and 3) development of image recognition techniques for identifying the dislocations in the ECC images and subsequent reconstruction of the 3-dimensional dislocation maps.  The technique is being used to map the dislocation structures in plastic fields developed under nano-indentations in non-cubic metals in order to facilitate a robust assessment of crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) models of small-scale plastic deformation.  Indentations near grain boundaries are being studied to understand the nature of plastic deformation transfer across the boundaries in order to elucidate the mechanisms associated with grain boundary failure and damage nucleation in polycrystals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The vast majority of solid metals and alloys, as well as a significant fraction of ceramics, are crystalline materials, made up of large numbers of repeating atoms or molecules.  In some forms, these solids are large single crystals, but in most cases the material is made up of many smaller crystal units in varying orientations, known as grains, resulting in polycrystals.  A number of different crystal defects can occur in these solids, where the local arrangement of atoms or molecules is disrupted and local bonding disturbed.  These include grain boundaries, where different grains meet, vacancies, which are missing atoms or molecules, and dislocations, which are lines of disturbed bonds.  All of these crystal defects influence the properties of the material, including mechanical, electronic, and thermal behavior.  The motion of dislocations is well known to control the deformation behavior of metals and alloys.  Dislocations also have detrimental effects on the behavior of electronic materials. Dislocations have primarily been studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), although some work has been carried out using field ion or atom probe microscopy.  However, all of these methods are limited to observations in small volumes of material.  For example, the thin samples necessary for TEM are typically 100 nm thick or less and require destruction of the surrounding volume of material to make such samples.  Thus, there is an unmet need for characterizing larger 3-D volumes in order to develop an understanding of the local mesoscale structure and behavior.    The objective of this research project has been to use an alternative approach for imaging dislocations, electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI), which allows imaging of dislocation in the near surface region of bulk materials, as the basis for a tomographic approach to map dislocations in volumes on the scale of tens of cubic micrometers.  This is carried out by using a focused ion beam (FIB) to serially section through volumes of interest, with ECC imaging carried out after each material removal step.  Subsequently, the locations of the dislocations are identified in each layer and the positions re-combined to form a map of the dislocation arrangements.    In this study, the fundamentals for such 3-D mapping have been developed in concert with a study of how the motion of dislocations was observed to be restricted by certain grain boundaries know as incoherent twin boundaries (ITBs).  Understanding such interactions are critical to understanding the strength and fracture behavior of materials.  These dislocations, which appear as small dots, are seen to accumulate near the ITB in the ECC image in figure 1.  A key aspect of this study was to develop an approach for the identification of these dislocations, facilitating automation in the future. Figure 2 shows the dislocation positions identified in three FIB slices.  These positions are then used to map the dislocation through the 3-D FIB sectioned volume. The fundamentals established in this program are now being used in a number of studies.  First, the 3-D sectioning techniques are being used to better understand how more perfect diamond based electronic materials can be produced by determining the manner in which dislocation distributions in substrates influence the subsequently grown films.  Secondly, the automated dislocation identification program is being used to measure the residual dislocation densities in super conducting niobium cavities used in high energy particle accelerators.  A complimentary portion of this study modeled how these dislocations interact with the ITBs.  Using molecular dynamics simulations, the atomic level structure of the ITBs were first determined.  Then, a series of dislocations were introduced under a stress that pushed the dislocations towards the boundary.  Figure 3 shows three steps of this dislocation interaction, with the green dots in figure 3 (a) representing the dislocation, which upon incorporation in to the boundary results in a change in the boundary structure (figures 3 (b &amp; c).  This change in structure was correlated with the stress necessary to push the dislocation in to the boundary and represents the manner in which such boundaries lead to increased strength in the material.  The electron microscopy-based research of this project was leveraged to offer a window into the broad field of materials science for k-12 educators and students through the MSU Scanning Electron Microscopy Education program. This program, led by Professor C. Boehlert, brings both teachers and students in for half day experiences with materials through the window of electron microscopy.  Five different scanning electron microscopes are used to give small groups hands-on experiences with materials science and STEM in general.  Both the PI and the postdoctoral researcher supported by this grant participated with these groups, with a total of approximately 100 visitors being introduced to materials science each year.
