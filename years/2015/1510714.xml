<AbstractNarration>1510203&lt;br/&gt;Reinhold&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1510714&lt;br/&gt;Bornhorst&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently the growing threat of antibiotic compounds in natural waters and the antibiotic resistance in microorganism in those waters has been recognized and is an emerging field of intense research. The uptake and accumulation of antibiotics by food crops has prompted concerns about unintentional human exposure. In addition to accumulation, plants metabolize organic chemicals, including antibiotics, through conjugation reactions, resulting in phyto-metabolites that are sequestered into cell walls and vacuoles. The overall aim of the proposed project is to elucidate the production of phyto-metabolites of antibiotics and their subsequent release in human systems when plants are eaten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will evaluate the central hypothesis that plants predominantly metabolize antibiotics through conjugation with glycosides and glutathione, forming phyto-conjugates that are reverted to the parent antibiotic by human digestion. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, the research will: 1. Identify the metabolites of antibiotics in Arabidopsis thaliana in sterilized, controlled systems. 2. Quantify the production of phyto-metabolites of antibiotics in soil systems planted with A. thaliana and three vegetables, as relevant to the environmental fate of antibiotics in crop systems. 3. Elucidate pathways of degradation of phyto-metabolites of antibiotics during human digestion. The proposed research addresses the limitations of existing research on the fate of antibiotics through coupled use of radiolabeled chemicals and mass spectrometry, which will facilitate quantification of phyto-metabolism and degradation of phyto-metabolites in controlled mesocosms and column studies. Consequently, the proposed research is expected to advance understanding of phyto-metabolism of emerging pollutants through the following outcomes: (1) development of a generalized, transferable model of phyto-metabolism, (2) realistic estimates of the mass of phyto-metabolites of antibiotics in vegetated systems, including quantification of individual phyto-metabolites sequestered in vacuoles and cell walls with time, and, (3) determination of the bioavailability of sequestered phyto-metabolites during consumption of vegetables. This study will broadly impact society and science through integrating discovery and teaching, engaging underrepresented groups, broadly disseminating results, and addressing environmental and human health challenges. Research will engage and train a graduate student, at least two undergraduate students, and least four high school students in active research that transcends engineering and biology. This project will involve minority high-school students in research to encourage interest in engineering careers. Research outcomes will be broadly disseminated through academic avenues, including journal publications and conferences.</AbstractNarration>
