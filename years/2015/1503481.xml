<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 (DRK-12) program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project is a four-year design and development study submitted to the assessment strand of the program. It will focus on understanding how educational games, designed according to research-based learning and assessment design principles, can better assess and promote students' science knowledge, application of science process skills, and motivation and engagement in learning. The project will develop a new genre of games to serve as formative assessment resources designed to collect evidence of science learning during gameplay, provide feedback and coaching in the form of hints, and reinforce middle grade (6th-8th) students' life science concepts and investigation practices about ecosystems described in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) (Achieve, 2013). The games will build on the designs of the simulation-based, curriculum-embedded assessments developed in previous NSF-funded efforts, which include student progress reports and reflection activities that allow teachers to provide feedback to students and adjust instruction. The design of the games will draw from multiple lines of research, such as cognition, particularly model-based learning; principled assessment design; and motivation. Intended to provide engaging activities for understanding and investigating the system components, roles, interactions, and population dynamics of ecosystems, the project will produce two sets of comprehensive games: (1) Organisms and Interactions, and (2) Emergent Population Levels: Managing an Ecosystem. Each game will consist of progressively advanced mini-games. Twenty-four California Bay Area middle school teachers will participate in the study. Teacher professional development (PD) will include face-to-face sessions and an online platform that permits a wide range of interactions among participants and the facilitators. The PD will emphasize the alignment of the ecosystem simulation-based curriculum modules with their state standards, instructional materials, and the new games. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address six research questions: (1) How well do the games align with the ecosystem crosscutting concepts, core ideas, and inquiry practices in the NGSS?; (2) How well do game components meet quality standards?; (3) How well do the games integrate with the existing simulation-based curriculum modules and the teachers' existing instructional sequence?; (4) What effect does the use of the games have on students' understanding of the science concepts, scientific practices, and collaboration skills?; (5) How does success in gameplay relate to improved performance on the external outcome measures comprised of the simulation-based benchmark and the pre/posttest?; and (6) How does the use of the games affect students' engagement in science learning? In a Year 1 usability study, the project will test, analyze, and revise alpha versions of the games. In Year 2, a classroom feasibility study of beta versions will inform further revisions. In Year 3, six teachers will pilot-test the games. A second pilot test in Year 4 will examine the effectiveness of the games by comparing student performance in classes using the existing simulation-based curriculum-embedded assessments and reflection activities with classes using the curriculum-embedded assessments plus the new games. Data collection and analysis strategies include: (a) alignment reviews; (b) focus groups and usability testing; (c) cognitive labs for construct validity and usability; (d) game reports (badges); (e) pre/posttest of American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) items; (f) benchmark assessment data; (g) student interest in the games and science; (h) teacher surveys; (i) case studies; (j) game quality analysis; (k) differential item functioning; (l) analysis of covariance; and (m) analysis of variance on posttest scores (outcome variable) to compare the means across student groups (by intervention mode) and their prior science achievement levels.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The SimScientists Games project developed and pilot tested two serious educational games to reinforce and extend student progress on the science practices and concepts in a middle-school science unit on ecosystems. The games were designed to be implemented as part of a suite of simulation-based embedded and benchmark assessment, embedded into a teachers' regular instruction.</p> <p>The project team developed systems for capturing data from the games and simulation-based assessments that could be used as evidence of student learning and mastery of the relevant science practices and concepts. These included a log of observable events, including mouse-clicks and other actions that students make during the game. The team interpreted from these logs student response patterns that yield diagnostic infomation about student learning and mastery, which could be used as evidence pieces to support claims about student learning and mastery of the relevant science practices and concepts.</p> <p>The games were developed iteratively, with each implementation providing data that informed revisions. A team of advisors with expertise in science education, assessment, and educational games provided feedback that were also incorporated into the revisions ofhte games. These implementations included a small pilot study with eight teachers and 641 students. All but one of these teachers was actively working to align their curriculum with NGSS standards. The teachers reported that the games were at least somewhat helpful in supporting student learning of the relevant science practices and concepts, that the games were engaging, and that the games had a positive impact on student learning. Data from students "thinking aloud" in cognitive labs indicated that students were using the relevant science practices and concepts to accomplish tasks embedded into each of the games. In particular, students were engaged in actively making observations, and then constructing arguments from evidence.</p> <p>The project culminated in a larger pilot study with 31 teachers from 19 different states at 26 different schools. Over 2,500 students participated. Teachers in the pilot study were split into two groups. Sample 1 included 16 teachers who used the simulation-based assessments and games; sample 2 included 15 teachers who used the simulation-based assessments and teacher-led "reflection activities" designed to review and reinforce the ideas from the embedded assessments. Compared to these reflection activities, the games had an effect size of -0.067 (Hedge's g), with p-value 0.0118.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Matt&nbsp;D&nbsp;Silberglitt</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1503481/1503481_10370430_1606689057336_SimScientistsGame1Intro--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1503481/1503481_10370430_1606689057336_SimScientistsGame1Intro--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SimScientists food web game introduction"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1503481/1503481_10370430_1606689057336_SimScientistsGame1Intro--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SimScientists food web game introduction"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The context for the food web game is a desert oasis in Africa.</div> <div class="imageCredit">SimScientists Games</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Matt&nbsp;D&nbsp;Silberglitt</div> <div class="imageTitle">SimScientists food web game introduction</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1503481/1503481_10370430_1606689238331_SimScientistsGame1CollectingEvidence--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1503481/1503481_10370430_1606689238331_SimScientistsGame1CollectingEvidence--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SimScientists food web game collecting evidence"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1503481/1503481_10370430_1606689238331_SimScientistsGame1CollectingEvidence--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SimScientists food web game collecting evidence"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Players collect evidence for the food web by taking pictures of interactions between organisms</div> <div class="imageCredit">SimScientists Games</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Matt&nbsp;D&nbsp;Silberglitt</div> <div class="imageTitle">SimScientists food web game collecting evidence</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1503481/1503481_10370430_1606689340361_SimScientistsGame1FoodWeb--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1503481/1503481_10370430_1606689340361_SimScientistsGame1FoodWeb--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SimScientists food web game food web"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1503481/1503481_10370430_1606689340361_SimScientistsGame1FoodWeb--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SimScientists food web game food web"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Players construct models of the food web and support the models with their evidence.
