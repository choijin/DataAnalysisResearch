<AbstractNarration>The Geometry Games software (to be developed in this project) takes some of the most fundamental ideas of modern geometry and topology -- namely multi-connected spaces, symmetries and higher dimensions -- and brings them to a broad audience of students, artists, and other laypeople.  Mathematics instruction has traditionally been very demanding:  mathematicians often ask their students to meet them on the mathematicians' own terms.  The current project turns this arrangement around, bringing beautiful mathematical ideas to the general public on their own terms, in a context they are familiar with, like games or artwork.  To bring each space or symmetry pattern to life, the software creates the illusion of a real physical object that people can hold in the palm of their hands and play with.  While having fun playing a game or painting a picture, people build up an intuitive understanding of the mathematics.  This project's primary goal is to let nonspecialists enjoy modern geometry in the same way that nonspecialists may enjoy literature and music;  at the same time the hope is that this exposure to "advanced" geometrical ideas may help prepare and inspire the next generation of mathematicians, scientists, and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of specific mathematical content and the software that brings it to life, the current project has three goals.  The first goal is to improve and extend the five existing Geometry Games flagship apps:  Torus Games (eight familiar games, but played on flat 2-manifolds and 3-manifolds), KaleidoPaint (create colorful paintings under the action of the 17 Euclidean wallpaper groups), KaleidoTile (explore polyhedra and tilings on spherical, flat and hyperbolic surfaces), Curved Spaces (flight simulator for spherical, flat and hyperbolic 3-manifolds) and 4D Draw (4-dimensional vector graphics).  The second goal is to raise the Hyperbolic Games (familiar games on hyperbolic 2-manifolds) from a minor app to flagship quality.  The third goal is to develop two completely new apps:  4D Maze (mazes in 4-dimensional space, as an aid to learning to visualize 4D) and Cross Chase (a projective plane game).  In terms of hardware, delivering versions of all these apps for Android and iOS is an especially high priority, given people's ubiquitous use of smartphones and tablets.  Versions for Macintosh and Windows will of course also be developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the words of an NSF reviewer:  "Mathematical concepts and ideas have traditionally been expressed in words and symbols, using an abstruse vocabulary that has been built up painstakingly over hundreds of years. For a traditionally trained mathematician this works well. But it takes a long time and is hard work for even a highly intelligent layperson to pick up enough of the lingo to become comfortable with it, and this sets up a very high barrier for non-mathematicians who would like to understand some part of modern mathematics."  The purpose of the P.I.'s work is to strip away the abstruse vocabulary and formalism, and present a few of the most beautiful ideas of modern geometry and topology in a concrete, visual, even tacile form that students, artists and other laypeople can appreciate and enjoy.  To achieve this goal, the P.I. selected three of the most important ideas, namely  symmetry multi-connected spaces 4-dimensional space   and wrote computer software to simulate these beautiful objects so smoothly and realistically that users feel as if they are holding and manipulating the novel objects in the palms of their hands.  Moreover, the software presents these simulations in contexts that people are familiar with, like games or artwork.  The user can immediately start playing a game in a multiconnected space, or drawing a picture with built-in symmetry, and gradually build up a gut-level intuition and understanding of the mathematical concept that it embodies.  During the 2015-2018 period funded by this grant, the P.I. brought the entire collection of Geometry Games up to date and extended them to new platforms. The revisions focused mainly on the graphics architecture:  Computer graphics hardware and software always evolve gradually from year to year, but then once every decade or so undergo a more major architectural revolution.  The latest revolution, over the past few years, has been to replace old-style programmable shaders with a more flexible and efficient "low-level" approach.  During the period funded by this grant, the P.I. rewrote all the existing Geometry Games apps using the new "low-level" approach.  For one of the apps (KaleidoPaint) the new approach was not only faster, but also let the P.I. reduce the app's memory requirements 1000-fold, to meet the needs of artists wanting to create highly complex symmetrical designs.  The switch to the "low-level" approach also turned out to be fortuitous preparation for possible future Geometry Games in virtual reality (VR), because (at least on macOS) VR isn't available for the old approach, but requires the "low-level" approach instead.  During the same 2015-2018 period, the P.I. wrote iOS versions of all apps which didn't already have one, and wrote one new publicly available app (Crystal Flight) that had previously existed only as a museum version.  More specifically, the following apps were upgraded and supported:  Torus Games KaleidoPaint KaleidoTile Curved Spaces 4D Maze 4D Draw Hyperbolic Games Crystal Flight   These apps are all available free of charge at www.geometrygames.org .  As well as their home and classroom use, these apps get used in a variety of public settings.  Here are a few current (September 2018) uses that the P.I. is aware of:  Flandrau Science Center  A custom "museum version" of the Torus Games is running live at the Flandrau Science Center &amp; Planetarium in Tucson AZ as part of their semi-permanent exhibit "Puzzles, Proofs, and Patterns: Experience the World of Mathematics".  IMAGINARY exhibitions  The German Mathematics Research Institute in Oberwolfach founded the IMAGINARY organization (imaginary.org), which has organized nine permanent math exhibitions and a large number of traveling ones.  Some of these exhibitions include the Crystal Flight app, which lets visitors explore the geometry of real crystals in Euclidean space as well as fanciful crystals in 3-dimensional spherical and hyperbolic spaces.  Escher exhibitions  I?ve been told that the current Escher exhibition in Brooklyn NY (as well as earlier installations of the same exhibition elsewhere) includes a drawing made with KaleidoPaint, used to illustrate a symmetry pattern that Escher himself rarely (or perhaps never) used.     The apps' ultimate purpose is two-fold:  First, to attract students to careers in mathematics and other STEM fields.  Indeed the P.I. occasionally meets graduate students and faculty who tell him that his earlier writings and software were what made them decide on a career in mathematics.  The apps' second, and equally important, purpose is to disseminate beautiful ideas from higher mathematics out into our broader culture, for the use and enjoyment of all.
