<AbstractNarration>The Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS) will administer and implement "PolarTREC - Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating", a program that brings together U.S. teachers to participate in cutting-edge field research with polar scientists in various, and often remote, locations in the Arctic and Antarctica. Through hands-on field experiences in the Arctic and Antarctica, participating teachers (pre-service and in-service) will improve teaching strategies, develop resources for their careers, and change how they teach STEM in the classroom. The program goal is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing educators and polar researchers together in professional collaboration. By integrating research and education, PolarTREC will help sustain and grow the considerable academic and public enthusiasm for polar research and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award provides funding for ARCUS to support 12 teacher-researcher teams during 2016. ARCUS will recruit, select, and match teachers and researchers, maintain a website for dissemination of information about the expeditions, provide orientation training for the teachers that includes field safety and communication training, provide travel support for the teachers to meet with scientists prior to deployments and for them to join the scientific expeditions in the field, and evaluate results of the program. Teachers will participate in a variety of outreach events following their deployments to ensure dissemination of information about the polar science and educational activities related to their scientific expeditions.</AbstractNarration>

Working effectively across these many boundaries requires communication, coordination, and collaboration management.&nbsp;The Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS) is an international not-for-profit organization that connects across boundaries (e.g., disciplines, international borders, stakeholders, communities). &nbsp;Since 2004, ARCUS has been administrating a cutting edge professional development program for classroom teachers. Through hands-on field research experiences, middle and high school educators from around the United States participant in field experiences with researchers in the polar regions (Arctic and Antarctica). Participating teachers improve teaching strategies, connect with the public and their classrooms, develop resources for their careers, and integrate what they have learned into their classrooms.</p> <p>From 2016-2017, ARCUS supported 15 expeditions to the polar regions, 8 in the Arctic and 7 in the Antarctic. All 15 teachers were either middle school or high school teachers from around the United States. All the teachers took part in an Orientation before they joined their research team. Training involves teachers learning how to use technology to communicate science, safety training, working with team training, and how to best prepare and use this experience in the classrooms. Soon after training, teachers began heading to the various field locations, starting in the late spring of 2016 and continuing through late January 2017. In the field, the teachers work very closely with the researchers and learn how to collect data, record data, and even analyze the data. They become an integral part of the team. Our program is also evaluated by an outside evaluator and they report that researchers enjoy having teachers on their teams as they are integral in both helping collect the scientific data as well as sharing the science with the public. More information about each expedition, including journals, photos, multi-media, and comments from the public are available on the PolarTREC website here: http://www.polartrec.com/expeditions.</p> <p>The attached image is an infographic sharing some of the outreach that the 15 teachers did while in the program. Overall, participants wrote 803 new journals; added 24 new lessons to our line resource database; were featured in 44 news articles; hosted 12 PolarConnect (real-time webinars) and participated in numerous student and public presentations. All the teachers wrote a &ldquo;STEM Experience Report&rdquo; which give an overview of the expedition and how they think the experience makes them a better teacher. These reports are easy to read and can be accessed here: https://www.polartrec.com/resources/expedition-reports</p> <p>The teachers were also very talented photographers and there are some stunning images that document their experiences. If you have never seen what it looks like UNDER the ice in Antarctica, we encourage you to view the work of teacher Tim Dwyer. He captured the underwater beauty of Antarctica during his expedition to look at Giant Sea Spiders.&nbsp; All the images taken by the teachers can be accessed and are free to use for educational purposes.
