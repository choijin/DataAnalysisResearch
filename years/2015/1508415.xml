<AbstractNarration>CBET 1508415&lt;br/&gt;Bibby&lt;br/&gt;CBET 1507285&lt;br/&gt;Haas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAPID: Collaborative Research: Survival of Ebola virus in the Water Environment: Surrogate Development and Disinfection Effectiveness&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little is known about the fate of Ebola virus and its survival in the environment.  Infection in primates has been observed from non-direct contact, raising further the possibility of an environmental infection route. As an initial phase of this RAPID, Ebola virus surrogates, based upon the published data of Ebola virus survival in liquid media, will be developed.  Second, the survival of these surrogates will be evaluated in environmental waters (including water and wastewater) and in the presence of water and wastewater disinfectants. This work will be valuable to the broader environmental, public health, and risk assessment communities by providing access to realistic surrogates with which studies (e.g. aerosol and fomite survival studies) may be conducted. The proposed RAPID mechanism is appropriate to inform proper waste handling in a timely manner. This work will also serve to mobilize and inform a response to proper waste handling. Given limited BSL4 access, this approach is the most reasonable response in the near term to inform Ebola virus survival in the water environment, and subsequent risk assessment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental work on this project will be conducted at the University of Pittsburgh. Data and statistical analysis will be conducted at Drexel University. The proposed research will benefit society through informing proper handling of Ebola virus contaminated waste. The proposed work will be disseminated broadly through journal publications and conference proceedings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will fill in an existing knowledge gap in the survival and proper handling of Ebola virus contaminated waste. This research will also develop and verify surrogates that may be used by the broader environmental engineering and public health research communities for Ebola virus survival studies.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The 2014-16 Ebola virus epidemic ultimately caused 28,652 illnesses resulting in 11,325 deaths. Concerns were raised during this outbreak regarding the appropriate disposal of Ebola virus contaminated wastewater to avoid possible environmental transmission. Infected individuals may produce up to 9 liters of liquid waste per day, in addition to wash water. Both the World Health Organization and United States Centers for disease control recommended direct disposal of the Ebola virus contaminated wastewater into latrines and sewers. This recommendation was made because of the expected low persistence of Ebola virus in the environment, as it is an enveloped virus. Contrary to official recommendations, in the United States all Ebola Treatment Units elected to perform some liquid waste treatment due to public and utility uncertainty regarding the risk posed by direct Ebola virus wastewater disposal. This research project was undertaken to address uncertainty regarding Ebola virus persistence in wastewater and to inform treatment of wastewater containing highly infectious virus. Working with Ebola virus requires specialized Biosafety Level 4 containment conditions. Therefore, we first evaluated the suitability of surrogates, physiologically similar microorganisms, to mimic the behavior of Ebola virus. The best performing surrogate was the enveloped bacteriophage (virus that infects bacteria) Phi6; however, this surrogate was not universally conservative and it was determined that it is more appropriate to work with the actual infectious agent. Via collaboration with NIH Rocky Mountain Laboratories we next investigated the persistence and disinfection of Ebola virus in sterilized wastewater. The time for 90% inactivation of Ebola virus was found to be 2.1 days; however, these results were likely conservative (i.e. Ebola virus decay would be more rapid) due to the necessary sterilization of the wastewater. Ebola virus was disinfected much more rapidly than current US EPA recommendations for virus disinfection in the presence of free chlorine; however, the chlorine demand of the wastewater must first be exceeded for this assessment to be valid. Moving forward, the findings from this project will inform appropriate disposal and disinfection of wastewater contaminated with highly infectious agents.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/12/2016<br>      Modified by: Kyle&nbsp;Bibby</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
