<AbstractNarration>Higher education offerings in entrepreneurship education (EE) at the undergraduate and graduate levels have outpaced efforts to inventory them, let alone outpaced agreement on objectives and development of evidence-based curriculum content and teaching and student evaluation methods.  The project will convene faculty and administrators, innovation and education scholars, and entrepreneurs and investors to review the variety of contemporary approaches, develop a greater consensus concerning the functions of entrepreneurship education, identify opportunities for evaluation, and recommend methods for research, including cross-institution research.   Although the project does not itself entail empirical research and data collection, a clearer articulation of objectives will enable the statement of testable hypotheses regarding the elements of curriculum, teaching methods, and performance evaluation that do and do not contribute to various student outcomes.    The project also has the potential to inform student expectations and choices among institutions, programs, concentrations, and courses as well as institutional decisions about academic offerings, staffing, and provision of ancillary services such as prototype development, enterprise incubation, and start-up financing.  Evidence-based individual and institutional decisions should contribute to policies to promote more vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-stage project will begin with the formation of a Task Force on Entrepreneurship Education and Research comprised of innovation and higher education scholars who will review current offerings, examine any evidence of the effectiveness of curriculum elements and teaching methods, and recommend research approaches.  The Task Force will develop a set of conclusions and proposals for consideration by a conference whose participants include administrators, entrepreneurs, investors, selected students, and a few principals from non-US institutions&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Project Outcomes Report  Education in entrepreneurship (EE) is being embraced by a very large, rapidly growing number of higher education institutions at all levels, both as a complement to other coursework in developing critical thinking skills and orientation to collaborative action and as a means of directly creating new business and not-for-profit ventures.  There is great diversity in EE programs but little agreement about or research on what are effective curricula, teaching methods, degree of interdisciplinarity, student selection and evaluation criteria, methods of project identification and refinement, involvement of mentors, and access to extra-curricular resources (e.g., incubators, accelerators, legal services, and start-up financing schemes), among other features.   Entrepreneurship education is an immature field in need of a consensus on the meaning of terms, a framework for systematic comparison, and development of protocols for evaluating outcomes to aid in the optimal design of programs.     On May 3-4, 2016, Duke convened a conference intended to take the first steps in developing a "community of practice" based on a common vocabulary, a theoretical underpinning, a systematic comparison of program elements, and evidence of what practices serve EE?s different objectives and constituencies.   The meeting was supported by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and the National Science Foundation?s Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) Program.   It was organized by the Duke (Law School) Center for innovation Policy, the university-wide Duke Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative, and the Fuqua (Business School) Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation.  The conference was attended by principals in 13 diverse EE programs at public and private institutions together with economists, entrepreneurs, investors, foundation representatives, and other interested parties &ndash; approximately 50 participants in all.    The conference reached two broad conclusions about needed next steps:  1)      As a foundation for research into the effectiveness of various approaches to EE in different contexts, there is an urgent need to develop a framework for comparing programs and a process for agreeing on terminology.   Through their convening capabilities (workshop and conference support), the National Science Foundation and the Kauffman Foundation should continue this effort.     2)     This conversation should be expanded beyond scholars of entrepreneurship (the majority of participants at Duke) to include scholars of higher education policy and practice, who can also advise on methods of evaluation research.  The Kauffman Foundation and the National Science Foundation, through its Human Resources Directorate and innovation programs, are well suited to bringing together appropriate people from education and business schools and other relevant departments such as economics and sociology.  Toward the first objective, conference co-organizer Jon Fjeld, Fuqua, took material from the conference to develop a framework for comparing seven experiential EE programs &ndash; Stanford Design School?s Launchpad program, Arizona State University?s eSeed Challenge + Accelerator Program, University of Chicago?s New Venture Challenge (Traditional Track), Duke University?s Program for Entrepreneurs (P4E), Georgia Tech?s Technological Innovation: Generating Results (TI:GER) Program, Massachusetts Institute of Technology?s delta v accelerator program, and Toronto University?s Creative Destruction Lab.  This template, Experiential Entrepreneurship Education Programs at Universities:  Are They All the Same? A Framework for Understanding, has been submitted to NSF and is available from fjeld@duke.edu.   It will be refined in further meetings convened by Duke.
