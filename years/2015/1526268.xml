<AbstractNarration>Monitoring web traffic is critical to several players in the Internet eco-system--including Internet Service Providers, regulators, network administrators, as well as researchers. Because of the increasing use of traffic encryption, as well as growing privacy concerns, however, such monitoring may soon need to be conducted using only limited information (anonymized TCP/IP headers). This project considers a learning-based classification approach for web traffic monitoring, that can work with such limited information and yet identify the type of web page being downloaded. The project argues through a proof of concept that the potential impact of this approach is quite significant in several application domains, including profiling of user content preference, profiling of user navigation behavior, as well as identifying the usage of video streaming and mobile devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, however, also identifies several fundamental issues that challenge the promise to deliver this impact in practice. The proposed research will evaluate and address these risks by:&lt;br/&gt; (i) designing robust statistical techniques for web page boundary detection;&lt;br/&gt; (ii) conducting an extensive study of web traffic and page diversity across client platforms, client locations, and time;&lt;br/&gt; (iii) identifying stable and robust traffic features and using these to study the performance of classification for several contemporary labeling schemes; and&lt;br/&gt; (iv) incorporating and evaluating the proposed approach within several real-world application domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project is expected to have a transformative impact on several domains.  The first impact is on the current debate on privacy-violating monitoring techniques. While most arguments are either for or against allowing deep packet monitoring, this project shifts the focus to a different paradigm -- that of simultaneously achieving a balance between monitoring and privacy goals.  The proposed classification approach provides a great alternative to network managers, regulators, ISPs, as well as researchers, who can understand client preferences and application prevalence, without relying on slow and privacy-threatening techniques. Second, the project will be an excellent source of undergraduate and graduate students trained in experimentation, measurements, and scientific analysis of big data---skills that are invaluable for many federal, commercial and academic institutions that are involved in mining for information in large data-sets. Third, through involvement of minorities, the project will help broaden the diversity of the Computer-Science work force. Finally, through outreach using demos to middle- and high-schoolers, especially on a topic related to web browsing that is near and dear to most, the project will help increase community engagement with science and technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main focus of this project was to study website classification, based on a diverse range of classes. Two key aspects studied were: (i) to study privacy-respecting web-traffic monitoring, in which only the type (and not identity) of a webpage is classified, and (ii) investigate the limits of learnability by comprehensively considering traffic features used for classification.  Intellectual Merits:  (i) The research pursued in this project represents a novel and unusual take in an important field&mdash;using a type-classification based approach for web traffic monitoring. This allowed the research to conceive and evaluate fine-grained and never-before-considered labeling schemes, that can enable a surprisingly diverse set of contemporary monitoring applications.  (ii) The web page boundary detection techniques developed in this project are expected to benefit and enable several other research topics. Indeed, this component of the proposed research is a fundamental pre-cursor to many other types of web traffic analyses---this project will represent a significant leap in how the state of the art addresses this fundamental problem.  (iii) The study of the impact of client diversity in client platforms on web traffic has made a strong case for incorporating client platform diversity in data collection for web traffic analysis. This will have significant implications for understanding and improving the design of both different browser platforms as well as websites. We expect that this project will lay significant groundwork for both client-side and server-side development of designs that perform better.  (iv) The methodology of considering both robustness and consistency of traffic features before they are used for classification, significantly advances how learning-based techniques get used in the field of networking.  (v) The synthetic user browsing models developed in this project lay the groundwork for newer ones that can better support future research on web usage and performance.  (vi) The exhaustive feature analysis methodology develop in this project sets the bar high for research in web traffic analysis, to aim for feature sets that are developed comprehensively.  Several publications (and a Ph.D. thesis) have resulted from this research.  Broader Impacts:  The project accomplishments benefit several communities.  First, classifying web pages without inspecting actual content in a privacy-violating manner, can shift the focus of the current monitoring-vs-privacy debate in the Internet community, to that of simultaneously achieving monitoring as well as privacy goals. This will be a significant enabler for ISPs, network managers, regulators, and researchers.  Second, experience in experimentation, measurements, and scientific data analysis is invaluable to federal, commercial, and academic institutions that are involved in mining for information in large data sets.
