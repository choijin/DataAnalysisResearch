<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Brooke Ullery is "Algebraic Geometry." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Utah, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Aaron Bertram.</AbstractNarration>

After that paper was completed, Ullery worked on a paper with David Stapleton, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California - San Diego, in which they computed measures of irrationality for several more examples of algebraic varities.   In addition, during the period of her fellowship, Ullery served on two panels at conferences for women in mathematics.
