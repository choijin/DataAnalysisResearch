<AbstractNarration>This project entails the convening of a workshop at the University of Pennsylvania Law School to discuss ways to increase access to federal court data for research use. Presently. such access is limited, very expensive or both. That is an important shortcoming given the important role that courts play in our economy and society. We cannot reliably assess the performance of our justice system, much less improve it, if we cannot adequately measure its performance in the first place. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together scholars with experience or demonstrated interest in using federal court data in empirical research, as well as organizational staff with experience in warehousing and studying court data. In several roundtable sessions, participants will discuss the logistical, scholarly, and any other practical challenges that must be faced to increase access to federal court data. They will then work together to develop concrete ideas for how to increase such access, taking into account the challenges just mentioned. It is hoped that these ideas will form the basis for future proposals or projects by participants, which will be directed at providing broader research access to court data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On October 9, 2015, Penn Law School hosted a workshop called Increasing Access to Federal Court Data, which was generously funded by the National Science Foundation Law and Social Science program ("NSF").   The focus of the workshop was to bring together researchers and administrators&mdash;from a broad cross-section of academic institutions, federal judicial agencies, and other organizations&mdash;to discuss the causes and consequences of current limitations in access to federal court data. A key objective was to come up with ideas to increase access in the future. The workshop agenda appears in Appendix A.  Attendees included a cross section of academic scholars, as well as representatives from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts ("AO"), the Federal Judicial Center ("FJC"), the Administrative Conference of the United States ("ACUS"), the National Center for State Courts ("NCSC"), a representative from the NSF there to observe, and a representative from the Free Law Project (a nonprofit organization that provides free public access to millions of court opinions). A complete list of participants is provided in Appendix B.  There were several sessions:  Session 1: What We Should Be Able to Do with Federal Court Data But Can?t   One key observation was that it is important to move to question-driven research, rather than data-driven research: rather than studying what limited data will allow, we should be studying important questions, and doing so with appropriate data. However, given current limitations on access to court data, it is often not possible to answer important questions. For example, reporters ask legal academics questions like, How many class actions are filed each year; How many of these are certified; and What sorts of claims do they make. Yet there is no way to answer such questions clearly and uncontroversially. Even though PACER?s databases certainly contain the information necessary to do so, academics cannot access these databases in ways that make such research feasible, either from a programming or, often, financial point of view.   Session 2: Papers Written Using Federal Court Data. Panelists described the following papers:   A study of whether female/African American judges decide cases differently from male/white judges. This study sampled from court data provided directly by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. A study of qui tam actions that used data obtained from the DOJ via FOIA requests, as well as court data obtained from PACER via fee waivers.[1] This study was feasible in part due to the substantial financial and human resources available at the author?s institution&mdash;resources that are not universally available to scholars. A study of transfers in the federal courts (pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1404). A large majority of research time in this project was spent on data acquisition tasks due to the constraints on scholarly access to federal court data.  Research on bankruptcy-related outcomes,[2] which brings the same data-access challenges discussed in this document with respect to civil actions.   Session 3: Logistics of providing court data access Session 4: Small-Group Discussions of Ideas to Increase Public Access to Federal Court Data Session 5: Full-Group Discussion of Ideas to Increase Public Access to Federal Court Data   A number of action items were identified as a result of the workshop?s panels:  The value of opening up access to the Integrated Data Base (which has recently been posted on the Federal Judicial Center?s website for public use) Improve the PACER user interface, which was designed a long time ago and has limited search functionality  Improve the nature of CM/ECF data collection, e.g., have separate designation of motions to dismiss by type Find ways to centralize PACER documents, or at least PACER fee waivers; the AO might create a system for national requests for waivers from the clerks Provide back-end access to PACER. One panel participant pointed out the "absurdity" of having to scrape data from a website when the data already live in a data base           [1] FOIA does not apply to PACER.    [2] A participant mentioned that there were more than 800,000 bankruptcy petitions filed in the 12 months ending on September 30, 2015&mdash;a substantial multiple of the 250,000-300,000 civil actions typically filed in the district courts.
