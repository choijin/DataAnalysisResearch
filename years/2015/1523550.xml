<AbstractNarration>A request is made by the University of Hawaii to fund additional and replacement instrumentation for the R/V Kilo Moana, (KM), a 185? general purpose research vessel. The vessel is owned by the Navy and operated by the University of Hawaii as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. Instrumentation requested in this proposal incluses:&lt;br/&gt;1) Scintillation counter $47,528 &lt;br/&gt;2) 12 kHz acoustic pinger $16,650 &lt;br/&gt;3) Reverse osmosis water purification system $8,135 &lt;br/&gt;4) High accuracy pressure standard $8,875 &lt;br/&gt;5) Replacement Xducers for subbottom profiling system $12,500 &lt;br/&gt;       $93,688 &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A modern research vessel requires a variety of dedicated equipment to support investigations at sea.  Aboard the R/V Kilo Moana, this includes supporting research using radioisotopes and highly purified water.  The ship also conducts geophysical investigations and is equipped with a 3.5 kHz sonar system that can penetrate the seabed to image underlying sediment structures.  This grant provided funds to purchase shared-use equipment that supports research aboard the R/V Kilo Moana.  Funds were provided to purchase a new liquid scintillation counter, a new reverse osmosis watermaker, and to replace three 3.5 kHz transducers that had failed in service.  A new Perkin Elmer Tri-Carb 4910TR liquid scintillation counter was purchased and put into service in the R/V Kilo Moana?s Radiation Lab van.  A Fisher-Scientific Pacific RO 40 water purification system was purchased and put into service in the Kilo Moana?s chemistry lab.  One replacement 3.5 kHz transducer was purchased to replace a non-functional element in the R/V Kilo Moana's subbottom profiling sonar array.  Two additional transducers were located or procured with other funds.  This left some funds available on this grant and, with the permission of the program manager, those funds were used to augment funds required to complete the Kilo Moana?s network upgrade, work which had supported with an earlier oceanographic instrumentation grant.
