<AbstractNarration>This work aims to effectively address security concerns while maintaining the privacy of individuals and corporations. The project analyzes subversive attacks, develops defenses and deterrents, creates privacy tools and software, and increases awareness and expertise through teaching, mentoring and involvement of students in research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research rethinks the basics of cryptographic security to provide new models, frameworks, tools and solutions. This project considers the subversion of random number generators and offers forms of encryption that are robust in its presence. The project explores: (1) the subversion of certificate authorities and offer certificate-signing mechanisms that deter it, (2) the exfiltration of cryptographic keys by malware installed on systems and development of big-key cryptography as a deterrent, and (3) the subversion of key distribution protocols through infiltration of their endpoints and development of new protocols to resist it.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Nation state adversaries subvert cryptographic security by methods that include insertion of vulnerabilities into encryption software, insertion of backdoors into standardized random-number generators and coercion of Internet corporations to perform subversive tasks. This project studied SUBVERSION-RESISTANT CRYPTOGRAPHY, identifying possible attacks and counter-measure in this setting. Cryptographic algorithms make crucial use of randomness, making random number generators a target for subversion. To protect against this, we develop encryption that provides the best possible security in the face of low-quality randomness.  We are seeing increasing use of non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) systems. These assume parameters provided by a trusted party. These parameters may be subverted. We develop NIZKs that resist this, retaining as much security as possible even under subverted parameters.  Public-key encryption systems in use assume trusted elliptic curves, which become another point of possible subversion. We develop public-key encryption systems that are more robust than standard ones in the face of compromise of the elliptic curves. TLS/SSL sessions can be compromised by coercing a Certificate Authority (CA) into creating a rogue certificate in the name of a popular server. As a deterrent, we suggest that CA's sign certificates with DAPS (double-authentication-preventing signatures), which in such a situation will allow anyone to recover the CA's signing key. We design and implement practical DAPS schemes. Subversion can involve penetrating a user system to install malware on a target computer that can then exfiltrate a key. We develop big-key cryptography, which protects against this by using 100 GByte keys in an efficient way. We design big-key authenticated-encryption schemes and big-key block ciphers. We give attacks that show how encryption can be undetectably compromised by malware that subverts the userâ€™s encryption code.
