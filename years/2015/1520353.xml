<AbstractNarration>This project provides travel support for undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at universities in the U.S. to attend the 16th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM 2015) on June 15-18, 2015 in Pittsburgh, PA. MDM is a premier conference sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society. It encompasses all aspects of mobility. Given the broad sense of mobility, MDM brings together researchers from databases, networking and ubiquitous and pervasive computing, to present and discuss the progress of science in these areas of critical national needs. The conference relies on the experience of senior members of the community, but also aims to generate fresh ideas, foster new collaborations, and expose new people to emerging research opportunities. Attendance at MDM is very beneficial to students. The conference makes for an excellent forum for exchange of ideas and future collaborations. Students also have opportunities to meet distinguished researchers and be inspired by them to follow careers in mobile data management research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference provides opportunities for four days of exciting discussions on topics of mobile data management. The theme of MDM 2015 is the Internet of Things (IoT) and Mobile Cloud Computing. In addition to research paper presentations, MDM includes tutorials, demos, workshops and panels on emerging topics and industrial applications. To encourage students to participate in the exciting technical program, this project provides support to defray the travel expenses for student attendees.  Calls for MDM 2015 student travel support applications are advertised nationwide through the MDM 2015 website (http://mdmconferences.org/mdm2015/index.html) and other venues including DBWORLD. Students from underrepresented groups (women, minorities and disabled students) are especially encouraged to apply. The project details can be found at the project website http://www.pitt.edu/~kpele/nsf-mdm.html.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was able to support the participation of 18 students (including 2 females and 1 undergraduate) at the2015  IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management in Pittsburgh, Pensylvania, U.S.A.  Students through participation in such conferences are able to understand and become exposed to the current state-of-the-art of the field.  They also have the chance to discuss their own research with senior researchers in the field and hence, get directions/advices for their future research beyond those of their advisors.  It is well-known that a diversity of directions to be examined is what provides novel scientific findings and these conferences are perfect for this idea-exchange.  It is expect that these students will be able to provide significant scientific developments in the future.    After the conference ended, the students were asked to submit a report about their experiences.   They almost univocally stressed that their participation in the conference benefited them significantly. For some of these students, this was their first conference; the grant has thus helped them get accustomed to participating in and presenting their work to wide audiences at conferences. As most of the award recepients stressed, they benefited from the interactions with senior researchers and got useful insights for their future research.
