<AbstractNarration>1531682&lt;br/&gt;Puchakayala&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports one year of continued operations and maintenance of a five-receiver, continuously operating GPS network in the Andaman Islands that was established soon after the 2004 Boxing Day (December 26) mega earthquake (Mw 9.3) near Sumatra that resulted in over 200,000 casualties across the region largely resultant the tsunami that was generated.  GPS data collected from this network can be used to address a fundamental yet unresolved debate about crustal deformation following very large earthquakes, namely whether fault afterslip or viscoelastic relaxation of the crust and upper mantle are the main driving forces of observed postseismic transient deformation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boxing Day 2004 earthquake is arguably one of the three most important earthquakes available for modern geodetic study in the historical record.  Continuity of GPS observations can result in advanced knowledge of the earthquake deformation cycle and fault behavior that has tremendous potential benefit for hazards mitigation in seismogenically active areas of the world including the U.S.  Data from this GPS network have been and would continue to be made freely available through the UNAVCO GPS Data archive.  Operation of the network would involve collaboration with scientists and staff at a local academic institution (JNCASR, Bangalore).  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and may advance the national prosperity and welfare through advancing knowledge of the earthquake cycle and promoting sound earthquake hazard mitigation strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

Intriguingly, uplift and right-lateral horizontal shear deformation, observed in the Andaman data, is exactly opposite the predictions of radially-symmetric viscoelastic relaxation models. We hypothesized then that, either radially-symmetric models neglect heterogeneities in flow properties that are important to understanding the earthquake cycle, or transient slip still dominates the near-field signals years after the event. Modeling of GPS displacements suggests that the twin (M8.6 and M8.2) ruptures of 2012 intra-plate oceanic earthquakes could have possibly accelerated the ongoing slow slip, along the lower portion of the thrust fault beneath the Islands with a month long slip of 4-10 cm. Thus, the continuing postseismic deformation excited by the December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman (Mw = 9.2) co-seismic stress change and interfered by 2012 M8.6 and M8.2 twin earthquake, is the primary objective of this continued work. There is also the need for better models for the near field deformation along the Andaman Islands. Currently there are models that either explain the far field deformation or near field deformation but not both combined. Measurements will continue at five continuous and twelve campaign stations in the Andaman Islands. UNAVCO facility has loaned GPS receivers that are operating in this region. Data from these sites along with surrounding IGS sites will be processed using GAMIT/GLOBK software. &nbsp;Data collected will be archived at the UNAVCO facility and is open for all. This endeavor is in collaboration with Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research Bangalore, India. In the coming year we will initiate the processes to hand over the complete technology transfer to this institute in main land India and to locals in the Andaman Islands to maintain the network of GPS stations. This includes training of the locals and those in JNCASR in Bangalore.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/05/2017<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;P&nbsp;Puchakayala</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1531682/1531682_10405436_1483641014590_carinew--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1531682/1531682_10405436_1483641014590_carinew--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CARI Time Series"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1531682/1531682_10405436_1483641014590_carinew--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CARI Time Series"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">North, East and Vertical Time series of site CARI in Andaman Islands.
