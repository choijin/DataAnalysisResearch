<AbstractNarration>Knowing where, when, and how much rainfall falls over oceans and continents across the tropics matters directly to the people who live there and is also a key piece of information to understand the atmospheric circulation over the entire globe. This is because -as moisture is evaporated from the ocean, transported by winds, and finally rained out - energy is moved with it across a planetary heat engine that affects climate everywhere. This project aims at elucidating how tropical rainfall changes in response to changes in the way energy enters the tropical atmosphere, be they the results of the alternating of seasons, the wobble of the earth's orbit, or the man-made changes in atmospheric composition. The goal of this research is to address the essential similarities and differences in their dynamics between the oceanic rain belt and the regional monsoons; its approach is to analyze a hierarchy of simulations performed with an ensemble of computer models of the global atmosphere, to compare the climates produced in idealized model setups, and to identify those mechanisms that are robust across a range of simplifications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research effort will have major impacts in two realms: our understanding of tropical dynamics and our design of model hierarchies. Progress on both fronts is necessary if we want to better our models and improve our prediction of future climate change in the tropics and globally. The effort will support continuous and focused leadership of a community effort to spur innovative research on the dynamics of monsoons and oceanic rain belts. The design and coordination of the ensemble simulations at the base of this project will continue through the organization of sessions and informal meetings at international conferences in which participants to this Grand Challenge can exchange results and plan additional research activities. One post-doctoral scientist, one graduate student and three undergraduates will be trained by this project and benefit from the interactions with the larger community that has gathered around these themes. Knowledge gained from this project will be incorporated in lectures and outreach activities, including the Lamont Open House and adult education at the American Natural History Museum. Results will also be reported via the State of the Planet Blog of the Earth Institute of Columbia University.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The state-of-the-art global climate models (GCMs) that we use to provide climate forecasts -whether for the next season or for the next 50 years- are meant to be as realistic as possible. But, by aiming for realism, models have grown as difficult to interpret as the real world. In those instances, idealized model configurations become a necessary tool for understanding. Our research goal is understanding the way in which external forcings induce changes in the tropical rainbands, over ocean and over land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our project's main tool has been the `Tropical Rainbands with an Annual cycle and Continent Model Intercomparison Project', or TRACMIP for short. TRACMIP is an ensemble of simulations (run with 13 CMIP-class and one simplified-physics GCMs) in which the ocean is idealized to be a motionless swamp and the continents are either non-existent (in what is called an Aquaplanet configuration) or reduced to a square equatorial continent. In both the Aqua and the Land configurations, each model ran standard and quadrupled-CO2 climate simulations, plus one Land simulation with a modified orbit, which affects seasonality. By comparing pairs of simulations, we were able to describe the response of the oceanic rain band and the continental monsoon to different forcings and to highlight both aspects of the response that are common across all the TRACMIP models, and aspects that instead depend on some individual modeling choices, such as the way in which each model represents unresolved cloud processes. The relevance of these simulations to the real world can be glimpsed in Figure 1, which shows how the presence of the square continent induces colder surface temperature in the ocean to its west and a corresponding split of the equatorial rainband into two off-equatorial rainbands. The split rainband (aka ITCZ) is reminiscent of the `double ITCZ &nbsp;bias' in CMIP6 models (Figure 1), so that our TRACMIP analysis suggests an explanation for the documented &nbsp;link between continental and oceanic biases in comprehensive models.</p> <p>We have used the same set of simulations to answer several questions linked to the so-called `energetic framework of the ITCZ', i.e. the idea that the same circulation that converges moisture into the rainband also diverges energy out of the tropics, cooling the warmer hemisphere more than the colder hemisphere and thus helping to keep the tropical free atmosphere at a roughly uniform temperature. In particular, we have shown that the hypothesized correspondence is fairly appropriate to explain inter-model differences in the mean state of the TRACMIP models, but fails to explain either the seasonal march of the rainband or its response to CO2. Subsequent work has focused on understanding where the energetic framework breaks down: &nbsp;to do so, we have studied the effect of transients eddies in moving energy across the tropics, how the changes in atmospheric vertical structure caused by quadrupling of CO2 to make the mean circulation more or less efficient in moving energy relatively to moisture, and how constraints coming from the momentum budget interfere with those derived from the energy budget. Finally, we have interrogated the relationship between rainfall and surface temperature, both in the context of cross-equatorial shifts of the ITCZ and in the context of ocean-to-land shifts of the seasonal rainfall maxima.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Another line of research -still linked to rainband dynamics via the influence that inter-hemispheric temperature differences have on the position of the ITCZ- developed an explanation for the polar amplification of warming under CO2 quadrupling in TRACMIP aquaplanets. We show the ice-albedo feedback (in which warming leads to melting of ice, which darkens the surface, which leads to more light absorption and warming) &nbsp;is not necessary for amplification. Instead, anything that warms and moistens the climate also produces polar amplification, as the general circulation acts as a diffusive process on the energy field and brings the moist energy of the low latitudes to the polar regions. Even feedbacks that warm the tropics more than the high latitudes end up contributing to the polar amplification, contrary to what one would infer by considering their local effects (Figure 2). A corollary of this result is that feedbacks that contribute to model spread in global warming (e.g. cloud effects) also contribute to the spread in the polar amplification.</p> <p class="Default"><span>This project had major broader impacts on our discipline, via its impact on human resources and information infrastructure.&nbsp; Using published perspectives, dedicated summer schools, and international conferences we reinforced community interactions between theoreticians and other monsoon scientists while broadening the community to include more women and under-represented minorities and to actively welcome diverse experiences (Figure 3).
