<AbstractNarration>A matrix group is a set of invertible square matrices that contains all products and inverses of its members. Representation theory is a branch of algebra concerned with studying symmetries, especially symmetries arising from matrix groups. Modular representation theory is the branch of representation theory concerned with matrix groups whose entries come from a finite field. It has deep connections with number theory, combinatorics, and geometry. This research project aims to make advances in modular representation theory using geometric methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project aims to make advances in the representation theory of algebraic groups over a field of positive characteristic via the philosophy of local geometric Langlands duality. Specifically, the PI hopes to establish a collection of derived equivalences in positive characteristic modeled on characteristic zero results. This work will lead to explicit connections between between the following notions: (i) modular representations of algebraic groups; (ii) modular perverse sheaves and parity sheaves on the affine Grassmannian and the affine flag variety; and (iii) the phenomena of Koszul and Q-Koszul duality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A "matrix group" is a set of invertible square matrices that contains all products and inverses of its members.  Typical examples include SU(2), the group of 2x2 unitary complex matrices, and O(3,R), the group of orthogonal 3x3 matrices with real entries.  Broadly, the subject of "representation theory" deals with how such groups can act on a (complex) vector space via linear transformations.  One can then ask what happens if we replace the complex numbers by a finite field (or the algebraic closure of a finite field).  "Modular representation theory" is concerned with matrix groups with entries in such a field, acting on vector spaces over the same field.   The goal of the present proposal was to make advances in modular representation theory by geometric methods. Specifically, the PI and his collaborators have studied the geometry and topology of certain infinite-dimensional topological spaces known as "(partial) affine flag varieties." Highlights of the results obtained under this award include the proof of the "graded Finkelberg-Mirkovic conjecture" and the "Riche-Williamson conjecture". The former gives an abstract way to encode representations in terms of the topology of a particular partial affine flag variety, known as the affine Grassmannian.  The latter gives an effective computational method for describing certain (so-called "tilting") representations, again in terms of the topology of the affine flag variety.
