<AbstractNarration>Recent technological developments and the increased availability of laboratory, airborne, and satellite hyperspectral imaging (HI) data have led to a growing demand for HI related jobs which calls for greater learning, understanding, and use of HI for various applications. The REU Site - Interdisciplinary Research Experience in Hyperspectral Imaging (IDREHSI) program at the University of Northern Iowa is an 8-week summer school that introduces 10 undergraduate students each year to a highly interdisciplinary research environment with a unifying theme of fundamental and applied research in HI. Student participants will have opportunities to engage in HI based research in various STEM fields such as geographic information science, earth science, environmental science, physics, biology, computer science, and atmospheric science for different applications. Specifically, they will: (1) be exposed to existing scientific approaches and experimental methods in HI, (2) develop skills that make students competitive in academic and professional environments, (3) be involved in scientific investigations that prepares them for graduate studies and/or professional careers, (4) operate in highly interdisciplinary research settings and work across disciplinary boundaries in problem-based research, (5) improve their capability for learning independently, and (6) provide opportunities to discuss ethical issues related to collection and use of data, experimental design, and professional standards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual core and unifying theme of the IDREHSl REU program is the science of HI that deals with the acquisition, processing, analysis and interpretation of spectra represented by multiple contiguous bands in a wide range of electromagnetic radiation wavelengths. The program builds on years of HI-related research activities by the research-mentors who work in different areas of HI science and will integrate their research with education by developing REU projects that can be completed by undergraduates during an eight week program. These projects are either lab-based (involving microscopic level data spectral analysis of materials such as minerals and chemical contamination, soil cores, photovoltaics, and other electro-optical characterization) or field-based (allowing outdoor data collection including the monitoring and estimation of water quality, crop condition assessment, wetland mapping, soil and sediment mapping, invasive species mapping and modeling, urban planning, and crop yield prediction). Participants will gain professional and personal experiences that are particularly valuable for young scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
