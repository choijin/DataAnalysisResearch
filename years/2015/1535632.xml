<AbstractNarration>The project provides addtional support for the Antarctic Meteorological Research Center (AMRC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;br/&gt;The AMRC currently supports distribution of meteorological data services within the Division of Polar Programs (NSF USAP; United States Antarctic Program),and provides access by US users and interested international meterological and climatological scientists. Reflecting rapidly changing polar cyberinfrastructure needs, the project also will establish a task force, of knowlegeable users, that will provide guidance concerning the future sustainability of Antarctic meteorological and climate data sharing and cyber-infrastructure needs. This concerted effort represents the USAP's meteorological contribution to the NSF's Geosciences Directorate broader Earth Cube program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational outreach efforts also extends into the classroom. This outreach efforts aim to demonstrate the use of Antarctic meteorological datasets to spur interest in high latitude weather, and to improve student learning in STEM subject areas. Together  with formal education, the project will continue to be invovled with a broader outreach to the general public.</AbstractNarration>
