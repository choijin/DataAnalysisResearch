<AbstractNarration>Under this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms - A (CSDM-A) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Richard Mabbs of Washington University in St. Louis is studying what happens when molecules collide with electrons and temporarily capture them.  The Mabbs research group is particularly interested in how molecules vibrate and rotate during the electron capture process. The results are particularly important for a full understanding of the electron transfer/collision induced chemistry which occurs in areas as diverse as chemical reactions, catalysis, radiation damage in DNA, remediation strategies for removing volatile organic air pollutants, and ionospheric chemistry.  This project serves as a vehicle for the education and training of graduate students and undergraduate students who are directly involved in the research. Professor Mabbs integrates some of the results of the research into his formal chemistry courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metastable, excited electronic states of anions represent free electrons interacting strongly with a neutral molecule. This project probes vibronic coupling within such states using high resolution velocity mapped photoelectron imaging and tunable photoexcitation. Vibrationally resolved photodetachment spectra of small molecular anions are recorded. Excitation to individual (ro)vibrational levels of a metastable excited anion state is followed by electron loss via one of the (ro)vibrational levels of the neutral molecule. The photon energy dependence of a vibrational channel cross section represents an action spectrum for autodetachment from a (ro)vibronic state of the excited anion, revealing which vibrational levels are strongly coupled in the anion. The action spectra also yield the energies of internal states of the excited anion and therefore provide valuable benchmarks for state-of-the art calculations of highly correlated and open shell, excess electron species.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual merit</strong></p> <p>Under this award a technique to probe properties of metastable excited anion states (electronic resonances) has been designed and implemented. The results of this method allow understanding of coupling (and hence energy transfer) between modes of freedom occurring as the resonance decays via loss of the excess electron to produce a daughter neutral molecule in a particular energy state. The studies are fundamentally important for understanding processes initiated by, or requiring the transfer of an electron such as chemical reduction, ionizing radiation damage in DNA, plasma remediation strategies to remove volatile organic air pollutants, the chemistry of the ionosphere and interstellar media, and ion formation in mass spectrometry.</p> <p><strong>Significant Results</strong></p> <p>This award allowed modification of an existing anion imaging photoelectron spectrometer (Image 1, top). The improved spectral resolution allows detailed study of the vibrational structure associated with short-lived anion states (Image 1, bottom right), the effect of interaction between states (Image 1, bottom center) and the effect of vibrational coupling within states (Image 1, bottom right).&nbsp;The work examines electron loss from short lived anion resonances which subsequently produce neutral molecules with a particular energy disposal. Results are photoelectron spectra, (revealing energy disposal in the neutral molecule) and action spectroscopy (essentially 2D photoelectron spectroscopy) in which the photon energy is varied in small increments.</p> <p>Proper correlation of intermediate to final state relies on the ability to distinguish transitions in the photoelectron spectrum. Image 2 shows the key modification supported by this award to achieve this, the implementation of a coaxial imaging arrangement. Electrons produced within the imaging lens are projected onto the detector and images show a set of concentric circles corresponding to the transitions in the photoelectron spectrum. The transitions occur at energies corresponding to the difference between parent anion and daughter neutral levels. Atomic detachment (e.g. F<sup>&minus; </sup>&rarr; F + e<sup>&minus;</sup> at 4.00 eV in Image 2) reveals that the modifications yield a detector resolution of &#8710;E/E = 1 % at 0.6 eV electron kinetic energy, an order of magnitude improvement on the preexisting arrangement.</p> <p>Image 3 shows a 2D spectrum for NiO<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> detachment. The contour plot represents spectra collected at photon energies between 3.25 and 3.62 eV. Transitions are identified by their binding energies (eBE) and the intensity of each transition varies considerably as the photon energy is tuned. Action spectra for the transitions can be extracted. The example shown in Image 3(b) is for the transition resulting in a neutral NiO<sub>2</sub> molecule, which has 1 quantum of excitation in the symmetric stretching mode. The series of regularly spaced peaks correspond to excitation of the regularly spaced energy levels of an intermediate resonance. Hence the periodic structure is probing the internal levels of the resonance state.</p> <p>A mediating resonance can allow forbidden transitions to appear in the photoelectron spectrum. Image 4(a) shows only allowed transitions (to CuF<sub>2</sub> symmetric stretching levels) in the 4.005 eV excitation of CuF<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>. At 3.546 eV (Image 4(b)), formally forbidden transitions associated with changes in bending motion become evident and allow measurement of the bending frequency. The action spectra (branching ratios) for the 2<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup> and 2<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> transitions (1 or 2 quanta of energy in the neutral?s bending mode) show structure. The irregularity represents a direct probe of the complex interaction between the two excited anion states promoted by motion along the bending coordinate.</p> <p>The improved detector resolution distinguishes between different vibrational transitions in the photoelectron spectrum. Image 5 shows rotational resolution in an action spectrum for CH<sub>2</sub>CN<sup>&minus;</sup> detachment for energies between 13650 and 13900 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>. This action spectrum is for a forbidden transition mediated by the action of a dipole bound state of CH<sub>2</sub>CN<sup>&minus;</sup>. The energy is scanned through the dipole bound anion and the resolution is determined by that of the excitation laser. Analysis shows that the observed structure is due to the rotational manifolds of two vibrations. More importantly, because the vibrational structure in the final photoelectron spectrum is also resolved, the results show that energy is transferred from one dipole bound mode to another during the process of electron loss and clearly demonstrates that these two modes are coupled.</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts</strong></p> <p>The data represent vital benchmarks for testing high-level electronic structure methods treating excited electronic states. Furthermore, the method developed is broadly applicable to anion photodetachment studies. In the course of this award the work has generated significant opportunities for the training of graduate students (3), the next generation of researchers and teachers. Undergraduate (4) and high school students (3) have also been given the opportunity to be involved with cutting edge research. Their involvement provides further opportunities for graduate students to learn mentoring and project management skill. Equally important is the opportunity to enthuse highly talented individuals for careers in STEM and in particular fundamental chemistry research.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/16/2020<br>      Modified by: Richard&nbsp;Mabbs</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1566157/1566157_10455297_1602858797466_summary--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1566157/1566157_10455297_1602858797466_summary--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Summary"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1566157/1566157_10455297_1602858797466_summary--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Summary"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Experiments using the modifications to exisiting instrumentation (top) have allowed probing of the structure of electronic resonances of anions (e.g. bottom left), mixing of excited anion electronic states (e.g. bottom center) and vibrational coupling in such states (bottom right)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Richard Mabbs</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Richard&nbsp;Mabbs</div> <div class="imageTitle">Summary</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1566157/1566157_10455297_1602792058526_fi1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1566157/1566157_10455297_1602792058526_fi1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Inline Imaging Arrangement"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1566157/1566157_10455297_1602792058526_fi1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Inline Imaging Arrangement"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ions enter the lens from the left, interact with photons and the resulting electrons are projected on the MCP.
