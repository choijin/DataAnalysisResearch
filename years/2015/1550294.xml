<AbstractNarration>This project will provide a demonstration of the capability to provide wide-area marine mammal (MM) monitoring, localization and species classification in near real time using the passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS) system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS) system will combine the Lightweight Thinline Acoustic Receiver (LTAR) array system, funded with OCE MRI funding, and an integrated processing and analysis software package that provides detection, localization, tracking, feature extraction and species classification of MMs charted onto a geographic map of the region in near real time. This system has the potential to be a useful operational MM monitoring system used during field experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The passive ocean acoustics waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS)<br />technology uses a large-aperture densely-sampled array of hydrophones<br />to provide continuous monitoring of marine mammals over instantaneous<br />wide areas from their measured vocalizations. POAWRS monitoring<br />includes simultaneous detection, bearing-time estimation, species<br />classification, and localization of marine mammals vocalizations over<br />continental-shelf scale regions. POAWRS technology presents<br />significant advancement over current marine mammal sensing techniques<br />based on single hydrophone, sparse arrays and visual surveys.<br /><br />(A) In this project, we developed and sea-tested a prototype 8-element<br />towable coherent hydrophone array hardware with real-time data<br />acquisition and 100 m tow cable in house at Northeastern University.<br />Each element consists of a piezoelectric ceramic transducer wired to a<br />preamplifier and connected to the tow cable. The tow cable contains 12<br />twisted pairs of wires providing power and ground to all<br />preamplifiers, and carrying output voltage signals of each of the 8<br />preamplifiers to a 32-channel analog-to-digital convertor (ADC)<br />hardware. The ADC is connected to a notebook computer for real-time<br />access and monitoring of the acoustic signals measured by each of the<br />8 hydrophone elements of the prototype array. We have written software<br />to convert the voltage signals to acoustic pressure signals by<br />correcting for hydrophone sensitivity, gain of the preamplifier and<br />the ADC conversion factor. The time-domain received signals and their<br />frequency-time spectrograms are plotted for each hydrophone and<br />updated periodically based on the data acquisition length. Each<br />hydrophone element is waterproofed using either poly-urethane or<br />silicon rubber. The shape of each element was designed to minimize<br />flow noise on the hydrophone array. Each element was tested in air<br />before and after waterproofing to ensure the element was acoustically<br />functional.&nbsp; The prototype array has been tested underwater at the<br />Northeastern University swimming pool facility. The prototype<br />hydrophone array recorded a variety of sounds including tonal and<br />chirp pulses projected using an underwater loudspeaker from Lubell<br />Labs, as well as broadband clicks generated by clanging two wrenches<br />underwater.&nbsp; The prototype array also recorded Led Zeppelin's<br />&ldquo;Stairway to heaven&rdquo; song that we projected underwater using the<br />Lubell Labs source.&nbsp; The prototype array was tested at sea on a<br />recreational fishing vessel off the Boston harbor in about 30 m water<br />depth. The array was first deployed vertically with the ship's engines<br />shut off and we recorded broadband clicks and sea-surface reflections<br />by clanging 4 weights together underwater with a pole. The array was<br />then towed horizontally at roughly mid-water column at various tow<br />speeds around 3 to 4 knots and we recorded mostly ship sounds in the<br />busy Boston harbor.<br /><br />(B) Under this project we significantly automated the POAWRS analysis<br />and processing software for real-time marine mammal sensing and<br />extending POAWRS for monitoring a large variety of other oceanic sound<br />sources.&nbsp; The stages in POAWRS processing include (1) filtering of<br />hydrophone recorded pressure-time series data (sampled in the 8 kHz to<br />50 kHz range) in several frequency sub-bands of interest, (2)<br />beamforming of data from full or sub-apertures of the array spanning<br />360 degree azimuths about the receiver array to identify bearings<br />(horizontal azimuths) with potential strong sound sources, (3)<br />detection of sound sources via beamformed spectrogram analysis,<br />thresholding and clustering, (4) high-resolution beamforming to<br />determine bearing and time of detected sources more accurately, (5)<br />feature extraction via pitch tracking where features such as mean,<br />maximum and minimum frequency, duration, frequency-time slope (in Hz<br />per second), and 2nd and higher order curvature via polynomial curve<br />fitting for each sound source is determined, (6) detected signal<br />clustering incorporating methods in machine learning such as<br />centroid-based k-means and Bayesian distribution-based Gaussian<br />mixture models, (7) bearing-time association of signals within and<br />between clusters, (8) source bearing ambiguity resolution by<br />temporally correlating bearing-time sequences of classified and<br />associated signals with the array heading employing Kalman-filter and<br />Hough transform based bearing-time tracking approaches, (9)<br />localization of a sequence of associated sounds from their<br />bearing-time trajectories using a variety of techniques including the<br />moving array triangulation, the waveguide-based array invariant, and<br />the Kalman-filter based bearings-only tracking in modified polar<br />coordinates, (10) geographic positioning of localized sound sources in<br />latitude and longitude including bathymetric overlays and localization<br />mean and standard deviation ellipse, and (11) update of extracted<br />features and classification results into a database using a feedback<br />loop within the processing and analysis stages.&nbsp; Currently many stages<br />of the POAWRS software have been connected and the rest will be<br />incorporated in the future. The automatic POAWRS software has been<br />tested and verified by application to coherent hydrophone array data<br />from two major oceanographic experiments: the Nordic Seas 2014<br />Experiment and the US Gulf of Maine 2006 Experiment. The results from<br />POAWRS analysis of marine mammal vocalizations from diverse species<br />and ship radiated noise have been published in four journal articles.<br />Our work has also been featured in various national and international<br />news media.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Purnima&nbsp;R&nbsp;Makris</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550294/1550294_10377077_1512057867773_prototype_array--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550294/1550294_10377077_1512057867773_prototype_array--rgov-800width.jpg" title="prototype 8-element coherent hydrophone array"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550294/1550294_10377077_1512057867773_prototype_array--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="prototype 8-element coherent hydrophone array"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The prototype 8-element coherent hydrophone array was developed at Northeastern University and sea tested at the Boston harbor.
