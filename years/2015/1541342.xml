<AbstractNarration>Malone University is redesigning its cyberinfrastructure support of scientific research, building a framework that can be utilized by similarly-sized institutions. Malone is improving support of research through: ongoing collaborative planning with campus researchers, information technology personnel, and external partners; implementing an advanced network with application-level network visibility to optimize researcher√≠s connections to resources and better troubleshoot when issues arise; improving its connections to peer institutions by configuring a Science DMZ, Internet2, and InCommon; and by creating a pool of student-driven programming and technical resources for the explicit purpose of supporting campus researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malone is systematically documenting and sharing this process; building a collaboration framework that can be referenced and leveraged by other small institutions who seek to support their own campus researchers. Expertise of statewide ISP OARnet will be leveraged in all aspects of the project but especially in the areas of the ScienceDMZ, Federated Identity (InCommon), and Internet2.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Malone University's Supporting Researchers Using Technology grant successfully improved technology support for research on its campus for the foreseeable future. The summary of the project is divided into the following three sections:   Research projects and people directly supported during the execution of the project Technology and infrastructure upgrades supporting current and future research Models of support developed for current and future research    Research projects and people directly supported during the execution of the project During the three year project, six faculty members and seven undergraduate students worked on seven research projects which produced eleven [and counting] presentations at scientific meetings and publications in national research journals.  These efforts were supported by the four PI/co-PIs of this grant. Examples of specific projects supported included: developing an automated web crawler to assemble an extensive database of online posts from stakeholders in the management of chronic health conditions, assembling two extensive, searchable databases to track incidence reports of West Nile Virus transmission in relation to spatial, demographic, and climate variables, and to efficiently search millions of eBird records, developing techniques to efficiently review and code international differences in emotional expressivity, and utilizing low-cost, microcomputers to remotely collect and transmit observational data about birds and associated weather data to centralized databases.   Technology and infrastructure upgrades supporting current and future research Improvements were made to the following general infrastructure and research support systems:   Dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 will allow for future compatibility of campus systems to the larger Internet and research communities.   Software Defined Networking [SDN] integrated at the individual log-on level allows for researchers to have special-access to intra and inter-campus resources to support their research and teaching endeavors.   InCommon shared authentication infrastructure is now integrated with campus single sign on so that researchers and students have wider access to resources outside of Malone's campus.   Implementation of EDUROAM intercampus wifi roaming has allowed for more seamless access to Malone students, faculty, and staff when traveling to other campus as well as when collaborators from EDUROAM peers come to Malone's campus.   Specific network switching upgrades and modifications to data cabling to support it were completed in the main science building on campus allowing for faster communication to and from that building.   Connection to Internet2 [I2] was seamlessly configured such that data transfers between I2 peers are not affected by commodity Internet traffic.    Virtualized data transfer nodes [DTNs] can be spun up and utilized when the need arises for large data sets to be transferred onto campus.   Models of support developed for current and future research Through a collaborative process between project PIs and campus researchers, we have developed the following model of support for future research projects:   Specific models for storage and campus computing resources have been developed such that when a grant request is made, those costs can be reasonably accounted for during the planning process.   Definition of a process whereby undergraduate student[s] can be sourced to provide  technological support for research with proper oversight from campus IT professionals. The benefit is twofold in that the campus researcher will be able to offload data-wrangling and other IT-related costs (time/attention/monetary) to the undergraduate student while simultaneously said undergraduate gains valuable experience in research.  A third, previously unrealized benefit, is that campus IT staff maintain a better understanding of the research that is happening on campus and can account for and support that research as changes are made to campus infrastructure.
