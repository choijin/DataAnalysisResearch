<AbstractNarration>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a powerful approach for mapping the regions of the genome containing single-nucleotide differences in the population (single-nucleotide variants or SNVs) that are associated with trait variation. Narrowing down from GWAS-identified genomic regions to the individual SNVs that are responsible for trait variation is particularly challenging for regions of the genome that are in-between genes.  A second challenge in GWAS is that the large number of SNVs necessitates a high level of statistical stringency, and thus, many biologically relevant SNVs are missed.  GWAS is used for many human disease traits (such as coronary artery disease or CAD), and thus, addressing these two challenges would have broad significance in biology and biomedical research.  This award supports initiation of a collaborative research project that will address these two challenges by developing mathematical models that integrate a variety of types of measurements and information derived from cells and population studies, in order to pinpoint SNVs in-between genes that affect trait variation, and to improve the statistical power of GWAS.  CAD is a high-significance application for improving GWAS because of CAD's prevalence (15 million in the U.S.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to (1) create and evaluate an integrative statistical model for improving power for GWAS analysis and for discovering novel gene-trait associations and (2) create and evaluate a machine-learning model for identifying regulatory variants within intergenic GWAS regions.  The models would incorporate features from large-scale datasets from the Framingham Heart Study SHARe database, the ENCODE project, the GTEx project, and CARDIOGRAMplusC4D. The models' performance would be benchmarked against previously published models.  The project's significant outcomes would be: (1) the first analytic statistical model for integrative GWAS analysis that would provide a readily interpretable significance score; (2) a quantitatively validated and interpretable machine-learning model for combining genomic information types to predict regulatory variants; (3) feature importance scores for the genomic features that are integrated within the model; and (4) identification of new GWAS loci for population variation in CAD risk, and, for regulatory variants within the loci, the genes and transcription factors (and ultimately, the gene functional annotations) with which they are associated.  Software implementations of the methods will be shared in an open-source software repository.  This award is supported by the National Institutes of Health Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative in partnership with the National Science Foundation Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Approximately 25-50% of an individual's lifetime risk of developing  coronary artery disease (CAD) is thought to be inherited, but this  heritability is thought to comprise many genes that contribute  positively or negatively to the risk in small amounts (but whose overall  combined effect on relative risk can be substantial). The current  standard method for mapping the nucleotides in the genome whose  variation in the population underlies variation in risk of CAD is the  genome-wide association study (GWAS), a large-scale statistical analysis  of individuals' genetic profiles and their trait manifestations (e.g.,  the presence or absence of CAD). As with other disease traits with  complex genetics, GWAS for CAD has revealed scores of locations (or  "loci") in the genome that harbor genetic variants that influence  disease risk ("causal variants"), but in most such locations it is not  known which variants (out of the potentially hundreds of common variants  within such a locus) are causal. Identifying candidate causal variants  that within a GWAS locus but outside of any gene (i.e., candidate causal  noncoding variants) is significantly more difficult than for variants  within the protein-coding portion of a gene. Thus, it is necessary to  combine many different types of biological information and many  different types of genome-wide biological measurements within  statistical or mathematical models in order to identify these candidate  causal variants. In this project, we developed two such models that in  parallel (as well as in combination) are designed to improve our ability  to identify noncoding variants that are likely to have a molecular  function. First, we designed and validated an improved statistical model  for detecting noncoding variants that are associated with population  changes in the levels of expression of genes (which is a key mechanism  through which noncoding variants exert effects on traits). We  demonstrated through applying this model to analyze genetic loci that  had been mapped in different GWAS studies, that the model has improved  sensitivity for detecting noncoding variants that are associated with  population variation in gene expression.
