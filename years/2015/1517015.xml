<AbstractNarration>Brown dwarfs are objects that sit at the boundary between stars and planets.  Although they form like stars, they do not have hydrogen fusion, so they cool over billions of years down to temperatures similar to those of planets.  By studying the the infrared heat radiation given off by brown dwarfs, we can understand the physics and chemistry and their atmospheres.  This project involves the work of graduate students and high school students, who will receive training in advanced computational techniques, which will allow them to create computer models of brown dwarf atmospheres.  These results will be compared to observations made from large telescopes in order to determine the physical properties within brown dwarf atmospheres. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal team will carry out a significant expansion of the phase space of brown dwarf model atmospheres.  They will investigate the role of metallicity, non-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratios, varied cloud thickness, cloud coverage fraction, surface gravity, and other factors in shaping brown dwarf spectra. This extensive grid of radiative-convective "forward models" will map out the phase space of brown dwarf atmospheric chemistry and physics.  For the first time we will gain a quantitative understanding of the reasons behind mismatches between spectral observations and models.  The bulk of the science will be performed by a graduate student, in concert with high school interns who will be mentored each summer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Brown dwarfs are common objects in our galaxy, that are in between stars and Jupiter-like planets.  Brown dwarfs form along-side stars, in large clusters, but then since they are not massive enough to sustain fusion in their interiors, they cool off over time.  After billions of years they reach cool planet-like temperatures.  Since brown dwarfs today are at a range of ages, we can study them at a range of different temperatures, from 3000 F down to 100 F.  We can see brown dwarfs by the thermal infrared light that they emit.  We can take a spectrum of this infrared light and see absorption due to molecules of water, methane, and ammonia.  What we did with our NSF award was to create new computer modeling tools to, for the first time, actually measure the amount of these molecules in brown dwarf atmospheres.  We did this for a wide range of the coldest brown dwarfs, those under 1000 K, and we saw new trends that tells us abot their atmospheric chemistry.  At the same time we did extensive studies of a newly found brown dwarf, which has cooled off to the point that it is colder than the Earth!  This object is so cold that even though it is relatively close to Sun (almost as close as the nearest normal stars), it gives off almost no visible light, just far infrared thermal light.  This makes is difficult to see!  For the first time, in this object's atmosphere, we found definitive evidence for water clouds in an object outside of the solar system.    The computer simulation tools that we developed will soon be used to study the atmospheres of planets around other stars.  We can compare and contrast planets with brown dwarfs, as they form in a different way.  In addition to the NSF supporting two graduate sudents, four undergraduate students in the University of California, Santa Cruz contributed to this project.  They did their senior thesis work assisting in running the computer models, and they will all be co-authors on an upcoming paper.
