<AbstractNarration>This project aims to derive fundamental results in the field of network design.  In network design, one wishes to derive a network which simultaneously has low cost and desirable properties such as high connectivity for fault tolerance.  The goal of this project is to find improved approximation algorithms - which find a network with cost and quality provably near the best possible for a given problem instance - or to prove new inapproximability results.  Problems in this area have a large practical significance in many areas including transportation planning, road planning, and power grids.  The project will provide undergraduate research opportunities.  The PI plans to test some of the algorithms developed in practical settings with the assistance of students from the recently launched Computer Science Undergraduate Research Academy at Rutgers-Camden.&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus in particular on approximability of NP-hard network design problems including some of the most significant connectivity problems: Directed Steiner Tree, Directed Steiner Forest, Group Steiner Tree, Multicommodity Buy-at-Bulk, Minimum Poise Tree, Tree Augmentation, Directed Rooted 2-Survivable Network, and the Minimum-cost Vertex k-Connected Sub-graph problem.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Papers published in conferences and journals. In the paper "Improved approximation algorithms for minimum power covering problems" we minimized the total cost of consumption of batteries. We used the new and seminal iterative randomized rounding and we even generalized this method. In the paper "Approximating Activation Edge-Cover and Facility Location Problems" What approximation ratio can we achieve for the Facility Location problem if whenever a client u connects to a facility v, the opening cost of v is at most theta times the service cost of u? We show that this and many other problems are a particular case of the Activation Edge-Cover problem. In the paper "Bounded Degree Group Steiner Tree Problems" we study two problems that seek a subtree T of a graph G=(V,E) such that T satisfies a certain property and has minimal maximum degree.  - In the Min-Degree Group Steiner Tree problem we are given a collection S of groups (subsets of V) and T should contain a node from every group.  - In the Min-Degree Steiner k-Tree problem we are given a set R of terminals and an integer k, and T should contain at least k terminals.  We show that if the former problem admits approximation ratio &rho; then the later problem admits approximation ratio &rho;&sdot;O(logk). For bounded treewidth graphs, we obtain approximation ratio O(log3n) for Min-Degree Group Steiner Tree. In the paper "Bounded Degree Group Steiner Tree Problems"  motivated by some open problems, we study three problems that seek a low degree subtree T of a graph G=(V,E). In the Min-Degree Group Steiner Tree problem we are given a collection of node subsets (groups), and T should contain a node from every group. In the Min-Degree Steiner k-Tree problem we are given a set R of terminals and an integer k, and T should contain k terminals. In both problems the goal is to minimize the maximum degree of T.
