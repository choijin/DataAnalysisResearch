<AbstractNarration>By undertaking this investigation of equatorial inertial instability the understanding of the role that the instability plays in the destabilization and equilibration of ocean currents in equatorial regions will be significantly improved. New theories will be developed to help in improving our understanding of inertial instability in the near-equatorial regions. Results obtained through this research can have an important impact on the future development of ocean models. Small-scale, near-equatorial instabilities are not resolved in ocean models, but their role in developing and maintaining large-scale currents is very important. By studying these instabilities, their effects can be predicted and, hence, be parameterized in ocean models. Improvement in ocean modeling can have important impact on climate research because of the essential role that the equatorial ocean plays in controlling the climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive study of symmetric instability of parallel shear flows for the equatorial beta-plane will be conducted by incorporating the full Coriolis force. Results will be contrasted with the commonly used traditional beta-plane approximation. The potentially extremely rapid downward mixing resulting from the instability with the 'true' Coriolis force suggests that the traditional approximation is a very poor one. Under terrestrian circumstances the horizontal scales are disturbingly small and therefore never resolved in global ocean circulation models. The correct redistribution of momentum, downward buoyancy flux and energy dissipation are thus not accurately accounted for. The proposed research will help in determining the correct parameterizations of these processes.</AbstractNarration>
