<AbstractNarration>Genetic data can provide a window in the factors that structure and drive divergence among populations. In this study, we will use such data to reveal how current and past landscapes features determine population structure. Such inferences, however, are challenging without methodologies to predict the genetic signature under such conditions. The proposed work will be a step towards addressing this knowledge gap with an application to a freshwater fish biodiversity hotspot, the Atlantic Coastal Rainforest of Brazil. The proposed work will provide critical knowledge about freshwater fishes in this particular ecosystem, as well as be broadly applicable to riverine environments in other world regions. The project provide insights into the properties of rivers that make them critical to conservation efforts because of their impact in population persistence and movement patterns of organisms living in the rivers. The PIs will also collaborate with Brazilian students on this project, promoting international scientific engagement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use computer simulations to generate expected patterns of genetic variation so the impact of specific river properties (e.g., the length of river segments, the number of connecting tributaries, and the flow regime) on movement patterns of an endemic tetra can be discerned. Such a mechanistic understanding will be instrumental to interpreting past studies that have documented differences in genetic variation between different regions. The tests developed here will allow re-evaluation of those prior studies to determine what processes structuring biodiversity might differ among regions. As such, the work will provide a general tool that can advance our understanding of the processes generating biodiversity patterns.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The proposed research aimed to understand the specific properties of rivers that influence the genetic variation of aquatic organisms by applying a modeling approach that captures the mechanisms underlying the observed patterns. Specifically, the project tested how genetic variation in freshwater fishes is affected by three riverine properties: river shape (i.e., degree of branching), river length, and flow regime, by statistically assessing the probability of candidate models as well as quantifying the contribution of specific river properties to population genetic structure for a species of tetra that inhabit isolated river basins along the Brazilian Atlantic coast. In addition, we assessed how species with different ecologies and vagilities interact with these riverine properties to promote different levels of genetic diversity among species. Overall, we were able to demonstrate the importance how riverine properties differ in the structuring of genetic variation, and therefore, how interpretion of genetic diveristy patterns needs to consider that the river properties themselves may lead to differences among regions and or taxa in genetic diversity. As such, the results highlight that certain river basins and portions of rivers are expected to have higher genetic diversity than others. This has a direct effect to compare diversity between different rivers and select aquatic areas that are appropriate for conservation. In addition, during the development of this project one PhD successfully defended her PhD, three scientific papers were published, and 3 others are in review and/or preparation, specimens were contributed to museum collections, numerous sceintific presentations were delivered, and graduate students from USA and Brazil were trained in genomics, bioinformatics, and analytical techniques.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/30/2018<br>      Modified by: L.
