<AbstractNarration>IRES Water Quality and Household Energy in Post-Earthquake Nepal: Long Term Protection of Community Health&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IRES award brings together a diverse community of researchers and students from the United States and Nepal. In addition to working directly with local and international scientists, U.S. students will communicate to other undergraduate and graduate students through blogging about international research experience. Participants will also develop education materials, with help from local collaborators, to help inform community members in host countries. Upon return to their home institution, students will present their results through professional seminars and scientific publications. The students trained by this proposed program will be the future leaders of an elite international development workforce diminishing the impact of infectious disease on human health by nurturing the interaction of persons of different disciplines and skill sets to meet water, sanitation, and household energy needs worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S. - Nepal international research experience for students (IRES) project supports partnership between researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), the Environment and Public Health Organization, Nepal (ENPHO), the Center for Rural Technology Nepal (CRT-N), the Institute of Engineering, Nepal (IOE) and the Nepal Department of Health Services. Over a three-year period, this program will engage three U.S. undergraduate and three U.S. graduate students annually, for a total of eighteen participants, at multiple research sites in Nepal to study the aftermath of natural disaster like earthquake on microbial water quality compounded with sanitation practices. Following training and research preparation at UIUC, students will travel to Nepal, where they will be co-mentored by professors and researchers from the partner institutes. Each student's research training will include experience with planning and implementation of field strategies for drinking water sampling in the affected areas; interviewing local people to understand the sanitation practices and the sustainability of relief efforts; and data collection on waterborne illnesses. Following each portion of fieldwork and sample processing in Kathmandu, participants return to UIUC to prepare collected samples for metagenomics, 16S and 18S sequencing, qPCR and bioinformatics analysis. These will be studied to identify opportunistic pathogens in collected water sample, and patterns of presence with different sanitation practices. Results will provide new insights on the risks of outbreak of diarrheal diseases after extreme natural events in developing world, and how human practices may increase or decrease these risks.</AbstractNarration>

Over the three years period, this program exposed multiple undergraduate students at UIUC to six international research experience trips to Nepal. The goal of the project was to (a) investigate how human behavior and cultural norms influence the sustainability of the relief efforts implemented by the Nepali project partners after the earthquake; (b) evaluate the impact of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) intervention on the pathogen load; (c) assess the public health risks from poor water quality and (d) investigate availability and affordability of fuels cause or co-vary with the factors affecting human’s cooking practices for WaSH purposes.  In a series of field trips made in a group of graduate and undergraduate students, we collected water and sanitation samples from several households. Collected water and sanitation samples were shipped to Tohoku University in Japan, where a graduate student conducted high throughput qPCR to detect and quantify a large range of bacterial pathogens. In addition, selected samples were subject to amplicon-based 16S rRNA sequencing to identify the associated bacterial community. Furthermore, fuel measurements and surveys were also conducted during the field visit to the households in Nepal.     Significant Results:  1)      Disaster-displaced residents in temporary shelters face higher health risks compared to residents living in permanent households in recovered communities. The research also highlighted the need to support the expedited recovery and reconstruction of individual households through proper dissemination of technical and financial aid information.  2)      Impact of WaSH intervention in pathogen reduction was not observed across all transmission pathways, and genes studied, but significant reductions were seen for specific pathogens for specific transmission pathways highlighting the need for further studies on pathogen-specific exposure risk assessment.  3)      The disease burden from poor water quality was seen highest in the low-land Terai region of Nepal, which indicated the need for more immediate and severe intervention. All pathways for water had a higher disease burden than WHO recommendations and water stored in households suggesting a sanitation and hygiene intervention need in the villages.  4)      Data regarding sanitation behavior and household energy regarding water use were also collected for a comprehensive understanding of water-energy context before, during, and after WASH intervention in earthquake-damaged communities.     UIUC - Tohoku University collaboration  In 2017, UIUC graduate student Sital Uprety spent 5 months under the NSF-GROW fellowship. All water and sanitation samples collected in 2017 in Nepal were analyzed during this period in Japan using high throughput microfluidic quantitative polymerase chain reaction (mfqPCR). A large range of bacterial pathogens, mainly responsible for causing diarrheal diseases in the Indian subcontinent region, were selected and were detected and quantified in water and sanitation samples. Recognizing the value of identifying multiple pathogens for the study, Sital spent several months in 2018 and 2019 in the same laboratory in Japan analyzing all samples collected in Nepal. A collaborative manuscript by the UIUC and Tohoku teams has been published, and two manuscripts are under revision/review.     Collaboration with the Environmental and Public Health Organization (ENPHO)  ENPHO, a local non-governmental organization (NGO), in Kathmandu, Nepal, was the in-country support the UIUC team received during each field trip. The organization was involved from the beginning to select the community and random households for water, sanitation, and energy studies. They also assisted the UIUC team by providing with local staff and translators whenever necessary. Besides, lab space and lab resources at ENPHO were used extensively in the past three years for the research. A collaborative manuscript by the UIUC and ENPHO teams has been published, and two manuscripts are under revision/review.     Key outcomes  To date, the project produced three journal publications, five podium presentations at international conferences, four invited seminars at other Universities. A group of students co-advised by PIs was afforded a range of learning opportunities in the environment that combined academic studies, laboratory research in tandem with the industrial sector, and international collaboration. Based on the work supported by this award, 2 Ph.D. students defended their theses; several undergraduate students conducted honor theses.     Broader impacts  This project has contributed to the knowledge base on water quality and household energy in and after extreme natural events. The practical purpose of this research is in informing the decision-making process requisite for effective WaSH interventions in emergency settings to reduce the risks of diarrheal diseases.
