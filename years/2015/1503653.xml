<AbstractNarration>Understanding the loss of ice from glaciers and ice sheets, and the resulting sea-level rise, is of critical importance. Both the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, as well as mountain glaciers, discharge primarily though rivers of ice; understanding what controls the type of flow that occurs in these rivers of ice is therefore central to understanding and predicting sea-level rise. Among the least-understood factors that are thought to be important in affecting ice flow is internal strength of the ice near the sides of a flowing glacier. This viscous strength, in turn, may be affected by the micro-scale structure of the ice crystals in the glacier. The investigators propose to examine these relationships in detail on Jarvis Glacier, in the eastern Alaska Range, with the ultimate goal of being able to represent the effects of microstructure in numerical models of glacial flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this, the investigators will first use surface velocity measurements, knowledge of the glacier geometry derived from ground penetrating radar, and numerical modeling to identify a site for drilling. They will then collect surface-to-bed cores across lateral and vertical flow gradients. Velocity and temperature measurements derived from the boreholes will complement the surface measurements and allow the investigators to produce a more sophisticated three-dimensional numerical model to test the sensitivity of flow patterns to the mechanical structure within the study area. They will compare the microstructure (e.g., grain size distribution, crystallographic fabric) in the ice cores to the in-situ and modeled velocities and temperatures. Although experiments suggest that variations in the intensity and orientation of the crystallographic fabric can result in up to a ten-fold difference in flow strength, there are very few in-situ observational studies of the microstructural architecture of streaming ice; most studies of ice microstructure come from ice divides, where flow rates are slowest. At the end of this project, the investigators aim to have determined (1) the degree to which fabrics formed in the study area are predictable based on ice kinematics, and (2) the relationship among measured crystallographic orientation fabric intensity, grain size, temperature, and ice viscosity as calculated through numerical models. A correlation between fabric and viscous strength would suggest that remote sensing techniques such as radar and seismic anisotropy could become an even more powerful method for identifying the rheological structure of ice. Alternatively, the lack of a strong link between viscous strength and fabric indicates that other factors exert significant control on the rheological properties. Therefore, the results of the proposed project, whatever the correlation between microstructure and viscous strength, should improve quantitative understanding of the physical laws governing streaming ice and improve future predictions of ice mass balance. The project would support and involve both graduate and undergraduate students. The project's numerical models will be developed into a publicly available web-based graphical user interface for use by other researchers and in the classroom.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes- Dartmouth Component:  This award was for study of ice microstructure under lateral shear conditions in a natural setting.  As such we identified Jarvis Glacier, Alaska, as a glacier with the appropriate combination of logistical tractability, appropriate geometry, and bed characteristics (wet, sliding bed).  We spent multiple field seasons measuring the geometry and motion of Jarvis, with the goal of extracting core samples from which we could measure ice microstructure, in particular preferred-orientation fabric.    Dartmouth's key task in support of this project was to design,  construct and deploy 3 arrays of borehole tilt sensors, which would be used to determine borheole deformation subsequent to drilling and thus shear strain.  We generated an independent, novel tilt sensor, based on arduino microcontrollers and inexpensive micro electromechanical system (MEMS) accelerometers and magnetometers.  We constructed 35 of these sensors, and the associated programming and dataloggers at the surface to log data from the sensors hourly over the course of a year.  Our design is in the process of publication as an open-hardware and open-software design, the details of which have already been posted on github.  A manuscript describing the sensor design is in preparation and is expected to be submitted to the Journal of Glaciology in spring 2019.    The data collected by our tilt sensors can be interpreted in terms of shear strain, and the ice rheology can be estimated, based on a knowledge of the stresses imposed on the ice (downhill flow due to gravity).  Our data show that a nonlinear viscous (Glen-type) rheology captures the flow well, with a stress exponent that varies according to flow regime.  Near the center of the glacier, the flow exponent that best matches observations is 3.  Closer to the margin, under lateral shearing, the best matching exponent increases to 3.5.    This project has enhanced infrastructure for research and education in the form of a new, open-source sensor design, which any university or individual can take, use, modify, and share.  In fact, colleagues from other universities have already contacted us to learn more about our sensor design.    This project has also enhanced human resources for the sciences, by training a MS student in the ways of glaciology and the technical aspects of electronics design and fabrication.  The MS student has stayed in the academic track, and will soon begin a PhD at a new institution.        Last Modified: 03/05/2019       Submitted by: Robert L Hawley]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
