<AbstractNarration>1566060 &lt;br/&gt;Guldberg, Robert E. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF has made an award to support travel costs and registration fees for 6 workshop speakers and registration fees for 24 trainees and 5 young faculty members who will attend the three-day Regenerative Medicine Workshop at Hilton Head being held March 16-19, 2016, on Hilton Head Island, SC.  The workshop, part of a series that began in 1996, brings together national and international regenerative medicine experts from a variety of engineering and scientific disciplines in a small conference setting to effectively convey knowledge, stimulate new ideas critical to advancing the development of regenerative medicine applications and therapies and promote research collaborations.  This year's workshop will focus on the theme of regenerative medicine discoveries, technologies and translation.  Conference session topics include:  Translation of cellular therapies, Immunoengineering, Controlling stem cell fate, Regeneration of cardiovascular tissues, Synthetic biomaterials, Arthritis and tissue regeneration and Tissue engineering and personalized medicine.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 20th Annual Regenerative Medicine Workshop at Hilton Head was held on March 16-19, 2016 at the Harbour Town Inn and Conference Center in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. The Hilton Head Workshop is an annual three day workshop series that has been organized and led by regenerative medicine leaders from Georgia Tech?s Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience since 1997. The goal of the workshop is to share new research discoveries with the regenerative medicine community, to foster research collaborations, and to promote academic-industry partnerships specific to the development of new biomedical technologies. The number of workshop attendees is intentionally kept small to facilitate interaction with attendance typically around 160 participants.  Registered workshop participants for this year?s workshop totaled 155 comprised of academic professionals (40%), pre-doctoral and postdoctoral trainees (45%), industry representatives (10%), and clinicians (1%). Additionally, twenty international registrants participated in the workshop.  It should be noted that the percentage of trainees attending the 2016 workshop compared to the 2015 workshop increased from 38% to 45%.  This year?s conference theme was "Discovery, Technologies and Translation." The conference-organizing partners were the Georgia Tech-Emory Regenerative Engineering and Medicine Center, Mayo Clinic, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Pittsburgh/McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine.   The workshop format was a single plenary session that promoted interaction among a diverse body of participants.  Session topics included: immunoengineering; gene therapy; biomaterials for orthopedic applications; biomimetic materials; synthetic biomaterials; stem cell morphogens; and controlling stem cell fate.  There were a total of 39 lectures, 67 posters, and a panel discussion focused on "Translational Challenges and Opportunities: Experience from the Front Line."  The program keynote lecturers included: Buddy Ratner, University of Washington; Abhay Pandit, National University of Ireland, Galway; Christopher Evans, Mayo Clinic; Beth Pruitt, Stanford University; Brenda Ogle, University of Minnesota; Karen Christman, University of California, San Diego; Harold Ott, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School; Randolph Ashton, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Joaquim Cabral, Instituto Superior Tecnico, Portugal; Linda Griffith, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees had the opportunity to participate in podium talks, poster sessions, and the highly popular "rapid-fire" talks that allow for a brief five-minute presentation followed by facilitated discussion. In addition, trainees had the opportunity to connect with national and international regenerative medicine leaders throughout the workshop, and for the first time at the workshop, two special plenary talks served to highlight the research of one young faculty member and one postdoctoral fellow.
