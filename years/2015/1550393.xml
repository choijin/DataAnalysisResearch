<AbstractNarration>Arizona State University (ASU) and Tecnologico de Monterrey (ITESM) have recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) and held two administrative meetings at ASU to explore collaborative research and education endeavors. This NSF award provides support to organize two workshops whose themes will be on Sensor Signal and Information Processing Systems. This program will positively impact US-Mexico research and education initiatives and will engage a number of qualified students and faculty from two large institutions in the area of sensors and signal processing. The program will engage underrepresented groups within STEM disciplines such as electrical engineering, with broader impacts on improving the engineering workforce base, with commensurate economic benefits to the two countries. The program will disseminate successful academy-industry collaborative models such as the I/UCRC in Mexico. Several application aspects of sensors will be addressed in industrial areas including localization, mobility with extensions to manufacturing, health, and other systems of common interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops which will engage USA and Mexico researchers, faculty and students and are titled:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Workshop 1: Sensors and Signal Processing for Localization and Security Applications;&lt;br/&gt;-Workshop 2: Academy-Industry Collaborations in Sensors and Signal Processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two workshops will be organized by the PI who will lead an organizing committee of faculty and industry partners. The first workshop will be in Tempe, Arizona (December 2015) and the second one in will be held in Monterrey, Mexico (May 2016). The objectives of the workshops are to: a) initiate collaborative structures between faculty and industry researchers in the US and Mexico through research and panel sessions, b) develop STEM foundations in the areas of sensor systems through organized tutorials for students and researchers that will support future workforce development efforts, and c) initiate industry-university relations&lt;br/&gt;in Mexico using US industry academia-research models such as the I/UCRC.</AbstractNarration>

USA  - Mexico (ASU / ITESM) Workshops and Outcomes  We have held two workshops in 2016 with ASU and Tech de Monterrey faculty and student presenters and industry speakers and participants.  We also held two more USA - Mexico workshops in 2017.  In all workshops, we invited industry research leaders, partners and engineers.  The workshops had several outcomes including:  They allowed researchers from ITESM and ASU to start collaborations on projects and proposals.  Three collaborative ASU-ITESM proposals were submitted in 2016 to: industry , NSF,  and to CONACYT. There was knowledge transfer from ASU to ITESM that enabled our colleagues ITESM to establish an I/UCRC type center, namely, COMSIP at Monterrey.  The PI at ASU provided support letters and expertise along with sample consortium proposals. The joint US - Mexico workshops at ASU also provided training sessions to faculty, students and industry in:  a) adaptive systems (May 2016) and b) Machine Learning algorithms (Nov 2016 and Oct. 2017). All workshops (SensMach 2016 and 2017) had industry, faculty and student presentations.  Poster sessions with more than 20 student research posters were also part of each of these events.
