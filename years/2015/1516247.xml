<AbstractNarration>With masses millions to billions times that of our Sun, the strong gravitational influence of supermassive black holes can heat nearby gas so that it outshines an entire galaxy of stars, and slingshot material outward at relativistic speeds. They exist at the centers of almost every massive galaxy, and they may play a significant role in regulating rates of star formation. Our project aims to produce the most realistic simulations to-date of two of the most dramatic events they can make: the inspiral and merger of two orbiting supermassive black holes and the tidal disruption of stars. Both were once thought to be unobservable, but the advent of very large astronomical surveys sensitive to transients have led to the discovery of numerous tidal disruptions and promise the discovery of many mergers. The prospect of extensive observational data make both very hot topics. The great advantage of this program is the opportunity it provides to integrate many existing research programs into a larger community of scientists, students, and the general public. It will foster crossdisciplinary collaborations among undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty at the Univ. of Tulsa, Johns Hopkins Univ., NASA/GSFC, and Rochester Institute of Technology. Through such a network, our previous highly successful outreach programs will be able to reach an even larger and more diverse audience. For instance, S. Noble (PI) will continue to speak about hot physics topics with the 100-200 high school students that attend the monthly ?Journal Club? event sponsored by his department, and will work with his collaborators on building similar activities at their institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major goal of this project is to make specific predictions of electromagnetic signatures of circumbinary accretion and tidal disruption events that will allow astronomers to identify, based solely on EM observations, these spectacular events using HST (optical), JWST (IR), Chandra (X-ray), and ISS-Lobster (X-ray), as well as ground based instrumentation such as the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, which is already in operation, or the planned Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Such identifications will be a tremendous aid in refining our estimates of the population of merging supermassive black holes, both for estimating the numbers of potential gravitational wave targets and for evaluating the impact of black hole mergers on galaxy evolution. Our simulations on Blue Waters will employ a number of new computational developments needed to achieve the most realistic simulations of these systems to date. They include an adaptive load balancer to evenly distribute runs with nonuniform costs, and a multi-patch system for evolving the magnetohydrodynamics equations on different coordinate domains. It is our intent to make the latter tool publicly available for use in other magnetohydrodynamics codes. Our scientific results will also have a wide-reaching impact on the astrophysical community, both theoretically and observationally. We will release detailed spectra and simulation data for use by observers and future mission development teams. This work comes at a particularly opportune time, as the fields of time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy are growing rapidly.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our goals in this project were focused on two projects, both involving gas flows around supermassive black holes.   One topic is how gas flows around a supermassive black hole binary with such a small separation that it should merge not too far in the future.   The other topic is a "tidal disruption event", an occasion in which an ordinary star ventures so close to a supermassive black hole that it is torn apart by the black hole's tidal gravity.  Although astronomers have good reason to think they exist, no one has yet spotted an example of a supermassive black hole binary.   Our goal in this project is to study the gas flow around such a system sufficiently carefully that we can predict the specific character of the light it emits, both its spectrum and its time-variations.   Toward that goal, we have studied very close black hole binaries, so close that their separation is only about ten times larger than their event horizons.   We made two surprising discoveries about such systems, both having to do with the "mini-disks" of gas orbiting around each of the black holes.  The first is that relativistic gravity makes it considerably easier for matter to travel from one mini-disk to the other than would be the case in a wider binary, where relativity is unimportant.   As a result, matter "sloshes" back and forth between the two mini-disks, creating violent shock waves with the potential capacity to create light in a new and unexpected form.   The second also reflects an aspect special to close black hole binaries, where relativistic gravity is important.  In more widely-separated binaries, the outer edge of a mini-disk is much farther from its central black hole than the radius at which orbits become unstable and matter abruptly spirals into the black hole.   In such disks, matter takes a very long time to sift inward.  However, here, where the disks are tightly limited in size because the other black hole is so near, matter can drift in much more rapidly.   In fact, these disks fill and drain over a time not very different from the orbital period of the binary.   This alternation could imprint a very distinctive character on the light emitted from the disks, perhaps enabling identification of some examples.  Tidal disruptions differ from supermassive black hole mergers in that we have already observed a few dozen examples.   In this case, the challenge is to understand some surprising features of the light they emit.    For example, although the flares they make are nearly as bright as an entire galaxy and last for a few weeks to a few months, the  total light energy emitted is nonetheless substantially smaller (by a factor of a hundred or so) than might be expected if the mass of an entire star fell into orbit around a black hole.  Supported by this grant, we have performed the first simulation able to track matter throughout its journey from being part of a stable star to being distributed over a wide, irregular, eccentric disk orbiting the black hole.   An important result of this simulation is that the matter finds itself in a relatively large and irregular flow, one in which inward drifting toward the black hole is likely to take rather more time than had been previously expected, possibly explaining the flares' observed faintness.  In addition to these scientific achievements, we also have made a technical advance by recognizing hat both topics would benefit by a new kind of simulation infrastructure, a "multipath" scheme.   In both of our subject areas, as well as in many other problems, both in astrophysics and in other areas of science and engineering, a single system comprises several different subregions in which the relevant physical processes or the characteristic lengthscales or the geometrical symmetry differ.   It is very difficult for monolithic methods to treat these contrasting regions well, but at the same time each one can influence the others.  To aid work on problems of this sort, we have built a "wrapper" package to coordinate the efforts of several independent programs, each responsible for simulating the physics of a single "patch", one of the contrasting subregions.   Coordination is achieved by exchanging information between any pairs of patches whose volumes overlap.    Thanks to support from this grant, our multipatch system is now fully operational and we have begun to use it.       Last Modified: 09/07/2018       Submitted by: Julian H Krolik]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
