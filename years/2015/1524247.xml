<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to determine the depths and distribution of crystallization of magmas within the oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges.  The release of latent heat during crystallization of magmas that forms the oceanic crust is a primary mechanism by which heat is transferred from the Earth's interior to the oceans and atmosphere, and it drives the hydrothermal circulation that sustains chemosynthetic life on the seafloor.  Thus, determining where crystallization occurs within the magmatic system and how magmas are distributed to the oceanic crust is critical for our understanding of global geochemical cycles and mid-ocean ridge systems as a whole. This project will provide funding and research experience for a graduate and undergraduate student at Boise State University (BSU) and results will be incorporated into a new marine geosciences course at BSU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to determine how variations in spreading rate, ridge axis morphology, and lithospheric thicknesses influence crystallization depths and magma compositions along Gorda Ridge. The investigator will use major, trace and volatile compositions of olivine-hosted melt inclusions to address three questions regarding melting and crystallization: (1) How do crystallization depths vary along Gorda Ridge and what does this indicate about lithospheric thickness? (2) Are there variations in magma compositions and melting systematics that correlate with ridge morphology? (3) How do melting systematics and crystallization depths beneath North Gorda compare to the Cleft segment on the Juan de Fuca Ridge? To address these questions, the investigator will determine the pressures/depths of crystallization of each melt inclusion using vapor-saturation pressures derived from volatile contents. Next, major and trace element concentrations will be used to determine how magma compositions vary along the ridge axis.  These results will be incorporated into numerical calculations to determine how mantle source compositions and total extents of melting vary along axis.  Finally, crystallization depths and melting models will be compared to previous studies of melt inclusions from a variety of ridges to determine how variations in spreading rate, magma supply and lithospheric thickness influence melting and crystallization beneath mid-ocean ridges.</AbstractNarration>

Additional data sets were collected on Gorda Ridge and Juan de Fuca ridge melt inclusions in 2016 and 2017.      Outreach and Educational Activities:  Marine Geology Course:A major focus of this project was course development.  In 2016, the PI taught a marine geology course to graduate and undergraduate students at Boise State University.  While this course was organized around conducting scientific research in submarine systems, the learning objectives focused on providing the students with critical thinking and problem solving skills.  A major emphasis of the course was for students to develop their own scientific questions and create a research plan to collect data during a research cruise. The students were introduced to a mapping program (GeoMapApp), planned bathymetric surveys, manipulated large geochemical datasets using PetDB, and discussed scientific literature. This course was well liked by the students, with an average student evaluation of 4.7 (out of 5).       High School Student Intern: In the summer of 2016, the PI sponsored a high school intern in her lab for 6 weeks.  This was part of the Boise State TRIO program, focused on providing STEM education to under represented groups in Idaho.  The student worked with the PI and graduate students in the lab every afternoon for 3 hours.  She learned valuable lab skills including: how to crush and pick rocks, how to clean samples for geochemical analyses, how to polish and mount samples in indium for volatile analyses.       Outreach Activities:The PI developed, coordinated, and ran demonstrations for the Annual BSU STEM Exploration Day (now Engineering and Science Festival). The PI brought new, indoor volcanology experiments and hands-on demonstrations to this outreach event. These activities highlight changes in volcanic activity based on volatile contents in magmas.  I have continued to improve and add to these demonstrations and will run these with graduate students at future STEM outreach events.
