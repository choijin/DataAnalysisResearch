<AbstractNarration>The proposal brings together a  national (US) group of atmospheric chemistry researchers from universities, government laboratories, and private research institutes, to promote discussion of information and ideas on topics of contemporary interest in atmospheric science through the internationally respected Gordon Research Conference. The theme of this year's conference is Multiphase Processes: Observations and Fundamentals, Aug 2-7, in the Waterville Valley, NH. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the symposium will derive from the exchange of ideas that will help to focus the research community on the most pressing questions, as well as provide an opportunity for young scientists to meet, network, and exchange ideas with leaders in the atmospheric chemistry and related sciences.</AbstractNarration>
