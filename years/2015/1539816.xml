<AbstractNarration>1539816 (Gaustad). The International Symposium on Sustainable Systems and Technology (ISSST) attracts participants from multiple disciplines to focus on issues related to sustainability science and engineering. This conference covers a spectrum of issues for assessing and managing products and services across their life cycle, and the design, management, and policy implications of sustainable engineered systems and technologies. The conference has significant participation from students and young faculty members, which is critical for generating the next generation of sustainable solutions. This grant is for funds to help expand the participation of students, underrepresented groups, and junior faculty from across the United States in ISSST 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solution of complex sustainability issues can only be achieved via trans-disciplinary approaches. Cross pollination of ideas among natural scientists, engineers, social scientists, and policy makers is necessary for developing a holistic understanding of sustainability applicable to engineered systems, products, and supply chains and the critical infrastructures on which they depend. ISSST 2015's theme is collaboration and this theme will be advanced with a variety of networking and learning opportunities. By providing opportunities for educational exchange among academics, government, and industry representatives, opportunities will be enhanced for the design and development of sustainable systems and technology. Further, ISSST 2015 is designed to fill key knowledge gaps and broaden the existing sustainability community base to include social and ecological scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The 2015 International Symposium on Sustainable Systems and Technology (ISSST) was held May 18-20 in Dearborn, Michigan.  The conference, now in its 22nd year, aimed to cover a spectrum of issues for assessing and managing products and services across their life cycle, and the design, management, and policy implications of sustainable engineered systems and technologies.  The goal of this project was to provide funding to encourage the attendance of students and junior faculty, particularly underrepresented groups; their attendance enables a wide array of networking and professional development opportunities.    Intellectual Merit The conference included over 85 oral presentations on topics in several key sustainability areas including: renewable energy, electronics, critical materials, advances in modeling and metrics, water, waste management, tools for decision support, supply chains and trade, behavior and communication, material-energy nexus, emerging technologies, resilience, reliability and risk, climate change and cities, and buildings and construction.  Highlights of the conference included a pre-conference workshop using improv to train for public communication of science, a Lego Serious Play workshop, a networking social for the student chapters, three concurrent tracks of talks each day, a networking poster session, an interdisciplinary resilience summit, keynote speaker Dr. Marga Gual Soler on "Science Diplomacy for Sustainability", plenary speaker Dr. Kara Hall on "Teams for Transdisciplinary Science", an introduction to the EPA Star Fellowship for students, an industry-agency plenary session, and workshops on game design and teaching LCA. Thirty students or junior faculty were able to receive travel assistance to attend with 100% participation in networking and professional development activities and 90% participation in oral presentation, proceedings, poster or service committee activities.   Broader Impacts The ISSST organizing committee was able to make thirty $500 awards to assist students and junior faculty in participation of the conference, making selections from sixty applicants.  Selection criteria included: award restrictions (students and junior faculty with a preference for domestic), need, fair geographic and institutional dispersion, STEM under-represented groups, and a demonstration or interest in service and engagement with ISSST. A diversity of recipients was achieved with approximately 50% being female, 20% AALANA, and representing 18 institutions with wide geographic dispersion.  This award has hopefully impacted the personal growth and career trajectory of participants in the principal discipline of sustainability by facilitating student and junior faculty professional development and networking at this conference. These awards provided wider dissemination of important sustainability science initiatives. As one key objective of this yearÆs conference was promoting collaboration, particularly across disciplines, this funding had a direct impact on facilitating cross-disciplinary work. Networking and professional development events were targeted at improving specific skillsets of the participants such as science communication, collaboration, and particular disciplinary training eg. life-cycle assessment, geo-spatial modeling, etc..
