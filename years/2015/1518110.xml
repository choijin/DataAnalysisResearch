<AbstractNarration>Particles play essential roles in the cycling and distribution of trace elements and isotopes (TEI). For instance scavenging onto particles and removal by particle export is a major sink for many TEIs. However the driving factors affecting the spatial extent and temporal variability of TEI scavenging remain largely unknown. The U.S. GEOTRACES East Pacific Zonal Transect between Peru and Tahiti will cross three biogeochemically important areas, setting the stage for researchers to constrain unknowns surrounding particle scavenging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and University of Minnesota-Twin Cities will address fundamental questions on the location of particle formation, particle-dissolved species interactions, dominant particle phases, and the evolution of particle phases during transport. As regards particle phases, the researchers will measure particulate organic carbon (POC), calcium carbonate, opal, lithogenics, and oxyhydroxides, as well as the trace element compositions of size fractionated particles covering three distinct zones: large lateral productivity gradients, a major oxygen deficient zone off the coast of Peru, and a world renowned hydrothermal plume emanating from the southern East Pacific Rise. Furthermore, since previous results suggest particle type affects scavenging, investigators will specifically measure acid-leachable trace metals, particle concentration, and major particle composition. These combined measurements will allow them to disentangle the relative importance of hydrothermal particles, benthic nepheloid layers, and high productivity margins for scavenging of TEIs. The cruise transect will also offer unique opportunities to examine the speciation of Fe and POC in hydrothermal particles away from the vent field and the effects of aggregation and POC coatings on TEI partitioning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As regards broader impacts, the researchers plan to create an educational module on particulate trace metals in the ocean which would become part of a five part GEOTRACES webinar series developed by Dr. Benjamin Twining at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in collaboration with the Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence-Ocean Systems at the University of Maine.  One graduate student from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and one graduate student from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, would be supported and trained as part of this project.  In addition, an undergraduate student would participate in the research during the summer month as part of the Woods Hole Diversity Initiative Partnership in Education program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     In this project, we determined the chemical composition of marine particles collected from the ocean. The marine particles were collected in two sizes, 1&shy;-51 um and &gt;51 um, along the U.S. GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect (EPZT), which sampled from the coast of Peru to Tahiti, roughly along 12&deg;S. This transect crossed two chemically significant zones: the large, Peruvian oxygen deficient zone in the eastern half of the cruise, and the hydrothermal plume emanating from the East Pacific Rise in the western half of the cruise.    The smaller particles (1-51 um) that we collected generally remain suspended in seawater, where they can interact with dissolved constituents, whereas the larger particles generally sink, and are thus a vector by which elements can be transferred to depth. The two size fractions interact with each other by aggregation and disaggregation, which are part of a suite of particle dynamics processes.    We measured major biologically &shy;produced carrier phases (e.g. particulate organic carbon and the biominerals, calcium carbonate and biogenic silica) and a suite of trace elements (e.g. iron, aluminum, manganese, cadmium, copper, cobalt, titanium), some of which are required as micronutrients for life, and others that act as tracers of oceanographic processes, in the size-&shy;fractionated particles collected from the US EPZT section. Along with collaboration with researchers from other institutions, we used these data to assess the relative importance of particle concentration, composition, and size distribution on the cycling and removal of trace elements and their isotopes (TEIs). This was a rich dataset that has already led to 10 publications that have been accepted by, submitted to, or soon to be submitted to peer reviewed journals.  Results of this work contributed to the overall goal of the GEOTRACES program, whose mission is to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean.           Results from this work provided critical information about particle dynamics to other science communities (such as global biogeochemists, environmental engineers) interested in the role of marine particles in sequestering carbon from the atmosphere through a process known as the biological carbon pump.   Some of our findings about iron cycling in the ocean, especially that iron can be oxidized in the water column even in the absence of oxygen, should be of interest to microbiologists and geobiologists who are studying similar reactions in terrestrial environments.           Two young female post&shy;doctoral scientists were supported by this project. Besides the analytical and scientific training they received on this grant, both were also given opportunities to lead components of the project, providing leadership training that they will need to be successful, independent scientists. An undergraduate and a graduate student at UCSC were also involved in this project.           Last Modified: 05/30/2017       Submitted by: Phoebe J Lam]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
