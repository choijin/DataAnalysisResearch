<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in promoting the protection of human health, the environment, and our nation's natural resources by providing new sensors that enable fast, accurate, cost-effective sampling and analysis tools to monitor pollution and exposure. The innovations developed here will allow for the rapid identification and detection of hazardous compounds in water at substantially reduced cost. These technological innovations will translate into triple bottom-line savings of companies by enhancing our ability to protect people and the planet, while simultaneously providing cost and time savings to the business. The technology embodies the concepts of sustainability and ease of use, and will achieve broad commercial appeal by saving businesses money, time, and effort while also giving them more data on potential sources of pollution. Scientifically, this technology will enable more precise assessment of environmental pollution by providing more rapid measurement capability at a larger scale than is currently possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop an innovative, market-disruptive technology for measuring toxic metals in water. This technology is inexpensive, portable, and does not require any power or external reading equipment. Furthermore, it can be adapted to a wide range of toxic compounds after initial commercialization around metals analysis. The system costs an order of magnitude less than the current "point of need" technologies capable of quantitative determination of toxic metals in water, and two orders of magnitude less than the traditional laboratory tests. Access Sensor Technologies is a new startup, but the core team has a strong track record in the field of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for environmental analysis where the proposed system represents a major innovation in the field. The proposal has four technical objectives: (1) Expand the palette of applicable chemistry to include additional metals: cadmium, lead, manganese, and both chromium 3+ and 6+; (2) Test the prototype system in a relevant laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment; (3) Achieve a successful customer-driven demonstration of the system in the field; and (4) Identify key elements of manufacturability that define the roadmap to production of the system at market scale.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project, ?SBIR Phase II: Measuring Aqueous Metal Concentrations with the Chemometer,? focused on creating simple water analysis tools that could provide insight in metals in water. The contamination of metals in water continues to be a worldwide problem. The historical production and use of metals has created an ongoing concern. There are many thousands of miles of leaded water lines in cities and tens of thousands of abandoned mine sites that must be managed to prevent further contamination of water and land resources. This project aimed to make measuring those mobile metals easier without the need for complex sample prep and instrumentation. The project focused on using paper-based technology as a scalable and simple means to create reliable assays for water analysis. Initially the project started out aiming to create a linear distance-based design that would allow for the concentration of an analyte to be read like the same way one reads a thermometer. This design was eventually improved upon by moving to a radial design allowing water samples to flow in to the devices and react with chemicals radially. This allows a user to achieve fast results by measuring the size of the spot formed and relating that size to a concentration. We developed test card designs to measure several metals and other important water quality analytes. Cards were deployed with users in the mining, environmental engineering, water management and education settings for feedback. Additionally during this project we created supporting products that would allow a user to extract and analyze metals from solid samples. To validate the cards we published several peer reviewed publications and submitted a full non-provisional patent application to protect the novel designs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/16/2020<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;D&nbsp;Miller-Lionberg</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1534786/1534786_10398751_1594934018234_On-Target--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1534786/1534786_10398751_1594934018234_On-Target--rgov-800width.jpg" title="On-Target"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1534786/1534786_10398751_1594934018234_On-Target--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="On-Target"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">On-Target cards developed to test common metals in water.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Access Sensor Technologies</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;D&nbsp;Miller-Lionberg</div> <div class="imageTitle">On-Target</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1534786/1534786_10398751_1594934077671_OnTargetuserflow--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1534786/1534786_10398751_1594934077671_OnTargetuserflow--rgov-800width.jpg" title="On-Target work flow"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1534786/1534786_10398751_1594934077671_OnTargetuserflow--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="On-Target work flow"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The cards were developed to create a simple way to measure metals in water.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Access Sensor Technologies</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;D&nbsp;Miller-Lionberg</div> <div class="imageTitle">On-Target work flow</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1534786/1534786_10398751_1594934139759_OnTarget_linear--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1534786/1534786_10398751_1594934139759_OnTarget_linear--rgov-800width.jpg" title="On-Target analyte set"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1534786/1534786_10398751_1594934139759_OnTarget_linear--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="On-Target analyte set"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A wide set of cards was developed to address many concerns in water monitoring and quality.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Access Sensor Technologies</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;D&nbsp;Miller-Lionberg</div> <div class="imageTitle">On-Target analyte set</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
