<AbstractNarration>This project is a collaborative effort between Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and Syracuse University (SU) to develop tools and strategies to "reverse engineer" key minerals of Earth's continental crust - that is, to learn how and when these materials formed and the conditions experienced since their origin.  Consider, for example, the benefits of being able to "read" the history of a single grain of sand simply by measuring its content of key chemical elements: Was it formed during an episode of mountain building or during a volcanic eruption? How far did it travel from its source? Was it associated with a potentially valuable ore deposit at the time of formation? This project will involve laboratory synthesis of selected minerals over a range of temperature and pressure conditions, followed by measurement of the amounts of elemental impurities incorporated during growth (the concentrations of aluminum and titanium in quartz, for example, depend strongly on the temperature and pressure of quartz formation).  The broader purpose of the project is to develop "chemical tools" for all researchers to use in deciphering events and processes of our planet's past - from mountain building to formation of ore deposits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A decade of experimental research at RPI has focused on evaluating the effects of pressure (P) and temperature (T) on the solubilities of low-abundance elements in key minerals of the continental crust.  This enterprise has been called "trace-element thermobarometry" because each application is based on the concentration of a single, marginally compatible element in a common or otherwise strategic mineral phase (e.g., Ti in zircon).  These thermobarometers differ in fundamental ways from "conventional" thermobarometers based on major-element phase equilibria, and they have a key advantage: if the system is properly constrained, the concentration of a single impurity in a single mineral can be used as an indicator of its crystallization T and/or P.  To date, this effort has produced thermo(baro)meters based on the Ti content of zircon, the Ti content of quartz ("TitaniQ"), the Zr content of rutile, and the Zr content of titanite.  The value of these thermobarometers has been enhanced significantly through experimental calibration of the diffusion laws for all relevant impurities in the phases of interest, so users can assess the robustness of the thermobarometers for specific real-world applications.  Efforts to date have had significant impact in the geoscience community (as judged by literature citations), but the development of trace-element thermobarometers and the improvement of "old" ones is far from complete. The proposed work is aimed at providing a full toolbox of thermobarometers for crustal systems that includes cross-checks of the various P-T indicators.  Specifically, the TitaniQ calibration will be extended to lower P for application to volcanic rocks, and Ti-in-zircon will be more thoroughly assessed for P effects.  Entirely new systems and applications will also be pursued, including the development of P-T indicators based on Ti in coesite for ultra high-pressure (UHP) rocks, Al in quartz to complement TitaniQ, Si and Al in rutile, and Ti in both K-spar and in kyanite. Equilibrium studies of all new systems will be complemented by diffusion measurements of the relevant elements. Further, the pressure-volume-temperature properties of fluid inclusions in crystals from experimental run products will be used in conjunction with trace-element thermobarometers to confirm accuracy of our calibrations at relatively low P-T applications. The proposed study involves implementation of techniques specifically in experimental geochemistry, but the applications of our results extend across a substantial expanse of geoscience, including not only igneous and metamorphic petrology but also ore-deposits research, structural geology, tectonics, and sedimentology.</AbstractNarration>

Simply put, geoscientists seek to reconstruct the pressure-temperature-time-composition (P-T-t-X) pathways of natural samples to determine the pace, intensity, regularity, and predictability of geologic phenomena initiated deep in the Earth.  The essential tools for extracting pressure-temperature-time information from natural samples have been termed "geobarometers" (which tell us about pressure), "geothermometers" (which tell us about temperature), and "geospeedometers" (which tell us about rates of change).  It is important to note that these tools are not actual physical instruments but rather mathematical or graphical representations of chemical characteristics of minerals and rocks that provide quantitative indications of conditions experienced.  The RPI portion of this project was to develop new P-T-t indicators based on the concentration of Ti in potassium feldspar, or "K-spar" - KAlSi3O8) and the aluminum (Al) concentration in rutile (titanium dioxide - TiO2).  K-spar is one of the most common minerals in Earth's crust; rutile is not abundant, but it is a common as s dispersed "accessory" mineral (i.e., it is present in many rocks but generally in amounts &lt;1%), and it incorporates Al at levels ranging up to ~1%, depending on P-T conditions.  To address the "staying power" of our new thermobarometers&mdash;i.e., the resistance to change through migration of atoms&mdash;we also examined the rates of migration (mobility) of Ti atoms in K-spar and related minerals, as well as the mobility of Al (and Si) in rutile.  Our research led to the following findings and conclusions:  Ti content of K-feldspar  In K-spar coexisting with rutile, the Ti content depends systematically upon temperature and pressure.  Like quartz, K-spar crystals incorporate more Ti when grown at high temperatures (more, in fact, than do quartz crystals) and less when grown at high pressure.  The mathematical relationships we produced from our experimental data form the basis of a potentially useful geothermobarometer.  This new tool is promising in that it can be used in conjunction with the Ti-in-quartz thermobarometer&mdash;many rocks of Earth's crust contain both minerals&mdash;but limitations may arise because the P-T calibrations (i.e., the graphical dependencies of Ti content on pressure and temperature of crystal growth) are similar for the two minerals, which leads to a degradation in resolution.  Ti mobility (diffusion) in feldspar  We measured the rates of migration of Ti atoms in K-spar and other feldspars (i.e., minerals of similar composition and atomic structure) over a temperature range of 750&deg;-1150&deg;C.  We found that Ti atoms are less mobile in feldspars than they are in quartz, which has been characterized previously.  This finding is encouraging because it means that the record of Ti uptake in feldspars will be effectively preserved though geologic cooling and/or thermal cycling.  Al content of rutile  The aluminum content of rutile increases with increasing temperature and also with increasing pressure, making this mineral a potentially useful geologic thermobarometer.  However, a significant complication came to light in that the Al content of rutile also depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the rock of interest during growth of the rutile crystal under consideration.  This finding is, on the one hand, quite intriguing because it raises the possibility of estimating oxygen pressures in Earth's crust on the basis of the Al content of rutile crystals.  On the other hand, however, the addition of a third variable (besides P and T) affecting Al uptake in rutile is a major limitation because more information about the host rock is needed before P-T information can be extracted on the basis of measured Al contents of rutile.  If the pressure and temperature conditions of rutile crystallization can be estimated independently (from, say, Ti content of quartz in the same rock), then rutile can tell us about the oxygen pressure, too.  Al and Si mobility (diffusion) in rutile  We measured the rates of migration of both aluminum (Al) and silicon (Si) in rutile at temperatures ranging from 1100&deg;-1500&deg;C.  Atoms of both elements show limited mobility at geologically plausible temperatures in Earth's crust, which means that under most circumstances rutile will retain a faithful record of its journey through P-T space in Earth's crust.
