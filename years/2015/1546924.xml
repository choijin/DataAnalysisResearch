<AbstractNarration>In 1985, a relatively small eruption at Nevado del Ruiz volcano in Colombia killed approximately 23,000 people in or near the town of Armero. A glacier at the top of the volcano partially melted, contributing to a large lahar that moved quickly downslope, inundating the town with large volumes of water mixed with volcanic ash and rock.   Recent activity at Nevado del Ruiz appears similar to the precursor activity observed in 1985 has local scientists at the Servicio Geologico Colombiano (SGC), the national geological survey of Colombia and the investigators on this grant concerned that another destructive lahar event similar to the 1985 event could initiate in the near future.  Unfortunately despite Colombian government efforts to discourage human settlement in areas surrounding Nevado del Ruiz that are particularly susceptible to the channeling of destructive lahars, local Colombians have quickly forgotten the past destructive potential of this volcano and much development has occurred in at-risk areas since the 1985 lahar.  This grant is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will enable the development of a high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano in Columbia coupled with GPS observations of surface deformation.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will employ a University of South Florida owned terrestrial Ku-band radar, drone-based aerial photogrammetry and Structure from Motion software to generate a very high resolution DEM that is a necessary input to the new generation of quantitative lahar models that will inform risk mitigation plans and will gain better resolution of volcanic edifice surface deformation with an expanded GPS network surrounding Nevado del Ruiz.  The surface deformation observations can offer clues to pressure changes in the shallow magmatic plumbing system and help advise early warning decisions.   The terrestrial radar will be used to generate interferograms of the spatial variability of deformation patterns and changes in the velocity of the capping glacier at Nevado del Ruiz, that if quickly melted by heat from accelerated volcanic activity, would be responsible for lahar generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aims to reduce the hazard at Nevado de Ruiz volcano in Colombia, as well as test a number of new mapping technologies that could be beneficial in a range of earth science applications, including mapping and hazard reductions at other active volcanoes.  Nevado del Ruiz last erupted in 1985, killing more than 20,000 people with a type of volcanic flow called a lahar.  This is basicly a rapid flow of volcanic ash and mud that moves downslope quickly.  In this case the residents of Armero, more than 60 km from the volcano, were quickly overwhelmed by the lahar, and the town was destroyed.  In principle lahar trajectories can be accurately modeled with modern computing techniques.  However, a key input to such models is an accurate topographic map, especially for the upper, hard to reach parts of the volcano where the lahar starts.  This part of the volcano is especially difficult to map &ndash; it is rugged, and in the case of Nevado del Ruiz, is often cloud-covered, precluding standard aerial photo or optical satellite techniques.  Our project used a combination of satellite and ground-based radar to derive a Digital Elevation Model (DEM &ndash; a type of computerized topographic map), and compared it with existing information.  In many of the high elevation parts of the volcano, the new DEM appears to be a significant improvement over existing DEMs.  We are currently testing our new DEM with existing lahar models to see how the model predictions differ with earlier DEMs, and compare with reality (small mudflows still occur in the various stream valleys, and can be used to test the model).  Our project also installed two high precision GPS receivers on the flanks of the volcano.  These units complement others operated by the Colombian Geological Survey, and together give a picture of the volcano?s deformation state, which can help to warn of an impending eruption.
