<AbstractNarration>Ulithi Atoll, in the Federated States of Micronesia, is the fourth largest Atoll in the world, and was an important staging area for the US Navy 3rd fleet during WWII. The Atoll contains dynamic coral reefs, and communities of people that depend on them. Ulithi has been subjected to a number of human and natural disturbances, including Typhoon Ophelia that hit in 1960. Local fishermen believe that this event started an invasion process by a 'weedy' invasive coral that covers reefs, and removes essential habitat for fish and octopus, potentially threatening these ecosystems.  Four years ago, local people invited the investigators to Ulithi to study the reefs and work together to enhance fisheries and reef health.  The investigators sequenced the invading coral DNA and identified it as a new species of Montipora.  However, its invasion dynamics remain a mystery. In early April 2015, Ulithi was hit again by a major disturbance: super Typhoon Maysak. The Typhoon destroyed most structures on the island, and removed much of the coral formations visible from shore. Using their baseline data of the past four years, the investigators, along with a team of students, seek to map the effect of the Typhoon on the invasive Montipora.  Using genomic sequencing, they hope to better understand the role of Typhoon Maysak on the establishment and dispersal of this invasive coral. This project provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of a rare event, and invasion processes, and to broadly disseminate findings, raising awareness about coral reefs, climate change, and unique human-natural coupled systems.  Their experiences will be made available on social media and the project website onepeopleonereef.ucsc.edu, as well as through NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super typhoon Maysak struck Ulithi Atoll on March 31, 2015, where an invasive/outbreak species of Montipora has affected shallow coral reefs over at least the last 50 years. The research the investigators propose will elucidate the effects of this rare but high impact event on a biological invasion using genomics and reef sampling to investigate Micronesian reefs that were dominated by Montipora before the typhoon, and more 'pristine' reefs where Montipora was absent or in low densities.  The investigators will be relating these findings to existing data that were collected from these sites over the past four years. These studies will advance our understanding of biological invasions in coral reef systems, explore the unusual occurrence of a coral species as an outbreak organism, and contribute to our knowledge of how high impact, episodic disturbances - likely to increase in frequency with the advance of global climate change - may affect threated coral reef ecosystems world-wide.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The impact of a large episodic disturbance on an invasive (outbreak) coral: Will Typhoon Maysak promote or suppress an invasive&nbsp;<em>Montipora</em>sp. coral on reefs of Ulithi, Micronesia?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Ulithi Atoll, in Yap State of Micronesia, is the fourth largest atoll in the world. The Atoll's healthy coral reefs have sustained local populations of approximately 1000 people for hundreds of years. Since the 1960?s, however, reefs have changed. The outbreak of a weedy coral, in the genus&nbsp;<em>Montipora</em>(locally called 'cabbage coral') has overtaken some reefs, smothering other corals and reducing structural complexity. The local people reported that these reefs were less productive, so we have been examining the impacts by comparing reefs with and without this coral. Curious about the cause, we interviewed islanders about when they first saw this coral. They believe that the beginning of this outbreak coincided with Typhoon Ophelia, which passed over Ulithi Atoll in 1960. Impact from that storm may have damaged other corals, providing an opportunity for this 'weedy' species of coral to take over, possibly exacerbated by climate change which may be creating more favorable conditions for this coral. We had an opportunity to test this hypothesis when Typhoon Maysak passed over Ulithi in 2015.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project addressed several questions:</p> <ol> <li>Is there a pattern to which reefs have become dominated by&nbsp;<em>Montipora sp.?</em></li> <li>Do reefs dominated by&nbsp;<em>Montipora</em>sp. have lower diversity and abundance of other coral species?&nbsp;</li> <li>Do reefs dominated by&nbsp;<em>Montipora&nbsp;</em>sp. have lower diversity, abundance, and biomass of reef fishes?</li> <li>What impact will the typhoon have on the local distribution of&nbsp;<em>Montipora&nbsp;</em>sp?

For this question, we used state-of-the-art genomic tools. We first did a set of experiments right after the Typhoon passed over Ulithi. We designed a grid on the ocean floor to collect a large number of&nbsp;<em>Montipora&nbsp;</em>coral fragments to determine: 1. If fragments were related to attached 'parental' colonies, and 2. How far from the parents the coral fragments had been scattered by the Typhoon.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We then waited a year to visit Ulithi again and set up a similar experiment, but this time we looked at small fragments of corals that were attached to the bottom floor. These were pieces of corals that had been broken up by the Typhoon the previous year, had been dispersed by the Typhoon, and then had been able to survive and reattach themselves.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The first surprising findings were that, unlike what we expected, the majority of fragments and colonies are genetically different from one another, which means that most Montipora corals are the result of sexual reproduction, rather than cloning and fragmentation. In addition, our investigations showed that, indeed, large colonies had been broken up by the Typhoon and fragments had been dispersed as far as 40 meters (120 feet) from the parent colony. Some of these fragments survived and reattached themselves. Our main conclusion was, therefore, that Typhoon Maysak did in fact play a role in the dispersal of Montipora corals.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet this is only one part of the story. A complex and unexpected picture emerged from our work. Overall, the abundance of&nbsp;<em>Montipora</em>sp. throughout the Atoll decreased after Typhoon Maysak. Although coral fragments were dispersed widely by the Typhoon, the large original colonies were broken up and other coral species were able to recolonize the spaces left open by the broken&nbsp;<em>Montipora</em>. We are closely monitoring reefs in the years following Typhoon Maysak to see whether these reefs will return to their original more diverse states, or if the fragmentation of&nbsp;<em>Montipora&nbsp;</em>will allow it to spread further.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/20/2019<br>      Modified by: Giacomo&nbsp;Bernardi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546374/1546374_10402115_1558330778199_bQIgFbxx--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546374/1546374_10402115_1558330778199_bQIgFbxx--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Meeting to discuss coral reefs"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546374/1546374_10402115_1558330778199_bQIgFbxx--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Meeting to discuss coral reefs"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The One People One Reef research team meeting with Micronesian community to discuss the impact of Montipora corals on the health of coral reefs</div> <div class="imageCredit">Scott Davis</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Giacomo&nbsp;Bernardi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Meeting to discuss coral reefs</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546374/1546374_10402115_1558330865480_DlLM_cjI--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546374/1546374_10402115_1558330865480_DlLM_cjI--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Micronesian lagoon"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546374/1546374_10402115_1558330865480_DlLM_cjI--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Micronesian lagoon"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Traditional canoes on Micronesian lagoon</div> <div class="imageCredit">Scott Davis</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Giacomo&nbsp;Bernardi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Micronesian lagoon</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546374/1546374_10402115_1558330949776_Fo86zsLB--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546374/1546374_10402115_1558330949776_Fo86zsLB--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Underwater fish counting"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546374/1546374_10402115_1558330949776_Fo86zsLB--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Underwater fish counting"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Giacomo Bernardi counting fish along a transect.
