<AbstractNarration>Scientists have long explained where particular species of animals are found by examining what we, as humans, see in the environment.  For example, we know that the type and density of plants affect where sparrows can be found. However, many animals rely heavily on non-visual senses, such as hearing, when interacting with their surroundings and deciding where to live. Although the acoustic environment -- what animals hear -- may be important to many species, it remains largely unexplored as a force influencing where animals can be found. This project will examine the extent to which natural sounds, such as those generated by wind and water, influence where animals settle, how they interact with one another and, ultimately, how they structure entire communities. Focusing on birds and bats, the investigators will conduct a large-scale experiment in which they place many speakers in the forest to create "phantom" oceans and rivers -- the sounds of moving water without the water itself.  This will allow them to figure out how sounds can change the way in which species interact with their environment and with each other. Specifically, this study will test how noise can explain where animals live, how they behave, and the extent to which they are impacted by human-made noise generated, for example, along major highways. This study will also provide research opportunities for undergraduate students at small universities and will result in an "Acoustics in Ecology and Evolution" workshop to teach young scientists how to incorporate acoustics into their own ecological field research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will test for acoustic impacts on bird and bat communities in areas characterized by high levels of natural sounds from moving water (natural river and ocean surf sounds), low levels of natural sounds, high levels of artificially created natural sounds (phantom river and surf sounds), and spectrally-shifted, artificially created natural sounds.  The latter two treatments will be generated via large-scale playbacks of sounds recorded elsewhere. The experimental approach of playing back natural sounds at different frequencies will allow researchers to parse the influence of acoustic masking versus more general effects of sounds (e.g., disturbance and distraction) on bird and bat behavior and on community structure.  Researchers will also assess the potential role of low frequency natural sounds as acoustic beacons for habitat selection. Field work will entail a combination of behavioral experiments, bird, bat, arthropod and vegetation surveys, and spatially explicit quantification of the acoustic environment.  Researchers will test hypotheses regarding how sounds structure communities directly by masking cues used for communication or predator/prey detection, directly via elevated perceived risk through a reduction in auditory surveillance, or indirectly by altering prey distributions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Natural acoustic conditions have received little attention in their potential influence on ecological communities. Here, by broadcasting ocean surf noise in coastal scrub environments for three summers, we tested hypotheses related to how acoustic conditions shape animal distributions, behaviors and interactions. We find that sounds of moving water cause several different bird species to alter their songs to cope with the difficult conditions for acoustic communication. Supporting this finding, we also find that birds have difficulty hearing songs of one another in the presence of sounds from moving water. Behavioral changes are common in other groups of animals as well. For instance, when exposed to sounds of moving water, ground squirrels become more visually vigilant for predators and forage less and move less than when they are not exposed to moving water sounds. Behavior of insects also can change with natural acoustic conditions. Females of the parasitoid fly <em>Ormia ochracea</em> eavesdrop on male cricket calls, then use the calls to fly near it to lay their larvae on or near the cricket, which subsequently burrow into the host to develop. In the presence of sounds from moving water, female flies have less success locating suitable hosts by eavesdropping on their calls, suggesting that ambient sound levels could influence broadscale patterns of parasitism risk for crickets. In terms of animal distributions, experimental broadcast of ocean sounds resulted in variable responses by individual species of birds and bats such that acoustics played an important role in structuring these communities. Many insectivorous birds that forage in shrubs or on the ground tended to avoid areas with higher sound levels whereas most aerial hawking bats became more abundant in louder areas. Foraging activity by birds also decreased strongly in areas exposed to higher frequency background sounds whereas small mammals increased foraging activity in all areas exposed to sounds of moving water. Taken together, our results demonstrate that naturally-occurring acoustic conditions represent an underappreciated dimension of the environment that shapes animal behavior and distributions. Incorporating this environmental dimension more broadly in ecology and evolution will provide stronger inference for both basic and applied questions. For instance, because the spatial and temporal footprint of human-generated noise is orders of magnitude greater than loud natural acoustic conditions, it is critical to understand that insights provided by our data increase the importance of keeping naturally quiet areas free of human-generated noise and mitigating noise pollution where it currently exists.
