<AbstractNarration>Children are introduced to the Web at increasingly young ages. While early exposure can help them build foundational skills vital in a knowledge-rich society, search tools were not designed with children in mind nor do retrieved results explicitly target children. Most engines do not support children's inquiry approaches (or do not support them well) and typically do not return content suitable to children's interests or reading levels. This need is important to address given that early experiences can affect attitudes in using the Web, skill development in making adequate use of resources for personal and educational interests, and the ability to leverage information and use it to make contributions into adulthood. The PI and her team will design and develop software modules as search engine add-ons to meet the needs of children searching the Web. The modules, which will upgrade current computation infrastructure, will be domain-independent, tailored to children, and usable on Google, to locate child-friendly educational- and leisure-related information. Research outputs will facilitate children's engagement with technology by improving their interactions on the Web. The proposed work can potentially further computer science research across a wide range of possible applications to impact the development of increasingly essential research and analysis skills among the general population of K-9 school-aged children and the underserved. Partnerships with Idaho K-9 classrooms will allow the research team to gather feedback from children and teachers and verify the usefulness of the proposed modules in their intended, formal setting. An underrepresented minority in computer science, the female, Hispanic PI will recruit and mentor female and/or Hispanic graduate student researchers. The team will disseminate research results at interdisciplinary conferences, and make educational material produced as part of the research effort available to teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will advance computer science research and technology and benefit childhood instruction across a wide variety of ages and domains. It will also address three significant problems in web information retrieval for children: search intent, query suggestion, and information filtering. Common Core state standards of education and online sources will help define target content areas. Together, the proposed modules offer children a way to post (natural language) queries that overcome common search challenges. The proposed modules will: (1) identify search intent on-the-fly given a child's natural language or keyword query; (2) suggest queries based on keywords and phrases in child vocabulary lists, literature, content written by children, and subject areas appealing to youngsters; and (3) filter results to meet readability and suitability levels as well as domain categories that children prefer. Researchers will conduct studies to verify module usefulness and measure the degree to which search environments enhanced with these modules can benefit educational tasks. The team will also integrate research and education by facilitating student research, advancing current technology, and contributing to the specific needs of children.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Web is an essential information gathering forum, with popular search engines, such as Google, serving as indispensable, every day tools. Mainstream search engines archive resources vast in both  volume and topic coverage to support wide-ranging needs. As described in the book, Search Engine Society, ?Children growing up in the 21st century have only ever known a world in which search engines could be queried, and almost always provide some kind of an answer, even if it may not be the best one?. Unfortunately, popular search tools were not designed for children, so it comes as no surprise that they often do not obtain results consistent with search intents and reading and development levels.  The overarching goal of the proposed project supported by this NSF award enabled design and development of new modules that can enhance children?s overall search experience.  In addition to the technical contributions in the form of new strategies and datasets that resulted from grant work, lessons learned (documented in associated manuscripts) revealed:  The need for search intent modules that can directly transform a child?s query (which can be in a natural form, include misspellings, and be too broad) into a succinct alternative query that captures information needs in a manner that can be effectively processed by popular search engines. The importance of offering children query suggestions that capture their interest and are based on terminology they are familiar with.  Limitations of current safe search functionality offered by popular search engines. In this case, empirical assessments demonstrated that while effective to act as a deterrent for lewd content, existing strategies do so at the cost of filtering resources that align with K-12 curriculum topics (e.g., biology) but that include terms that can be misconstrued as inappropriate for children.  The need for ranking strategies that not only prioritize resources based on their relevance to the information needs expressed in a user?s query, but that also consider how reading abilities, maturity levels, search expertise, and context (i.e., classroom vs. leisure) affect the definition of relevance.    Technical contributions and lesson learned serve as foundation for research directions in various areas of computer science and beyond (e.g., information retrieval, recommender systems, human computer interaction, digital literacy and education), when it comes to better supporting interactions with information retrieval systems of niche users beyond children, including non-English speakers and individuals suffering from dyslexia, for whom online information seeking tasks can be challenging.  In addition to research advances, this CRII project was meant to support research independence of junior faculty. In this case, related outcomes include:  New interdisciplinary partnerships with researchers in K?12 education.  Collaborations with researchers in other computer science areas, including but not limited to, human computer interaction and visualization.  Foundation for PI?s next stage of her research agenda. Strengthening PI?s mentoring and leadership skills, which constitute critical steps that will lead the PI into achieving research independence and building a research group specializing in identifying issues and proposing solutions related to information retrieval practices for children and other niche audiences.  Strengthening CS pipeline. As an underrepresented minority in computer science, the female, Hispanic PI recruited female and/or Hispanic undergraduate student researchers, mentored them in the proposed work, and expand their experience as future computer science professionals. All of these students are now at different stages of graduate school. Enhanced undergraduate and graduate curriculum. Class modules focused on service learning and algorithmic design for non-traditional users are now part of the Introduction to Information Retrieval and Advanced Information Retrieval classes at Boise State University.
