<AbstractNarration>Most information is communicated in the form of waves, and it is critical to carry out wave simulations to advance science and engineering disciplines. In fact, computational wave propagation has become a fundamental, vigorously growing technology in diverse disciplines ranging from radar, sonar, seismic imaging, medical imaging, submarine detection, stealth technology, remote sensing, and electronics to microscopy and nanotechnology. These fields and applications are of great strategic value in the petroleum industry, in medical imaging, and in materials science. One of the most challenging problems in computational wave propagation is how to carry out large-scale high frequency wave propagation efficiently and accurately.  This research project develops novel, fast numerical methods for high frequency wave propagation to tackle this long-standing challenge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will develop and implement new data-enabled fast Huygens sweeping methods for large-scale high-frequency wave modeling and imaging with big data sets motivated by industrial and military applications. The goal is to develop efficient and accurate sweeping methods for the Helmholtz and Maxwell equations in inhomogeneous media in the high frequency regime and in the presence of caustics. This project will foster breakthrough innovations in at least four theoretical and computational aspects: first, fast higher-order sweeping methods for computing Eulerian geometrical-optics ingredients, such as eikonals and amplitudes; second, butterfly-algorithm-based fast Huygens sweeping methods for large-scale high-frequency wave modeling and simulation; third, fast Huygens sweeping-imaging methods for big seismic data sets; and fourth, implementations of these new algorithms on a range of novel parallel-computing architectures. Data-enabled fast Huygens sweeping algorithms will be developed for the first time for these large-scale imaging applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under my current NSF support,  I have solved a long-standing problem for computing Green's functions of Maxwell's equations in inhomogeneous media in the high frequency regime.   V. M. Babich, who enjoys similar reputation as late Joseph Keller (an awardee of US National Medal of Science (1988)), wrote the following in Part V of PDEs in the Springer Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences,   ``Both the Hadamard expansion (28) and the expansion (24) are unique: similar expansions have NOT been written down for several general equations with variable coefficients (for example, for the dynamic equations of elasticity theory in the case of an inhomogeneous medium).''     I am pleased to report that we have not only written down such expansions for Maxwell's equations, but we have also developed fast algorithms to implement the expansion by using fast algorithms of numerical PDE tools, such as WENO and fast butterfly algorithms.  Our papers are published in SIAM Multiscale Modeling and Simulations.   Because electromagnetic waves are ubiquitous, such as wireless phones and antennas, our work is important for these applications.   In some applications, it is reasonable to assume that geodesics (rays) have a consistent orientation so that Maxwell's equations may be viewed as an evolution equation in one of the spatial directions. With such applications in mind, we propose a new Eulerian geometrical-optics method, dubbed the fast Huygens sweeping method, for computing Green's functions of Maxwell's equations in inhomogeneous media in the high-frequency regime and in the presence of caustics. The first novelty of the fast Huygens sweeping method is that a new dyadic-tensor-type geometrical-optics ansatz is proposed for Green's functions which is able to utilize some unique features of Maxwell's equations. The second novelty is that the Huygens-Kirchhoff secondary source principle is used to integrate many locally valid asymptotic solutions to yield a globally valid asymptotic solution so that caustics associated with the usual geometrical-optics ansatz can be treated automatically. The third novelty is that a buttery algorithm is adapted to carry out the matrix-vector products induced by the Huygens-Kirchhoff integration in O(N logN) operations, where N is the total number of mesh points, and the proportionality constant depends on the desired accuracy and is independent of the frequency parameter. To reduce the storage of the resulting traveltime and amplitude tables, we compress each table into a linear combination of tensor-product based multivariate Chebyshev polynomials so that the information of each table is encoded into a small number of Chebyshev coecients. The new method enjoys the following desired features: (1) it precomputes a set of local traveltime and amplitude tables; (2) it automatically takes care of caustics; (3) it constructs Green's functions of Maxwell's equations for arbitrary frequencies and for many point sources; (4) for a specied number of points per wavelength it constructs each Green's function in nearly optimal complexity O(N logN) in terms of the total number of mesh points N, where the prefactor of the complexity depends only on the specied accuracy and is independent of the frequency parameter. Three-dimensional numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the new method.
