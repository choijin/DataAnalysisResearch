<AbstractNarration>Cities directly influence the quality and quantity of water that moves through urban watersheds and to the human populations located downstream.  Though impacted by development, urban rivers and streams provide important ecosystem services, including drinking water and stormwater drainage to surrounding human populations.  However, urban rivers in developing economies, such as Mexico may be directly utilized by humans for sources of untreated drinking water, direct conduits for sewage, and freshwater fisheries.  To appropriately manage urban watersheds in these regions, it is important to understand how biological communities and biological processes are affected by increasing urbanization.  This proposal, the Mexican Urban Stream Ecology Collaboration (MUSE), will bring together group of stream ecologists, fish biologists, and students from the United States and Mexico to begin to understand the links among urbanization, stream ecology, and freshwater fisheries in southern Mexico.  The activities conducted in MUSE will provide the foundation for greater understanding of urban stream ecology and urban fisheries throughout the world and will initiate a new collaboration that will generate knowledge and resources for scientists, students, and natural resource managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urbanization is considered to be an important driver of global decline in the integrity of streams and rivers; yet, affected systems continue to provide essential ecosystem services including stormwater drainage, drinking water, and freshwater fisheries.  The influence of urbanization on the structure and trophic relationships of fishes and on the functional role of fishes in ecosystem processes is not well understood. Through MUSE, U.S. and Mexican researchers will begin to understand synergistic links among urbanization, biogeochemistry, and freshwater fisheries in southern Mexico.  Specifically, MUSE researchers will investigate the influence of urbanization on freshwater fish communities and energy and nutrient dynamics in the Usumacinta-Grijalva watershed in Chiapas and Tabasco, Mexico.  Through this project new scientific directions in urban ecology and tropical ecology will open for collaborating researchers and students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Catalyzing New International Collaborations program (CNIC) was designed to support the development of new international collaborations in order to initiate new directions of research for collaborating scientists and to support researchers in gathering pilot data to investigate new research questions. Our project, the Mexican Urban Stream Ecology (MUSE) collaboration, was designed to begin a new collaboration among researchers from four US institutions (The University of Maine, Texas Tech University, the University of Georgia, and Kansas State University) and Mexican partners from two institutions (El Colegio de la Frontera Sur in Villahermosa, Tabasco and in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The project supported multiple exchange trips to Mexico and led to the development of new research programs. Networking activities and site visits created transformative educational experiences for students, PIs, and senior personnel that led to discussions about new research projects in tropical and urban ecology and fisheries ecology. Activities supported through MUSE were also designed to contribute to the professional development of early career scientists by placing pre-tenure researchers in leadership roles within the new collaboration and to provide US undergraduate and graduate students with experience conducting international research and with new training in laboratory analysis. Through MUSE, several US-based undergraduate and graduate students experienced their first international research trips and a subset receive additional training in analytical chemistry and genetics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The collaboration was also designed to advance knowledge and understanding in urban stream ecology and urban fisheries by collecting pilot data to begin answering the following research questions:&nbsp;</p> <p><ol> <li>How does urbanization influence the trophic relationships and community structure of freshwater fishes in two climate regions in the Grijalva-Usumacinta basin?</li> <li>How does urbanization alter nutrient limitation and diel patterns in nutrient dynamics and dissolved oxygen in two climate regions within the Grijalva-Usumacinta basin?</li> <li>Does urbanization modify the functional role of freshwater fish communities in nutrient dynamics? If so, are these patterns spatially or temporally influenced by climate?</li> <li>Are there seasonal changes in diversity and abundance of yield in small-scale, urban fisheries?</li> </ol></p> <p>To begin addressing the questions, we collected fishes from 20 sites along land use gradients in the Grijalva and the Usumacinta Rivers. Dominant species were noted and up to five individuals from each species were sampled for carbon and nitrogen isotopes to understand more about their diet. During the field trips to Mexico, we also collected water chemistry data from 51 sites (20 overlapping with the fish data described above) in the Grijalva-Usumacinta. To address the fourth question, we visited 10 fishing collectives along the Usumacinta River and we conducted informal interviews to document changes in diversity and abundance of yield in the fisheries. Importantly, we documented that the only remaining official fishing collective in the Villahermosa, can no longer fish around the city due to pollution.&nbsp; We observed that fishing within the city limits is quite common, but it is not conducted in an official, organized capacity. Small groups of fishers--sometimes family groups--were found frequenting several fishing sites within the city, many of which were located around sewage discharge sites. Interestingly, the urban fishing groups were the only groups where women were commonly seen fishing with men.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>New projects have been initiated in the population dynamics and movement ecology of large bodied, migratory fishes, in metal contamination in urban fisheries, and in urban mosquito ecology. Multiple scientific presentations of data collected during MUSE activities have been given by the lead researchers to a variety of academic audiences. Moreover, several manuscripts have been published, submitted, or are being developed around the themes of this project or from the 2015-2016 field trips. Over the next few months, we will continue to analyze and interpret our data and we will publish the results from MUSE. The networking activities we experiences as part of MUSE also led to the development of additional grant proposals that either have been or will be submitted to granting institutions in the US and in Mexico.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/01/2016<br>      Modified by: Krista&nbsp;Capps</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1560813/1560813_10339579_1475364895337_1(2)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1560813/1560813_10339579_1475364895337_1(2)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Processing cichlid samples"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1560813/1560813_10339579_1475364895337_1(2)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Processing cichlid samples"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Drs.
