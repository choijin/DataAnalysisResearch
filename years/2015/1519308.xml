<AbstractNarration>This award provided support for the DIS2015 XXIII International Workshop on Deep-Inelastic Scattering and Related Subjects (DIS2015) to be held on the Southern Methodist Universiy campus, Dallas, TX during the period April 27-May 1, 2015.   The conference covers a large spectrum of topics in high energy physics. A significant part of the program is devoted to the most recent results from large experiments at major research laboratories in the United States and abroad.  Theoretical advances are included as well. The program is organized around seven working groups: Structure Functions and Parton Densities; Small-x, Diffraction and Vector Mesons; Electroweak Physics and Beyond the Standard Model; Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and Hadronic Final States; Heavy Flavors; Spin Physics; Future Experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has emerged as the premier venue for comprehensive discussions and debate between experimentalists and theorists. While the original DIS workshops had a strong emphasis on the Hadron Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA) based physics, the topics of the workshop have now branched out to include the recent Large Hadron Collier (LHC) physics as well as the US-based measurements at Fermilab in Illinois, JLab in Virginia and RHIC in New York. This meeting draws approximately 300+ scientists from across the globe to discuss the latest results. Recent meetings were held in Poland, France, Germany, Japan and Russia. The 2014 meeting hosted 265 talks with participants from 32 countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has generally been based in Europe and visits the US every few years. Therefore, hosting this meeting in the US represents a special opportunity for US-based students to be exposed to this breadth of topics and also the leaders in their field.  The group is making arrangements to allow students to participate in a cost-effective manner so as to expand the scope of participation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[DIS2015 International Workshop returns to the USA   In Spring 2015 the XXIII International Workshop on Deep-Inelastic Scattering and Related Subjects (DIS2015) took place at Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas Texas, USA. Recent workshops have been held in Poland, France, and Germany.  The workshop was held from 27 April to 1 May 2015 and included 250+ participants representing 30 countries presenting over 200 talks on assorted scattering subjects. The program reported on current developments in the area of High Energy Physics (HEP) including the latest experimental results, related theoretical topics, and future experimental opportunities.   The NSF support allowed researchers in the early stages of their academic careers (i.e. graduate students and postdocs) to attend the workshop and exchange ideas with peers from other institutions regarding the current status and future direction of this important area of research.   The workshop began with a full day of plenary reports on recent progress at both the experimental and theoretical frontiers. These excellent overview presentations stimulated extensive discussion and generated interest for the upcoming parallel talks. The following two and a half days of parallel talks,  were organized around seven themes: 1) structure functions and parton densities; 2) small-x, diffraction and vector mesons; 3) electroweak physics and beyond the Standard Model; 4) QCD and hadronic final states; 5) heavy flavors; 6) spin physics; and 7) future experiments.   PHYSICS TOPICS: A central topic of the meeting was the structure of the proton; this is critical for understanding many experimental results from the Fermilab Tevatron, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), the Jefferson Lab accelerator, and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These discussions were very timely, as improved knowledge of the proton will help with the analysis of the new LHC Run 2 data.   There were also extensive updates on the properties of the Higgs boson, as well as prospects for discovering new Higgs-like objects including proposed Supersymmetry particles. (Recall, the Higgs boson, discovered in 2012, was recognized with the 2013 Nobel Prize for physics.) Precision measurements from both RHIC and LHC experiments can also place constraints on new physics signatures, such as "dark photons."   On the heavy flavors frontier, we saw new improvements on theoretical calculations, matched by new experimental measurements from RHIC and LHC. Heavy flavor production is an incisive tool that probes many features of the strong interaction force; however, the heavy quark mass introduces an additional scale which complicates the theoretical calculations. Nevertheless, new techniques, clever ideas, and hard work have enabled us to make progress in this area.   The spin physics session had extensive presentations on HERMES and COMPASS data, as well as measurements from RHIC and Jefferson Lab experiments. This was complemented on the theoretical side by advances in the area of generalized Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) which can reconstruct the proton structure in 3 dimensions.   We also heard about future experiments, including the Jefferson Laboratory 12 GeV upgrade, the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF), the Electron-Ion-Collider (EIC), and the Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC). The combination of these projects would vastly extend our experimental reach to study matter from the lowest to highest energies and densities.   OUTREACH ACTIVITIES:  The workshop program made room for several outreach events, including a public lecture entitled "If the Universe is the answer, what is the question?" This presentation featured four workshop physicists discussing critically important unanswered physics questions that upcoming experiments might help resolve. The presentations were stimulating and thought provoking, and gave the local audience a non-technical glimpse ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
