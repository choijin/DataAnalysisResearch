<AbstractNarration>The Location Based Service (LBS) is one of the most popular types of applications in networking systems. As the name suggests, the success of a LBS application depends on two pipelined procedures: localization and information transmission. Unlike in relatively static networks, it is crucial to accomplish localization as early as possible in networks where users continually change their positions. This is to ensure that the targets' positions are still valid for LBS applications. In the environments, where GPS is not available (interfered, blocked, or destroyed), such as in battlefields, underwater, tunnels, and buildings, the current relative localization techniques are facing long localization delays, and this drawback cannot be overcome because of the nature of conventional localization requirements. Customers who have critical time requirements on location-based applications have to densely deploy anchor/reference nodes, which already know their locations, to reduce the localization time. However, the deployment of anchor/reference nodes is expensive, and it sometimes still cannot meet the critical time requirements. The proposed innovation, therefore, will provide solutions for those customers who have time-critical location based applications running in GPS free environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this I-Corps Teams project is to develop a feasible plan to commercialize the rapid localization techniques and develop a team to be capable of executing the plan. A team consisted of an academic researcher, a minority entrepreneurial lead, and an experienced minority and female industry mentor will closely work on business models, marketing, and seeking funding. The project intellectual merit lies in a novel design of the rapid localization platform. If successful, there will be a high-reward of applying the platform to many areas to improve their location based applications: availability, accuracy, integrity, and efficiency. The PI expects the market to be significant with revolutionary changes from existing ones and emerging new applications. The proposed innovation can be adopted by the industry and the military in their future designs and protocols for enhancing location-based services availability and integrity. The team expects the market to grow with revolutionary changes from existing applications and emerging new applications. The team will also keep improving/adjusting the technique while interviewing potential customers based on their feedbacks, needs, and data collected. The relevant products which may result from the proposed innovation may include protocols, systems, add-ons, licensing, and services.</AbstractNarration>
