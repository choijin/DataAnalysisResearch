<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, the Mines-UNC STEM Teacher Preparation Noyce Scholarship Program is recruiting undergraduate majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and preparing them to become grades 7-12 STEM teachers. The project is funding 18 scholarships and 30 internships over 5 years. In this project, Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and the University of Northern Colorado (UNC) are collaborating with Denver Public School District, Jefferson County School District, and St. Vrain Valley School District to educate and prepare STEM teachers. This project will: provide insight into how a partnership between a strong engineering school and a strong teacher education school can increase recruitment and retention of STEM majors who consider teaching as a profession; assess CSM students' perceptions of teaching as a profession; evaluate the impact of early support (e.g., mentoring and professional development seminars) on teacher retention; and, ultimately, meet the need for providing more highly-qualified STEM teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mines-UNC STEM Teacher Preparation Program is a unique partnership between CSM and UNC that offers a path toward secondary teaching licensure in science or math for CSM students. The program plays on the strengths of the two institutions to produce highly-educated graduates through an integrated program that is part of the students' undergraduate degree. CSM (a highly selective, small public research university) is fully responsible for STEM content preparation, while UNC (a strong teacher preparation institution) delivers the Professional Teacher Education Program. This project will add an important component to the teacher preparation program by making secondary teaching a more visible, accessible, and attractive career option for these students. The specific goals of this project are to: 1) increase the number of CSM graduates who become STEM teachers and teach in high-need school districts; 2) create early STEM education experiences for CSM students to encourage more to consider teaching of STEM subjects as a career; 3) provide ongoing mentoring and professional development support of STEM teachers during their induction year at high-need schools; 4) actively address ideas about teaching as a career to maintain a healthy supportive culture at CSM toward the profession; and 5) assess, disseminate, and sustain the best recruitment and retention practices.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, these professionals chose to enter the teaching field and completed secondary teacher licensure requirements through the University of Northern Colorado, the state?s premier teacher preparation institution.     The 20 Team-Up Noyce Scholars have the potential to collectively impact more than 2000 middle and high school students per year.     The Noyce teachers? high quality STEM preparation and creative lesson planning encourages secondary students to develop a STEM identity, to explore STEM careers, to prepare for further STEM training, and to consider teaching as a rewarding profession.     Noyce teachers enter the teaching profession with the skills and support to effectively teach STEM in the places that need it most. They will inspire and empower the next generation of students to have positive STEM identities.     Coursework and field experiences:  All TEAM-UP Noyce Scholars are prepared to effectively teach mathematics and science as well as integrated STEM courses. All TEAM-UP Noyce Scholars have gained experience in at least 3 different schools including both middle and high school experience. All TEAM-UP Noyce Scholars have experience in high needs schools prior to completing the program.      Individualized and Solutions-focused Induction Support for Noyce Teachers in their first two semesters of teaching:  Supporting students through pandemic schooling changes Supporting themselves through various wellness and self-care techniques Transitioning to online and hybrid teaching Transitioning back to full time classroom instruction post-pandemic restrictions Grading practices and policies specific to pandemic times Classroom management through relationship building and creative curriculum planning Parent and student rapport Alternative and individualized assessment Ways to sustain practice over the long term for a successful career trajectory All Noyce teachers received Lesson Planning with Purpose: Five Approaches to Curriculum Design (2020, Teachers College Press)           Last Modified: 08/13/2021       Submitted by: Christy M Moroye]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
