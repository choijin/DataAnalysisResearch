<AbstractNarration>Hypersaline environments such as the Great Salt Lake or the Dead Sea are ecosystems where salt concentrations are five to ten times higher than seawater. Despite these extreme conditions, the waters are teaming with salt loving microorganisms, "halophiles", which are adapted to these exceedingly briny habitats. Halophiles in all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya) and their viruses are the focus of "Halophiles 2016: The 11th International Congress on Halophilic Microorganisms May 22-27th, San Juan, Puerto Rico" (Conference website: http://www.halophiles2016.org/), which is a multidisciplinary and international conference for researchers working in this field. The mission of the Congress, which has met triennially since 1978, is to explore all aspects of microbiology in salt-enriched environments and to draw on expertise from numerous disciplines in order to facilitate quantum advances in understanding life in high salt ecosystems. The objective of NSF support for the Congress is to help provide students and early career researchers with access to this unique scientific gathering, especially those who are members of groups underrepresented in Science/Technology/Engineering/Mathematics (STEM) fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Halophiles conference series is the primary meeting that discusses halophilic microorganisms, and highlights halophile adaptations, ecology, geographic distributions, physiology, evolution, taxonomy, biochemistry, genetics, genomics, metagenomics, biotechnology, metabolic engineering, and bioremediation.  Attendees will be immersed for six days in this intellectual atmosphere, attending lectures given by highly respected and published researchers, and gaining a wide range of knowledge regarding the current, emerging and broad state of the halophile field.  Though the application process will be open to all, priority will go to qualifying undergraduate/graduate students and post-docs who are from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The International Halophile Congress has a long history of broadening participation in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Halophiles series of conferences is a multidisciplinary international congress, with a strong history of regular triennial meetings since 1978.  While focusing our mission on halophilic systems and organisms seemingly narrows our perspective, our scope is in fact tremendously broad through investigation of microorganisms from all three domains of life and viruses.  Our triennial meetings on hypersaline-focused studies provide exceptional and intimate opportunities for researchers to interact, and form collaborations with a diverse group of scientists and assorted data, from molecules to communities.  The objective of this proposal was to provide access for young US researchers to this unique scientific gathering in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with diverse speakers from all over the world. To this end, we wanted to increase the participation of US undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers by offering them travel grants to defray the cost of their expenses.  Broader Impacts of this funding was that priority went to qualifying undergraduate/graduate students and post-docs who are from groups underrepresented in STEM fields (Women, African American, Native American, Latina/o and Pacific Islander/ Native Hawaiian).  In total, 11 young researchers, all of whom gave oral or poster presentations of their research, had their expenses to attend the Halophiles 2016 conference reimbursed.  The student/post doctoral fellow breakdown was: one undergraduate, eight graduate students and two post doctoral fellows.  Underrepresented groups in STEM fields included four women, five Latino/a.  Only US citizens or permanent residents qualified for reimbursement.          Last Modified: 05/08/2017       Submitted by: R. Thane Papke]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
