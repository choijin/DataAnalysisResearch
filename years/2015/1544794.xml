<AbstractNarration>This project develops advanced cyber-physical sensing, modeling, control, and optimization methods to significantly improve the efficiency of algal biomass production using membrane bioreactor technologies for waste water processing and algal biofuel. Currently, many wastewater treatment plants are discharging treated wastewater containing significant amounts of nutrients, such as nitrogen, ammonium, and phosphate ions, directly into the water system, posing significant threats to the environment.  Large-scale algae production represents one of the most promising and attractive solutions for simultaneous wastewater treatment and biofuel production. The critical bottleneck is low algae productivity and high biofuel production cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous work of this research team has successfully developed an algae membrane bioreactor (A-MBR) technology for high-density algae production which doubles the productivity in an indoor bench-scale environment. The goal of this project is to explore advanced cyber-physical sensing, modeling, control, and optimization methods and co-design of the A-MBR system to bring the new algae production technology into the field. The specific goal is to increase the algal biomass productivity in current practice by three times in the field environment while minimizing land, capital, and operating costs. Specifically, the project will (1) adapt the A-MBR design to address unique new challenges for algae cultivation in field environments, (2) develop a multi-modality sensor network for real-time in-situ monitoring of key environmental variables for algae growth, (3) develop data-driven knowledge-based kinetic models for algae growth and automated methods for model calibration and verification using the real-time sensor network data, and (4) deploy the proposed CPS system and technologies in the field for performance evaluations and demonstrate its potentials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will demonstrate a new pathway toward green and sustainable algae cultivation and biofuel production using wastewater, addressing two important challenging issues faced by our nation and the world: wastewater treatment and renewable energy. It will provide unique and exciting opportunities for mentoring graduate students with interdisciplinary training opportunities, involving K-12 students, women and minority students. With web-based access and control, this project will convert the bench-scale and pilot scale algae cultivation systems into an exciting interactive online learning platform to educate undergraduate and high-school students about cyber-physical system design, process control, and renewable biofuel production.</AbstractNarration>

Currently, many wastewater treatment plants are discharging treated wastewater containing significant amounts of nutrients, such as nitrogen, ammonium, and phosphate ions, directly into the water system, posing significant threats to our environment. Finding a solution for effective treatment and safe discharge of wastewater has become an urgent and challenging task. Another grand challenge is non-fossil green energy sources which lie at the intersection of some of our nation?s most pressing issues: environment, energy security, and sustainable economic development. Large-scale algal cultivation and production has been recognized by the U.S. National Academy of Science and Department of Energy as one of the most promising and attractive solutions for simultaneous wastewater treatment and biofuel production. The critical bottleneck is low algae productivity and high biofuel production cost.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this project, we have explored how the cyber-physical concept can be applied to significantly improve the productivity of algae. Specifically, we have successfully developed a water-proof rugged multimodal sensor system which can immerse in waste water and work for a long period of time to monitor the light level, dissolved oxygen, temperature, CO2, and pH level of algae cultivation environment. All sensors are integrated into a Raspberry PI platform for sensor data capture and wireless transmission to an online server. We have improved the stability, robustness, and ruggedness of the system so that it can work effectively and continuously in the waste water outdoor. We explored various ways to fabricate hollow fiber membranes with the so-called self-cleaning characteristics so that they can work in the waste water for a long time to filter out algae without degrading its performance. Based on the continuous sensor data, our team has developed a set of computational models to characterize the correlation between algal productivity and major environmental variables, including lighting (both indoor and outdoor), CO2 level (including CO2 bubbling), and pH level. Based on these models, we were able to develop control methods to adaptively control the algae production process. We have obtained the full access to the Columbia Waste Water Treatment Plant and conducted a field test to evaluate the performance of our cyber-physical system. We have successfully demonstrated that, using this cyber-physical system sensing, modeling, and control technology, the algae production has been improved by approximated 50-55%.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project has provided a unique and exciting interdisciplinary research opportunity for training graduate and undergraduate students. It has supported 4 Ph.D students and three of them have already graduated. This project has also supported two undergraduate interns. Our students from electrical engineering, civil engineering, and chemical engineering worked closely together on various aspects of this project, including sensor system design, sensor calibration, algae growth monitoring, algae growth control, and data modeling. As a team, they collaborated closely to work with the local government agencies to obtain approvals, deploy system in the waste water plant, design data collection and study plans, and perform the experiments.</p> <p>We have published our results in top journal and conference papers. We have participated the 2016, 2017, 2018 Engineering Week in University of Missouri. We have demonstrated our projects to hundreds of middle and high school students who came to University of Missouri campus.

This project demonstrated a new pathway toward green and sustainable algae cultivation and biofuel production using wastewater, addressing two important challenging issues faced by our nation and the world: wastewater treatment and renewable energy.
