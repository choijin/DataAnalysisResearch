<AbstractNarration>Plants are defining components of natural ecosystems where they provide habitats for other organisms and influence the composition of soils and the atmosphere. Fungi, though less conspicuous, significantly affect the success of living plants in addition to breaking down dead matter. Fungi that live inside healthy plants, called fungal endophytes (hereafter simply endophytes), can benefit plants in many ways, including promoting growth, enhancing disease resistance, and increasing resilience to extreme conditions such as drought. Therefore, understanding how endophytes interact with their host plants is critical for managing wild ecosystems as well as increasing productivity in forestry and agriculture as plants respond to extreme weather in a changing climate. Endophytes have been found in nearly all plants sampled to date but there are few direct studies of the mechanisms behind their functions. This project investigates the diversity and functions of endophytes in a liverwort. This project will sample the diversity of endophytes in a model liverwort, Marchantia polymorpha, and investigate what factors influence this diversity. M. polymorpha grows well in the laboratory, so this project will directly test the effects of individual endophytes. Using genetic methods, the researcher will identify possible mechanisms behind the observed interactions. In addition, the study system developed in this project will provide many future opportunities for plant-endophyte interaction research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will collect Marchantia polymorpha plants from ten populations across the USA and characterize the diversity of the liverworts and their endophytes. Liverwort genotypes will be assessed using Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to sample sites throughout the genome. Internal fungal diversity will be sampled by surface sterilizing whole M. polymorpha plants, extracting total DNA, then amplifying and sequencing a fungal barcoding gene region. The researchers will test for correlations between fungal community diversity and composition, host genotypes, and population locations.  These data will provide an ecological context for previous experiments testing the effects of cultured endophytes on M. polymorpha in laboratory growth assays. To investigate the mechanisms behind the liverwort-endophyte interactions observed in the laboratory, the researchers will sequence the transcriptomes of the plant and selected fungi when grown alone and together. Four fungi will be used: a growth-enhancing fungus, a detrimental fungus, and close relatives of each which show a neutral interaction. Comparing the levels of gene expression between the treatments and controls will allow the researcher to form hypotheses about which cellular systems may be important in controlling the observed interactions.</AbstractNarration>

In this project, we focused on fungal endophytes, fungi that live inside healthy plant tissues. These fungi are important drivers of plant growth, competitiveness, and resistance to stress and disease. Understanding the diversity and effects of fungal endophytes on their host plants will contribute to agriculture and ecosystem conservation efforts. For this project, we developed an experimental system for studying fungal endophytes using the liverwort <em>Marchantia polymorpha, </em>a small plant belonging to the bryophytes (which also include mosses). This liverwort is a model species with a recently sequenced genome and its small size and ease of propagation in sterile culture make it a compact model well suited to microbial interaction studies. We surveyed the diversity of fungal endophytes in <em>M. polymorpha </em>across the United States, finding a diverse community distinct (but overlapping with) those known from flowering plants and conifers. With the experimental system we built for testing <em>M. polymorpha </em>responses to endophytic fungi grown in the lab, we revealed that endophytes can have a wide range of effects on <em>M. polymorpha&rsquo;s </em>growth, with some strongly promoting growth and others acting as pathogens. We then investigated what genes two species of <em>Marchantia </em>express when they interact with beneficial or pathogenic fungi. We anticipate that the results of this gene expression study will elucidate possible cellular mechanisms that liverworts use to control the growth of fungal symbionts and gain benefit from them as well as components of their immune responses. Since certain known genetic mechanisms for microbial interaction are known to be shared between bryophytes and other plants, we anticipate that our work in the compact <em>M. polymorpha </em>system will contribute to understanding of plant-fungal interaction more generally. The experimental system we developed has great potential in the growing field of plant microbiota research to answer questions that range in scale from molecular mechanisms to ecosystem function.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/27/2017<br>      Modified by: Jessica&nbsp;Nelson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501826/1501826_10360606_1511812789012_2015-07-3112.37.34--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501826/1501826_10360606_1511812789012_2015-07-3112.37.34--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Marchantia polymorpha"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501826/1501826_10360606_1511812789012_2015-07-3112.37.34--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Marchantia polymorpha"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Marchantia polymorpha, the plant used in this study as a model for plant-fungal interactions</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jessica Nelson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jessica&nbsp;Nelson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Marchantia polymorpha</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
