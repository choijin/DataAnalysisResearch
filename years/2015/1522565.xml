<AbstractNarration>Mendocino-Lake Community College District (Mendocino College) will develop a five-year strategic and infrastructure management plan for the Point Arena Field Station (http://www.mendocino.edu/coastal-field-station), a 15.2-acre oceanfront field station with seven buildings, located on the Northern California Coast. With 70+ years of limited public access, the field station sits within a relatively undisturbed natural coastal environment.  The management plan to be developed will be used to guide Mendocino College in preserving the pristine habitats for scientific study and research, as well as increasing access and use of the Point Arena Field Station, making it more broadly available to researchers and educators in the region and nationally.  This planning proposal includes a focused educational workshop which will identify educational needs of students at both Mendocino College and other institutions. It is the intent of the institution to deliver educational programs to all, including under-represented groups. In 2013, Mendocino College was identified as a Hispanic Servicing Institution (HSI). This planning proposal will also address the needs of the increasing women in STEM disciplines along with evaluating ADA access at the field station. Another key educational component to be addressed in the planning proposal is the identification and evaluation of collaborative STEM programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed planning activities include four specific areas: 1) Determine and develop best practices for management and operations of a field station by visiting established facilities and talking with station managers.  2) Identify and develop partnerships with 4 year universities and non-profit organizations by administering a survey to assess interest in facility use by appropriate educators and researchers.  3) Conduct focused planning sessions with educators, scientists, students and community members to determine general research and teaching goals, as well as best facility use practices.  4) Develop a comprehensive management plan that will focus on increasing access to and use of the Point Arena Field Station. The management plan will allow for the continued development and exploration of activities and collaborations that will address the needs of educators, scientists, students, and community members both regionally and nationally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mendocino-Lake Community College District (Mendocino College) was granted NSF-FSML planning grant #1522565 for 2015-2016.  Science faculty at the college scheduled numerous opportunities throughout the year to introduce the field station to key researchers and educators, to get local community and organizations excited about it, and to obtain direct feedback from advisors and consultants regarding its condition and potential.  The intent of the associated activities was to provide Mendocino College with the resources to develop a strategic and infrastructure management plan for the Mendocino College Coastal Field Station (MCCFS).  Our work involved visits to other field stations, the exploration of potential partnerships with 4 year universities and non-profit organizations, and a number of brainstorming workshops focused on educational and research directions for our field station and to summarize best practices for facility operations.  Our planning efforts also included key contractor and building consultant evaluations of the facilities and a management workshop to help define critical administrative needs.   Bringing the facilities and management information together with the educational and research components, we have outlined our Mission and Vision for the MCCFS and defined Goals and Objectives for the next five years to highlight the educational and research program directions we believe are achievable by Mendocino College. We have incorporated pertinent workshop information into a facilities infrastructure improvement guide that outlines the prioritization of field station needs and gives general costs and a timeline for addressing the necessary deferred maintenance, renovation and improvement work.  The education, research, management and facilities components have been integrated to create a Comprehensive Strategic Master Plan for the Mendocino College Coastal Field Station.  The remaining step will be to finalize the business portion of our Comprehensive Strategic Master Plan and to move the document through the approval process at Mendocino College.  The complete business plan will introduce expected ongoing maintenance and operations costs and incorporate potential funding sources, including the important relationship with the non-profit affiliate of our Mendocino College Foundation, the Friends of the Mendocino College Coastal Field Station and Natural Sciences.  Through our outreach networking over the last year, the uniqueness of the MCCFS for education and research activities was highlighted at every opportunity: It has a relatively pristine intertidal zone and 15 acres of mostly natural coastal prairie; it is the last research station on the west side of the San Andreas fault; its location is key for regional education and research in generally rural Northern California; and the college property is surrounded by the California Coastal National Monument to the east and marine protection areas offshore.  Numerous organizations and institutions are now aware of the field station and some, including the United States Geological Survey, the University of Texas Department of Geology, and the biology and geology departments at Humboldt State University, are excited to make plans to utilize the facilities in the near future.  Others have recently utilized the facility for the first time, or have scheduled use for the very near future, namely UC Santa Cruz PISCO researchers, UC NRS supercourse field program, and the non-profit Reef Check California and Pacific Manta Research Group.   The De Novo Group utilized the field station for a recent Technology and Infrastructure for Emerging Regions field meeting, and they have brought high speed WiFi to the field station through their FurtherReach.Net program.  Representatives of the ongoing research efforts at the facility, UC Davis Bodega Marine Lab?s CODAR and UNAVCO?s PBO GPS systems, have been able to make contact with this organization through Mendocino College to consider this internet service for their needs as well.   We have identified many other potential collaborators, and first contact has already been made with the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, the Bureau of Land Management, and local contingents of the California Native Plant Society, California Naturalist Program, the Audubon Society, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, and the Point Arena Gateway Group.  Mendocino College will build on the critical foundation we have developed through this NSF-supported work in order to finalize our Comprehensive Strategic Master Plan, seek funding, and begin renovation and remodeling of the existing facilities.  The Comprehensive Strategic Master Plan will be our blueprint for operation of the Mendocino College Coastal Field Station in the years to come. With both 1-year and 2-5 year goals identified, we anticipate immediate increased use of the Mendocino College Coastal Field Station by a broad spectrum of educators, scientists, students and community members.
