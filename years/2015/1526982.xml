<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Vassar College  will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The instrument will allow research in different areas including the synthesis of materials of potential commercial interest such as of carbon nanotubes, fullerenes and small molecules which are potential precursors to pharmaceuticals. Areas of biochemical interest such as the biosynthesis of lipids will be investigated. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by students at Vassar College, Marist College, SUNY New Platz and other undergraduate institutions in the area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research especially in areas such as (a) characterizing glycerophospholipid structures; (b) investigating titanium-mediated asymmetric imine alkylation; (c) charactering pyrrolidine substituted fullerenes; (d) developing biodegradable polyanhydride materials; and (e) studying C-Shaped diastereomers containing cofacial thiophene-substituted quinoxaline rings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the acquisition of a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer for use by students and faculty to support teaching and research with undergraduate students.  The acquired instrumentation modernized our capabilities with this analytical method, a method central to characterizing the structure of molecules, in both classroom teaching and in support of a variety of research programs.     Several research programs were advanced through access to this instrumentation at Vassar College as well as Marist College, a nearby predominantly undergraduate institution.  Research projects that focus on the determination of the three-dimensional structure of molecules, including small biological molecules and polymer precursors, were published in peer-reviewed journals or presented at national scientific meetings.  All of these projects directly involved undergraduate researchers collecting data on the instrument.  In addition, data from the instrument were critical for more than 15 senior thesis projects during the funding period.    The instrument has had a major impact on teaching as students from sophomore-level organic chemistry classes collect and analyze data from the instrument.  This has resulted in upper-level chemistry and biochemistry students who are empowered, capable users of the instrument and have developed the ability to analyze and apply the data to answer their research questions.  In total more than 100 students each year are learning with the instrumentation through classroom work.         Last Modified: 11/29/2018       Submitted by: Joseph M Tanski]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
