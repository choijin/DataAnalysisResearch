<AbstractNarration>CBET 1508415 &lt;br/&gt;Bibby &lt;br/&gt;CBET 1507285 &lt;br/&gt;Haas &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAPID: Collaborative Research: Survival of Ebola virus in the Water Environment: Surrogate Development and Disinfection Effectiveness&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little is known about the fate of Ebola virus and its survival in the environment.  Infection in primates has been observed from non-direct contact, raising further the possibility of an environmental infection route. As an initial phase of this RAPID, Ebola virus surrogates, based upon the published data of Ebola virus survival in liquid media, will be developed.  Second, the survival of these surrogates will be evaluated in environmental waters (including water and wastewater) and in the presence of water and wastewater disinfectants. This work will be valuable to the broader environmental, public health, and risk assessment communities by providing access to realistic surrogates with which studies (e.g. aerosol and fomite survival studies) may be conducted. The proposed RAPID mechanism is appropriate to inform proper waste handling in a timely manner. This work will also serve to mobilize and inform a response to proper waste handling. Given limited BSL4 access, this approach is the most reasonable response in the near term to inform Ebola virus survival in the water environment, and subsequent risk assessment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental work on this project will be conducted at the University of Pittsburgh. Data and statistical analysis will be conducted at Drexel University. The proposed research will benefit society through informing proper handling of Ebola virus contaminated waste. The proposed work will be disseminated broadly through journal publications and conference proceedings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will fill in an existing knowledge gap in the survival and proper handling of Ebola virus contaminated waste. This research will also develop and verify surrogates that may be used by the broader environmental engineering and public health research communities for Ebola virus survival studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the onset of the outbreak of Ebolavirus in West Africa, we reviewed previous guidance on the handling of patient waste.  There had been statements that the virus was highly fragile in the water environment, and therefore disposal of patient excreta to the normal hospital wastewater stream (in developed countries) would be appropriate.  These statements did not appear to be founded upon well developed science, therefore this project was undertaken to examine the environmental persistence of Ebolavirus and potential surrogates in the water and wastewater environment. In collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh, we reviewed the literature onpersistence of Ebola, and analyzed the survival kinetics compared to other viruses in water. We worked with colleagues at the NIH Rocky Mountain Laboratory to generate new data on Ebola persistence (at Rocky Mountain) and we analyzed the resulting data.  To date, we have published two papers, with additional work under review.  Key findings include:  The persistence of Ebolavirus in water and sewage does not appear to be qualitatively different than other viruses examined -- days to over a week for disappearance Chlorine treatment of raw wastewater may afford a means to reduce the amount of Ebolavirus in patient waste prior to discharge to a sewer system   This work has formed the portion of the thesis of an MS student at Drexel University, and he has gone on to professional practice.  We have communicated the results of this work at professional meetings, in journal articles, and via personal communications and conference calls to environmental engineering and public health practitioners, and also to personnel from CDC and US EPA.
