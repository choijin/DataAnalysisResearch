<AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the aftermath of Procter &amp; Gamble's voluntarily recall of Rely tampons, due to the product's deadly association with Toxic Shock Syndrome. It focuses on the ways in which policy developed to warn women about the dangers of tampons in general and super-absorbent tampons in particular. The project has three core research questions. How were standards concerning materials testing for tampon absorbency established; how did various stakeholders, including corporations, federal agencies, and health advocacy groups, work to shape policy about tampon use; and how were warnings about risk conceptualized in light of absorbency standards? To answer these questions, the PI will engage in archival research at the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women, Harvard University; specifically, she will focus on the library's collection of the papers of Esther Rome, a women's health advocate for tampon safety and founder of the Boston Women's Health Book Collective. The results of this research will be of interest STS scholars, particularly those engaged in research on feminist science and women-centered technology, and more broadly. They will also be of interest to health care professionals and experts in health care policy. In addition, they will have wide appeal to women, who are deeply interested in narratives of personal health and the impact of techno-science on their bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance knowledge in a number of overlapping fields including gender and women's studies, science and technology studies, history of medicine, history of science, and history of technology. It contributes the new framework of "biocatalytic technology" defined as technologies that are not primarily dangerous to humans, but have the potential to catalyze microbial activity that may result in harm through their use. The framing of biocatalytic technology helps to interpret, analyze and understand micro-biotechnological interfaces. This research conceptualizes the body as an ecological space and historicizes relationships of emergent technology, gender, and microbial constituents. It exemplifies the need for different voices in the lab, and not only women scientists but also invested publics. It calls upon medical practitioners to understand the effects of material objects, and the unexpected influence they may have not only on bodies but also upon microbial ecosystems as well.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 1980, Procter &amp; Gamble voluntarily withdrew Rely tampons from stores, sparing itself from an official FDA recall due to the tampon?s deadly association with Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS).  Toxic Shock Syndrome was linked to so-called "super absorbent" tampons and the CDC recommended that women use the lowest absorbency possible, yet product labels were unclear and varied among brands so that following this advice was difficult.  This historical research examines the relationship of tampon technology to illness, and the mobilization efforts to stem TSS through the establishment of absorbency standards.  It utilizes archival documents to trace the work of the Tampon Task Force, composed of corporate representatives, consumer advocates, and women's health activists, and charged by the FDA to negotiate guidelines to set federal policy concerning absorbency standards. Women needed accurate information in the form of absorbency labeling to compare tampons across categories and amongst different manufacturers, but the stakeholders on the task force disagreed about the lab methods, data gathering, and how standards would be articulated through labeling on tampon boxes.  Esther Rome, a women?s health advocate and founder of the Boston Women?s Health Book Collective who served on the Tampon Task Force, sought out other scientists to help since the consumer advocates did not have their own labs like the corporations, and proprietary data was not always shared equally with them.  Rome challenged lab practices in tampon testing, in particular the utilization of blue saline solution rather than menstrual fluid to yield data concerning product absorbency. She recruited nursing professor Nancy Reame, from the University of Michigan, who provided alternative testing models and data by using heparinized blood.  This affected the absorptive capacity of tampons differently than saline and altered the scale by which absorbency was based, though the task force did not heed the results on the whole.  Nonetheless, women's health advocates sought to build a data set more accurately reflecting their bodily experiences in an effort to minimize new cases of tampon-related TSS.     Intellectual Merit  This project contributes to literatures of gender and technology, histories of women?s health, and histories of technology and disease.      Broader Outcomes  This historical research exemplifies the dynamic relationship between medicine and society, and the benefits of women?s health activism in shaping policies about menstrual management technologies, which in turn reduce incidents of TSS.
