<AbstractNarration>Goldenrods are a widespread, yet taxonomically challenging group of plants with an estimated 150 species that mainly live in North America. Previous attempts to determine how many species there are and how they are related have failed because of the large number of potential species involved, extensive hybridization among these species, and the seemingly recent evolutionary divergence of species within the group. The limited understanding of goldenrod biodiversity has slowed progress in plant evolutionary ecology.  Goldenrods have emerged as a critical study system for many important processes including species formation, invasive species biology, nutrient cycling in soils, and pollination biology. This research will reconstruct evolutionary relationships in the group by using large amounts of DNA sequence data. Project participants, including three undergraduate researchers, will sample tissue from specimens representing all 150 putative goldenrod species under the guidance of a project collaborator who is the global expert on goldenrod taxonomy. This approach will allow the genealogy of this large genus to be reconstructed rapidly and economically, and will provide an essential evolutionary framework for other goldenrod researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will employ an anchored phylogenomics approach to capture DNA sequence data from 1200 locations across the genome of goldenrods (Solidago, Asteraceae). Multiple samples from each species will be obtained exclusively from herbarium specimens, which have been shown to harbor DNA of sufficient quantity and quality for this genomic technique. Sampling will focus on the &gt;4200 Solidago herbarium specimens for which the research team and collaborators have previously obtained a chromosome count, with the cytotype of additional samples estimated using a highly-accurate microsatellite allele number approach. Both diploids-only and combined diploid/polyploid species trees will be reconstructed in order to establish both divergent and reticulate evolutionary events. Phylogenetic, taxonomic, and methodological results stemming from this research will be disseminated in scientific journals and more broadly through a Solidago-focused website maintained by a project collaborator.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ DNA sequence data is a powerful tool for establishing the diversity of life on earth and the evolutionary relationships among species.  These data are increasing easy to get on a large scale, from hundreds of thousands of base pairs per sample to complete genomes.  However, most biologists are still limited by their access to samples- if you don?t have tissue to extract DNA from it doesn?t matter how much you can sequence.  Fieldwork is expensive, extremely time consuming, and many species are rare or otherwise legally protected.  A powerful alternative strategy is to extract DNA from preserved specimens of plants and animals in museums.  In order to test this strategy, in this study we attempted to obtain three kids of commonly used genomic datasets from museum specimens from the plant genus Solidago, the goldenrods.  This approach worked well, and we were able to get three different large datasets from goldenrod specimens, largely regardless of how long ago the specimen had been collected or the level to which its DNA had been fragmented.  Although analysis of the full dataset is complex and ongoing, preliminary data suggest that we will be able to fully understand Solidago biodiversity and evolutionary history with these data.  This success has large implications for the scope of research into plant diversity and evolution.  Millions of plant museum specimens are available worldwide, representing time, space, form, function, and ecology.  The ability to compare the genomes of these specimens is a huge step forward.  We were also determined to provide cutting edge research opportunities for undergraduates at Wichita State University, an institution at which no genomics and bioinformatics had been performed.  This project provided training for the project Principal Investigator and 6 female undergraduate students.  The undergraduate researchers were all new to research.  These experiences included museum work alongside a taxonomic expert, DNA extraction, DNA quantification, genomic library preparation, morphological analysis, and bioinformatics.  These experiences also provided the expertise needed for the project Principal Investigator to incorporate genomics and bioinformatics into his STEM teaching.
