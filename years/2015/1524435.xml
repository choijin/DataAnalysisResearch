<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funding for a postdoctoral researcher to study how the character of thunderstorms changes during the transition from day to night.  During the day, thunderstorms feed off of the solar heating of the ground and are referred to as surface-based.  When the sun sets and the ground begins to cool, the air flow into the thunderstorms becomes elevated and the thunderstorms often consolidate into a larger complex known as a mesoscale convective system (MCS).  Computer models do not capture this transition well and forecasting of whether an MCS will form and how long it may survive becomes very difficult.  This study will make use of both numerical modeling and observations to study the transition.  The research should provide forecasters with more information about these hazardous nocturnal events which can contain severe winds and flooding rains.  The researcher also would like to connect with other colleagues to determine how the public interprets forecasts for these types of events with an eye towards improving overall public safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher plans to improve basic understanding of the dynamics of the nocturnal transition of convection through a series of numerical modeling experiments and analysis of high-resolution field observations.  Two main research questions will be addressed:  1) How do increasing planetary boundary layer stability, increasing low-level jet strength, and increasing low-level lift along the terminus of the low-level jet influence upscale growth and behavior of convection during nocturnal transition and 2) Do field observations of nocturnal transitioning MCSs corroborate the results from numerical experiments?  The researcher will perform idealized numerical experiments to address the first question and then follow-up with analysis of data from the Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) field campaign.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organized clusters of thunderstorms are known as Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs).  MCSs are capable of producing damaging winds, hail, tornadoes, and flash flooding.  Despite their impact on society, certain aspects of MCS behavior are poorly understood and difficult to predict.  This research sought to address several poorly understood aspects of MCS behavior.  This research improved our understanding of (1) why MCSs stall and produce excessive rainfall, and (2) what causes tornadic thunderstorms to transition into MCSs in the evening in some instances, but not others.  We used this improved understanding to show how low-level moisture errors in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models lead to errors in the predicted placement of MCSs by these models.  We also found that the behavior of tornadic thunderstorms is remarkably sensitive to small variations in the lower atmospheric temperature.   Finally, we published a climatology of instances where tornadoes and flash floods threaten the same place at the same time.  The results of our work has the potential to increase weather forecaster awareness of the processes that are responsible for supercell and MCS behavior.  This work also established collaborative relationships between scientists at Colorado State University, North Carolina State University, and the Naval Postgraduate School.  Finally, this work provided an educational opportunity for a Research and Experiences for Undergraduates intern, who participated in key aspects of our analysis.
