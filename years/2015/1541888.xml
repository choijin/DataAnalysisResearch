<AbstractNarration>1541888 (Reardon). This workshop addresses Food-Energy-Water (FEW) nexus challenges in energy. Discussions will cover FEW issues in two key energy sectors, unconventional oil and gas production, and biofuels production, before expanding out to evaluate general research needs related to sustainable energy. The workshop participants will include basic researchers and those with in-the-field experience so that the issues identified are of practical significance. Both technical and social science perspectives are incorporated in the agenda. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge of providing food, energy, and water in the future is characterized by a complex, dynamic network of interactions. Solutions to these nexus problems must therefore evolve from a systems-level understanding. Numerous FEW issues are encountered in energy, including competition for water between food and energy conversion, energy industry impacts on water quality for food production, and competition for resources (land, nutrients, and water) between biofuel and food production. Addressing these nexus issues is essential for moving toward sustainable energy. The workshop will include expertise and viewpoints from across the nation and will engage subject experts in a focused discussion of the state of understanding of the multidimensional FEW challenges in energy; current tools derived from physical science, technology, and social science for addressing these challenges; and identification of needed research and development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The workshop, Food-Energy-Water Nexus Issues in Energy, was held in Arlington, VA on December 7-8, 2015. The goal of the workshop was to explore and define the underlying science and engineering that must be advanced to facilitate better approaches to sustainable energy. It also sought to explore new technologies that would promote economically viable recovery and recycling of irrigation water and produced water at various points in the energy and food systems.  The challenge of providing food, energy, and water (FEW) in the future is characterized by a complex, dynamic network of interactions. Solutions to these nexus problems must therefore evolve from a systems-level understanding. Numerous FEW issues are encountered in energy, including competition for water between food and energy conversion, energy industry impacts on water quality for food production, and competition for resources (land, nutrients, and water) between biofuel and food production. Addressing these nexus issues is essential for moving toward sustainable energy, especially in semi-arid regions. The workshop included expertise and viewpoints from 49 attendees from across the nation, including leading researchers and practitioners (from academia, industry, government, and private non-profit laboratories), students, and government officials. These attendees brought perspectives from the sciences, engineering, and social sciences.  Presentations by subject matter experts were followed by focused discussions in three subgroups assessing the state of understanding of the multidimensional FEW challenges in energy. The deliberations of these subgroups led to recommendations for near-term and longer-term actions. Summaries of the key recommendations are:  As with any FEW nexus issue, using systems approaches is critical for identifying, quantifying, and solving the resource conflicts that arise in the production of energy.  Very often, water is the main resource for which production and processing of energy and food compete.  Better models that explicitly incorporate this linkage are needed, including consideration of low-quality waters. Finding solutions to energy issues at the FEW nexus also requires deep collaboration with social scientists.  Technical solutions need input from policy makers, decision makers, and the public, who similarly need technical information to understand options. Biofuels have the potential to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels but must be produced in a way that does not draw critical resources from food production.  That requires development of biomass feedstocks with reduced water and nutrient inputs, and conversion technologies that use less water.  Decision support tools must be developed to find optimal land and resource use. Treated produced water from the production of natural gas by hydraulic fracturing has the potential to offset agricultural water consumption and represents a rare opportunity for synergism between energy and food production.  This requires research and activities to overcome technical, economic, and social challenges.    A website for the workshop, including speaker presentation materials, can be found at https://vprnet.research.colostate.edu/FEW/nsf-workshop/          Last Modified: 07/08/2016       Submitted by: Kenneth F Reardon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
