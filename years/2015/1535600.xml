<AbstractNarration>The Fourth Amendment of the United States protects against unreasonable searches and seizures; the question of whether a search violates the Fourth Amendment hinges on whether the individual searched had a subjective expectation of privacy that society is willing to recognize as reasonable. Expectations of privacy can be impacted by current events (such as the 2013 NSA surveillance scheme leaks), increased use of technology and digital communication, or even individual differences such as age or generation effects. The current research examines how expectations of privacy develop through adolescence and adulthood and whether this development is due to a "generation gap" in use and familiarity with digital communications or due to developmental changes in risk taking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research uses cross-sectional surveys to examine how reasonable expectations of privacy differ among various age groups. In addition, an in-lab study will test whether Steinberg's (2010) Dual Systems Model of Adolescent Risk-Taking can explain differences between adolescents' and adults' expectations of privacy in on-line communications.  The proposed research will integrate three bodies of research (lay adults' reasonable expectations of privacy, adolescent decisionmaking, and privacy- protecting behaviors in on-line communications) to examine how reasonable expectations of privacy differ across the lifespan. The findings of the proposed research can help inform courts and attorneys how expectations of privacy are changing with advances in technologies. The current standard courts use to evaluate whether a search was protected by the Fourth Amendment (examining both subjective and objective expectations of privacy) may prove to be increasingly difficult for courts to administer as technology continues to develop. The current research aims to provide evidence of whether that standard adequately protects Fourth Amendment rights.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research in the grant "Doctoral Dissertation Research: Expectations of Privacy: Development, Digital Natives, and Online Information Management" investigated how lay people?s expectations of privacy are related to age, decision-making, and experience with electronic communication devices. The Fourth Amendment only protects against government intrusions into spaces or information that receive a reasonable expectation of privacy&mdash;a subjective expectation of privacy that society is willing to recognize as reasonable.  Judges are tasked with determining when a reasonable expectation of privacy exists.  But as evidenced by justices? confusion at oral arguments in recent Supreme Court cases, judges do not always fully grasp new technology.  Scholars have expressed concern over the impact the ubiquity of wired communications may have on our expectation of privacy.  Additionally, because our decision-making capacities do not fully develop well into adulthood, increased impulsivity and sensation seeking may impact how younger individuals evaluate expectations of privacy.  A series of three studies examined the role age, experience with wired communications, and developmental decision-making play in expectations of privacy.  In Study 1, we compared adolescents? expectations of privacy to judicial decisions of whether a search violated the Fourth Amendment.  Consistent with prior research on lay adults? expectations, adolescent participants agreed with judges on extreme violations of privacy, but there are significant disagreement about several types of searches. Study 2 asked participants to evaluate the privacy implications of various searches and examined whether these perceptions vary as a function of age, experience with social networking sites, impulsivity, or sensation seeking.  While intrusiveness ratings of searches increased as participants? age and scores on a sensation seeking scale increased, the ratings were not related to a measure of impulsivity.  However, as impulsivity increased, so did the amount of information participants self-reported sharing on their social media profile.  Finally, Study 3 measured adolescent and young adult participants? perception of the risk of sharing information online as participants create a profile on a "new" social networking site.  Participants did not appear to view the decision to share information as a risk and the amount of information shared publicly was not related to age, experience with social networking sites, or developmental decision-making.  This research was the first to examine how expectations of privacy differ with age, experience, and decision-making.  Consistently in all three studies, participants of all ages viewed information shared electronically as highly private and searches of that information as very intrusive.  This research extended research on adolescent decision-making, particularly Steinberg?s (2010) Dual Systems Model of Adolescent Risk Taking, to decisions regarding privacy rights in online information.  Impulsivity in particular was related to self-reported online information sharing but was not related to ratings of searches. This may be due to the different nature of the tasks.  Rating searches is a cold, deliberative task that does not implicate the same emotional arousal as a hot task such as the decision to share information online.  These results have broader impacts for courts evaluating expectations of privacy and policy makers seeking to protect privacy interests.  Courts may want to consider the importance individuals place on cell phones, computers, and other electronic devices in sharing information. Courts may need to consider the applicability of the reasonable expectations of privacy test in a world that is constantly "wired in."  Additionally, policy makers may want to consider how to make individuals more aware of the privacy implications of sending information and how best to encourage deliberative decisions when sharing information online. Finally, the grant provided scientific research training opportunities to both undergraduate and graduate research assistants, many of whom were from groups underrepresented in the scientific community.
