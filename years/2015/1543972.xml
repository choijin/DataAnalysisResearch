<AbstractNarration>The PI team from University of Oklahoma, University of Delaware, Ohio Wesleyan University, Colorado State University, Unity College, University of Nebraska at Omaha, and San Diego State University has received an award through the Research Coordination Network - Undergraduate Biology Education (RCN-UBE) program to hold a conference entitled RCN-UBE Summit: Learning from the Community of Education Networks.  The conference assembles the key personnel from awards of the Research Coordination Network-Undergraduate Biology Education (RCN-UBE) in Washington, DC, early in 2016.  Projects funded through this program contribute both to the discipline of biology and to the education of undergraduate biology students; they bring together faculty who would not normally collaborate but who communicate and interact in a variety of newly established networks.  This conference of key project personnel is the first time that representatives of all RCN-UBEs have met to exchange information about successful strategies used to advance biology and biology education across America.  The summit attendees will include the Principal Investigators of all RCN-UBE projects (22 of the 38 PIs are women), the co-Principal Investigators of all full RCN-UBEs, as well as key network faculty from under-represented groups and faculty from institutions with a highly diverse student population.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first RCN-UBE awards were made in 2009, and there is now a critical mass of projects to warrant a meeting of Principal and co-Principal investigators to share insights, results, and recommendations with each other and the NSF about the formation and work of these undergraduate biology education networks.  The summit provides a formal way for personnel to discuss issues related to network management, organization, sustainability, and product dissemination.  In particular, this face-to-face meeting is important to current and future projects in order to sustain successful components of projects, how to initiate and cultivate networks of science faculty, and how to promote maximum participation from a diversity of biologists.   This award is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On January 14-16, 2016, a Summit meeting was held at the headquarters of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington, D.C. for representatives from all of the projects awarded by the NSF Research Coordination Networks for Undergraduate Biology Education (RCN-UBE) program.  The RCN-UBE program made the first awards in 2009 to catalyze positive changes in undergraduate biology and biology education.  Seven Principal Investigators of other RCN-UBE projects organized this NSF-funded Summit.  Sixty-five scientists and science educators from 38 of the 41 RCN-UBE awards attended the Summit, which highlighted each of the projects in a poster session and during selected talks.  The 41 projects have used a diverse group of strategies to improve different aspects of biology and biology education.  Summit participants discussed the issues that were common to all of the projects and possible solutions to those problems raised by network organizers.  This was the first time that all of the projects of the RCN-UBE program had an opportunity to exchange ideas about what makes networks successful, to learn about each other's work, and to identify how the RCN-UBE program has made a positive impact on the biology education reform effort across the U.S.  In addition, participants shared experiences regarding network development and growth and presented best practices and challenges faced in network management.  Five of the eleven characteristics of successful networks identified at the Summit were:  1) the possession of shared goals and visions among members of a network; 2) regular and effective communication among members; 3) the creation of an environment in which all members feel comfortable to exchange and discuss issues and ideas; 4) the essentiality of face-to-face meetings that allow members to begin collaborations and form working relationships; and 5) having a point person to keep the group going and who sets deadlines and maintains a timeline for the entire group.  Summit participants felt that their interactions with colleagues at the January meeting were highly valuable; all participants met new colleagues, and many developed nascent collaborations.  These new collaborations were cultivated at the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Undergraduate Biology Education Research in July of 2017.  In addition, at the GRC meeting, the PI and co-PIs of the Summit award met and completed a survey that will be used to elicit additional information from RCN-UBE PIs.  The RCN-UBE community aims to distribute knowledge about excellent biology and STEM education activities, practices, and resources to stakeholders in the public, private, and policy-making sectors.  As was anticipated, the RCN-UBE Summit began the formation of a large network of networks.  Systematically sharing information about which network strategies work and which do not, which occurred at the Summit, is an essential benefit of networking across all RCN-UBE communities that needs to be sustained.
