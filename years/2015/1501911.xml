<AbstractNarration>The significant use of social media has transformed the lives of students.  The project investigates the effectiveness of social media strategies in the construction of messages and platforms using best practices from business and research in service of the recruitment of students into advanced technological fields in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  The project draws on established partnerships and the results from prior NSF-funded projects.  Specifically, the project builds on a robust partnership between the Education Development Center (EDC) and National Convergence Technology Center (CTC) to develop and test a model and materials that will enable a selected set of ATE centers and projects to construct and implement social media strategies based on best practices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analytic and qualitative study addresses the need for ATE centers and projects to use to the full potential of social media, associated technologies, and strategies to recruit students into advanced technological fields in STEM fields.  A set of well defined and vetted social media strategies provide the backbone of this effort.  A pre/post research design tests the effectiveness of messages and the different social media platforms using a set of data analytics and tools that measure traffic, use, time spent, and audience engagement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Education Development Center (EDC), in partnership with the National Convergence Technology Center?s Convergence College Network, led this exploration into the feasibility and potential effectiveness of social media as a recruitment tool.  The project paired faculty leaders of technical programs at three colleges-El Centro Community College (TX), Polk State College (FL) and the University of North Texas (UNT)- with social media subject matter experts (SMEs) who helped each college to design a recruitment strategy built upon social media best practices.  Each college then ran their campaigns in advance of the Fall, 2016 semester and the Spring, 2017 semester.  The social media SMEs provided periodic technical assistance to the faculty leaders who were charged with implementing their school?s social media campaign.

Their analysis of the recruitment campaigns were presented in a report whose major findings included:       1)    Regarding the key question guiding the research- What impact does the implementation of a best practice social media recruitment strategy have on student enrollment in ATE programs?- the results were inconclusive. Between the three schools, a total of six "runs" of a social media strategy were completed during the project. In four of these six runs, program enrollment decreased, while enrollment increased in the other two instances.  2)    Based upon the social analytic data generated by the schools, there was no consistent correlation between the number of social media posts and the reach of social media messaging. In some cases, less frequent posting, with careful attention paid to the post content and presentation, led to greater post reach.
