<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses a path to achieve the metric of less than $1 per kilolumen in Gallium Nitride (GaN) based light emitting diodes (LEDs).  This is expected to spur widespread adoption of solid state lighting which, according to the US Department of Energy, could result in electricity savings equal to the output of 44 gigawatt power plants by 2027.  The price for LEDs is slowing adoption. LEDs don't typically need to be better; they need to be cheaper. This project could directly address this adoption problem by lowering the cost of making LEDs by eliminating one of the most expensive steps in the LED production process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the technical problems in Gallium Nitride (GaN) based light emitting diodes (LEDs), namely using traditional buffer layers to grow GaN on non-GaN substrates.  Traditional approaches are typically expensive and result in crystalline defects because the buffer materials used are non-ductile crystalline structures which very effectively propagate, rather than annihilate, defects. This project develops a new substrate made with a patented crystalline metal and process that will let the manufacturers spend less time and effort to get the same or even better LED crystalline quality than they can achieve today.   Low cost growth techniques are used and to reduce defects in GaN LEDs and to improve the dollar per kilolumen cost to performance metric.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ If you own an EV/HEV, or expect to communicate via 5G RF, or quite possibly want to enjoy solid state lightning, or kill bacteria with UVC light, then you will need high quality GaN on low cost Si.  To this end,  we have achieved specular MOCVD GaN onto Si(111) substrates coated with the stabilized Tivra template strategy of utilizing all PVD processed films, a metal alloy for lattice matching to GaN and c-AlN capping layers to standup against harsh MOCVD environment. A major milestone was reached by establishing a clear path toward the fabrication of a uv/blue LED device on a Si(111) substrate, and sapphire to mitigate device risk.  The GaN quality on a Si(111) template has been shown to nearly match the quality of that on our sapphire template. Moreover, a detailed study comparing the PVD template to an MOCVD template was undertaken to show XRD, AFM, and commercially relevant MOCVD device layers are comparable in quality.  While an important step has been achieved in proving the metal alloy stack as a PVD buffer &amp; nucleation layer, improvements remain in scaling to 200mm diameters in deposition uniformity, bow/warp control.  These quality improvements will be proposed as future course of R&amp;D study for Phase IIb commercialization in order to reach a 200mm scale product.  In a significant verification of the core Tivra technology, functional uv-blue LEDs have been fabricated on Tivra coated PVD templates. GaN was processed by our MOCVD growth partner, and the devices were fabricated by a tier 1 LED maker in Germany and their R&amp;D center. Achieving this milestone proves that our core technology works for uv-blue LED?s. During Phase IIb, we propose extending our learning into the deep uv LED markets.  We will refine the metal alloy to serve as a high reflectivity mirror approaching 100% reflectivity in the UVC portion of the spectrum, and show R&amp;D demonstrations on 150mm sapphire targeting a latticed matched system to AlGaN with Al mole fraction &gt;80%.  The latter requires further R&amp;D to adapt the metal alloy lattice matching condition, test the applicability of the stabilization strategy, and transfer to new patterned sapphire substrates on larger diameters to manufacture deep uv LEDs incorporating our template technology.  The latter is of the utmost importance to serve a tier 1 duv LED maker in Korea, and reduce the MOCVD cycle time from 10 hours down to 2 hours.  We attribute the successful completion of the LED milestone to improvements made in the thermal stability of our material stack as described in previous reporting periods, combining the highest quality PVD c-AlN interlayer, metal alloy, and PVD c-AlN capping layer. Since then, we have concluded by combining a stabilizing element within the metal alloy layer and with an adjustment to the metal alloy composition, the alpha-beta destabilizing phase transition is moved &gt;1400C and outside of the MOCVD growth window. The metal alloy composition is now lattice matched to AlN which allows us to achieve high quality metal crystallinity and provide a good template for the AlN capping layer. The stabilized metal layer continues to show stability exceeding 1200&deg;C in MOCVD environments as demonstrated by shiny metal surfaces in post processed device wafers.  An additional fortuitous finding, the reflectivity of the metal stack was measured and demonstrates an efficient mirror approaching 100% reflectivity as the wavelength of light decreases towards the UVC range down from blue.  The system-integrated nucleation layer development lead to a critical solution in keeping the metal alloy protected during air transfer and subsequent thermal ramps in caustic MOCVD environments in the presence of ammonia, trimethylgallium (metal organic), and H2 at 1100 C.  We further concluded the PVD c-AlN films developed as the system-integrated nucleation layer were equivalent, if not superior to a standard MOCVD c-AlN nucleation film regarding surface roughness, crystal quality, and a series of device epi-layers grown by a Japanese potential customer.  Additionally, the PVD c-AlN is of sufficient quality to serve as a standalone single crystal film for direct MOCVD growth.  Moreover, the morphology studied was determined to have a fine nano-feature size, creating the opportunity for more defect annihilation events at the surface compared to rough and pitted low temperature MOCVD c-AlN films used today for nucleation on Si (111).   Mainly, the ability to deliver additional kinetic energy in the sputtered AlN molecules using both the magnetron power (high Voltage) and long mean free paths of low vacuum operating pressure, along with the substrate temperature in the range of 800C, creates single crystalline PVD c-AlN films superior to MOCVD c-AlN.
