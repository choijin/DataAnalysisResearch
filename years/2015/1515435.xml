<AbstractNarration>This award investigates the ways that households value neighborhood attributes in the residential location decision process in Beijing.  It also seeks to understand the ways vehicle ownership policy constraints unique to Chinese cities impacts the bundled decisions of households, along with implementing this into a unique modeling framework to investigate how these preferences vary across the metropolitan area.  In early 2011, Beijing restricted the purchase of automobiles by distributing license plates through a lottery.  This restriction led to capacity constraints on the choices that were available to each household.  Through simulation of counterfactuals, it is possible to test how changes in the number of vehicles allowed may alter the urban landscape and demand for certain location choice characteristics for particular types of households.  This project utilizes the joint decision making ability of households to present an integrated discrete choice modeling framework for Beijing that ties together residential location choice with other jointly made decisions such as work location, commuting distance and vehicle ownership to further understanding regarding household bundled residential location choice behavior.  The research will be conducted under the supervision of Dr. Wenzhong Zhang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, whose expertise and household survey data will be invaluable to the project. The discrete choice model of bundled residential location choice is estimated using a unique micro-level dataset covering the urbanized areas of Beijing?s metropolitan district.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a modeling framework through the incorporation of a household survey and other relevant data sources to 1) implement a discrete choice model for an investigation into household?s valuation of neighborhood and structure amenities, how this changes across household compositions, and the bundled nature of household decisions, 2) investigate the role of constraints (vehicle ownership in Beijing) on these bundled residential location decisions along with the impact of potential policy changes in vehicle ownership on the location choice process and 3) implement this is a discrete choice modeling framework that allows for spatial correlation across choice alternatives. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Initially, this project had planned to complete a project in Beijing this summer titles æSpatial Heterogeneity in Preferences for Housing Amenities across Household Compositions: Discrete Choice Models for Residential Location Bundles in Beijing.Æ  However, the nature of this project was forced to change course after learning that the dataset I had planned on working with would not be available.  Thus, a new project was developed during my time in Beijing titled æUnderstanding the Relationship between Transportation Infrastructure and the Land Price Gradient in a Rapidly Changing City: Case Study in Beijing.Æ  This project investigates the land price gradient in Beijing and the relationship to urban accessibility/development of the metro system during that time.  The overall objective of this study is to provide an extensive analysis of the relationship between land values, transportation infrastructure and urban accessibility in Beijing for 2005-2014.  The data for this study comes from a variety of sources and includes several thousand land transaction records, land use information, neighborhood demographics along with researcher created proximity attributes and detailed history of transportation infrastructure development during these years.  As new transportation networks allow firms and households to settle in geographically less central neighborhoods without losing the privilege of accessibility to the city center, the structure of transportation networks and the patterns of accessibility they give rise to are an important determinant of land prices and urban structure.  This paper thus estimates the bid rent curve as a way of testing the monocentric city model and understand the role of accessibility provided by new transportation infrastructure on decentralization along with the marginal value of being located closer to the central business district and how this may have diminished over time for several reasons, including increased accessibility provided by new transportation infrastructure.  The methods for this paper involve establishing detailed records of the cityÆs metro system over the course of the study period and calculating distances and reasonable travel times to the central business district given required transport modes.  Initial models demonstrate significant and negative coefficients on distance to the central business district and a declining land gradient during the study period as Beijing decentralizes.  These models are also run using fixed areas for districts or jiedao.              Currently, progress on this paper includes analysis that is near completion and significant progress on writing.  Ideas and progress have also been shared with colleagues in the United States.  Additional ideas have been developed since leaving Beijing, including the addition of an additional section discussing the intricacies of land development and the land market in China compared to the United States.  In the coming months, time will be spent to complete the analysis and writing for this paper and potentially submit an article for review later this summer.
