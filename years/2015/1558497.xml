<AbstractNarration>Attention affects nearly all aspects of perception, cognition, and performance.  Despite its central importance, researchers lack a simple way to measure a person's attentional functioning.  Although no mental process can be reduced to a single number, both research and practical settings can benefit from starting with standardized and quantifiable measures.  For example, intelligence research and education practice depends heavily on g, an index of fluid intelligence. A comparable measure is lacking for attention.  The goal of this project is to develop an attention profile measure that can 1) quantify a person's attentional function, 2) predict behavior, 3) and to facilitate comparison of attentional performance across individuals, tasks, and sites, and, importantly, over time.  A quantifiable and standardized whole-brain attention measure can have transformative utility for research and practical applications.  The work should have direct benefits for advancing the scientific understanding of attention and the underlying neural mechanisms.  This project will also benefit society through education and research.  Our brain imaging studies involve rigorous training of analytic methods needed to process complex fMRI data, providing opportunities for STEM training at high school levels and beyond, especially for women or underrepresented minorities. The PI, Dr. Marvin Chun, has a strong record of dedication to mentoring, teaching, and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new attention profile investigated here predicts a performance ranking for novel individuals based on models of whole brain functional connectivity, which can be measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the resting state, collected while participants lie passively in the scanner without performing an explicit cognitive task.  Models of intrinsic connectivity in a whole brain attention network during the resting state are created to significantly predict sustained attention task performance.  This project will develop further models to test other attention components such as alerting, orienting, and executive function.  Collectively, these whole brain functional connectivity models will provide a quantitative attention profile for individual participants.  Because we can apply our models to novel subjects or independent data sets from different sites, these new methods have broad applicability, and they are predictive rather than just descriptive.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Thanks to NSF funding, this project has made significant progress towards developing brain imaging technologies that can measure important cognitive abilities such as attention.  Because attention has many components, the goal of this project was to develop an attention profile measure that can 1) quantify a person's attentional function along several dimensions such as sustained attention, alerting, orienting, and executive control, 2) predict behavior, 3) facilitate comparison across individuals, and 4) be obtained in a practical and standardized way to maximize comparability across individuals, tasks, and sites.     Towards these goals, we tested participants in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners while they conducted a battery of different attention tasks.  Based on these functional MRI scans, our methods allow us to measure and predict how well people will perform in a variety of attentionally demanding tasks. Our methods are robust enough to be applicable to novel participants and novel attention tasks.  We also devoted effort to improving our computational methods, which may contribute beyond our studies towards developing better neuroscience analyses and artificial intelligence systems.       Overall, the project has supported several publications and public presentations.  In addition, as broader social impact, this NSF grant has supported the training of highly talented and promising young researchers -- mostly women -- across disciplines such as psychology, neuroscience, data science, and computer science.
