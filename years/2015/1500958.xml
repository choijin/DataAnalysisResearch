<AbstractNarration>This research project focuses on the interplay between three major areas in mathematics: harmonic analysis, additive combinatorics, and partial differential equations (PDE), with the harmonic analysis component playing the dominant role.  The research plan has the following characteristics: (1) it is structured into several classes of problems (some to be detailed in the next paragraph), on some of which the principal investigator has already made relevant contribution/advancements by developing new analysis methods; (2) it covers a wide range of techniques, with levels of difficulty varying depending on the nature of the subject that also allow partial progress; (3) it has two main components, namely, a purely theoretical one dealing with problems that focus on understanding the behavior of various so-called maximal operators with highly oscillatory kernels and a more applied side, part of the area of fluid dynamics, studying the problem of singularity formation for two-fluid interfaces. An advancement in this latter direction will contribute to a better understanding of the physical reality around us. Further aspects of the project are the dissemination of the principal investigator's work through conference participation, lectures, and graduate courses, interaction with other researchers/experts in the areas of harmonic analysis and PDE, the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates several problems that position themselves at the interface either between harmonic analysis and additive combinatorics, or between harmonic analysis and fluid dynamics. It is structured along several major themes, among which we mention the following (items (2), (3), and (4) represent joint projects with collaborators): (1) pointwise convergence of Fourier series near L^1; (2) the maximal Schrodinger operator, Kakeya extremizers, and sum-product estimates; (3) formation of singularities for the two-dimensional, two-fluid interface in the absence of vorticity in order to increase understanding of the "limiting" water-wave case; (4) the rotational two-dimensional water-wave problem and quasilinear systems of Klein--Gordon equations in three dimensions with nontrivial vorticity, with a focus on the time of existence for small initial data. On the first topic the author has already made contributions, developing new methods that either improved on known results (e.g., the pointwise convergence along lacunary subsequences of partial Fourier sums) or recovered the best known results stemming from the celebrated work of Lennart Carleson. The approaches for both the first and second topics combine techniques from time-frequency analysis and additive combinatorics. The third theme investigates, for the two-dimensional, two-fluid problem, how the geometry of the interface changes as the boundary approaches a "splash" scenario from the water-wave case; the fourth one explores how the time of existence for solutions (relative to small initial data) of the two-dimensional water-wave case and three dimensional Klein-Gordon systems are affected by the presence of vorticity, a new and hitherto mostly unexplored theme in the fluid dynamics literature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal aims to reveal some of the deep connections between the area of Harmonic Analysis (the core of this project) and other mathematical areas such as additive combinatorics, incidence geometry and PDE.  Our proposal is organized into six major themes:  1) Pointwise convergence of Fourier Series near $L^1$. 2) The maximal Schr\"odinger operator, Kakeya extremizers and sum-product estimates. 3) Singular multilinear operators in the presence of the curvature. 4) Polynomial Carleson operator in higher dimensions. 5) Formation of singularities for the 2D-two fluid interface in the presence/absence of vorticity; understanding the ``limiting" water-wave case. 6) Rotational 2D water-wave case - understanding the time of existence for small initial data.  INTELECTUAL MERIT:  This proposal is intended to develop new connections between areas such as time-frequency analysis,  additive geometry, incidence geometry and PDE. The PI has established deep and surprising connections between time-frequency analysis and additive combinatorics, which now begin to grow into a new methodology for treating certain difficult topics (items 1 and 2 above).  In a different direction, based on his prior work, the PI proposed various problems in oscillatory integrals (item 3 above), which are meant to develop a deeper understanding of the role of the curvature in harmonic analysis, by studying ``curved'' models of some difficult well-known open problems and conjectures. This proposal had also a fluid mechanics component that aimed/aims to understand aspects of the water-wave/two-fluid problem such as singularity formation and long-time existence in the presence/absence of vorticity. Progressing on this latter component would impact our understanding of the physical world.  BROADER IMPACT:  The PI supported several educational activities: workshop (co-)organization (Spring 2015, AIM), graduate student seminar organization (MSRI, Spring 2017), Putnam team coaching (2014--present), teaching multiple reading courses, and supervision of undergraduate theses.  The fluid dynamic component in this project is directly connected with physics and more generally with the real world. Thus, an advancement on the problem of singularity formation/long time existence contributea to a better understanding of the physical reality around us.  The results of the PI's research were presented at conferences and various seminars. They were also be made available through journal publications and posted on electronic libraries such as arXiv.
