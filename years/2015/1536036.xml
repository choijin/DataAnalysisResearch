<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation of students and early-career scientists at the Triennial Earth-Sun Summit (TESS), a joint meeting of the Space Physics and Aeronomy Section of the American Geophysical Union and the Solar Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society. TESS is intended to be a gathering of the entire Heliophysics community, including distinct sub-disciplines devoted to studies of the Sun, the near-Earth space environment, and their interactions with the Earth's atmosphere. The goal of this conference is to promote greater interaction and unity within this community.  This increasingly interdisciplinary effort is necessary to understand, predict, and mitigate the effects of "space weather".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will be administered by the American Astronomical Society (AAS), the principal professional organization for US astronomers.  They have very successfully and economically administered similar programs in the past, and the proposed procedures ensure that these funds will provide the maximum benefit to the astronomical and geospace communities at minimal administrative cost.</AbstractNarration>
