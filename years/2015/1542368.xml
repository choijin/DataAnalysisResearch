<AbstractNarration>Within a coherent theme of Smart Vehicles, this collaborative Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site at Central Michigan University (CMU) and Western Michigan University (WMU) will expose in-service and pre-service teachers, and community college faculty to leading research spanning mobile robotics, kinematics and kinetics, vehicle manufacturing robots, vehicular sensor networks, ergonomics, material science, and circuit design. The multidisciplinary nature of Smart Vehicles in engineering will provide a holistic ground for developing creative course modules in physics, chemistry, engineering, and technology that aligns well with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), Common Core State Standards (CCSS), and Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) Criteria for STEM curriculum. Engaging regionally automobile focused industrial advisors and university faculty with rural secondary school and community college teachers will serve as a model-platform, and provide rare best-practices-based professional development opportunities and experience. CMU, a regional comprehensive university, is located in the heart of central rural Michigan where it maintains a reputation as "the" university to which schools turn for access to newly educated teachers, and for professional development for their current teachers. This RET renewal site will focus on teachers in these rural areas, and support them as they lift the STEM knowledge base of their students, increasing their opportunities for employment and for becoming entrepreneurs. Engaging pre-service teachers in cutting-edge research ensures that they begin their careers well-equipped with research experience and confidence to take into their classrooms. Similarly, with nurtured NGSS-based curriculum design and implementation expertise these teachers will take on leadership roles in their employing schools, thereby multiplying the effect of this project. Overall, through partnership with K-12 schools, community colleges, and a public university, this RET site will provide a profound influence on the learning and career paths of young students in the rural Michigan area, with knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes which are in high demand, but who have traditionally been underrepresented in the STEM education and employment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Site will offer an intensive six-week summer research program for a total of 45 rural STEM teachers over three years with a focus on those serving groups that are underrepresented in science and engineering. RET participants will engage in cutting-edge research on Smart Vehicles, under the guidance of engineering faculty mentors who lead active research programs, and who serve the community through outreach activities. The engineering faculty mentors, curriculum development specialist, Instructional Coach from Science/Mathematics, Technology Center, and staff from CMU's Faculty Center for Innovative Teaching will coach participants as they design standards-compliant curriculum modules and conduct professional development activities for each participant group. Extensive follow-up activities through the academic year include on-site Instructional Coaching, Quarterly Team Meetings, engineering faculty involvement in secondary school and community college classrooms, and Cross Classroom Collaborations to ensure translation of research experience into practice. The annual CMU High-Impact STEM Teaching Symposium will share findings with regional educators, and the annual CMU STEM Day will engage more than 200 secondary school students in exploration of engineering disciplines on CMU campus. The Science and Mathematics Program Improvement (SAMPI) staff at WMU will serve as external program evaluators, track and evaluate the site progress and provide feedback for improvement. They will also conduct longitudinal studies to assess the long-term impact of the proposed RET site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RET Site is co-funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) and the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposed RET site aimed to:  strengthen the partnership between Central Michigan University (CMU) School of Engineering and Technology (SET), Science/Mathematics Technology Center (SMTC); Mid-Michigan Community College (MMCC) and Delta College (DC); middle and high school STEM ISTs and PSTs (CMU science education majors) in the northern lower peninsula of Michigan. broaden and deepen science and technology teacher/faculty’s content knowledge and pedagogical tools by engaging them in engineering research to solve open-ended problems. improve middle school, high school, and community college student science and technology achievement. stimulate student interest in STEM careers as a result of improved instruction and curriculum delivered by RET participants in rural Michigan.       Under the scope of above objectives, following major activities were performed:  Since 2016, RET has been able to provide professional development opportunities a total of 51 current and future participating teachers in rural Mid-Michigan towards better understanding and utilization of engineering concepts in the classroom. Since 2016 RET participants have been able to impact a total of 14 public and private school districts and three community colleges in rural Mid-Michigan with the information garnered from their experience. CMU held STEM Day events in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, where over 800 secondary students developed understanding of engineering concepts through high quality STEM challenges in a University setting. RET participants have engaged in the Upward Bound STEM Day 2017, 2018, where approximately 80 high school students from low-income households/whose parents do not have bachelor’s degrees developed understanding of engineering concepts through high quality STEM challenges in a University setting.  CMU held the High-Impact STEM Teaching Symposium in 2016, 2017, and 2018. In this event, participating teachers gave Ted Talk-esque presentations introducing both the work accomplished in the program and NGSS’s resultant paradigm shift in science teaching to fellow educators. Poster presentation and open house 2016, 2017, 2018: where participants utilized a research poster to present the work accomplished through the summer’s program. Administrators, colleagues, and family members were invited to learn more about the participant’s experiences with engineering practices. RET participants have designed and implemented 47 lesson plans for their respective classroom through experience from this program. These lesson plans were delivered to over 3000 students. RET participants have submitted 10 lesson plans to Teachengineering.org. These lesson plans were delivered to over 1900 students. Over 30 RET participants have attended and presented at a pedagogy focused conference. RET participants have published over 50 newspaper articles in the local newspapers and highlighted the significance of STEM in the community. RET has created STEM experts who have become agents of change within local schools. These new advocates for the three dimensional learning required by the NGSS are highly influential within our home districts and are active voices in the implementation of STEM based education, sharing their expertise with colleagues.  RET graduates in turn provide colleagues with direction or reassurance as they themselves venture into the new pedagogy the engineering design process demands.   RET participants are creating STEM based lesson plans, but they are also providing the guidance and encouragement for fellow in-service teachers (ISTs) and pre-service teachers (PSTs) to create their own lesson plans.
