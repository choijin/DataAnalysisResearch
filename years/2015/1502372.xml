<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the "Rocky Mountain Dynamical Systems Conference," held on June 8-11, 2015, in Provo, Utah. The mathematical field of dynamical systems provides fundamental ideas and tools for the modeling, analysis, and prediction of complex phenomena. Theoretical development in nonlinear dynamics has been in the forefront in many areas of scientific endeavor such as environmental fluid dynamics, geophysical flows, climate dynamics, networks of neurons, genetics, and physiology.  The purpose of this conference is to nurture high quality scientific activity, to strengthen scientific collaboration, and to stimulate interest among young scientists, students, and those from underrepresented groups working in the field of dynamical systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the discipline of dynamical systems has matured, it has divided into many subfields such as smooth, topological, complex, Hamiltonian, symbolic, ergodic, etc. However, solutions to important dynamical problems increasingly require techniques from various areas of mathematics, and progress in the field will be catalyzed by more collaborative research. The conference will not focus on a specific area of dynamical systems, but instead will invite speakers from diverse areas in the subject.  This will help provide a venue to develop collaborations from various research areas within dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web page:  math.byu.edu/~tfisher/sites/rmdsc15index.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant supported the Rocky Mountain Conference on Dynamical Systems (RMDS Conference), held from June 8-11, 2015 in Provo, Utah.  Dynamical systems provides fundamental ideas and tools for the modeling, analysis, and prediction of complex phenomena.  Solutions to important dynamical problems increasingly require techniques from several areas of mathematics, and the research in these areas is becoming increasingly collaborative. In fact, rapid progress requires an organized collaborative effort such as the this conference.   Additionally, as the discipline of dynamical systems has matured, it has divided into many subfields (smooth, topological, complex, Hamiltonian, symbolic, ergodic, etc.). But with this specialization comes the danger that the disciplineas a whole can become fragmented and ultimately weaker. Thus it was important,to have a regional meeting devoted to the general field of dynamical systems.  The RMDS Conference was a vehicle to support graduate students, junior mathematicians, and underrepresented groups and gave them the opportunity to interact with an array of top experts, as well as other students and junior mathematicians.  This was a  valuable experience for them, and provided a special opportunity for establishing contacts between peers.  There were a number of talks, throughout the conference, presented by graduate students, junior mathematicians, and those from underrepresented groups.  Additionally, the grant provided support to invite a select group of leaders in the field to give presentations.  The RMDS Conference had 48 participants.  Of these 13 were graduate students and 12 were Post Docs, a very high percentage for each.       Last Modified: 01/11/2016       Submitted by: Todd L Fisher]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
