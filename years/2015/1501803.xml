<AbstractNarration>This research will investigate the evolutionary consequences of whole-genome duplication in the flowering plant genus Tolmiea. Duplication occurs when an offspring ends up with two copies of all of the chromosomes of its parents. Genome duplications have occurred frequently within the flowering plants (300,000+ species), and likely contributed to their success. Most agricultural crops are the result of one or more recent duplication events, including wheat, cotton, corn, potato, and sugarcane. Thus, the research will be of broad importance in agriculture as well as the study of biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tolmiea (Saxifragaceae) contains one polyploid, T. menziesii that arose directly from the single diploid in the genus, T. diplomenziesii. Ongoing work found divergence both in abiotic niche preference and physiological water stress responses between diploid and autotetraploid Tolmiea. In concert with other ecophysiological investigations, this research will characterize the role autopolyploidy has played in the divergence of gene expression patterns using a common garden experiment consisting of multiple populations and multiple water-stress treatments. This study will: 1) provide insights into genome-wide patterns of gene expression in a natural autopolyploid compared to its diploid parent, 2) evaluate the variation and responsiveness of gene expression levels to the presence and absence of water-stress, and 3) use synthetic polyploid lines to determine whether these changes are the immediate effect of polyploidy or the result of subsequent evolution. This study will increase our understanding of gene expression changes resulting from autopolyploidy, and will provide valuable information for future breeding management and improvement of autopolyploid crops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Polyploidy (whole genome duplication) is a natural, and common occurrence among flowering plants.  Humans, and most other mammals are quite intolerant of major genomic additions/subtractions, a single chromosome addition for example, is the underlying cause of down?s syndrome in humans.  Why is it that flowering plants, as well as fungi and fishes, not only seem to tolerate simultaneous duplication of every chromosome, but often thrive following these events.  Our research was focused on two critical questions regarding polyploidy in plants. One, how does polyploidy contribute to plants overcoming environmental stressors, eventually leading to the occupation of novel habitats, and thereby serving as a facilitator of speciation?   Two, how might a doubling of every chromosome, and thereby every gene across the genome, lead to altered gene expression (a step along the path to protein synthesis) and a subsequent change in stress tolerance.  The research supported by this award led us to identify drought stress as a critical component of the habitat differences between polyploid and diploid Tolmiea.  We then developed methods for quantifying gene expression differences between organisms of differing genome size, and applied those methods towards understanding differences in drought response following polyploidy.  We discovered that when subjected to drought stress, the gross gene expression of polyploid Tolmiea is incredibly variable when compared to its diploid parent, suggesting that polyploids might have the capacity for more varied physiological responses than diploids.  We also determined that although polyploid Tolmiea harbors larger, but fewer cells than the diploid, each cell in the polyploid is capable of higher rates of photosynthesis relative to cells in the diploid parent. These results imply that polyploid cells are capable of compensating for cell density differences.          Last Modified: 07/07/2017       Submitted by: Clayton J Visger]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
