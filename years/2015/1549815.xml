<AbstractNarration>This EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award is an interdisciplinary project that brings together an expert in adaptive control with an expert in the cognitive basis of anomaly response. The focus is on providers of highly automated, business critical, smart digital services in which human supervisors normally monitor automatic controllers, but must take over control if anomalous events occur that the automation is not designed to handle. The objective is to ensure that such transitions occur safely, smoothly, and reliably. An industrial research partner will provide a set of cases of anomaly response from actual business critical software services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smart services increasingly rely on autonomous computational mechanisms to quickly handle extremely large numbers of transactions extremely. Given the scale and dependence on automation, even small disrupting events can cascade quickly, and human supervision may lead to late and erroneous responses when anomalies occur that challenge automated capabilities. This project promises to re-engage human supervisors in the developing anomaly (a) smoothly, by providing anomaly visualizations that anticipate when the automated activity is at risk of saturating control, and (b) quickly, so that supervisors can intervene to block cascading problems. Performance testing will be based on actual cases of anomaly response and will estimate how re-engagement following anomalies is smooth or bumpy, the increase in responsiveness to anomalies, and the range of autonomous activities that can be supervised effectively with the new form of shared control.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Anomalies are ubiquitous and continuous. Some examples are flight accidents, chemical plant disasters, or the 2010 crash in the New York stock market. In most of these catastrophic situations, the use of an automated system has been reported to be inadequate, as the anomalies push the system into regions that are beyond its operational envelope.

This shows that shared control between humans and machines is a non-trivial problem, and has to be addressed carefully and systematically. This is the focus of our project.  The nature of this research is to introduce a shared controller that provides improved resilience so as to help recover gracefully from such unpredictable anomalies. The specific example we have explored is flight control and resilience using a shared control architecture between the human pilot and an adaptive autopilot. The specific anomaly we have explored is that of engine outages. We have raised and answered the following questions:  How do we define resiliency? What are the key variables/characteristics that contribute to resiliency? What are the building blocks of a resilient shared control architecture? How do we distribute the tasks among human and machine or pilot/autopilot in our example?   The resilient control architecture that we have developed is composed of perception and adaptation components. We defined resiliency as the system capability to keep up the performance post-anomaly. The performance metric considered is the tracking error of flight controller. We introduced a novel concept of capacity for maneuver (CfM) which corresponds to the difference between the instantaneous control input and the actuator saturation limit. The key characteristic of the shared controller is the ability to sustain the CfM via graceful performance degradation, i.e. trading-off the ability to track a command with CfM to spare.
