<AbstractNarration>When the environment in which a person or a device is operating is relatively constant, but uncertain, information can be collected slowly and used to make decisions. However, the situation is quite different when critical decisions have to be made rapidly as the environment changes. Such situations arise in medical emergencies, trading in the stock market, conflict management, and taking counter-terror measures. In such cases, there is (i) incomplete information about the situation (ii) uncertain or unreliable information and (iii) limited resources. The aim of the proposed research is to use the given resources as efficiently as possible to find adequate responses. The central idea of the research is to exploit the information coming from distributed sources, and decide at every instant how to combine the information for decision making. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems that continuously monitor their own performance, and adjust their control strategies to improve the performance are considered. These are both stable and robust for time-invariant plants when the parametric uncertainty is small. However, in recent years the need for analytic tools for reacting effectively to large uncertainties and rapidly varying environments, in the presence of input and output disturbances, has been arising in a variety of fields including biology and medicine, economics and  finance, and various engineering problems such as energy management, aircraft and automotive control, and security. In many of these applications, it has been found that classical adaptive algorithms result in large and oscillatory (and possibly unstable) responses. To address such problems, the use of different methods based on multiple models has been proposed by the PI. These include a) Switching      b) Switching and Tuning c) Interactive adaptation and d) Second Level adaptation. The first method involves switching between fixed models, while the second method combines adaptive switching and continuous adaptation. The third method is based on novel ways of locating models, while the fourth method confined search of unknown parameters to convex regions. In complex problems, the variations that can occur cannot be classified easily. The proposal attempts to study methods for adapting efficiently by distributing resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary:  Adaptive control refers to the control of any dynamical system (airplane, automobile, process) when there is uncertainty about the system. For over six decades researchers have studied parametric uncertainty (e.g., unknown density or mass, or concentration etc.). Generally, it is assumed that the parameter (parameters) are constant and unknown. Most of the work has been connected with the estimation of the parameter and using the estimate to control the system.   The project that was investigated from 2015-2019 dealt with situations where the parameters vary with time. The designer generally has some prior information about how the parameters may vary (e.g., discontinuously, switching between specific values, periodically, or arbitrarily within certain specified frequencies). For such systems, the old methods are found to be inadequate (unless the parameters vary very slowly). It is when the parameters vary rapidly and with large amplitude that new methods are needed. The multiple model based approach is found to perform far better than conventional approaches. The use of numerous fixed models  to collect information, switching and tuning, evolutionary methods with many simultaneously adapting models, and second level adaptation are combined judiciously to make the given dynamical system behave in the desired fashion. Thousands if simulations have been carried out to demonstrate this fact.     Intellectual merit:   The concept of using multiple models is a general one. Consulting many doctors, many lawyers, many stockbrokers or even many friends to make an important decision is quite common. The PI believes that the method of adapting to changing environments using multiple models will become a generally accepted one in the future.     Broader impact:  The research carried out has broad implications in engineering. Combining different methods have advantages in numerous situations.  The principal results of the research have been presented at national and international conferences and in plenary, invited, and distinguished lectures given by the PI around the world. One doctoral dissertation has been completed and one doctoral student is currently continuing the work. Outstanding undergraduate students at Yale have been trained as summer interns in the new methods.
