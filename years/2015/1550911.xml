<AbstractNarration>Drought is a nationwide threat to biodiversity, one of the challenges that motivated development of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).  Droughts are already affecting organisms from microbes to vertebrates and higher plants.  The long-term consequences are unpredictable because each species responds to other species, as they too respond to drought.  For example, a species that is insensitive to drought will still respond if the plants on which it feeds or the predators that consume it respond to drought.  Ecologists could better anticipate drought effects by developing tools to integrate the information from many species as they respond both to climate and each other.  With data from key taxonomic groups monitored by NEON the researchers will use a new approach, joint modeling of species and drought, to develop a predictive framework for biodiversity analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using relevant NEON, predictive models, which combine multiple species, functional types, and functional traits, will be developed to identify commonalities in species responses to changing drought, reducing the dimensionality of thousands of species to groups that can be predicted.  Indirect effects of species interactions will be emphasized in planned modeling activities.  For example, a tree species may increase in crowded stands only when others decrease.  The effects of temperature usually depend on precipitation. The results of this collaboration involving ecology and statistics will be of interest not only ecologists, but for all global change scientists and policy makers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Predicting which species are at risk from climate and land use change is important to help direct resources to save endangered species, help common species stay common, and identify where newly suitable conditions might exist for species outside of their previous range.  Traditionally these assessments have been done on individual species, with larger scale predictions coming from simply aggregating these independent predictions. We improved on this approach by developing a community-based analysis called Generalized Joint Attribute Modeling (GJAM).  This statistical approach that recognizes that each species interacts with many others, which are also responding to climate, and relates the presence or abundance of species to a suite of environmental conditions to help us understand what factors affect their distribution.  Model results allow us to evaluate species risk to future change in conditions and thus provide a unique opportunity to assess biodiversity threats in the community context.  Our analysis of plant, insect, and mammal data from the National Ecological Observatory Network showed the usefulness of the GJAM approach and revealed substantial reorganization of communities from climate change.  For example, as a measure of local sensitivity to climate change, our model can predict the numbers of species lost at a site per degree of warming, which we found to be highest in the South.  This could be due in part to lack of a nearby source of species adapted to increasing temperature and moisture deficits in that region.  The numbers of species lost per year, or velocity, is highest at mid latitudes, balancing the increase in warming to the North against high sensitivity in the South.  This first application of joint species prediction for entire communities with demonstrably accurate predictions, shows that community reorganization involves all major species groups.  In addition to our focus on using these new statistics to analyze NEON data we have made these tools and results broadly available.  We have steadily improved the core software package to run GJAM (now ver 2.2.6), which has been very popular (25,000+ downloads).  We also developed code for an analysis pipeline to directly ingest the latest NEON data from their database and integrating climate and satellite data from Google Earth Engine.  Many aspects of this analysis pipeline are being incorporated into an interactive web-based utility.  This is now online (ttp://pbgjam.org) but still under development. We have also adapted GJAM to work with camera trap data, which permits a novel consideration of spatial and temporal covariates.  This grant supported undergraduates, graduate students, and post docs who helped conduct the research, and led to two software packages, 15 publications, and two government reports.
