<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the acquisition of a research-grade petrographic microscope (Nikon LV100) with an automatic point counter stepping stage and PETROG software to enable examination of thin sections. The requested microscope will support teaching in structural geology, sedimentology, and mineralogy courses by allowing photographic documentation and storage of thin section and grain separate images.  This microscope will also support existing paleomagnetic, mineralogy, petrology, and tectonic research at New Mexico Highland University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to examine thin sections with transmitted and reflected light is fundamental in rock and mineral characterizations. The microscopic images and the textural analyses obtained can provide important information to aid the determination of formation history, which is crucial in the study of structural geology, volcanology, and paleomagnetic research. The microscope will be open to regional, national and international collaborators.  This equipment will facilitate the training of a diverse undergraduate and M.S. student body at this Hispanic Serving Institution as well as at surrounding institutions. This support is congruent with NSF?s mission of promoting the progress of science and will advance the national prosperity and welfare especially through the training of the next generations of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
