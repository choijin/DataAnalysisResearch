<AbstractNarration>The Mixed Integer Programming Workshop is an annual workshop that highlights the state of the art in discrete and continuous optimization, with a primary focus being to showcase more junior researchers.  Another goal of the workshop is to enable collaborations and scientific exchanges between leading researchers and graduate students, thus promoting the progress of basic science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project will provide travel support for 10 student poster presenters, providing them the opportunity to network with the world's top researchers in a student poster session, as well as during the invited talks, which are presented in a single track format with plenty of opportunity for interaction.</AbstractNarration>
