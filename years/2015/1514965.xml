<AbstractNarration>This award supports research to understand how and why some of Taiwan?s small carnivores adapt quite well to human disturbance, while others are less successful. Carnivores are essential to functioning, healthy ecological communities, so it is important to understand how they are doing in any particular ecosystem. The study will investigate how these animals adjust their diet, choice of habitat, and schedules, among other factors,  depending on proximity to human development. Taiwan, despite its relatively small size, is richly diverse ecologically, but much of the island has been heavily deforested for agriculture and urban development, which has reduced and fragmented wildlife habitats. Nevertheless, Taiwan, like countries and cities all over the world, continues to be under constant pressure to develop, leaving its remaining forests vulnerable to further reduction and fragmentation. This research will be conducted as part of an ongoing Ph.D. research project under the mentorship of Dr. Pei-Jen Lee Shaner at National Taiwan Normal University.  The methods and principles of this project can be easily applied in order to understand the ecology of urban landscapes, how human actions can alter wildlife, and how to manage urban wildlife here in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data regarding the activities of small carnivores and their prey will be collected by camera trapping, gathering and analyzing scats, and recording scat sample locations along transects in field sites. Scat analysis will be completed using next-generation sequencing of scat samples, revealing genetic information and diet composition, among other data. Our analysis will help reveal what factors (e.g. canopy cover, vegetation type, prey availability, etc.) influence distribution and niche use; the extent to which niches of different species overlap and how they compare in pristine areas versus unprotected/developed areas; and what factors explain success or failure in human-dominated habitats. This project will employ inexpensive, noninvasive, and effective methods, and contribute to existing literature on urban ecology. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In our rapidly urbanizing world, wildlife communities are in increasingly frequent contact with humans, in the forms of outdoor recreation, expanding human settlements, and various other types of activities. Despite the many protected areas and national parks in Taiwan, large areas have been heavily deforested for agriculture, cities, and other human developments, thereby reducing wildlife habitats. Taiwan continues to be under constant pressure to develop, leaving remaining forests vulnerable to further destruction and fragmentation.  The health of carnivore populations is important to monitor because human encroachment can result in competition for resources such as food, resulting in conflict and negative encounters, and because it is often a good indicator of the overall health of ecological communities.

Some of the goals of this project were to explain this phenomenon, create models that illustrate it, and ultimately use such models to predict future change and thence to improve the balance between development and the conservation of TaiwanÆs diverse ecosystems. TaiwanÆs wildlife is inherently at higher risk of extinction simply because Taiwan is an island, so great care must be taken to maintain TaiwanÆs biodiversity. Communities in the United States should take similar care to protect their biodiversity, as suburbanization creates a similar "island effect," putting enormous pressure on wildlife to navigate pockets of heavy human activity to find resources and shelter.  A possible consequence of increased exposure of wildlife to humans is that animals deviate from their typical diets and consume human-related items such as human foods, garbage, or even pets. In turn, these changes in diet could potentially be harmful to animals, cause changes throughout ecological communities or create conflict between humans and wildlife.
