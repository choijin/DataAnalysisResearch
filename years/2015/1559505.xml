<AbstractNarration>IRES-SAGES will train U.S. undergraduate students to discover and characterize planets outside our solar system. Students will travel abroad to receive mentorship from international experts. The students will bring their acquired skills and research products back to the US where they will continue their investigations, train fellow students, disseminate their findings, and develop outreach activities for their local communities and K-12 schools. The students' research will look for gas giants in close orbits around especially bright stars - planets known as 'hot Jupiters.' The students' home institutions and the foreign institutions they will visit are members of the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) project, a global collaboration with a proven record of discovering these planets. Participation in IRES-SAGES will prepare the students for employment in physics- and space-related industries, advance the field of astrophysics research, promote national and international interests in space exploration, and improve scientific literacy in the US through outreach activities. The recruitment of IRES-SAGES students will target demographic groups traditionally underrepresented in the physical science fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surveys for exoplanet transits - dimmings of a star when one of its planets partially eclipses it - have been largely limited to stars fainter than tenth magnitude. KELT was created to search for planets transiting brighter stars through the use of telescopes specially designed to prevent image saturation. Only about two dozen hot Jupiters transiting stars brighter than tenth magnitude are known, but they are responsible for nearly all of the published literature on exoplanetary atmospheres, direct thermal emission, and spin-orbit alignment. Until more transiting super-Earths and Neptunes are discovered around bright stars and technology advances to the point where we can investigate them more thoroughly, hot Jupiters transiting bright stars remain the best sites for individual exoplanet exploration. KELT has discovered several of these planets through its global network of observatories and astronomers with different key specialties. IRES-SAGES will leverage this network to train US students in the discovery and characterization of these planets, as well as the wider range of planet types targeted by the microlensing, radial velocity, and transit programs of KELT?s foreign partners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Five students from Westminster College went on research trips over three summers; the first two went to Italy and worked on a microlensing project, and the last three went to Austrailia over two summers and worked on research related to exoplanets and systems that host them.  All students' educational experiences were greatly enriched by their experiences.  One is already in graduate school, and the other three are currently applying to graduate school.  Their decision to go to graduate school was influenced by their research experiences from this project, and many of them are receiving     Because I inherited this grant with no warning when the previous PI left academia suddenly, I was only ever peripherally aware of what was happening with the grant.  I knew the students who went and had taught them in classes.  I also gave the first two students a series of lectures on General Realtivity and gravitational lensing, to help prepare them for their trip.  However, I was not  able to do the one thing I agreed to do (take the last two students to a AAS meeting).  I'd been told there was enough money for three people to make the trip, but at the las tminute, after plans had been made, was informed that there wasn't enough money left in the account for even one person to make the trip. Again, not having been the PI of this grant, and having only agreed to take the students on the final trip, I am not aware of the expenditures and circumstances that led to this unanticipated shortfall.
