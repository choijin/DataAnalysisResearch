<AbstractNarration>Transport and distribution networks come in a number of forms, from animal cardiovascular and respiratory systems to communication and industrial infrastructures. Practical issues abound: prediction of local spikes, estimation of perfusion, and impact of structural changes such as vessel occlusion. The complexity of such phenomena can be illustrated by the well-known Braess' paradox: adding links to a transportation network might not improve the operation of the system! In spite of recent successes, our understanding of network flows is usually limited to small deterministic problems, while most applications correspond to large uncertain ones. The goal of this project is to enable improved predictions in biological and technological transport and diffusion networks. For instance, can one predict how cerebral blood flow will be affected if one of the carotids becomes narrow or blocked? Will the vasculature allow for re-routing? If so, with what probability and how fast? &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The main challenge in this research project is the presence of uncertainties. For many applications, only partial information about the systems is available. For instance the size or even the presence of a specific vessel might be uncertain or the status of a router unknown. The analysis of such problems requires the creation of novel mathematical tools and numerical methods to describe how uncertainties propagate through vast and complex networks. The computational tools to be constructed will provide information, usually probabilistic in nature, regarding phenomena that are difficult, expensive, or impossible to measure.</AbstractNarration>

These two challenges are encountered in most applications of interest from both the life sciences (as in blood flow circulation) and within the realm of technical applications (as in power grids).  Agregation method or dimension reduction often must take place to obtain models that are amenable to computational study.  As there is no generic approach to creating smaller, surrogate models, we started to study how to determine, among the input parameters of a large original model, which ones are "important".

A natural approach, initiated by Sobol, is to consider the uncertain input parameters of a model as random variables and to assign to each parameter or group of parameters its relative contribution to the variance of the output. In that approach, uncertainty is roughly equated with variance. As part of this project, we have obtained  significant advances in global sensitivity analysis.   1. Most global sensitivity analysis methods yield confusing and often useless results if the input parameters are correlated; unfortunately, correlated inputs is the general case in practice. Switching the framework from probability to approximation theory, we have extended Sobol's original indices to the generic case of correlated parameters. In addition, this new framework also provides a direct and explicit link between sensitivity analysis and dimension reduction.  2.

We have developed new methods to perform sensitivity analysis of time-dependent quantities of interest. The challenge is here that the "yardstick" (for instance, the variance of the quantity of interest) changes with time. Our approach resolves this issue and, additionally, respect causality.  4.
