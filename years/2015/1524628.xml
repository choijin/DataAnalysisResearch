<AbstractNarration>Large-scale applications of cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as commercial buildings with Building Automation System (BAS)-based demand response (DR) can play a key role in alleviating demand peaks and associated grid stress, increased electricity unit cost, and carbon emissions. However, benefits of BAS alone are often limited because their demand peak reduction cannot be maintained long enough without unduly affecting occupant comfort. This project seeks to develop control algorithms to closely integrate battery storage-based DR with existing BAS capabilities. The overarching objective is to expand the building's DR capabilities, providing crucial benefits towards smarter grids, while maintaining appropriate occupant comfort and reducing building ownership cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project follows a 2-phase approach towards more effective integration. First, building peak demand forecasting will be added to existing battery dispatch methods. Under electricity tariffs geared towards daily [monthly] peaks, such forecasting could result in the same battery-enabled demand charge (dollars per kW) savings as previously demonstrated storage dispatch algorithms. However, supply charges (dollars per kWh) and associated emissions would be reduced because battery dispatch would be geared towards reducing only the biggest daily [monthly] peaks while not incurring roundtrip charging losses on more moderate peaks. Phase 2 builds on phase 1, adding closer integration and systematic optimization to the algorithms for forecasting, BAS, and battery dispatch. This integration will allow the integrated CPS to manipulate the BAS process itself, thereby optimizing, e.g., light dimming, temperature set-points, and pre-cooling in unison with battery-based DR. Feasibility and future promise of such experimental control methodology will be measured by a multi-objective cost function which includes demand and energy charges, savings from DR participation, storage equipment capital expenditure (required size, achievable lifetime), and occupant comfort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating BAS- with battery-based DR is nascent, mostly because the peak demand forecast, BAS, and storage dispatch algorithms that such a CPS requires have yet to be developed. This project seeks to lay important methodological groundwork for such applications, thus furthering commercial buildings' role in the Internet of Things. The PI's participation in the NIST/US-Ignite Global City Team Challenge (with partners Urban Electric Power, Siemens Corporate Technology, City University of New York, and NY-Best) furthers public engagement with such technology and will help catalyze its translation into the commercial space.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the US, buildings are responsible for ~40% of all greenhouse gas emissions and ~70% of electricity use. Modern building automation systems have the potential to reduce overall electricity consumption, for example by smarter controls of heating/cooling and lighting. In addition, and particularly in conjunction with local battery storage, buildings can conceivably modify their electricity consumption profile during the course of the day in a way that makes electricity grids more resilient and that facilitates transitioning the grid towards more renewables such as wind and solar energy.  While basic algorithms and software packages to design such smart building automation have been available, the following fundamental questions with regards to practical applicability and thus real word impact have not previously been answered:  Q1) Given today's battery technology and cost, the consumption profiles of commercial buildings, and actual electricity tariffs in metropolitan areas such as New York, can such smart building automation be cost effective for building owners?  Q2) By how much can undesirable demand peaks on the grid be reduced?  Q3) Can the control algorithms be made fast and accurate enough to enable such building automation in an actual physical building, adapting to weather and occupants' needs in real time?  Q4) Could all this be achieved without unduly impacting occupant comfort such as thermal environment or unreasonable curtailment of electricity consumption?   This NSF Eager project answered above questions quantitatively via a novel combination of existing energy models and control theory. One particular emerging focus during the project was the successful integration of traditional software packages such as Energy+ with more novel approaches such as data-driven, machine learning-based surrogate models.  Using typical US East Coast commercial buildings and Consolidated Edison electricity tariffs as a proof of concept test bed, we developed a novel modeling and control environment. We achieved the following quantitative results:  R1) When integrating building automation such as optimized cooling schedules with optimally dispatched battery storage, operators can reduce a commercial building's annual electricity cost by 10.7%, more than enough to offset system installation and financing.  R2) At the same time, the building's monthly peak demand on the grid can be reduced by up to 26%, thus alleviating grid congestion and risk of brownouts.  R3) Substituting the Energy+ software with novel, faster algorithms and limiting the degrees of freedom in the optimization renders the technology fast enough to be used in real world applications.  R4) Loss to occupancy comfort can be kept to a minimum. In particular, electricity consumption by occupants does not have to be curtailed while still alleviating grid congestion via batteries.  In keeping with the spirit of NSF Eager projects, above results were achieved by combining three broad disciplines, building energy modeling, data-driven surrogate models, and smart cyberphysical system (CPS)-based control and optimization strategies. Advances in all three disciplines were achieved. Together, they were shown to enable more energy and cost-efficient commercial buildings, and a safer, cleaner grid with higher potential for renewables.
