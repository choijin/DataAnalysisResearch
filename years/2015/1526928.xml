<AbstractNarration>The problem of ensuring that computer hardware is not surreptitiously malicious is a growing concern. The case of random number generators (RNGs) is particularly important because random numbers are foundational to information security.  All current solutions in practice require trusting the hardware, and are therefore vulnerable to hardware attacks. This project explores a quantum-based solution to hardware security by designing and implementing a new class of RNGs that can prove their own integrity to the user.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate randomness generation in several settings: using a perfect seed, using a weak seed, and distributed key distribution. The goals are to achieve a high level of security with a minimal set of assumptions. The approach is based on Bell inequality violations and builds upon the investigators previous theoretical results. This project develops new methods for both the mathematical analysis and experimental techniques in order to close the gaps between theory and practice. The contributions include new insights and techniques for proving quantum security and for overcoming practical challenges for realizing Bell violations. This new approach could pioneer a new application domain and train an early generation of diversified practitioners for the rapidly growing quantum information technology industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Random numbers are widely used in the business, security and cryptographic communities.  Unfortunately there is no way to test whether a specific sequence of numbers was generated randomly.  It is, however, possible to prove that certain techniques and hardware implementations will generate random numbers.  Most of these techniques rely on the assumption that the hardware was constructed as specified.   This is a serious limitation, since in most cases the hardware is procured from a third party vendor who may not be fully trusted.  The focus of our research is to theoretically and experimentally investigate and expand techniques for generating provably random numbers using untrusted hardware.  In particular, we rely on the properties of quantum systems, primarily entanglement and superposition, in our work.  These properties lead to "spooky" behavior that is counter-intuitive and cannot be explained using classical techniques.   The key observation is that if two devices exhibit non-classical probability correlations (without communicating), then they must be making quantum measurements and therefore exhibiting random behavior.  This allows the generation of random numbers even when the devices themselves are not trusted, i.e., when one cannot guarantee that they were built as specified.  Much of the theoretical work we performed for this project focused on developing the theory of trustworthy random number generation to make it applicable to a broad range of applications and trust models.  We addressed the following questions: What are minimal resources that are needed to generate truly random numbers?  How can we further improve the level of security in these protocols?  Our team proved new theoretical results that we presented at conferences during the grant period and published in academic journals.  A second focus of the theoretical work was to develop new random number generation algorithms that could be more easily implemented.  The goal is to find algorithms and implementations that can be realized using commercial hardware, avoiding stringent and costly requirements on the individual hardware components, e.g., high optical detector efficiency.  As part of our effort, we constructed an experimental apparatus, i.e., an optical Bell's test device, using polarization entangled photons.  Using this experimental apparatus (see photo attached), we exhibited the quantum correlations (as opposed to classical behavior) needed to generate random numbers.  Furthermore, this grant provided the opportunity to educate Ph.D.-bound electrical engineering and computer science students in this important technological area.
