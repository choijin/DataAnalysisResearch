<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a novel, lower energy method of creating nanowires that will enable reliable, cost-effective and scalable manufacturing of nanowire sensors.  Low-cost nanowire sensor technology is important because it has the potential to improve multiple types of detection systems, with impacts in disease detection, food safety, antiterrorism capabilities, higher crop yields (due to earlier detection of pathogens), and better protection for emergency responders and industrial plant workers (due to better chemical detection). The project will result in a proof-of-concept electrochemical nanosensor for gas/vapor sensing with the following unique features: 1) it will be based on a combined top-down and bottom-up nanomanufacturing method that directly deposits nanowires on micro-fabricated devices, 2) it will be fabricated via a room temperature process, 3) it will utilize a reversible synthesis process that may enable in-field regeneration and reuse, 4) it will have new or broadened sensor capabilities through a modular approach enabling combinatory synthesis of a wide range of novel organic nanowires, and 5) it will be compatible with flexible electronic architectures.  These features will provide the following advantages: low-cost, scalable, reusable, modular, and applicable to a diverse range of chemicals as compared to other competing sensor technologies in this market space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanowires have been applied to sensing for over 10 years but few nanowire sensors have reached the market. The major barriers are the complexity of manufacturing and difficulty in connecting nanowires in microelectronic devices. In current competing technologies, nanowires need to be aligned and placed at precise locations and orientations on the patterned substrates, a complex process to scale up. This new technology synthesizes nanowires directly on the metal substrates by using the metal micro- and nanopattern as nucleation points to grow the nanowires. It is based on seed-mediated nucleation research. When a nanoparticle is used as a seed, the high curvature of the seed imposes unsustainable strain energy on the nucleated crystal at the crystal/seed interface and results in a nanowire crystal. In addition, a graduate student involved in this project will gain technology translation experience through exposure to business methodologies, access to technology transfer networks, and a deeper engagement in the university technology transfer process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages a serial entrepreneur with prior experience in nanotechnology ventures to guide technology transfer and commercialization activities, and an established technology-enabling company to augment research capability in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>
