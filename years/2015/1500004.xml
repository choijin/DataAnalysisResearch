<AbstractNarration>The past few years have seen unprecedented growth in mobile data consumption. Powered in large part by the rapid adoption of smart phones and tablets, the growth in wireless data creates phenomenal challenges for the wireless industry, which has been unable to meet the demand for rich mobile content through cellular networks. This has led to the investigation of solutions by network operators that aim to utilize WiFi radios present in these mobile devices to deliver content without using the cellular radio links, also known as content-offloading.  Industry-led approaches aim to utilize WiFi infrastructure in the form of access points to offload this content, but these have various deployment issues. Research has lately focused on the potential of proximity-based peer content sharing, since proximity enables low-power, high speed data exchanges which in turn allows mobile devices to proactively share data with one another. No large-scale study using real-world situations has established the potential for such content-sharing to provide capacity gains, until now. This proposal aims to conduct solid, preliminary pilot studies evaluating several of the foundational claims in this area, specifically as to whether sufficient potential exists in the right time, right place, and with reasonably viable deployment scenarios. The proposed work will gather and evaluate pilot data in both highly amenable environments (WiFi across multiple tailgate offerings of hundreds of users) as well as more challenging environments (daily commuter trains to / from Chicago).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the work will be to either demonstrate the potential viability for proximity-based solutions or to present compelling evidence that such proximity solutions are unlikely to yield significant benefits. Further broader impacts for the work include data sharing capabilities with respect to temporal characterizations of redundancy across mobile devices in several real-world scenarios.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the major challenges facing wireless devices is that the volume of data that we wish to access keeps increasing but the amount of wireless spectrum we have available does not increase at the same rate.  The focus of this work was to conduct pilot studies to see the extent that mobile devices could exchange data when close to one another in the hopes of caching or pre-staging information.  A common example might be that of a viral video whereby one gets the video from a friend rather than having to use the cellular connection to directly download the video.    In this work, we conducted various experiments gathering data across several common environments including a local commuter train, campus locations with plenty of people, and a football tailgate.  This data was gathered over a period of two years and provided exceptional insight into the changing patterns of access on mobile devices.  The result of our pilot study showed that while there are some benefits to letting devices automatically exchange / share data with one another, the complexity and battery consumption were unlikely to justify an approach in most cases.  The sole exception was that of the football tailgate which also tends to be one of the most challenged environments.    The end result is that we recommend that researchers avoid focusing on these distributed or ad hoc approaches but rather focus on how an operator or institution might push or pre-stage data to take advantage of most devices having significant free space available.  We believe that one could see reductions on the order of 20% or beyond which would be quite helpful in dense scenarios where cellular and WiFi are already quite challenged.
