<AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together researchers who are currently promoting various types of idealized experiments and diagnostic studies to address this problem by individual scientists and groups, in order to compare their results, and formulate productive coordinated experiments that can become part of the experiment design for the decadal prediction experiments for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). In order to provide robust decadal climate predictions, the research community must improve the capabilities of decadal climate predictions. Improved understanding of the processes and mechanisms in the climate system that lead decadal climate variability is crucial. NSF funds will provide travel support of early career scientists at the workshop to be held in Aspen CO, June 7-12, 2015. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to bring together the World Climate Research Program Decadal Climate Prediction Panel to compare their results and formulate productive coordinated experiments to further the understanding regarding processes and mechanisms that could produce prediction skill on decadal timescales. Approximately 30 scientists from the DCPP, which is made up of the Working Group on Coupled Models and the Working Group on Seasonal to Interannual Prediction will participate from the United States as well as from key international modeling groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes  The outcomes of this project included the successful convening of an interdisciplinary scientific workshop, furthered scientific understanding on decadal climate prediction, publication of findings in scientific periodicals, and incorporation of new ideas about decadal climate variability into upcoming experimental designs.  During June 7-12, 2015 AGCI hosted a workshop entitled, "Decadal Climate Prediction: Improving Our Understanding of Processes and Mechanisms to Make Better Predictions," in Aspen, Colorado. Post-workshop evaluation revealed the workshop?s success in advancing discussions on this topic and developing new partnerships across disciplines.   Intellectual Merit  This meeting brought together 32 national and international scientists who are members of the Decadal Climate Prediction Project (DCPP). The workshop was designed to develop key methods and research questions for DCPP, a part of the 6th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The DCPP has been organized around three components: A) to build on the pioneering work of CMIP5 with a refined approach based on learning from that phase; B) to provide decadal prediction results that may be useful for meeting societal demands for climate services and related needs; and C) to generate better understanding of mechanisms and processes in the Earth system at decadal time scales. A central focus of the AGCI workshop was consideration of how to pursue this third component, C.  The meeting explored the existing and near term capability of the major supercomputing centers (Japan, Germany, UK, U.S., other EU countries, China) focused on climate modeling to develop skill at forecasting in the near term. It is currently comparatively easier to apply Earth?s given path of carbon emissions to project global average temperature over the next 100 years than it is to use this information to project temperatures on inter-annual to decadal timescales (2 to 30 years). A key reason for this challenge is that at shorter timescales the climate system is dominated by natural variability rather than anthropogenic forcing (greenhouse gases and land use). Initializing the models with a good representation of the Earth?s systems, particularly the ocean state, requires a synthesis of observations with modeling and also a better fundamental understanding of how natural events and processes like volcanoes and ocean cycles drive natural variability.  Broader Impacts   Progress in this new field of decadal climate prediction shows promise for eventually informing climate impact analysis in many sectors including agriculture, water resources, ecosystems, and energy.  A meeting report on the Decadal Climate Predictions workshop was published by the co-chairs in the December 2015 issue of Eos: https://eos.org/meeting-reports/toward-improving-decadal-climate-predictions. An additional paper based on workshop discussions has been submitted to Geoscientific Model Development (GMD). The GMD paper in development will describe the DCPP experimental design ideas for CMIP6 discussed at the AGCI workshop.[1]  Additional outreach to the broader research community is achieved through digital video and slides of the technical presentations, available on agci.org.  The workshop and outcomes directly benefit the climate modeling community as well as contribute to the strategic vision of the USGCRP in advancing of climate predictions.
