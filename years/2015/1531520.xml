<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, the University of Montana will acquire a time-resolved  confocal microscope.  The instrument consists of a pulsed laser light source and a microscope.  The microscope detects the light that is emitted (fluorescence) from a sample after irradiation by the light source. The instrument facilitates investigation of cellular complexes down to single-molecules using time-resolved fluorescence techniques. It will be used in the investigation of molecular and biomolecular interactions and mechanisms in the chemical, biochemical and biological sciences. The instrument will be used by undergraduate and graduate students in their research. This training will assist them in future careers as fluorescence microscopy techniques are widely used in the biotechnology and materials industry. The acquisition will be used in outreach activities including programs to recruit Native American students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studying immobilized bifunctional catalysts, photocatalysts and metal sensors; (b) studying binding and dynamics of cytochrome c on cardiolipin nanodiscs; (c) investigating biogenic amines, the extracellular matrix, and neuronal development; (d) investigating the mechanisms for dynamic localization of stem cell regulator FBF-2 in C. elegans; and (e) studying the mechanism and dynamics of G-protein activation by Ric-8A.</AbstractNarration>
