<AbstractNarration>1515869 &lt;br/&gt;Jay, Steven M.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award supports the 2015 annual Conference of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) held in Bethesda, MD.    The Conference brings together scientists, clinicians, industry, and government stakeholders to facilitate dialogue for establishing new and innovative research platforms and technologies and identifying new challenges in the field. One of the goals of the meeting is to educate students, young investigators, investigators from underrepresented groups, and female investigators in the latest developments of this topic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will focus on all aspects of extracellular vesicle (EV) research, including fundamental research on the cellular processes that lead to EV biogenesis, EV biomanufacturing, and deployment of EVs as biopharmaceuticals.  Specific Conference topics will include Purification and Characterization Methods of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), Scalable Biomanufacturing of EVs, EVs in Drug and Gene Delivery, EVs as Biomarkers, Preclinical Animal Models of EV-related Physiology, Mathematical and Computational Modeling of EV Trafficking and Physiological Roles of EVs.</AbstractNarration>

Awardees were chosen based scores of submitted abstracts and/or on the basis of a submitted statement on how conference attendance would benefit their professional development.

At least one undergraduate student reported a desire to pursue graduate studies in EV research based in part on the conference experience, and several others reported positive feedback from poster session interactions and &ldquo;Meet the Experts&rdquo; sessions. The &ldquo;Education Day&rdquo; was also very popular with the awardees, who noted that it allowed for them to hear directly from experienced researchers in the field and gain a high level of knowledge over a short timeframe.

This year, the conference brought together over 800 researchers, scientists, trainees, and students from academia, industry, and government to discuss key developments in the field.

The meeting was highlighted by four plenary speakers, including Nationa Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Dr. Francis Collins, Nobel Laureate Dr. James Rothman, and National Academy of Science members Dr. Gary Ruvkin and Dr. Xandra Breakefield. There were 20 poster sessions as well as 27 oral sessions during the 3.5 day conference, with a total of 487 abstracts presented, including 65 late-breaking abstracts. Additionally, new this year were 9 &ldquo;Meet the Experts&rdquo; sessions where eminent scholars in subdisciplines of EV research presented overviews of the field and engaged in the audience in discussion of critical issues and future challenges. Despite these sessions being held at 8:00am, they were well attended and audience members expressed enthusiasm for continuation of these sessions at future meetings. Another highlight was a live interview conducted with plenary speakers Collins, Rothman, Breakefield, and ISEV president Jan Lotvall to address key issues in the field. This was done at the end of a plenary session and featured over 500 attendees. In addition, an &ldquo;Education Day&rdquo; was held in conjunction with the NIH Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium that featured over 400 attendees and allowed for those new to the field to learn all the latest developments in various areas from experts.
