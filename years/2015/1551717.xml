<AbstractNarration>Continental drift between the eastern United States and northwest Africa about 180 million years ago was a key event in Earth's plate tectonic history. The mechanical and volcanic processes that shaped the continental margins of the eastern U.S. left a record of volcanic crust and deep sedimentary rocks beneath the coastal plain, and offshore in the Atlantic Ocean. This project will examine the deep structure of the passive margin and provide a better understanding of the early tectonic evolution, heat flow, and sediment accumulation along the east coast of the United States. Understanding the geologic history will improve our knowledge of natural resources and ancient submarine landslides that affected the continental slope. The project supports the training of a graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the researcher and graduate student will investigate the deep structure and origin of the Blake Spur Magnetic Anomaly, which lies offshore the eastern United States. Seismic data collected during the Eastern North American Margin community experiment will be used to image the crust and upper mantle beneath this magnetic anomaly. A preliminary inspection of the seismic data suggests that seismic waves here can travel through the mantle with a speed that is higher parallel to the magnetic anomaly than perpendicular to it. This form of seismic anisotropy can be used to test whether mantle melt infiltration or stretching of the mantle rock created the rock fabric of the rifted margin.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this project we used seismic data to determine the nature of the crystalline basement that lies beneath the continental slope and abyssal plain offshore North Carolina and Virginia. These seismic data are part of the ENAM community seismic data set. By measuring the arrival times between acoustic sources and ocean-bottom seismometers, we can determine the speed of compressional and shear waves through the Earth?s sediment, crustal and mantle layers. The seismic wavespeed gives us an indication of the composition of crustal rocks that formed in the Early Jurassic (170 million years ago) when the supercontinent Pangea broke up, and formed the oldest seafloor of the Atlantic Ocean. The surprising result of this seismic data analysis is that the crust offshore eastern North America is not particularly thick (7 km), but seismic waves travel at speeds greater than 7.2 km/s through the lower crust, which is faster than in most ocean basins. Using these parameters, we developed a petrological model for the breakup of Pangea, which describes how mantle melts formed during rifting, and crystallized to formed new crust offshore eastern North America. This model indicates that the mantle temperature was ~50?C hotter than normal during the breakup of Pangea. We suggest that the insulation of the deep mantle by this large continent caused the temperature increase.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/14/2019<br>      Modified by: Harm&nbsp;J&nbsp;Van Avendonk</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1551717/1551717_10417040_1565821492667_Figure10revised--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1551717/1551717_10417040_1565821492667_Figure10revised--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Schematic figure of breakup of Pangea"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1551717/1551717_10417040_1565821492667_Figure10revised--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Schematic figure of breakup of Pangea"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic cartoon representing the tectonic setting during formation of proto-oceanic crust, which forms on the thinning lithospheric lid until rupture of the continent.
