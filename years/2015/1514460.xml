<AbstractNarration>Software is comprised of a multitude of artifacts; some of them are intended to be read by the compiler, while many others are intended to be read by developers.  The user centric information is often expressed in natural language and it is usually much larger in size than the source code.  Given the amount of unstructured data present in existing software systems, tools are necessary for its storage, retrieval, and analysis, before it is delivered to the users.  This type of information is essential during software evolution, when developers need it to understand the software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will define and evaluate an infrastructure for the management of the textual information present in software systems.  The infrastructure will make use of Information Retrieval techniques in combination with statistical and rule-based Natural Language Processing methods and other text analysis techniques.  The infrastructure will be used do define a new type of conceptual model of a software system that will complement the structural, behavioral, and architectural models, which can be extracted and built with traditional analysis and modeling methods.  The new conceptual model and infrastructure will be used to define novel methodologies and build tools to support a variety of software evolution tasks, such as: change propagation in software, traceability link recovery between software artifacts, error and change prediction, quality measurement, concept location, refactoring, and program comprehension in general.  The planned infrastructure will offer a platform for researchers from different areas of computer science (such as, software engineering and computational linguistics) to use state of the art results from each field.  The empirical work will result in a repository of software artifacts and analysis data of textual nature from software to be used to support rigorously controlled experimentation and benchmarking in the research community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project focused on raising unstructured information (such as, natural language text) analysis in software engineering, to the same level of importance as source code analysis.  The research produced notable results in terms of: (1) tools and techniques that software developers can use in their everyday activities; (2) education material that educators can use in their classrooms; (3) development of human resources.     The project resulted in technology that allow developers to better identify parts of the source code that implement specific features, including unwanted features (a.k.a., bugs).  These tools and techniques will help developers produce higher quality code.     In addition the project sparked a new research area in software engineering, that is, the automatic summarization of software artifacts.  The produced tools and techniques allow developers to automatically document complex source code artifacts, usages of library software, and changes between two releases of a software system.  This technology has been already used in industry setting and it is ready for industry transfer.     The project resulted in teaching material to be used in educating software engineering students, researchers, and practitioners on the applications of text retrieval and analysis in solving software engineering problems.  Two graduated software engineering courses were taught using this material.  In addition, the material was presented (in a condensed form) at three summer schools and nine major software engineering conferences as tutorials or technical briefings.  Dozens of additional conference presentation and research seminars included parts of this material.  Overall, about one thousand people were directly exposed to this material via presentations of the PI and his students and collaborators.     Finally, the project supported the research work of four graduate students and two undergraduate students.  Two of the graduate students graduated with their Ph.D. degrees and are currently working as Assistant Professor in the US Academia, while one of the graduate students graduated with an M.S. degree.  All three graduate students are from underrepresented categories of students in computing, that is, they are women.
