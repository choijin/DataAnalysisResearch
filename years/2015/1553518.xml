<AbstractNarration>Plant species compete for nutrients, water and light, yet differ in competitive ability. Ecological theory predicts that the superior competitor should drive inferior competitors to local extinction (i.e. the best fighter wins!)  Yet, plant communities contain many species with varying competitive abilities, so a central question in ecology is: How do competing species coexist in nature?  For example, co-occurring plant species differ dramatically in seed size, and larger seeded species are often better competitors and also sometimes better at tolerating stressful conditions than smaller seeded species.  Given these inequalities, how is seed size variation maintained? A leading theory is that small-seeded species have better dispersal abilities than large-seeded species, enabling them to reach local sites where large-seeded species are absent.  This theory, however, ignores the fact that large-seeded species often have substantially more of their seeds eaten by rodents than do small-seeded species.  Thus, this research will experimentally test the novel idea that large and small-seeded species coexist because rodent seed predators preferentially feed on large seeded species, thereby countering the imbalance in competitive ability among these species based on their seed size.  This research will generate a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that promote coexistence and a fuller appreciation for the ecological forces that determine the relative abundance and diversity of species in communities.  This work will also be used to increase public understanding of grassland ecology and enhance knowledge of how plant communities are organized, which is essential for effectively managing these habitats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seed size and number have long been considered central to coexistence strategies, yet empirical evidence showing how these traits are shaped by specific coexistence mechanisms remains scarce. Within sites, seeds of 18 co-occurring forb species (9 small-seeded, 9 large-seeded) will be added to plots with and without resident bunchgrass competitors to test how species vary in competitive tolerance.  Across 12 sites that vary in productivity and other abiotic factors, seeds of the same focal species will be added to plots at different densities where competition from resident dominant bunchgrasses and rodent seed predation are manipulated. This will allow an evaluation of how competition, seed predation, and ability to handle stressful abiotic conditions influences recruitment functions of species with different seed sizes.  It will also enable an exploration of whether seed size is part of a suite of correlated traits that form "syndromes" that predict demographic performance under distinct biotic and/or abiotic conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of our project was to determine how co-occurring grassland plant species that vary in their seed size and in the number of seeds they produce co-exist.  If all else was equal, one might expect small-seeded species that produce copious amounts of seeds to outcompete large-seeded species that produce few seeds, but this is not what is found in nature.  Thus, a key question that has been unanswered is how species that vary in seed production and seed size co-exist (and hence contribute to high plant species diversity at the local level). In perennial grasslands, herbaceous flowering plant species germinate and establish in the interstitial spaces among large and long-lived bunchgrasses (in the grasslands where we worked, the dominant bunchgrass is rough fescue, Festuca campestris). Our research involved adding seeds of 18 species that varied in seed size/seed number to plots where we experimentally removed (or not) rough fescue and also either excluded (or not) access by small rodent seed predators (mice).  Our goal was to examine how competition and post-dispersal seed predation influenced coexistence among our 18 focal species.  Competition from rough fescue reduced the number of seedling that established in experimental plots, and subsequent adult plant survivorship, but more so for small vs. large-seeded species. In contrast, predation on dispersed seeds by deer mice greatly reduced the number of seedlings of large-seeded species that established in our plots but this was not the case for small-seeded species.  Plant height and leaf thickness, two important traits related to plant competitive ability, did not predict differences among species in competitive tolerance to rough fescue. For the forb species we studied, the number of seeds added to experimental plots correlated positively to the number of seedlings that established.  Since we added seeds to experimental plots at densities that mimicked differences among species in seed production, this result indicates that small-seeded species that produce more seeds leave more seedlings in subsequent generations than do large-seeded species that produce fewer seeds. We also found that survival of both seedlings and adult plants was independent of the number of individuals of our focal species that established in plots. Even at very high density, individuals of our focal species did not crowd each other out. Thus, why don’t these smaller-seeded species dominate natural communities? The answer appears to be because small-seeded species are more negatively affected by rough fescue competition than are large-seeded species.  Across sites that varied naturally in fescue cover, the abundance of small-seeded species decreased at sites with increasing fescue cover, whereas this was not the case for large-seeded species. For adult plants, the average (across all individuals and species) seed size, height and leaf thickness was greater in plots with rough fescue present versus in plots where we experimentally removed rough fescue.  Most importantly, at the end of the experiment, the abundance of each focal species in our experimental plots positively correlated with the number of seeds that each species typically produces.  However, this only occurred in plots where we had removed rough fescue.  Thus, in the absence of competition, adult plant abundance scales positively with seed production, indicating the inherent advantages accrued to species that produce many versus few seeds. However, in the presence of rough fescue competition, abundances of focal species were similar regardless of their inherent differences in fecundity.  This was because high seed producing small-seeded species were more negatively affected by rough fescue competition than low seed producing larger-seeded species.  Thus, our key finding was that species that vary in seed size and the number of seeds they produce likely co-exist because highly fecund small-seeded species are less tolerant of competition from the dominant community member, rough fescue, than lower fecundity larger-seeded species.  We communicated the goals and findings of our research via outreach activities involving the Montana Natural History Center (MNHC).  In collaboration with MNHC staff, we created interactive educational displays at the museum that were aimed at teaching the general public about grassland ecology in general and the general conceptual issues that our project touched on.  We also worked with MNHC staff to train MNHC Naturalists in the field, and develop educational materials for school kids. Our project annually employed undergraduates and post-baccalaureate students and helped provide training and experiences that furthered career opportunities for these students.  The project also helped train several graduate students at the University of Montana.          Last Modified: 07/30/2021       Submitted by: John L Maron]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
