<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the 11th International Conference on Computability, Complexity, and Randomness, held on the campus of the University of Hawaii at Manoa during January 4-8, 2016. The conference features invited talks, contributed talks, and a tutorial. The conference covers topics such as computability theory, computational complexity theory, algorithmic randomness, and interactions between logic and analysis. Participants may submit abstracts for talks which upon acceptance by the program committee may be presented at the conference. Selected papers based on the talks will be published in a post-conference journal volume. The conference organizers are committed to helping to advance the careers of young researchers, women, and minorities in mathematics. Priority for financial support to attend the conference will be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to faculty at smaller institutions who do not have other sources of financial support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CCR conference series has become a fixture in the community of algorithmic randomness researchers since its inception in 2004. Many of the most prominent workers in this field make a habit of attending it most years. The conference promotes applications of algorithmic randomness and computability theory in other areas of mathematics, and in other disciplines such as statistics, economics, and finance. The invited presentations provide a platform for the latest developments in the field. Moreover, the contributed talk session gives graduate students and young researchers an opportunity to expose themselves to the most recent research trends and present their own work, thereby contributing to their training and professional development. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website is located at http://math.hawaii.edu/wordpress/ccr-2016/</AbstractNarration>

Financial support was given by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. 1545707 and by the Simons Foundation under a Collaboration Grant for Mathematicians (#315188 to Bj&oslash;rn Kjos-Hanssen). The auditorium fees and coffee services were sponsored by the Mathematics Department at University of Hawaii at Manoa. The local organizing committee consisted of Bj&oslash;rn Kjos-Hanssen (chair and PI), Mushfeq Khan (co-PI), Achilles Beros, Dale Myers, David Ross, and Dusko Pavlovic.  It was the eleventh in a series of meetings started in 2004 with the aim of supporting research in algorithmic randomness and related areas.  The conference had the scientific sponsorship ofthe Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL), the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM), the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS), andthe European Association for Computer Science Logic.  The members of the Program Committee were:Laurent Bienvenu (Paris, France), Rod Downey (Wellington, New Zealand) (co-chair), Johanna Franklin (Hempstead, New York, USA), Denis Hirschfeldt (Chicago, Illinois, USA) (co-chair), Bj&oslash;rn Kjos-Hanssen (Honolulu, Hawaii, USA), Jack Lutz (Ames, Iowa, USA), Elvira Mayordomo (Zaragoza, Spain), Joe Miller (Madison, Wisconsin, USA), Kenshi Miyabe (Tokyo, Japan), Andrei Romashchenko (Montpellier, France), Henry Towsner (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA), andNikolai Vereshchagin (Moscow, Russia).  There were eight invited talks: Uri Andrews (University of Wisconsin, Madison &mdash; USA), Connections Between Computation and Geometry. Rutger Kuyper (University of Wisconsin, Madison &mdash; USA), Symmetric differences and random sets. Satyadev Nandakumar (Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur), Pseudorandomness and Dimension. Ron Peretz (Bar-Ilan University &mdash; Israel), Effective martingales with restricted wagers. Crist&oacute;bal Rojas (Universidad Andr&eacute;s Bello &mdash; Chile), Computability and complexity of random perturbations of dynamical systems. Jeffrey Shallit (University of Waterloo &ndash; Ontario, Canada), Separating Words With Automata. Dan Turetsky (Victoria University of Wellington &mdash; New Zealand), The complexity of free abelian groups. Linda Westrick (Victoria University of Wellington &mdash; New Zealand), Seas of squares with sizes from a co-enumerable set.  The program also included three tutorial lectures by Lance Fortnow (Georgia Tech) on Bounding Rationality With Computation, and a public talk by Fortnow of the same title. The public talk was filmed by local television station ThinkTech Hawaii, and program committee chair Rod Downey gave an interview.  After the conference several participants stayed another week for an informal post-conference workshop focusing on automatic complexity.  A special issue of the journal Theory of Computing Systems is planned for peer-reviewed full versions of a selection of paperspresented at, or related to the topics of, the meeting.
