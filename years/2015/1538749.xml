<AbstractNarration>The number of U.S. doctoral students with temporary visas has steadily increased over the last two decades; approximately half of these individuals stay in the U.S. after receipt of their doctorate. However, the roles of economic, nationalistic or scientific influences on the decision to stay or to leave are not widely understood. The objectives of this project are to 1) generate a baseline forecast of temporary U.S. visa holders with U.S. doctoral degrees who return home, 2) build an explanatory model for the decision to return home by these individuals, and 3) use the results of the model to enhance our ability to predict future trends about temporary visa holders intention to either stay in the U.S. or return home.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major focus of this work is to provide policy relevant information and tools on how the changing status of economic and political activity abroad influences individual decisions to leave the U.S. Further the work will contribute to our understanding of how early scientific training and the quality of training also influence the decision to return home. Data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) will be used for the study.  The development of a forecast from this data will provide evidence as to whether or not the return phenomena is stable, growing or in decline over time. The explanatory model will provide a mechanism for linking policy relevant variables (e.g. nature, amount and conditions of financial support for doctoral education, quality of training, role of foreign governments) to individual likelihoods of return after receiving a U.S. degree.  Finally, the results can help enhance data quality for regularly collected information from the SED by quantification of bias.  It is also useful to note that this project will support one full time doctoral student who will become proficient using SED and SDR data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on three topics related to foreign individuals who receive a Ph.D. from a US research university.  The first described trends in the rate at which these individuals have been returning home over the past 10 years. The second developed and tested an explanatory model for why these individual make the choice to return home. The final part evaluated the use of an intention based forecast, made by each individual at the time of graduation, to return home with a focus on understanding both false positive (intended to return by stayed) and false negative (intended to stay but returned) decisions.  Data used for the study are drawn primarily from the 2013 Survey of Doctoral Recipients (SDR), the 2013 International Survey of Doctoral Recipients (ISDR), and Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) from 2000 through 2013.  Results for the first analysis suggests that with the major exception of China, the rate of return by graduation year cohorts has been declining over the past decade by around one percentage point per year hence more and more scientist and technical non-US Ph.D. graduates are staying in the US.  Chinese citizens who receive US Ph.D.?s have experienced a growing return rate of roughly 0.6% a year for each new graduating cohort between 2001 and 2011.  Our theoretical framework for explaining the decision to return home identifies four categories of relevant variables: economic factors (e.g. wage and job type), factor related to connectedness with their home country (e.g. earlier higher education degrees and country effects), measures of embeddedness within professional research networks (e.g. research quality of degree program and nature of degree funding), and policy related variables.  In particular we are interested in the extent to which foreign countries make returning home more attractive by increasing their science infrastructure.  Findings suggest that salary, the research quality of their degree granting university, and the main funding mechanism for their degree have little effect; while, however, market conditions at home, funding from abroad for their degree, investment in science infrastructure at home and connectedness through various institutions increase the likelihood of return.  Subsample analysis suggest that the policy variables and local labor market effects are being driven primarily by the large number of individuals in the sample from China.  In the final analysis, intention forecasts to return (return/stay) made at the time of graduation from their Ph.D. program were matched to actual decisions (return/stay).  This generated four outcomes, two which accurately predicted their future decision (85%) and two errors.  Modeling these outcomes we focused on understanding where the intention forecasts generate false positive errors (intend to return but stay &ndash; 6%) and false negative errors (intend to stay but return &ndash; 9%). For the false negatives the main positive factors leading to this outcome relative to those who intend to stay and do stay are variables related to connectedness to their home country (e.g. undergraduate and master degrees from their home country) while the factors reducing this likelihood again relative to those who intend to stay and do stay are being married and fixed year effects.  There is also a strong negative effect of salary interacted with being from China.    Taken together these results suggest that trans-national and connectedness factors provide more explanatory power for understanding why these people return than simple economic criteria.  It also strongly suggest that more and more foreign nationals earing US Ph.D.s does not result in brain drain but rather, it is having an overall positive effect on increasing the US STEM workforce.
