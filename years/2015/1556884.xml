<AbstractNarration>How do two species coexist when each has a negative impact on the other?  When a new species invades a habitat, how can we predict whether it will coexist with the native species, drive one or more of them extinct, or be driven to extinction itself by the natives? This research will investigate whether coexistence is an evolved property of species interactions. This will happen if species that could not coexist on first contact can act as agents of natural selection on each other's features in a way that enables them to evolve rapidly to coexist.  Understanding when and how this evolution occurs can have a profound effect on our ability to predict the results of invasions, species re-stocking, and habitat alteration on biodiversity. This research will engage undergraduate researchers, as well as engaging the public with an outreach website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on one of the most challenging of species interactions, which occurs when the adults of two species compete with each other for food but each preys on juveniles of the other.  This research will examine how Hart's killifish and Trinidadian guppies, which interact in this manner, somehow coexist in higher elevation streams in Trinidad.  Typically, guppies encounter killifish when guppies invade locations that have held only killifish.  This research exploits the fact that comparisons can be made among killifish populations that coexist with guppies and populations that have never encountered guppies, along with comparisons between guppy populations that have not invaded killifish-only locations, populations that have been introduced into those locations in recent experiments, and populations that have coexisted with killifish for decades.  The work includes experiments in artificial streams that mix and match these populations to examine how fitness of each species depends on the combinations of its own genetic background and that of the other species.  It also includes experiments in natural pools that remove one species to measure its net effect on the other.  The researchers will also be documenting the fates of guppies and killifish in experimental introductions to assess how much evolution is actually occurring.  There will also be laboratory experiments that pair individuals of different body sizes within and among species to understand how competition and predation depend on relative body sizes of interacting individuals.  Finally, the research will synthesize these results with computational models that describe the ecological and evolutionary trajectories, which can be used as tools for understanding the fate of biodiversity in a variety of contexts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We developed a new approach to studying how two competing species can coexist.  This is an important question.  For one reason, despite considerable effort, ecologists do not know, precisely, which among the possible mechanisms that promote coexistence are the most common ones in force.  For another, global change is creating new combinations of species.  Understanding how species coexist, and when they cannot, will offer valuable insight into how we might conserve biodiversity in a changing world.  We studied a situation in which the competition between two species depends on the body size of the competitors.  This is a very common situation in nature.  Moreover, in many of these cases, individuals change their diet consistently as they grow larger.  Whether this promotes coexistence or promotes stronger competition is not well known.  A great many species of fish, amphibians, and reptiles are characterized in these ways so the problem we set out to study is a very general one.   We focused our work on Trinidadian guppies and killifish.  These two species coexist across the streams in the mountains of northern Trinidad despite the fact that traditional theory says they ought not to.  We chose this pair of species for two reasons.  First, there is an obvious paradox; traditional theory says they ought not to coexist, yet they do.  Second, we could simulate what is happening with global change by introducing guppies into locations that, heretofore, had only killifish, creating a novel combination in particular streams and enabling us to watch the evolution of coexistence.   In our theoretical work, we found that coexistence requires at least one species to shift its diet with size more than the other.  We found that when guppies invade a killifish-only location, this is precisely what happens: killifish change the size-dependency of their diet.  But we also found that this was not enough to guarantee coexistence.  We found that coexistence must somehow evolve - the initial invasion by guppies drives killifish populations downward rapidly.  We also found that the ways in which the two species interact differ between their initial contact and the situation that appears many years later.  We also uncovered what may be a critical role for the pronounced dry and wet seasons.  Guppies thrive in the dry season, killifish in the wet season.  This discovery suggests that the seasonal nature of the tropical environment could facilitate the coexistence of these species, a possibility we hope to pursue in earnest.    We offered dozens of undergraduates and many dozens of young scientists the opportunity to engage in this research.  Many of our proteges worked in the laboratory in the US; many others worked in Trinidad, where they were exposed to the rigors of tropical fieldwork, the richness of tropical biodiversity, and the beauty of the Trinidad culture.  For many of our students and young scientists, the exposure to a very different culture was as valuable as their exposure to tropical biology as a whole.  A sizeable fraction of these individuals went on to graduate and professional study for careers in science.  Several of them changed their career paths to become ecologists and evolutionary biologists.  We developed pedagogical tools for K-12 students and teachers based on the project and used our ability to speak with community groups and other organizations to promote tropical conservation.
