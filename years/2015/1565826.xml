<AbstractNarration>Metric spaces, especially those so-called Banach spaces, form the conceptual framework in which mathematicians, scientists, and engineers work when investigating problems that involve estimation or approximation.  Discrete metric geometry, including dimension reduction that has been established by the PI and a collaborator, is important in the design of algorithms and in compressed sensing. Work on the classification of operators that are commuters was originally motivated by the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics (which, from a mathematical point of view, arises because multiplication of operators, unlike multiplication of numbers, is not commutative). Nonlinear phenomenon often occurs in nature but is difficult to deal with.  This makes it important to understand when non linearity actually conceals underlying linear structure, and this is central to the nonlinear study of Banach spaces. Parts of this research project are coordinated with the Workshop in Analysis and Probability Theory at Texas A&amp;M University, of which the PI is Associate Director. The Workshop encourages interactions among researchers and apprentices in different mathematical fields by bringing together graduate students and junior and senior postdoctoral participants in several areas of analysis. Activities of the Workshop include seminars, Concentration Weeks, introductory lectures, and an annual conference.  The efforts of the principal investigators and other participants in the Workshop are helping to break down barriers between different areas of mathematics and also promote the outreach of pure mathematics to other sciences, especially to computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems in Banach space and metric geometry to be considered fall into several subcategories: commutators of operators on Banach spaces, approximation properties of Banach spaces, the structure of finite and infinite dimensional spaces of p-integrable functions, the nonlinear classification of Banach spaces, discrete metric geometry,  quantitative linear algebra, and cluster value problems in an infinite dimensional setting.  These topics are at the heart of the geometries of Banach spaces and of metric spaces and make contact with many other areas within mathematics, including operator theory, group theory, geometric analysis, and linear algebra, as well as with other areas of science, including the design of algorithms and compressed sensing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was devoted to understanding better the structure of Banach spaces and metric spaces (which always can be considered as "living in" appropriately chosen Banach spaces) and, especially,  analyzing the space of operators on classical Banach spaces.  Banach spaces form the universe in which virtually all mathematical approximation is conducted.  Formally, a Banach space is a vector space of either finite or infinite dimension upon which a norm is defined. The norm measures the size of vectors, and the distance between two vectors is simply the size of the difference of the vectors. There are many different norms on even the simplest non trivial vector space, the two dimensional plane, and the proper choice of norm depends upon the specifics of the theoretical or real world problem that is under consideration. Classical Banach spaces are the spaces that arise most often in the applications of the theory. Bounded linear operators on Banach spaces arise naturally in many contexts within mathematics, engineering, and the physical sciences.  A bounded linear operator is a function T that assigns to an input x in some Banach space X an output vector Tx that lives in a (possibly different) Banach space Y.  "Linear" means that T preserves the linear structure; i.e., T(ax + by) = aTx + bTy for all vectors x, y in X and all scalars (i.e., numbers) a and b.  "Bounded" means that the length of Tx is controlled by some constant times the length of x.  In regards to the structure of the space of bounded linear operators on classical Banach spaces, perhaps the most important single result proved is that the space L(L_1) of bounded linear operators on the Banach space L_1 of integrable functions on the unit interval has infinitely many (in fact, a continuum) of closed ideals. This solved a problem that had been open for more than 40 years. The techniques also yielded that the spaces L(X), when X is either the space of continuous functions on the unit interval or the space of bounded sequences, have a continuum of closed ideals.
