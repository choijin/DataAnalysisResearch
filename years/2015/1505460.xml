<AbstractNarration>This award supports the continued development, assessment, and dissemination of Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorials (QuILT) and peer-instruction tools for undergraduate courses to prepare future scientists and engineers for the demands of the high-tech workplace. A solid grasp of the fundamental principles of quantum physics is essential for most scientists and engineers, considering that the global economy has become increasingly dependent on science and technology based upon quantum phenomena. Single electron transistors, SQUIDs, quantum-well lasers, and other innovative quantum devices are made possible by an understanding of the underlying quantum processes. However, quantum physics is a technically difficult and abstract subject. The subject matter makes instruction quite challenging; able students constantly struggle to master basic concepts. To sustain U.S. leadership in science and technology, it is critical to  ensure that advanced undergraduate students (and graduate students) preparing for careers in science and engineering develop a solid grasp of the fundamental concepts of quantum physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QuILTs and peer-instruction tools are based upon a cognitive-apprenticeship model of learning and emphasize modeling, coaching and weaning.  To aid instructors, the concept-based and problem-based QuILTs and peer-instruction tools will be keyed with most of the common textbooks. However, every effort will be made to ensure that the different modules fit together as a coherent whole and help students organize their knowledge in a hierarchical fashion. Some tools expose students to contemporary and exciting topics such as quantum cryptography that can be taught using simple two-level systems.</AbstractNarration>

The QuILTs, e.g., on the Double-slit experiment, Mach-Zehnder interferometer  (including quantum eraser), probability distribution of measurement outcomes and  expectation values in quantum mechanics and peer-instruction tools use research as a  guide and are based on a cognitive-apprenticeship model emphasizing modeling, coaching  and weaning.

We find that these research-validated learning tools are effective in helping students develop  a solid grasp of quantum mechanics concepts. Moreover, we find that students can  co-construct knowledge while working with other students in that students working together  on research-validated learning tools figured out things that they were not able to do  individually. We also find that advanced students in quantum mechanics context were able  to transfer their learning of "which-path-information" from the context of Double-slit  experiment to Mach-Zehnder interferometer. These findings are important because they shed  light on the theoretical framework of expertise in general and how advanced physics  students learning quantum mechanics may differ from students in the introductory physics  courses in terms of their expertise in their respective contexts. We also find that students  in quantum mechanics courses have common difficulties related to fundamental concepts  similar to the universal nature of difficulties in the introductory courses.    The guidance and support provided by the QuILTs and peer-instruction tools that we  developed and validated has the potential to attract students with diverse prior preparations  to pursue physical science/engineering major and careers related to quantum  mechanics.  Dissemination is a very high priority for us. Our research and learning tools  developed continue to be disseminated through presentations, publications in journals,  and professional society websites. These learning tools have also been found to be effective  for graduate students who need to refresh concepts learned in undergraduate quantum  mechanics as a self-study tool.
