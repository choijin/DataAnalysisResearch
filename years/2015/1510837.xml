<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to investigate the flow properties of blood. Blood is a very complex fluid suspension of many ingredients, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and several proteins. It is proposed to combine experiments and theory to discover the correct model for blood that can be used to predict fluid dynamics phenomena in cases of bleeding or aneurysms, or flow around atherosclerotic plaques. The economic impact on the US from cardiovascular disease is about three hundred billion dollars annually. Even a small improvement in this area can have a very strong impact on the quality of human life and on the National economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed here to offer a systematic, multidisciplinary, collaborative, study of the Non-Newtonian blood rheology that will be based on a combined experimental and theoretical effort. From the experimental side, nonlinear and time-dependent rheological experiments are planned on carefully collected and appropriately physiologically characterized blood samples. The experiments, in addition to the more traditional ones (such as Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear, LAOS) involve new ones (like the superposition of LAOS and steady shear) specifically tailored to probe those blood flow characteristics that are most pertinent to arterial pulsatile flow. By systematically varying the frequency and the amplitude of the imposed deformations, it is proposed to collect a detailed representation for the blood rheological response that can be used to fully characterize it. From the theoretical side, particular emphasis will be placed on using the experimental data to develop thermodynamically consistent models. The models are then proposed to be used in simulating arterial blood flow behavior, in order to investigate the impact of the Non-Newtonian blood rheology in blood flow dynamics, especially under conditions and in situations where the thixotropic blood flow characteristics are anticipated to play an important role, such as flow in aneurisms and around atherosclerotic plaques. The proposed experiments and simulations will lead to the development of demonstration showcases for K-12 students that can also spread the influence of STEM in education, especially for minorities, through the targeted involvement of local minority institutions and through leveraging with minority programs within the University,</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work investigated systematically how blood flows.  First, a protocol has been established to allow repeatable results to be obtained, as blood is a living fluid and from the time it is collected continuously changes, even in the presence of anticoagulants. We were able to show that if it can be used within 4 hours from its collection, the changes are small and the results reliable.  We were then able to collect stress data by systematically varying the flow characteristics, from steady state at different levels of shear rate, to transient conditions involving both step up and step down, as well as various combinations of oscillatory and steady shear flow.  (Shear flow is obtained when two parallel plates, enclosing the fluid, slide with respect to each other, the shear rate representing the ratio of the velocity to the gap width and the shear stress the force per unit area exerted on the plates in the direction of the flow).  In this way a significant amount of experimental information has been collected for every blood sample regarding its rheology (flow behavior) for many human and several animal (from seven species) blood samples that were well characterized physiologically.  Those detailed data were then used to test existing models of flow behavior, as well as to develop three new ones, of various degrees of complexity and capabilities. Invariably, the new models have outperformed existing ones in fitting the experimental results.  An example is shown in the first image, which depicts stress data corresponding to a transition from low (step up) or high (step down) initial shear rate to the same final one.  Note first the complexity of the data, given that the corresponding responses of a simple viscous fluid would have been represented by the same straight horizontal line, indicating the complexity of the blood rheology.  Second, the new models (and especially the second one) seem to be able to capture well this complex rheological behavior.  In addition, an effort has been made to reduce the number of phenomenological parameters through the use of a more physically-based multiscale population-balance approach.  This aims to better represent the aggregation of the red blood cells into rouleaux structures, the main reason behind yield stress and thixotropy encountered in blood (making its flow behavior a bit similar to ketchup albeit to a much lesser effect).  The new models allow us to better describe the rheology of blood leading to better predictions in blood flow simulations, more faithfully representing the blood flow behavior and better adapted to individual blood sample characteristics.  The connection of the model parameters, as extracted from fitting the experimental results, to the blood physiology is also important as it can potentially lead to the use of the blood rheology as a diagnostic tool for blood pathology.  The parallel investigation of animal blood flow behavior revealed differences and similarities to that corresponding to human blood.  This is of interest when animals are used in medical work.  Furthermore, of general scientific interest is the development of an allometric relation between the viscosity of animal blood at a low shear rate and the animal mass, found to exist for most animals, as shown in the second image (the viscosity is defined as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate and the data have been normalized with respect to the blood hematocrit, the most important rheological parameter). Upon further analysis, this relation has been found to lead to more constant values for the wall stress as calculated for all vessels of the arterial network and for all animals for which the allometric relation applies.  This is of special significance to cardiovascular physiology, given the close connection that exists between variations in the wall shear stress and atherosclerosis.   The models, their model parameters (as extracted from fitting experimental data) and selective detailed experimental measurements are made available to the scientific community through 5 publications in refereed journals and through the supplemental information therein.  In addition, many presentations (oral and posters) in scientific meetings have also helped in disseminating the results.  The grant helped train one PhD graduate student, one master student and several undergraduate students as well as a (female) school intern.
