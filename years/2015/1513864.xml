<AbstractNarration>This project concerns a theoretical study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QPG), a state of matter thought to have occurred a few microseconds after the Big Bang. At that early stage of the Universe, quarks and gluons then combined to form the basic building blocks of nature, the hadrons that we observe in Nature today. This transition is being studied in ongoing experiments with heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This project will provide theoretical support to these experimental programs by calculating fundamental observables from first principles and systematically relating them to experimental measurements. By taking advantage of the unprecedented level of accuracy achieved in both theory and experiment, this project is expected to advance significantly our understanding of the QGP and will shed light on the nature of the phase transition and the degrees of freedom governing the mechanism of hadronic matter formation. The project will involve students in an international research activity addressing fundamental questions in high energy, nuclear and astrophysics. The PI is actively involved in outreach activities designed to promote physics in Houston schools and she will give public lectures and seminars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a microscopic understanding of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. The methodology employed here is to calculate relevant observables from first principles and map them to experimental measurements through phenomenological models. The specific objectives are as follows: determine the temperatures and densities at which hadrons are formed and relate them to the ones at which hadron yields are fixed by experiments; constrain the existence and position of the critical point at which the order of the phase transition changes; establish whether the interaction is strong enough to enable sequential, possibly flavor specific, hadron formation in the QGP. Besides having immediate applications to RHIC and LHC experiments, the project will also help us understand the nature of matter formation in the early Universe, which might clarify a variety of astrophysical phenomena pertaining to the interiors of stars and the matter distribution in the Universe.</AbstractNarration>

A few microseconds after the Big Bang, the Universe was in a QGP state. Quarks and gluons then combined to form the basic building blocks of nature, the hadrons. Today we can study this transition in the laboratory, in ongoing Heavy-Ion Collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).</p> <p>Intellectual merit</p> <p>The project has provided the calculation of several observables by numerically solving the fundamental theory of strong interactions on a discretized grid. These quantities have been connected to experimental measurements from RHIC and the LHC. The synergy between theory and experiment has been crucial, in order to achieve the project milestones and answer the physics questions which were at the basis of this investigation.</p> <p>The temperature at which the QGP is created at finite density, namely when the balance between matter and anti-matter is broken, was estimated for the first time up to densities which are relevant to the experimental program at RHIC. Similarly, the equation of state of strongly interacting matter has been obtained at finite density from first principles. One of the main goals of the project was to relate the temperatures and densities at which hadrons are formed to the ones at which hadron yields are fixed in experiment; this has been done for light particles, at the highest RHIC collision energies. A method has been proposed, in order to extract the same quantities for strange mesons (kaons), once the experimental data are finalized. The contribution of particles, which contain strange quarks, to the thermodynamics of strongly interacting matter has also been calculated. Our result has given clear indications for the existence of additional particles, beyond the ones currently known experimentally, and has provided information on their quark content: this will guide the future experimental search for these states. Finally, by combining the first principle results on thermodynamic quantities with a string-theory-based approach, the existence and location of a critical point in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter, which is within the reach of the next generation colliders, has been predicted.</p> <p>Broader impact</p> <p>The main impact of the project is in the field of nuclear/high energy physics. The current heavy ion experiments running at RHIC and the LHC need the support of a strong theoretical program, to which the project belongs. Several quantities calculated in this project were eagerly anticipated by the community, such as the curvature of the phase transition line and the QCD equation of state at finite density.

Furthermore, the production of strange bound states near the phase transition might shed light on the matter configurations in the core of dense stars. The results on thermodynamics and fluctuations have an impact also on the string theory field: they are being used to constrain the model parameters. This is done not only in QCD-based models, but also in holographic approaches based on the gauge/gravity duality.</p> <p>The University of Houston is the second largest minority-serving research institution in the Nation; the PI devoted particular effort to attract underrepresented students and postdocs to STEM disciplines: the group working on project-related topics was composed of seven members (the PI, one postdoc, two graduate and three undergraduate students) including four women and two Hispanic members.</p> <p>At the University of Houston, the PI is one of the instructors in the STEM Teaching Equity Project (STEP) for high school teachers, which provides K12 science teachers from disadvantaged areas professional development in science content, instructional strategies, technology and mentoring.
