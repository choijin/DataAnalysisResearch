<AbstractNarration>PI: Palecek, Sean P.  &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1547225&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent scientific advances in the discovery of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and the ability to direct hPSCs to specialized cell types offer the potential to revolutionize the study of human development and disease, drug screening and safety profiling, and cell-based regenerative therapies.  To realize this promise of hPSCs, however, efficient biomanufacturing platforms are needed to robustly generate large quantities of high quality hPSCs and their derivatives.  Traditional biomanufacturing strategies employ bioreactors to control the environment of the cell, providing extrinsic signals that direct cell fates.  Here, the investigators propose a novel intrinsic paradigm for control of hPSC fate, using recent advances in molecular biology to program an hPSC to develop into a heart muscle cell in the absence of external cues.  Successful completion of this project will provide a deeper fundamental understanding of how hPSCs make decisions to turn into more specialized cells and provide a new strategy to biomanufacture specialized cells from stem cells by engineering the cell.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a novel paradigm for controlling human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation, using cell intrinsic sensing of cell state and control of developmental signaling pathways.  The investigators will employ recent advances in understanding how canonical Wnt signaling drives hPSC commitment to mesoderm and subsequent specification to cardiac mesoderm and functional cardiomyocytes to design cells that sense their differentiation status and drive signaling to elicit desired differentiation trajectories.  The investigators will identify mesoderm and cardiac mesoderm-specific promoter elements and use these to activate expression of Wnt pathway modulators, generating hPSC lines that differentiate to functional cardiomyocytes in the absence of extrinsic signaling.  Then, the investigators will test the hypothesis that cell intrinsic control of differentiation enables more robust and scalable biomanufacturing of cardiomyocytes than extrinsic control via application of small molecules during scale down for high throughput screening application and scale up for production of cells suitable for clinical evaluation.  The broader impacts of this project include providing a blueprint for engineering hPSC lines for biomanufacturing of somatic lineages beyond cardiomyocytes. Education and outreach activities will also stem cell engineers at the graduate and undergraduate levels, and will provide outreach to K-12 students, K-12 teachers, undergraduate students, and the general public on aspects of stem cell science and biomanufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Heart muscle cells differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have the potential to revolutionize treatment of heart attacks and other causes of heart failure by restoring contractile function to damage heart tissue.  It is estimated that a heart failure patient will require about one billion transplanted stem cell-derived heart muscle cells to improve cardiac function.  While laboratory scale processes have been developed to direct hPSCs to heart muscle cells, these do not scale well to generate clinically relevant numbers of cells, nor do they provide the quality of cells needed for clinical trials.  To address these issues we developed a process to program the hPSCs to become heart muscle cells in 15-30 days in culture in the absence of any exogenous factors.   This cell-intrinsic control of differentiation uses a genetic sensor by which the cells determine when the cells take the first step from a stem cell toward heart muscle, then this sensor drives expression of another genetic element that pushes the cells to heat muscle cells.  This study demonstrates the proof-of-concept of using genome editing to program stem cells to sense their state and become cardiomyocytes without adding heart developmental factors to the bioreactor.  We anticipate that similar strategies can be employed to help improve biomanufacturing of other therapeutic cell types from hPSCs including neural, pancreatic, and eye cell types.  While our results demonstrate the simplicity of cell-intrinsic differentiation in scalable manufacturing, further optimization is needed to match the efficiency of current methods that use small molecules to drive differentiation. The advances made in this project represent an important step toward manufacturing the numbers and quality of heart muscle cells from hPSCs for evaluation of these cells in clinical settings.   In addition to the research outcomes, this project provided workforce development training for two Ph.D. students in stem cell biomanufacturing.  We developed educational materials for undergraduate and graduate courses in biotechnology.  We also developed outreach materials in stem cell biomanufacturing for high school teachers and students.             Last Modified: 12/26/2018       Submitted by: Sean P Palecek]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
