<AbstractNarration>Particle accelerators and light sources are important tools for scientific discovery across many disciplines such as biomedical, biological, chemical, and physical sciences.  Photocathodes with improved emission properties are desirable for certain next generation light sources, such as those based on Free Electron Laser (FEL) or Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) technologies.  They are also needed for high-resolution microscopy tools such as Dynamic Transmission Electron Microscopy (DTEM) devices.  Accelerators are also used by industry for a variety of manufacturing tasks.  Thermionic cathodes are typically used for industrial accelerators, although the beam properties of photocathodes would in some applications be more desirable.  Some examples are medical radiological accelerators, and electron beam machining and welding.  The cost and complication of photocathode operation discourages their use in industry.  A goal of this award is to apply a multidisciplinary research approach to discover methods to modify the photocathode surface to manipulate emission properties, making them cheaper to operate, or else improve their performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, an investigation of the use of thin film deposition to modify photo-emissive surface properties in a systematic way will be carried out.  Specifically, development of novel photocathodes including plasmonic cathodes with thin coatings, and thin epitaxial multilayered MgO/Ag/MgO structures is planned.  It may be possible to make robust, high quantum efficiency metallic plasmonic nanostructured cathodes by deposition of a thin layer of material such as BaO on the surface.  The goal is to manipulate the photocathode to operate at visible, rather than ultra-violet wavelengths, making the technology more accessible for industrial applications.  The thin flanking layers of MgO utilized in multilayered MgO/Ag/MgO structures modify the surface band structure; and emission properties vary systematically with layer thickness.  Previous research can be continued, both to investigate how robust these structures are in an accelerator environment, and to determine more fully how performance depends on properties such as the surface roughness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Advanced Accelerator Physics Research on Electron Beam Sources     Particle accelerators are major tools for research and discovery.   Accelerator-based light sources, for example, advance research in medicine, geology, environmental science, biology, chemistry, physics, and the materials sciences.  The properties of the electron beams that generate the light are critical to the experiments using light from these beams.  The beam quality not only depends on the total number of particles, but also on the particle density.  Reducing the angular excursions of beam particles with respect to the direction of transport decreases the transverse beam emittance.  The number of electrons produced and their emittance are important properties of an electron source.  When it is desirable to have a beam of very short bursts of electrons, photocathodes are the type of electron source used.  The electrons are emitted via the photoelectric effect when a laser impinges on the surface of the cathode.  The number of electrons produced compared to the number of incident photons is called the quantum efficiency of the cathode.  This NSF supported project explored two aspects of photocathode development, (1) the gap between the theoretical design of engineered multilayered photocathodes and the performance of actual fabricated multilayered photocathodes, and (2) the performance of novel nitrogen-incorporated ultrananocrystalline diamond (N)UNCD photocathodes.     Prior NSF support research found that the emittance of a photocathode beam could be reduced while maintaining the quantum efficiency by engineering the electronic properties of the photocathode material.  Special multilayer MgO/Ag/MgO photoemitting surfaces were fabricated using pulsed laser deposition. They were made to test a theoretical prediction that the properties of the emitted electrons depend on the thickness of the flanking MgO layers of the structure.   It was found that while the quantum efficiency and work function of these samples had a systematic dependence on the thickness of MgO that was consistent with the theoretical prediction, the behavior was not an exact match for the thinnest layer thicknesses.  A variety of multilayer structures were fabricated to isolate the reasons for this.  The number and thickness of the layers as well as the effective substrate material were varied to determine whether diffusion, surface roughness, layer composition or contamination are most responsible for deviation of actual materials from calculations based on ideal layers.  It was found that the roughness of the deposited thin Ag layers was the major cause for deviation when the Ag layers were thin.     In addition to exploring engineered photocathodes, the fabricated (N)UNCD material was characterized for use as a novel photocathode material.  Photocathodes are typically either metals or semiconductors.  The former are easily handled but have low QE, while the latter have high QE, but are difficult to handle.    This complicates the use of photocathodes for industrial applications or in small laboratories.  This project explored the use of (N)UNCD as a photocathode material.  This material is neither a semiconductor nor a metal; there are sp2-bonded graphitic grain boundaries surrounding diamond grains.  Emission occurs preferentially from the grain boundaries.  It was found that this material is extremely robust and requires no special handling, while at the same time, it also has good photocathode performance.  The emittance is competitive with other types of cathode, and the QE is similar to that of the highest QE metals.
