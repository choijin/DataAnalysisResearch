<AbstractNarration>Utah Valley University (UVU) is implementing a high speed network connection in conjunction with the Utah Educational Network (UEN) that connects the university to other state and national research networks using dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) across existing fiber optic cable.  Additionally, an on-campus research and science network is being created, separate from the regular campus network, to facilitate current and future research. The project is headed by UVU's CIO and implemented by UVU/UEN engineers; a Research Advisory Committee will help maximize the benefits of the new technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Network upgrades provide the UVU community with cyberinfrastructure for scientific and education projects requiring high bandwidth capabilities.  The project increases capacity for undergraduate research and experiential learning.  As UVU is a major hub on the UEN network (one of the nation's premier education networks), the enhanced connectivity will improve STEM education in all Utah schools and many public education services; access to STEM education will be strengthened for rural, remote, and underserved populations in this vast state. Additionally, high bandwidth, high speed capabilities facilitate UVU's partnership in the US Ignite community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this project, UVU is installing networking hardware that will connect to the 4x10GE equipment previously installed by UEN.  The networking equipment consists of switches capable of supporting 10, 40, and 100 Gigabit Ethernet ports with more than 83 terabits per second of overall switching capability.  The switches support layer-2 routing, and IPv4 and IPv6 routing.  A perfSONAR host is being deployed for network performance monitoring.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many applied research projects include large data sets and high speed network needs. Using a 4x10GE connection to our internet provider Utah Education Network and to Internet2 has enhanced the ability to deliver dedicated high speed bandwidth for these projects. This connection can provide up to a 40 gig connection for researcher and up to four dedicated 10 gig connections.  In addition to the high speed connection to Internet2, the connections on campus need to provide the proper environment to researchers.  A campus science network and science DMZ provides that environment with maximum bandwidth and minimal hops on campus.  The flexibility of SDN networking equipment shows great potential to enhance the networking capability on campus both for research as well as for the regular campus network not only to provide flexibility but also security. SDN also provided some significant challenges both in the maturity of the technology and the training of networking staff to be able to take full advantage of it.  Adding a GENI rack that is connected to the research network provides a platform for researchers to use a distributed, high speed, virtual environment for development and research of next-generation technologies.  In addition, a perfSONAR server allows for benchmarking and measuring the performance of the research network.  These technologies will provide the basic needs for the researchers to use with their applied research both for the existing projects as well as for the future.
