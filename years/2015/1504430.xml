<AbstractNarration>The question "Does shale gas extraction lead to contamination of freshwater aquifers by methane, deep-formation brines, or frac-water chemicals?"   is a topic of considerable public and scientific interest and the debate to date has taken place within a fundamental lack of data and cooperation.  This study begins with a cooperative arrangement between Yale and an industry partner that will facilitate the exchange of knowledge and data between industry and university scientists and will lead to an assessment of water quality concerns stemming from shale gas development.  The study directly addresses the issue of an established predrilling baseline.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will improve our knowledge of drilling as an initiating mechanism for cross formational flow of water, brines and gas.  The study improves upon previous knowledge with: (i) time series data on groundwater quality to be collected before gas wells are drilled, enabling natural variations in shallow groundwater chemistry to be distinguished from a shale gas effect; (ii) data on water quality and groundwater flow to be measured throughout all stages of shale gas development and (iii) monitoring locations to be chosen strategically to take into account known locations of gas well laterals, rather than sampling only from drinking water wells that are located randomly, without consideration of hydrology and potential sources of water quality impairment.  The project will provide fundamental research on drilling as a means of initiating cross formational subsurface flow.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ More than 4,000 thousand wells have pierced aquifers of Pennsylvania?s northern tier to siphon natural gas from the underlying Marcellus Shale.  As drilling and hydraulic fracturing ramped up a decade ago, homeowner reports of well water contamination by methane and other contaminants began to emerge. Although made infrequently compared to the number of gas wells drilled, these reports were troubling and motivated our two-year, prospective study of groundwater quality within the Marcellus Shale Play.   The question that guides this study is "Does shale gas extraction lead to contamination of freshwater aquifers by methane, deep-formation brines, or frac-water chemicals?" To address this question, a suite of measurements were made in freshwater aquifers that underlie portions of Susquehanna County, PA, a "sweet spot" of the Marcellus Shale Play. Analysis of these measurements enabled us to (i) characterize water quality prior to commencement of shale gas extraction activities; (ii) quantify perturbations in groundwater flow that were attributable to any stage of shale gas development; and (iii) evaluate changes in the chemical composition of groundwater induced by hydraulic fracturing and other stages of shale gas extraction.    We installed multi-level sampling wells within a bedrock aquifer of a 25 km2 area that was targeted for shale gas development. These wells were sampled on a monthly basis before, during, and after seven shale gas wells were drilled, hydraulically fractured, and placed into production. The groundwater samples, together with surface water samples collected from nearby streams, were analyzed for hydrocarbons, trace metals, major ions, and the isotopic compositions of methane, ethane, water, strontium, and dissolved inorganic carbon.     Shale gas development had detectable effects on groundwater flow and methane concentrations during this study; however, these effects were short-lived, restricted in spatial extent, and did not lead to water quality impairments that would constitute a water quality or human health concern.  Gas well drilling altered the groundwater flow field, although these perturbations were ephemeral (&lt; 1 day) and dissipated sharply with distance away from the gas wells.  Thermogenic methane with an isotopic composition consistent with Marcellus gas was detected in a monitoring well 100 m away from gas well that developed a small rupture in its production casing.  This rupture was sealed quickly, less than 4 days after developing, and methane was detected at only one sampling location, where concentrations peaked at 0.12 mg/L, which is 65 times lower than 7 mg/L action level set for homeowner wells by the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Law.  Neither the specific process of high-volume hydraulic fracturing or management of fluids associated with this process exerted a perceptible influence on groundwater flow or chemistry within our study area.     Methane concentrations varied widely between sites, averaging less than 0.1 mg/L in recharge areas beneath hilltops to more than 30 mg/L in areas of groundwater confluence beneath valleys. Methane concentrations tended to increase with depth and were greatest within regional flow systems, where dissolved methane was comprised of a mixture of biogenic gas and post-genetically modified, thermogenic gas. In deeper monitoring wells, methane concentrations exhibited considerable temporal variability that occurred synchronously with changes in salinity.  We infer that the co-variation in methane and salinity reflects shifts in natural aquifer recharge that altered mixing ratios between shallow and deep groundwaters.    Our study is among the first to systematically assess the responses of groundwater flow and quality to key stages of the shale gas extraction process. Inferences drawn from this study should be of broad interest to scientist and industry experts, as well as regulatory agencies and policymakers responsible for establishing safeguards around unconventional fossil fuel development.  The cooperative arrangement between a university and an industry collaborator is unprecedented in the context of the shale-gas/water-quality problem and permitted analysis of water quality concerns at a temporal resolution not equaled before.  We hope this type of university-industry partnership, which affords open and unrestricted dissemination of all university findings, will serve as an example for continued applied research into the effects of fossil fuel extraction on the environment.
