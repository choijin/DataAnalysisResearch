<AbstractNarration>Organizational routines are persistent sequential interaction patterns among the members of an organization. Such routines are believed to be responsible for the efficiency advantages of organizations as structures for collective decision-making. Nevertheless, to date there has been little formal modeling or evidence collected as to how organizational routines emerge, endure and adapt to change. This project proposes an agenda for studying the emergence, maintenance, adaptability and optimality of organizational routines that combines game theoretic analysis with experimental evidence. The baseline model is a novel but simple "harvesting game" wherein teams of agents repeatedly harvest a grid over several periods with full information about all past choices. The team's goal is to uncover as many novel outcomes on the grid as possible in the time allowed but without the ability to communicate with one another. The absence of communication proxies for specialization by team members that makes communication difficult or for settings where communication is impractical, for example during an emergency response. In such environments there are easily identifiable optimal routines and this study examines both theoretically and experimentally which routines emerge, how long it takes them to emerge, whether they are stable once they emerge, and if agents make short-run sacrifices in the interest of promoting the emergence of optimal routines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will build upon and extend the baseline model by studying routine formation in variants where 1) there is no information about past choices, 2) the complexity of the decision task is increased, 3) more players are added, 4) some players have private, payoff-relevant information that may naturally position them as team leaders and 5) players have the ability to communicate with one another prior to making their harvesting decisions. The new framework will broaden understanding of how members of organizations learn to form routines in a variety of different environments that are all amenable to theoretical and experimental evaluation. Thus will bring game-theoretic analysis and rigor to the organizational routine literature which to date has been studied using the methods of psychology and organizational behavior researchers. The game-theoretic framework allows one to assess the extent and source of deviations in routine formation from the rational choice ideal so that there is a better understanding of the role played by bounded rationality in routine formation. In addition, data on organizational routines are difficult to measure or observe -- the experimental tests proposed using the methods of experimental economics, where subjects earn payments based on their own choices and the choices of other members of their same team, provides an excellent framework in which to study organizational routines. The experimental designs, programs, data and findings resulting from this proposal will be made freely available so that other researchers can build upon the new framework and instructors can teach this new approach to organizational routines in the classroom.</AbstractNarration>

The performance advantage of many organizations is believed to arise from the adoption of such organizational routines, for example, the procedures followed by emergency workers at a hospital, or air travel procedures as implemented by the crews of airlines. Thus an understanding of how such routines emerge, are sustained and amended in response to new scenarios is an important topic for economic research and we contribute to knowledge of this topic by developing some new theory of organizational routines and testing that theory in a laboratory experiment with paid human subjects.  We define an organizational routine as a persistent sequential interaction pattern involving group behavior; thus in our view, an organizational routine is distinct from an individual habit.  Further we argue that organizational routines substitute for communication or monitoring when such activities are impractical (e.g., in emergency situations); that is organizational routines are a kind of tacit knowledge.  We model the development of an organizational routine using a novel, two-player "harvesting game". In the baseline version of this game, each player has two action choices, "X" and "Y", so that there are four possible outcomes (or cells) from the two players? simultaneous choice of one of the two actions: {XX, XY, YX, YY}.  A cell that has not been previously harvested yields a fixed payoff to both players of 1; once a cell has been harvested, revisiting that cell yields a payoff of 0, so pairs of agents are incentivized to seek novel outcomes.  In our baseline game, each pair of players has 3 opportunities (or rounds) to harvest as many novel cells as possible, but they are not able to communicate with one another (e.g. as in an emergency setting). They do receive feedback on which cells have previously been harvested. This 3 round harvesting game is played repeatedly so that we may study interaction behavior between pairs of players.  Since each novel cell harvested yields a payoff of 1, the efficient outcome is for the two players to develop a "routine" wherein they harvest three of the four cells in every repetition of the 3-round game, for example, the sequence of outcomes XX, XY, YX would maximize their joint payoff. There are many such efficient routines. Our theory emphasizes the importance of teams establishing a precedent, which breaks symmetry and allows a pair to implement the optimal symmetric strategy, for instance, one player chooses X and the other chooses Y.  Our experiment studies whether pairs of individuals coordinate on efficient routines or not and whether such routines are robust to changes in the payoff incentives. In our experiment, all subjects begin by playing the baseline game described above for 10, 3-round periods.  We find high efficiency, in excess of 90% meaning that most pairs coordinate on play of an efficient routine by the end of these 10 rounds of play. The routines coordinated up on quite varied, though certain routines are more common than others.  We then confront players with some change to the harvesting game. In a first treatment, players are matched with a new player to play the same baseline game. In a second treatment, the payoffs to certain cells, e.g. XX, are raised from 1 to 1.5 or lowered from 1 to 0.5. In a third treatment the location of the elevated or lowered payoffs is randomly determined. In a fourth treatment, we add an additional strategy choice and in a fifth and final treatment, we randomly determine which cells in the 3x3 game of the fourth treatment yield positive payoffs.   We find that players adapt their routines to these changes in payoffs. Efficiency remains high in treatments 1,2 and 4, but tends to fall off in treatments where there is random assignment of payoffs to cells.   Our overall finding is that players learn to develop efficient organizational routines and stick with those routines repeatedly, adapting them in response to novel innovations. Our theoretical framework enables others to easily build upon and replicate our findings.
