<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed study is to use a combination of theory and simulations to understand the transition from laminar to turbulent flows in the case of non-Newtonian fluids, like polymers and biological fluids. The work is motivated by the fact that non Newtonian fluids are used in many industrial settings (e.g., polymer processing) where instability and transition could lead to manufacturing defects. In addition, transition mechanisms in flows of complex fluids are very important for the development of micro/nano-fluidic devices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to understand, predict, and control the transition to turbulence is important for a multitude of technological applications and scientifically important processes. This proposal is focused on exploring the physical mechanism of transition to turbulence in the flow of viscoelastic fluids. While in Newtonian fluids a lot of research, experiments, computations, and theoretical analyses have been done over several years, transition in non-Newtonian fluids is a new, vibrant area with tremendous technological impact that needs to be explored. Preliminary results from the group of these PIs have indicated that in viscous flows the transition to turbulence can occur at much lower Reynolds number than for Newtonian fluids, and that another dimensionless number, the Weissenberg number, is an important parameter. This number characterizes the fluid relaxation time scale in relation to the characteristic time scale of the flow. Previous work by the authors has focused on the linear mechanism instability in viscoelastic flow. Streaks in the streamwise flow direction have been identified as the transition structure that can be amplified and lead to turbulence. The proposed work is focused on discerning the nonlinear mechanisms involved in the later stages of the transition process. In the proposed work, channel flow geometry will be used to examine the secondary receptivity and instability of the most amplified linear disturbance. The final stages of transition that lead to spectral broadening will be examined via direct numerical simulation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Viscoelastic fluids are materials that can behave both like a solid and a liquid.  Flows of viscoelastic fluids can be unstable, leading to a time-dependent, disordered flow state known as elastic turbulence.  Elastic turbulence can lead to manufacturing defects in polymer processing, where flows of viscoelastic fluids are commonly encountered.  However, elastic turbulence can help promote mixing in microfluidic devices used for medical diagnostics, where the biological samples used may be viscoelastic fluids.  It is therefore important to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for the transition to elastic turbulence so strategies can be developed to control transition.  The work supported by this grant has significantly advanced fundamental understanding of the early stages of this transition.  We have focused on the challenging but important case of flow in a channel where the forces due to fluid elasticity are at least as strong as the forces due to fluid inertia.  This has involved the development and application of new computational approaches that are useful for not only this problem, but other problems in fluid mechanics as well where large spatial gradients arise.  In contrast to prior work, we have considered the case of flows subject to localized imposed perturbations, which are easier to realize experimentally.  Our results suggest new mechanisms for the early stages of transition to elastic turbulence in strongly elastic channel flows of viscoelastic fluids, and provide possible explanations for recent puzzling experimental observations.  The basic knowledge gained from our work provides a necessary foundation for future work  aimed at elucidating the later stages of transition  and the development of strategies to control transition in applications such as polymer processing and microfluidic devices.
