<AbstractNarration>Big Data (BD) is a prominent, rapidly emerging discipline with far-reaching scientific and economic potential. While significant fundamental research has already taken place, there is a gap in the translation of BD research findings into economic growth and end-user impact. In addition, big data often arises in the practice of industry and government, and in broad geographic settings, making multi-stakeholder partnerships vital to exploiting its full potential. To successfully address these challenges, academic institutions from 16 states in the South region and the District of Columbia, in partnership with collaborators from industry, government, and non-profit organizations, will establish the South Big Data Regional Innovation Hub (South BD Hub) with lead institutions, Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). The South BD Hub will serve as the primary vehicle for interdisciplinary, multi-stakeholder partnerships designed to pursue BD projects of interest to the South region and the nation as a whole. It will collectively nurture a BD innovation ecosystem, promote collaboration, provide essential workforce training, and serve as a national asset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Hub will establish a community-driven governance plan for long-term sustainability, guided by a Steering Council composed of stakeholders that reflect the breadth, involvement, organizational nature, geography, and diversity of BD Hub interests. An Executive Committee and several Standing Committees also will be established. Birds of a Feather groups and more formal Working Groups may be established in targeted areas over the award period as needed. The Hub will have dual locations in Atlanta and Chapel Hill, with co-Executive Directors broadly accountable to the South BD Hub partners. GT and UNC-CH will act as host institutions providing logistics, operational, and other support for creation and long-term sustenance of the hub. Many partner organizations in the South region are committed to make diverse contributions to the Hub, including BD science "spoke" projects chosen by South region stakeholders. Initial spoke areas include: 1) Healthcare; 2) Coastal Hazards; 3) Industrial Big Data; 4) Materials and Manufacturing; and 5) Habitat Planning. To support these and other activities, the Hub also will launch cross-cutting spoke projects in BD Sharing and Infrastructure and BD Economics, Privacy, and Policy Issues. The national need for data scientists will also be addressed, through training programs, workshops, online resources, and other workforce development activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site:  southbdhub.org</AbstractNarration>
