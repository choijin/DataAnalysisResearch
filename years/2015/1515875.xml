<AbstractNarration>Whether or not a species can persist and spread in an environment is a fundamental and long-standing question in ecology.  Recently, this question has been brought to the forefront by climate change and landscape conversion.  Due to the processes of climate change, habitat regions suitable for population growth of many species have been shifting geographically.  Climatically induced shifts may interface with population demographic processes in complex ways, setting the stage for impacts on species population growth and spread, long-term dynamics and interactions between species.  This project aims to produce new frameworks for the analysis of persistence and spreading speeds of species in a shifting habitat.  It addresses the question of how ecosystems are being affected by climate change and how ecosystems might respond in the future.  It contributes to the growing body of information identifying species at a high risk for extinction and predicting the spread of invasive species under ongoing climate change.  The outcomes of the project help improve strategies for coping with challenges of natural resource management.  This project further stimulates interdisciplinary collaboration between mathematicians and biologists to address issues beyond the reach of single disciplines.  In addition, it contributes to human resources development, focusing on training and skill development of graduate students, and providing them with experience in interdisciplinary interaction and exploration. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In this project, the investigator formulates and analyzes spatial population models that describe species growth, interactions, and dispersal in shifting habitats.  The goal is to understand and accurately describe how climate change affects biological invasion processes.  Multi-species reaction-diffusion competition models and predator-prey models, as well as semi-discrete stage-structured spatial models with a shifting habitat edge, are studied to emphasize the role of changing habitat suitability in persistence and spread of an invasive species interacting with an existing species.  In these models, shifts in habitat ranges are incorporated in species growth functions that propagate as traveling waves.  Species spatial dynamics are investigated for the following cases: (i) one species spreads into a shifting habitat preoccupied by a resident species; and  (ii) two species consecutively invade an open shifting habitat and the earlier species is still in the process of expanding its spatial range.  New techniques are developed to determine the behaviors of solutions of the models on appropriate bounded and unbounded spatial intervals that expand and shift in time.  Methods from differential equations, integral equations, and dynamical systems are employed to detect conditions under which species go extinct and to determine spreading speeds of persisting species in space.  The results of this research also have impacts in other disciplines where wave propagation is studied.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recently there has been renewed interest in spatial ecology largely driven by the interplay between biological invasion and climate change.  There is growing recognition that the warming trends have led to habitat shifts, expansions, and contractions that may be altering the outcomes of invasion events. Understanding biological invasions within the context of climate change requires modeling approaches that incorporate dynamic landscapes.  Throughout this grant, we have considered several scenarios where the rate of climate change was vital for understanding outcomes of biological invasions.  In one study, for example, we examined both expansion and contraction of the region of a suitable habitat for a species, as well as the case that a species grows everywhere along the spatial gradient, but with differing levels of success. We provided conditions under which the species spreads to a region of poor quality where the species eventually becomes extinct. We showed that, when the species persists, the rate of climate change can impact the rightward spreading speed and leftward spreading speed and that its effect depends on whether or not the region of suitable habitat is expanding or contracting and on how fast climate change is occurring relative to the intrinsic rate of spread of the invasive species. We also demonstrated that it is possible for a solution to form a two-layer wave, with the propagation speeds of the two layers analytically determined.  In another study, we considered the existence of traveling waves in population models with a shifting habitat. Such a traveling wave has a fixed shape and a forced speed which is the same as the rate of climate change. We established the existence of traveling waves with range expansions and speed in different value ranges determined by spreading speeds. We also showed the existence of a traveling wave with any forced speed for the case that the species can grow everywhere. Our results demonstrate existence of different types of traveling waves with the same speed and connections between spreading speeds and the traveling wave speed.  In a separate study, we considered a competition model for the case that two species with different competitive capabilities consecutively invade a homogeneous habitat. We showed that in general that there are multiple invasion speeds in the model. It is possible for a species to develop two separate waves propagating with different invasion speeds.  The techniques developed for studying this model was extended to investigate population dynamics of two competing species in a contracting habitat suitable for population growth. We demonstrated the possibility that a competitively weaker species with a faster spreading speed can drive its rival to extinction in a contracting habitat.  Furthermore, we conducted additional studies; for example, we analyzed the effect of phenology (biological timing) on population growth and invasion in semi-discrete stage-structured models, examined bacterial invasions using multiple-species reaction-diffusion equations, and evaluated oscillating invasion speeds for models with an Allee effect and overcompensation.   Our results highlight important elements in biological invasions that may aid in ecological forecasting.  This grant provided critical training opportunities for graduate students.  Two Ph.D students graduated with support from this grant.       Last Modified: 11/29/2019       Submitted by: Bingtuan Li]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
