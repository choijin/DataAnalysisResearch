<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this collaborative project from Monroe Community College, Robert Morris University, and the State University of New Your (SUNY) at Buffalo is to use visual exploration to help students develop a deeper understanding of multivariable calculus concepts and to conduct and publish research on the effects of visualization on student understanding of these concepts. This project will build upon the success of the CalcPlot3D multivariable calculus exploration applet, an award-winning, interactive Java applet that is already widely used across the United States to facilitate the teaching and learning of multivariable calculus.  The CalcPlot3D applet is designed to improve students' geometric intuition about surfaces, vectors, vector fields, and curves, thereby preparing students to understand more fully engineering and physics problems in subsequent STEM coursework. This project will greatly enhance the use of CalcPlot3D by creating a series of visual concept explorations for multivariable calculus and expand CalcPlot3D to facilitate visualization of concepts in physics, engineering, differential equations and linear algebra courses. It also will fill a gap in the existing educational research by addressing the effects of visualization on student understanding of three-dimensional concepts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three professors from these diverse institutions (community college, private 4-yr, public 4-yr) will collaborate with faculty across the United States and Mexico to: (1) design and test a series of new visual concept explorations and applications in CalcPlot3D to improve student understanding of multivariable calculus; (2) expand the features of CalcPlot3D to accommodate the new concept explorations and address applications in differential equations, linear algebra, physics, and engineering; (3) create new visualization apps, including a new version of CalcPlot3D, that work on more platforms, including tablets and phones; (4) conduct and publish research investigating how student understanding of multivariable calculus concepts changes through the use of visualization and dynamic concept explorations; and (5) extend and diversify the user base by disseminating project materials through papers, workshops and conferences, by creating a Spanish language version of project materials, and by promoting the exchange of user feedback and research. Students who participate in this project will help populate a better prepared and more diverse workforce in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   CalcPlot3D is an online visualization tool designed to enhance the teaching and learning of multivariable calculus, seeking to improve students? visualization and geometric intuition (both 2D and 3D) of surfaces, vectors, vector fields, and curves, thereby better preparing students to more deeply understand engineering and physics problems in other STEM coursework. See the project website: https://sites.monroecc.edu/multivariablecalculus/     The goals of the CalcPlot3D project were: 1) to develop and test a series of new concept explorations to improve student understanding of multivariable calculus; (2) expand the features of CalcPlot3D to accommodate the new concept explorations and address applications in differential equations, linear algebra, physics, and engineering; (3) create new visualization apps, including a new version of CalcPlot3D, that work on more platforms, including tablets and phones; (4) conduct and publish research investigating how student understanding of multivariable calculus concepts changes through the use of visualization and dynamic concept explorations; and (5) extend and diversify the user base by disseminating project materials through papers, workshops and conferences, by creating a Spanish language version of project materials, and by promoting the exchange of user feedback and research.    The project was a collaboration of three faculty from diverse institutions (a community college, private college, and large public university). Co-PIs were Paul Seeburger (Monroe Community College), Dr. Monica VanDieren (Robert Morris University) and Dr. Deborah Moore-Russo (University at Buffalo).  Each team member contributed their individual expertise to accomplish project goals: creating code for the visualization tools, creating new concept explorations, testing project materials with students, conducting educational research, writing papers, and presenting on these tools and research at conferences.  These are summarized in the Work and Results image.    Results of the project include the following:    Visualization Apps for Visualizing Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra   CalcPlot3D was converted from a Java applet to a JavaScript app, able to run on mobile devices as well as computers.

Additional concept explorations have been developed, but have not yet been coded into WeBWorK.        Dissemination   Two 3-day workshops were held at Robert Morris University (34 participants).  At each workshop, groups developed new concept explorations and brainstormed new ways to help students learn using CalcPlot3D.  Each group then shared their work with other workshop participants.    Three minicourses were conducted at national conferences to train participants to use CalcPlot3D.  An additional minicourse is scheduled at the 2020 JMM.   Twenty (20) additional presentations and ten (10) posters were given by project collaborators on many aspects of the project at national and regional math and educational research conferences or at local universities.      Educational Research, Developed Instruments, and Publications   The PIs conducted and reported a careful analysis of items on existing vector understanding instruments developed for physics students in light of critiques written regarding the developing understandings of students, a review of the concepts they address and don?t address, the representations used for their items, and their inclusion of three-dimensional vectors. In addition, the collection of data from multivariable calculus students coupled with input from multivariable calculus instructors have led to a positioning where the research team is now creating a vector concept inventory.   The most significant contributions to the mathematics education research community were presentations and publications related to how students develop an understanding of the vector cross product, resulting in a conceptual model of student understanding of vectors.
