<AbstractNarration>Dilute peracetic acid (PAA) is a potent disinfectant for the food and beverage industry and for medical facilities and equipment. The estimated global market of peracetic acid in 2018 is &gt;US$600 million. The challenge with using PAA is that manufacture creates concentrated PAA solutions. These are hazardous to transport, to store and to dilute for use. The proposed solution is to make PAA on-site, which eliminates transport, make PAA only when needed, which eliminates storage, and make PAA only in the dilute less-hazardous form, which eliminates handling steps by workers. The key to this solution is an enzyme catalyzed reaction on-site from safer ingredients - acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide. To reach this application goal, the enzymes need to be more stable than they are now so they can be reused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peracetic acid (PAA) is a strong, reactive oxidant which allows PAA to kill a broad range of microbes. This I-Corps team's goal is to produce PAA at end-user's on-site facility using enzymes by the perhydrolysis reaction of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Prior research identified efficient enzymes which creates ten molecule of PAA per second for each molecule of enzyme. The fast enzyme catalyzed formation of PAA created the opportunity to make it at the application location only on demand and also in amounts needed. To make it commercially viable, the proposed approach is to use enzyme in a packed-bed reactor, with acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide fed in and produce PAA with the amounts needed. To achieve this demonstration, it requires engineering of perhydrolase enzymes to be more resistant for oxidation by PAA, immobilization of stabilized enzymes for the reusability and optimize reaction conditions for a continuous flow reactor. The current proposal seeks to commercialize the enzymatic production of PAA for safer use and thereby tests the broader hypothesis that the biotechnology micro factories can replace traditional chemical factories.</AbstractNarration>

Peracetic acid is an effective disinfectant that replaces bleach in many applications. Our initial plan for the commercialization did not interest potential customers, but we identified a new plan that may increase food safety and hospital cleanliness.     Intellectual merit   Our hypothesis was that the advantage of the enzyme was to allow users to make peracetic acid at the use site, thus avoiding transportation costs and hazards. Interviews with potential customers in the food &amp; medical industries demonstrated that they did not see this feature as an important advantage. The would still need to buy and store acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The synthesis step would add complexity to the use and most of the end users were unskilled workers.   In contrast, potential customers were most concerned about the effectiveness of the disinfectant. Contaminated food such as the recent outbreak at Chipotle restaurants and the prevalence of hospital-acquired infections concern the potential customers. We created a new hypothesis &ndash; that the enzyme-catalyzed reaction could create a smart disinfectant, that is, one that could increase its disinfecting power as needed.    The smart disinfectant would be a formulation of peracetic acid where enzymes regenerate more peracetic acid as needed to maintain disinfecting power. We further identified that for this commercialization strategy to work, we needed to stabilize the enzyme to long-term exposure to peracetic acid. We have started carry out this stabilization.     Broader impacts   The broader impacts of this work are the development of more effective disinfectants. They are not stronger, that would harm the substance being disinfected (e.g., food), but they are more effective because they regenerate as needed. This new approach to disinfecting will yield safer food and cleaner hospitals. This work trained a postdoctoral fellow in commercialization of scientific discoveries.
