<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) and Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) programs, Emory University will acquire a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. This instrumentation will advance research activities spanning the fields of synthetic organic chemistry, catalysis and new methodology development, natural products and materials characterization, inorganic chemistry, biomolecular chemistry, and the integration of spectroscopic information with theoretical studies. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out modern research. This instrument will also be an integral component in training undergraduate and graduate students. It will advance the teaching and research training mission of the department by providing hands-on NMR experience in applying advanced NMR topics covered in core academic and supplemental summer courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research in areas such as (a) studying natural product synthesis; (b) studying reactivity, catalysis and synthetic strategy, to drive pharmaceutical and materials innovation; (c) developing stereoselective methods and their applications in total synthesis and drug discovery; (d) discovering reactions with a particular aim to apply to transition metal chemistry; (e) understanding signaling pathways involved in human health and disease; (f) exploring functional and well-defined macromolecular structures with various applications; (g) studying polyoxometalate (POM) complexes and POM-based materials, and their uses as catalysts; (h) developing synthetic methods in contexts ranging from selective activation and functionalization of traditionally inert starting materials; (i) developing small molecular radiotracers for positron emission tomography; (i) studying antimicrobial principles in medicinal plants; and (j) discovering therapeutic agents and the structural basis for their interactions with target proteins.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With this grant from the National Science Foundation - Major Research Instrumentation Program, Emory University has acquired a 600 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  This instrument has been continuously and heavily used since its installation in summer 2016.   To date, 25 peer-reviewed publications have appeared utilizing this instrument, with most of these publications appearing in 2018.  This state-of-the-art instrument has supported recent and ongoing funded research, primarily discovering and characterizing new types of chemical reactivity.  These research activities have diverse applications, ranging from destruction of chemical warfare agents to creating potentially bioactive compounds serving as leads to understand the principles underlying the causes, diagnostic methods, and treatments for human diseases.   Intellectual merit: The high sensitivity of the instrument has supported accurate structural and quantitative analysis of chemical structures considerably more complex than we could study on our older instruments, and permits unambiguous determination of chemical structures and reactive intermediates in much less time.  These capabilities have greatly accelerated the pace of research accomplishments arising from our laboratories.  As the high quality and excellent performance of this new instrument supports research projects in at least fifteen laboratories at Emory University, this instrument has substantially raised the research profile of several areas of chemical research in our department.  The funding environment and numbers of publications arising from our department have both increased since the installation of the new NMR spectrometer in 2016.    Broader impacts: In our new Chemistry Unbound undergraduate chemistry curriculum, undergraduate students in Chem 203L "Advanced Reactivity Laboratory" obtain NMR spectroscopic data on products arising from Nobel Prize-winning discoveries in chemical reactivity.  To accommodate the large numbers of students enrolled in all sections of Chem 203L (fall 2018 enrollments totalling 379 students), the autosampler allows each student to characterize his/her product structures arising from combinations of unknown reactants.  In part, the availability of this instrument has recently attracted to our department one new tenured faculty member, who has a highly productive and well-funded research program.    In the past two years, despite raising our admission standards, our program has recently attracted a larger-than-usual cohort of excellent chemistry graduate students.   At least half of the newer graduate students are current or likely future users of this instrument.  In addition, the new graduate students include more members of groups traditionally under-represented in chemistry.
