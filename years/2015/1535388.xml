<AbstractNarration>The 20th Penn State plant Biology Symposium will focus on the important topic of "Plant Stress-Omics in a Changing Climate". Plenary sessions are focused on water and salinity, atmosphere (temperature, CO2, ozone), biotic/abiotic interactions and the use of novel tools. The conference is held at Penn State University, University Park takes place May 13-16, 2015. There will be two formal poster and two short talk sessions to feature research from talented junior scientists.  The conference includes an impressive cadre of US and international speakers. The organizing committee and speaker list seems balanced in terms of broadening participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop addresses an important topic in Plant Biology, namely how plants deal with increasing environmental stresses. Particularly noteworthy is a planned workshop preceding the meeting to provide training in novel mass spectrometric methods. These methods are necessary to determine metabolomics changes in response to various environmental stresses.  The meeting is an ideal forum for students and postdocs to identify future mentors, and for established scientists to forge meaningful collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
