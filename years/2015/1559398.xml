<AbstractNarration>Project abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication is a key component of many aspects of economic activities, and more generally of social interactions. Lawyers need to convey information about the parties they represent; central banks provide information about the state of the economy; researchers disseminate results from their work; job candidates report their qualifications to potential employers; firms report their progress to investors. Complex information requires effort both to communicate and understand. Without resorting to dishonesty, an informed entity may be able to mitigate the effect of detrimental information by making it more difficult to decipher, for instance through information over-load or unclear language. While the development of information economics over the past fifty years has greatly improved our understanding of how information affects strategic behavior, many models still overlook the complexities of communicating, acquiring and processing information. The purpose of this study is to understand the extent of communication between individuals when information may be difficult to transmit and/or process. This project will clarify how attention and incentives shape behavior in such widely relevant settings, and why policies preventing lying or omission may be insufficient to address issues of transparency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project looks at the important interplay between communication, perception and strategic obfuscation from both theoretical and experimental angles. First, the PIs will examine the testable implications of a model of costly communication and perception; that is, they will characterize the set of observed behaviors which are consistent with their model for some underlying cost functions. Second, they will show how one can build on recent developments in experimental tests of rational inattention to test strategic obfuscation; that is, they move from an individual decision problem to the complexities of an interactive setting. Finally, they will test their theory experimentally using a novel experimental design that highlights the impact of limited perception on strategic obfuscation in communication games.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Previous studies of communication have focused on either "hard" information, whereby only irrefutable facts are transmitted, or on "soft" information, whereby any cheap-talk, potentially non-truthful message is allowed. We study a middle ground where communication must be truthful but statements can vary in their degree of clarity. Combining theoretical arguments and experimental evidence, we consider the case of a sender who can send truthful but obfuscated information, that is more difficult for those who receive it to decipher and understand. This framework is of real-world importance. In many settings, legal requirements and harsh penalties prevent economic actors from being untruthful, without precisely stipulating requirements for clarity. This may be taken advantage of by economic agents who wish to obfuscate information unfavorable to themselves. Building on recent work studying the testable implications of costly perception in a single-agent decision making framework, we identify the testable implications for interactive sender-receiver settings. Our experiment provides a first evidence that senders are willing to obfuscate information, despite the possible strategic inferences that follow and the fact that receivers may nonetheless be able to decipher the message; and that receivers do use strategic inference when deciding how much effort to spend deciphering choices. In particular, our study establishes that strategic inference may be used as a substitute for costly perception. An ongoing aspect of the project continues to study whether, in analogy to established evidence on lying aversion, any obfuscation aversion exists.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/31/2020<br>      Modified by: Kareen&nbsp;Rozen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
