<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Women's participation in engineering is a crucial national priority.  The shortage of engineers in the US weakens the country's position as a leader in the global market and restricts our capacity to solve infrastructural challenges.  This project involves research in four countries (Jordan, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia) to assess the contextual factors that encourage women's participation in engineering in tertiary education and as a career. In three of the four countries identified (Jordan, Malaysia, and Tunisia), women's participation in engineering is much higher than in the US, despite social, political, and economic restrictions on women's participation in public life.  In the fourth country (Saudi Arabia), women's engineering participation is also on the rise. This project seeks to understand the links between cultural context and expanding women's STEM participation by studying the drivers of women's participation in these contexts. The research is significant because it promises to document factors that encourage women's successful participation in STEM in social, political, and cultural contexts that are very different from the US. These explorations of women's success, in turn, promise to shed light more generally on how context shapes women's participation in STEM in ways that inform our efforts to broaden participation in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Women's participation is engineering is a crucial national priority.  The shortage of engineers in the US weakens the country's position as a leader in the global market and restricts our capacity to solve infrastructural challenges. This project entails conducting research in four countries (Jordan, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia) to assess the contextual factors that encourage women's participation in engineering in tertiary education and as a career.

In the fourth country (Saudi Arabia), women's engineering participation is also rising. This project seeks to understand the links between cultural context and expanding women's STEM participation by studying the economic, educational, socio-cultural, legal, and political drivers of women's participation in these contexts.  This project will apply case study methods to collect rich data from focus groups and in-depth interviews in each country with female engineering undergraduate students, faculty members, and practicing engineers (total N=208-325). The research is significant because it promises to document factors that encourage women's successful participation in STEM in social, political, and cultural contexts that are very different from the US. With its cross-national, in-depth exploration of women's curricular and career choices and its attention to mechanisms producing gender-differentiated curricular and career decisions, this project promises to shed light more generally on how context shapes women's successful participation in STEM in ways that inform our efforts to broaden participation in the US.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project sought to explore the mechanisms that motivate women to pursue engineering in Jordan, Malaysia, and Tunisia, where participation rates by women are as high as 50 percent, in order to gain greater understanding of the constraints that shape women&rsquo;s participation in engineering and new ways to increase the number of women studying engineering in the U.S. The funds used resulted in the creation of nine category books stemming from the data analysis of the qualitative focus group interviews with female engineers, engineering faculty members, and undergraduate students in our three locations.&nbsp; These category books represent our taxonomy of emergent themes and will be applied to modify existing theoretical and empirical approaches to the study of women&rsquo;s representation in engineering. Research from the project has been presented at the annual meetings of the American Sociological Association (2018), the American Society of Engineering Educators, and in four other venues to date. Progress has been documented on the project website at http://womeninengineeringpmcs.org . This site includes focus group training materials, focus group consent forms, focus group protocols in English and French, slides from project presentations, and a white paper on managing international, interdisciplinary collaborations.
