<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Zlatko Bacic and Mark Tuckerman of New York University are performing theoretical calculations on molecules confined in cages formed by other molecules, or within a single C60 "Buckyball" molecule.  They are interested in understanding how molecules such as water (H2O), hydrogen (H2) and other small molecules move when they are in restricted spaces. This theoretical study will improve the interpretation of experimental measurements, for example the results of a technique called inelastic neutron scattering (INS).  It will also have implications for the control of material properties at the molecular level (for advanced "nanoelectronics" applications), and possibly for the design of efficient and economical hydrogen storage media for energy technologies.  Two graduate students are directly involved as researchers in this project.  The conceptual advances and new results from this research will be integrated into educational materials for undergraduates. Finally, methodology developments achieved in this project will be incorporated into the Principal Investigators' user-friendly software tools that will be made freely available to the general community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An array of sophisticated theoretical and computational approaches, some developed in the realization of this project, ranging from multidimensional bound-state and scattering methods to path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations, is implemented in these investigations. The INS spectra of H2O confined in C60 are calculated with high accuracy utilizing the newly developed methodology for quantum simulation of the INS spectra of nanoconfined polyatomic molecules. The PIMD simulations of the crystalline H2O in C60, an extraordinary 3D cubic lattice of highly quantum H2O dipoles, each confined inside C60, shed light on its dielectric properties and free energetics, including the ferroelectric phase transition, arising from the many-body dipolar correlations. Path-integral simulations also probe the temperature and pressure dependence of the free energetics and approximate diffusion rates of H2 and D2 molecules in the sII clathrate hydrates, simple and binary, accounting for quantum effects and framework flexibility. These studies address the fundamental problem of the diffusion of molecular hydrogen in the quantum regime, inside a chemically and structurally complex environment. Quantum treatment of the condensed-phase effects, including the proton disorder of the framework water molecules, on the "rattling" dynamics and the INS spectra of H2 in the sII clathrate hydrate addresses the general question of how the dynamical and spectroscopic properties of guest molecules inside a host environment evolve and approach their bulk limits.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has led to a number of significant methodological advances applicable to, and deeper conceptual and quantitative understanding of, several challenging classes of molecular systems exhibiting strong nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). One of them pertains to the two aspects of the dynamical behavior of H2 , HD, and D2 molecules inside the cages of the structure II (sII) clathrate hydrate. The first one deals with the effects of the condensed-phase environment of the hydrate on the frequency shift of the intramolecular stretch fundamental of H2  molecule inside the small cage.  This frequency shift was computed in two ways, by means of quantum 5D calculations for rigid H2 in the v=0 and v=1 vibrational states, respectively, and also by the pioneering fully coupled quantum 6D calculations of flexible H2, HD, and D2.  These calculations took into account spherical clathrate hydrate domains of increasing radius, with the number of water molecules considered ranging from 20 to over 1900. The dominant contribution to the frequency shift, whose computed value is in very good agreement with experiment,  was found to come from the 76 water molecules in the first three hydration shells around the hydrogen molecules. Subsequently, the intramolecular stretching fundamentals, and their shifts, of two H2 molecules indide the large cage of the sII hydrate were computed rigorously by means of 8D fully coupled quantum calculations, assuming rotationless (j=0) H2 moieties.  For the largest sII hydrate domain considered encompassing 98 water molecules the redshift computed for the HH fundamentals of ~24 cm-1 is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 26 cm-1 .  The second aspect of H2 and D2 inside the sII hydrate investigated by us was that of the low-temperature diffusion, its quantum statistical and dynamical components,  from a singly occupied large hydrate cage to the neighboring empty large cage, through a shared hexagonal face over a wide range of temperatures. Path integral molecular dynamics simulations were used to compute the free-energy profiles for the diffuson of the hydrogen molecule as a function of temperature. Ring polymer molecular dynamics rate theory was utilized in the calculations of the H2 and D2  diffusion rates in a broad temperature interval. It was found that both the shape of quantum free-energy profiles and the diffusion rates are strongly affected by competing quantum effects of the zero-point energy perpendicular to the reaction path  and tunneling.  Rigorous and quantitative explanation was developed for the long-standing puzzle of the symmetry breaking observed in the solid endofullerenes M@C60 (M = H2, HF, H2O) at low temperatures . It was established that the main source of symmetry breaking is the electrostatic interaction between the charge densities on the guest molecule M and on the 12 nearest-neighbor C60 cages of the solid, and moreover, that retaining just its leading quadrupole term suffices to quantitatively account for the manifestations of the symmetry breaking. We have also investigated the effects of symmetry breaking on the excited translation-rotation (TR) eigenstates of M@C60, and its manifestations in the simulated near- and far-IR spectra of these species.  Symmetry breaking was taken into account for the first time in calculating rigorously  the low-temperature  inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra of HF@C60. These quantum simulations demonstrated that the INS selection rule that we derived previously for H2 and HD in a near-spherical nanocavity applies also to the strongly mass-asymmetric HF. Our calculations also resulted in the reassignment of one peak visible in the published INS spectrum of HF@C60. In addition, another peak predicted by the INS simulations agrees well with that in the subsequently measured INS spectrum.  A very efficient and rigorous methodology for high-dimensional and fully coupled quantum calculations of the intra- and intermolecular (ro)vibrational states of noncovalently bound molecular dimers was developed. This methodology was implemented in the full-dimensional quantum calculations of (HF)2 (6D) and H2O/D2O-CO (9D), as well as to benzene-H2O/HDO (9D) and H2O@C60 (9D) where the large molecule, benzene or C60, was treated as rigid. These calculations yielded the frequencies of the intramolecular excitations, as well as the effects of the excitation of the intramolecular fundamentals on the low-lying intermolecular eigenstates and on the hydrogen-exchange tunneling splittings.
