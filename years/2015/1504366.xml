<AbstractNarration>This exploratory project addresses a significant national challenge impacting the success of STEM undergraduates, the difference between students learning mathematics and students being able to use it productively.  Much of the previous work in this area has focused on identifying student difficulties.  This project will work to understand the mechanisms that underlie these difficulties. Modeling physical systems using mathematics is a critical component of success in all STEM disciplines. This project will study undergraduates who have been successful in college level calculus as they take an Introductory Physics for Life Sciences (IPLS) course.  From studying why and how students do and do not understand and use mathematics to model systems, the project will weave a thread related to mathematical modeling to include:  a coherent set of readings, quiz and clicker questions, homework problems, and exam questions intended to build students' modeling skills throughout the class in a variety of contexts. This will help students both understand the structure of symbolic reasoning and its value for their chosen careers. This mathematical modeling thread will then be implemented in the IPLS course, and the effect on students' ability to use mathematics in biology will be assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is both to identify the mechanisms underlying students' difficulties in applying mathematics in biological contexts and to produce materials that can help them learn to use mathematics productively as scientists. The study will combine qualitative research (problem-solving interviews and focus-group problem-solving) with quantitative studies of student responses to issues in mathematical modeling. The primary context for the study is the NEXUS/Physics IPLS course developed at the University of Maryland College Park (UMD-CP). It serves a diverse population containing many students who have been successful in calculus but have difficulty using mathematics in science. Students at the UMD-CP (a large state land-grant institution) will be the primary subjects. Students at two additional institutions using NEXUS/Physics materials will also be studied: Montgomery College (a two-year institution) and Swarthmore College (a four-year private institution).  The project will use as its core analytic structure the Resources Framework, developed in part with prior NSF support, to create models of high-level thinking. This Framework takes a dynamic knowledge-in-pieces approach that considers conceptual, epistemological, and affective resources and how they interact with each other and with the student's perception of their socio-cultural environment. It permits a dynamic, fine-grained approach to student thinking that provides specific tools for understanding the barriers to the use of mathematics in science and for guiding construction of materials and test questions.  It also gives insight into modeling the cognitive elements and processes of learning the complex subject of using mathematics in science.  The Intellectual Merit of this project is in developing a deeper understanding of the barriers STEM students face in learning to use mathematics in science. The Broader Impact of this exploratory project is that both what is learned by the research and the materials the project develops could be used in many STEM classes in many colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Life-science and pre-health-care students are well known to have trouble with physics. Many instructors identify this difficulty as arising from a weakness with their math skills. Our project investigated a different hypothesis:   The way math is done in science is fundamentally different from the way math is done in math classes. In science, mathematical concepts are blendedwith physics ideas, changing both how the math is interpreted and how it is used. Instructors tend to ignore this difference and treat the math-in-science as if it were "just math" and this confuses students.   We explored this idea with interviews, focus groups, and pre-post surveys that we developed. We found strong support for our hypothesis. Students often showed that they were able to do the math when it was expressed as math but had difficulties applying their mathematical knowledge in a physical context. A second part of their problem turned out to be that they resisted using the math because they didn't see its value in helping them understand material in their chosen profession.   To deal with these issues, we identified a series of knowledge-building tools that students could learn to use to help make sense of math in a physical context. These ranged from learning to identify the physical content of a symbol (dimensional analysis) to learning the importance of telling the physical story of a problem rather than just trying to do the math.  In this context, we created lessons that made a strong bridge between using math and understanding critical issues in biology.   We created a set of curricular materials &ndash; readings, homework problems, group learning activities, quiz and exam problems &ndash; that focused student attention on learning these tools and building physical meaning into the math. The activities we built worked hard to create math problems with authentic biological relevance.  In an anonymous final survey at the end of the project, 90% of the students expressed the opinion that they had improved their skills of using math in science, and more than half of those felt they had done so dramatically.   The materials developed for this project are being prepared for sharing with the instructional community through the Living Physics Portal &ndash; a curated web site currently being built by another NSF project to share instructional physics materials for life science physics classes.
