<AbstractNarration>Computing has become an integral part of everyday practice within modern fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). As a result, the STEM+Computing Partnerships (STEM+C) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning. Computational Thinking (CT) is an intellectual skill rooted in the ability to conceive of meaningful, information-based representations that can be effectively manipulated by a computer. Integrating CT into core science instruction addresses practical constraints in K-12 education, in that there is no room in the curriculum to teach it directly to everyone. But, more importantly, integrating CT into core science provides a synergistic opportunity to deepen instruction in both. STEM education programs that effectively foster development of CT skills as an essential competency are among the most successful in preparing a future STEM workforce that can leverage computational methods to advance basic science and engineering research and design innovative approaches for using data-rich resources to solve complex, societally-relevant problems.  Similarly, a science-literate society increasingly needs to appreciate how advances in scientific knowledge are inter-woven with the use of big data, modeling, and simulations, if they are to make informed, evidence-based decisions. This project will explore the integration of core chemistry topics and computational thinking through student interaction with and manipulation of models that visually represent chemical systems, such as the carbon cycle.  When a student examines a visual, runnable model, makes a prediction, changes the programming code, and then runs the model again, the computer provides feedback to the student that demands explanation.  The process of anticipating, interpreting, and testing the computer's feedback, when coupled with a structured argumentation process, supports a student's abilities to think and act like a scientist as they explore and learn about both the computational and physical world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Tech and the University of  Texas at Austin will investigate a method of broadening access to CT thinking by providing it in a context that all students take: 8th Grade Integrated Science. Targeted chemistry topics will be embedded into editable, runnable computational models that are themselves embedded within a pedagogy of structured scientific argumentation focused on the production of evidence-based reasoning. Students will learn about chemical systems, as well as key concepts such as equilibrium and reaction rates, through interacting with models as they are represented visually and about CT through modifying and adapting the code to better represent aspects of the chemical systems.  Four computational chemistry tasks, including computer models and associated standards-aligned curricula, will be developed and refined using participatory, design-based research techniques, in partnership with four Austin, TX teachers serving ~300 students from a variety of socio-economic settings.  A curricular framework called Argument Driven Computational Thinking and two associated assessment tools - the Performance Assessment of Computational Thinking and the Computing Attitudes Test - will be developed and validated.  Quantitative and qualitative analysis of videotaped classroom instructional activities, student artifacts, and computer-use logs will be used to document the effectiveness and broad utility of this new model for integrating chemistry and computing.  A post-doctoral fellow and two graduate students will be trained through this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To promote the progress of science, we need a better-educated populace, especially with respect to computing and STEM more generally. Computational thinking (CT) is an intellectual skill rooted in the ability to conceive of meaningful, information-based representations that can be effectively manipulated by an automated agent (e.g. a computer). CT needs to be integrated into core science instruction because (1) there is no room in the K-12 curriculum to teach it directly to everyone, (2) the nature of routine scientific practice is changing to incorporate CT practices, and (3) integrating CT into core science provides a synergistic opportunity to deepen instruction in both.    The Intellectual Merit of the project lies in the investigation of a method of broadening access to CT by providing it in a context that all students take: 8th Grade Integrated Science.  This method exposes students to how CT interacts with and deepens chemistry thinking.   The method embeds targeted teaching/learning of chemistry topics into editable, runnable computational models that are themselves be embedded in a pedagogy of structured scientific argumentation, featuring the production of evidence-based reasoning.  Students learn about chemical systems through interacting with models as they are represented visually, and about CT through modifying and adapting the code to better represent aspects of the chemical systems.  Students learn about chemical systems, and key concepts such as equilibrium and reaction rates. Research questions concerned the viability and power of the approach and the details of making the set of goals align in a practical, classroom-based, teachable way.  The Broader Impact of the project lies in the ways that it has addressed sophisticated aspects of CT in the context of science classes that all children take, and in a range of school contexts including those with both high and low socio-economic-standing students.  The socio-economic-standing of parents is highly associated with how well children do in school.  We have reason to believe that students who participated learned important things about chemistry, and computational thinking, and that teachers had significant experiences.  Two post-docs and several graduate students were trained on the project, and numerous undergraduates were involved in the creation of the simulations, improvement of the simulation environment and in the analysis of pedagogical data.  We have uncovered reason to believe that the integration of CT into 7th and 8th grade science classes can succeed, but that insuring success is complicated.  Mechanisms such as curriculum and technology design, teacher training (e.g. ''professional development'') and adequate assessment require further thought and context sensitive exploration.  We have deepened the conversation about how to do this through publications and presentations in multiple forums and by making a video of explaining the vision of the project, which has been viewed more than 2800 times on YouTube and is also available on Vimeo with captions in both English and Spanish.  This report includes screen shots of the computer systems that we use in the teaching to model (1) water formation and splitting, (2) a reaction of aluminum and copper sulfate reaction, and (3) the carbon cycle.  However, the technology is only one part of the design that enables teaching and learning.  Putting the technology together with curriculum, other classroom activities and teacher training provides the power to change student learning and understanding.  One picture shows work of four student groups trying to think out what was important about the science they saw in the laboratory experiment that constituted the "grounding experience" for the instructional unit.
