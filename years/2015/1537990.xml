<AbstractNarration>The breakdown of shed plant parts (liter) by microbes, called decomposition, is a fundamental ecological process integral to the flow of energy and cycling of nutrients in all ecosystems. Many earlier studies have described how the initial chemical makeup of litter relates to its decomposition rate. But much less is known about the later stages of decay, which are important for long-term stability of soils and ecosystems. If initial chemistry is not in fact related to long-term decomposition, as is usually assumed, then our understanding is much more limited than thought. This project takes advantage of a large set of archived litter samples collected from a wide range of ecosystems over many years. The investigators will combine existing data on litter chemistry with new analyses of these archived samples to explore more general patterns of litter chemistry throughout the entire decomposition process. This project will integrate research and education with undergraduates at the West Campus of Arizona State University that serves a very diverse community with a high percentage of first-generation college students. In addition, a decomposition module will be developed for K-12 teachers to use in Arizona middle and high school science classes. The investigators will take advantage of the multiple institutions involved to coordinate undergraduate student teaching and involvement in research, while centralized training at the University of New Hampshire will enable graduate students to learn new techniques in close collaboration. Finally, in addition to publishing results in peer-reviewed journals, a special session is proposed for a national meeting to engage a larger group of scientists in discussions of this important topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will determine whether diverse plant litter types maintain their initial chemical differences throughout decay, remaining chemically unique as often assumed, or if decomposing litter follows different chemical trajectories to either converge or diverge over the course of decomposition. Further, this study will determine how these patterns relate to decay rate and identify the local environmental drivers, including climate and decomposer communities, that may influence the patterns and temporal variability in litter chemistry during decomposition. The results of this project will help determine whether the suite of litter chemical characteristics known to influence decomposition follow consistent patterns throughout decay across a range of terrestrial ecosystems that includes forests, deserts and agricultural fields. It will help settle the issue of whether or not initial litter chemistry is the main determinant of decay rates. The project will also document and explain differences resulting from the many analytical methods currently used that should be taken into account in future studies. By leveraging existing data and a large set of archived litter samples, the new resources needed to achieve these objectives are greatly reduced.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plant litter decomposition is a narrow but critical step in the global carbon cycle, and it is key to the formation of soil organic matter.  Yet many of the factors that govern the litter decomposition process are still poorly understood.  The goal of this project was to test a long standing assumption about plant litter decomposition; that over the course of decay, all plant litter follows a predictable chemical trajectory regardless of differences in initial litter chemistry or environmental conditions.  To achieve this goal, archived plant litter samples were obtained from roughly 25 plant litter species decomposed across 10 different ecosystems.  Litter chemistry was analyzed at distinct decay stages (100, 70, 50, and 30% of initial mass remaining) to facilitate comparison of litter samples regardless of differences in decay rate.  Chemical analyses were conducted using pyrolysis-gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (py-GCMS).  This method couples the pyrolysis of solid samples with compound separation using traditional chromatography, followed by electron ionization and compound identification using the resulting ion fragments.  Py-GCMS generates a detailed chemical fingerprint for plant litter samples, allowing for in-depth assessment of changes in chemistry over the course of decomposition.    This project also incorporated a mentorship opportunity for an undergraduate student to play a significant role in meeting the project goals.  The student helped prepare plant litter samples for analysis, learned how to operate a py-GCMS system and process raw data, worked with other undergraduates and faculty involved in the project to analyze samples, process data and prepare a scientific poster, and co-presented a poster at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America in Fort Lauderdale, FL (Figure 1).  In addition to attending the conference, the student was also able to travel to an annual meeting for the Hubbard Brook, Long-Term Ecological Research site near Woodstock, NH (Figure 2). There, the student had the chance to network with other students and scientists and discuss possible career paths related to ecosystem ecology and environmental chemistry.   Our initial py-GCMS results indicated no clear distinctions in chemistry among decay stages, but, even after significant decay, most plant litter species appeared to retain distinct chemical traits.  Despite remaining chemically unique throughout the decomposition process, many litter species exhibited a relative reduction in lignin and polysaccharides accompanied by a relative accumulation of lipids over their decay.  This pattern was not observed in all litter species; agricultural crop residues and litters decomposed in agroecosystems, tropical forests, and some arid environments followed different trajectories.  Our findings suggest that in many cases, plant litter may indeed follow a common chemical trajectory during decay.  However, factors that have traditionally been considered important only for predicting litter decay rates (e.g. initial plant litter chemistry and variation in biotic and abiotic factors among ecosystems) may play important roles in shaping the chemical trajectory of litter over the course of decay.  This finding could have implications at both community and ecosystem-levels as substrate chemistry is important for understanding trophic dynamics in food webs as well as longer-term soil processes such as soil organic matter formation.
