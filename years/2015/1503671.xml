<AbstractNarration>The University of California, Berkeley Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) will join the Fossil Insect Thematic Collections Network (TCN) dedicated to understanding the impacts of environmental change on insect diversity and evolution using paleontological data. The project will expand the TCN's current geographic coverage providing researchers and the public with web-accessible digitized images and specimen records of approximately 4,900 Cenozoic insects that lived during times of significant climate change. These specimens include insects in amber, a rare insect assemblage from the Great Basin, and Ice Age insects from southern California's Rancho La Brea and McKittrick tarpits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Addition of these specimens to the Fossil Insect TCN will enhance datasets for analyzing how these climatically-sensitive organisms have responded to abrupt environmental changes throughout Earth history, and the implications of climatic warming on present-day biodiversity. Students at UC Berkeley will perform the digitization while learning about the value of natural history collections and their relevance to science. Project data will enhance UCMP's K-16 teacher-student science education programs, global public outreach, and Internet resources. Input from local communities will assist in developing "DigIt", a mobile application for researchers, teachers and students, members of industry, government agencies, and the public. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) joined the digitization Thematic Collections Network (TCN), &ldquo;Fossil Insect Collaborative: A Deep-time Approach to Studying Diversification and Environmental Change,&rdquo; as a partner (the Berkeley Fossil Insect PEN [BFIP]) to digitize the UCMP&rsquo;s holdings of fossil insects. The Collaborative's central goal is to make available to researchers and the public digital images of the roughly 253,250 specimens and their associated data records (e.g., information about taxonomic, geographic occurrence, geologic age, and collector) held in nine of our nation&rsquo;s museums and academic institutions. The Collaborative&rsquo;s specimen images and data are now accessible online via a number of web portals and includes insects found in deposits from around the world that range in age from the Paleozoic (from ~400 million years ago), to the Mesozoic (from ~250 million years ago) up through the Cenozoic (from 66 million to 10,000 years ago). Because insects have a long geologic history and their different life stages &ndash; egg, larva, adult &ndash; are fine-tuned to their environment, the study of fossil insects can inform us about climate-mediated biodiversity changes, changes in their geographic distribution through time, insect evolution and extinction, co-evolution with plants and animals, and because of their sensitivity to environmental change, they can inform us about how they responded to dramatic climate fluctuations (e.g., the warmer and wetter interval in the Eocene [greenhouse] vs. the cooler and drier interval in the Oligocene [icehouse]) and the impact these conditions had on insect diversity and community structure in deep-time, thereby providing a basis to assess the potential negative impacts future climate change will have on our modern biota.</p> <p>Our primary goal for the BFIP project was to digitally database and image UCMP&rsquo;s fossil insects to fill gaps in the representation of the Collaborative&rsquo;s existing Cenozoic insect faunas. We added new specimens from the Miocene, one of the Earth&rsquo;s warmest epochs, and from new or underrepresented geographic areas (California, Nevada; Chiapas, Mexico). The collections included: 1) two-dimensional compressed insect and spiders preserved in the fine-grained lacustrine sediments of the mid-Miocene Stewart Valley, Nevada; 2) three-dimensionally-preserved insect, spider, and millipedes from the late Pleistocene-Holocene Rancho La Brea and McKittrick tar pits of Southern California; 3) the type and non-type insects and spiders in early Miocene amber from Chiapas, Mexico collected by Frans Blom, UC Berkeley faculty and associates; 4) the unique, three-dimensionally-preserved crystalline casts of millipedes from the Pleistocene Crystal Caverns cave in the Sierra Nevada foothills; and 5) a small collection of miscellaneous insect compressions from several Paleogene sites in western North America. Two additional collections were discovered and also digitized, a small collection of the three-dimensional casts of nests made by ground-dwelling bees and an assemblage of Holocene insects associated with plants and vertebrates from a newly-discovered tar seep in the Coast Range of central California.</p> <p>Through the life of the grant we successfully added 6,278 images and digital data records for over 6,200 specimens, surpassing our original estimates. The BFIP specimen images and data are accessible online through iDigBio (<a href="https://www.idigbio.org/portal">https://www.idigbio.org/portal</a>), iDigPaleo (<a href="https://idigpaleo.org/">https://idigpaleo.org/</a>), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/">https://www.gbif.org/</a>) and Encyclopedia of Life (EOL). Concurrent with the public serving of the specimen metadata and low resolution images to the above mentioned web portals, user access and experience has been enhanced by the serving of high resolution images via the UC Berkeley CalPhotos database (<a href="https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/">https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/</a>, advance search: Project=Berkeley Fossil Insect PEN). The CalPhotos specimen images in turn are directly linked to their specimen data records in the UCMP database (<a href="https://ucmpdb.berkeley.edu/">https://ucmpdb.berkeley.edu/</a>). Access to the UCMP fossil insect collections by the public and professionals is facilitated by ongoing awareness of the project through social media interfaces such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and the BFIP website (<a href="https://bfip.berkeley.edu/">https://bfip.berkeley.edu/</a>). Outcomes from the BFIP project have contributed to the Collaborative&rsquo;s goals to advance understanding of changes in insect diversity throughout Earth's history, phylogeny and evolution, co-evolutionary relationships and geographic distribution through deep time, and the impact environmental change had and potentially will have on insect biodiversity if our planet continues to warm at its current rate. The online availability of the Collaborative&rsquo;s data, as well as that of the other digitization projects, is extremely helpful to professionals worldwide who often find it difficult to obtain funding and the time to personally visit collections relevant to their research interests that reside thousands of miles away.</p> <p>This project, led by a first-time PI, engaged a diverse team of nine undergraduates, two graduate students, a Visiting Scholar from Egypt and the UCMP outreach team in a variety of activities working with the UCMP fossil insect collections in carrying out grant-related tasks.&nbsp;They received on-hands training in natural history collection curation, database management, fossil preparation and handling, use of state-of-the art imaging equipment and imaging software.
