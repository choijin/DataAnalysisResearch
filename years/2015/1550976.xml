<AbstractNarration>1550976 Agrawal, Nitin &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissolved oxygen is an essential nutrient for cells.  It is sparingly soluble and thus its concentration varies in solid tumors and tissues with consequential physiological response.  This proposal attempts to innovate a sensing platform that will measure cellular response at various oxygen concentrations in a microfluidic arrangement. An example application is dose-dependent cellular response can be obtained efficiently at various levels of oxygen tension. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissolved oxygen (DO), an essential nutrient, is required for energy metabolism of mammalian cells. When cells grow into tumors, dissolved oxygen gradients vary spatially.  Similar situation arises in tissues and muscles that are not well vascularized.  Since DO has significant effects on cellular physiology, there is a need for a measurement and experimental platform that will enable detailed characterization of cellular responses under various DO levels and DO gradients.  To address this, simultaneous sensing of hypoxic perturbation and measuring cellular response in a single semi-automated platform is proposed.  The integrated multi-sensing platform is capable of imposing linear oxygen gradients without requiring a continuous supply of oxygen. Monitoring real-time dissolved oxygen tension via integrated thin-film PdO-EPK oxygen sensor, monitoring continuously cell-cycle progression, as well as analyzing dose response effects of multiple drugs on cell proliferation and survival will be accomplished. Two cell types MDA-MB-231 (breast) and U87MG (glioblastoma) will be used for the model experiments.  Scientifically, the proposed approach, if successful, will create a measurement platform for conducting oxygen tension studies.  The research project is multidisciplinary and integrates bioengineering, cell biology, microfabrication, computational design and modeling, and will expose a full-time PhD student to an interesting learning opportunity. It is planned to incorporate multidisciplinary training in the STEM field through George Mason University?s (GMU) ?Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program? designed for promoting research and education in high schools and undergraduate students in the Northern Virginia. Through proposed research on sensor platform the PIs will promote underrepresented minorities in STEM through the ?Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation? program at GMU.</AbstractNarration>
