<AbstractNarration>Remarkable patterns have been discovered in the structure of closed curves lying on surfaces. The goal of this project is explain as many as possible of these patterns theoretically and to discover further structures. This research combines methods from geometry and topology with probability and statistics. The tools include computer experimentation using algorithms developed by the PI, finding patterns, and then proving rigorous results about the patterns that are discovered. The PI will engage graduate and undergraduate students in research related to the project and she will organize the Stony Brook Women in Mathematics Group. The PI also plans to create a series of applets that can be used by other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the project is to understand the asymptotic statistical structure of five numbers that can be associated to the free homotopy class of closed curves on an orientable surface with negative Euler characteristic. Those numerical values are the self-intersection number, the word-length (that is the smallest number of letters of a word representing the curve in a chosen set of generators of the fundamental group of the surface), the geometric length of the unique geodesic, and the mean and the variance of the distribution of mutual intersection numbers with other curves. Another part of the project concerns development of a combinatorial description of the string topology of manifolds in dimension three, and exploring a relationship of string topology with the geometrization of three manifolds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       A surface can be seen as the mathematical representation of the "outer layer of a solid". A curve on a surface can be thought of as a "rubber band" clinging to the surface of the solid. Three numbers can be associated with a closed curve on a surface:   the number of times a curve crosses itself, the  two lengths of the curve on the surface,   computed  the first way using a notion of distance on the surface and the second way using the smallest word length description.  These words are written  in terms of   upper and lower case  letters which label the directed ways of going around certain basic holes in the topology of the surface.   Two closed curves on a surface are considered to be ?the same?  if one curve  can be deformed continuously to the other without leaving the surface.  This relationship determines a class of curves  which consists in the  set of all curves that are related in this way.  By considering the smallest values taken on a class of curves , one can define the length, the word length and the self-intersection number of a class of curves. In this work,  algebraic, combinatorial and statistical structure and relations between these three numbers associated to a class were studied. In some cases, conjectures were first established by means of computer experiments. Many of these experiments were performed by graduate, undergraduate and high school students  We also studied how a certain algebraic structure defined by combining and splitting apart classes of curves is related to the number of intersections of these curves. This structure is known as the Goldman Lie bracket. In this work, we studied the relation  between this structure and the number of  crossings of curves on  the surface.  Also for  a particular surface, the sphere with three holes a rather  extensive computation was  performed for the number of  curve classes with a given word length and a given number of  self crossings. This computation revealed an unexpected theorem whereby infinite sets of values lay  exactly on a system of parabolas each one determined by three of  its values. The life and work of  a not very well known female mathematician, Alicia Boole (1860-1940), was researched and it was discovered how she started to work on regular four dimensional polytopes (the four-dimensional analogues to the Platonic solids). Alicia Boole found and deeply analyzed all six of the four dimensional platonic solids.  In all of these activities a substantial production of mathematical  surface crochet  was used to explain the mathematics and geometry (see Figures)    During the four summers included in this grant, we organized the Stony Brook Student Workshop in Geometry and Topology. This workshop meets once a week for about six hours during the entire summer. Participants include high school, undergraduate  and grad students as well as students from the Math Education Program and faculty members. The format is highly interactive, with occasional lectures and a great deal of ?hands on? work.   Many of these students started and completed research projects. Many of the undergraduate students went to grad school in Mathematics, some being inspired to do so by the workshop.  This grant supported the Stony Brook Math Club, a vibrant organization of young math enthusiasts who held meetings to discuss problems and listened to talks, as well as providing tutoring to freshman at Stony Brook.  This grant also supported the Stony Brook Women in Math group, a network  of women whose purpose is increase the number of women in mathematics by mentoring undergraduate and graduate students.
