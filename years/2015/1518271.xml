<AbstractNarration>The investigators will search for red giant stars along the plane of our Milky Way galaxy, using radio telescopes. These stars have the remarkable characteristic of acting like ultra-bright lasers, emitting radio waves due to the molecule Silicon Monoxide (SiO), which is found in the environment surrounding this type of star. Because of this unique feature, radio telescopes can detect these stars at great distances, even when they are hidden in clouds of dust and gas. The investigators will use the stars to study the structure of our galaxy and understand how our Galaxy is being pulled by the gravity of other nearby galaxies and clusters of stars in our Galaxy. By looking for unusual motions of stars in the galaxy, the investigators can detect the past collisions of dwarf galaxies with our Galaxy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will test models for a key feature seen in our Galaxy, "the bar", a linear structure extending on both sides of the center of our Galaxy. The bar is thought to partially result from the gravitational pull of clusters of stars and gas. These clusters merged to become part of our Milky Way. In addition to the bar, our Galaxy also shows a "bulge" near the center, where stars reach high orbits. In our region of the galaxy the stars are concentrated in a disk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will provide student participation opportunities and education within the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines. This includes finding minority students to work on the project and concentrating on strengthening female participation. Through this research award, graduate students will be trained and additional undergraduate students will be have to opportunity for summer research jobs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific science goals include the modeling of the dynamics and the structure of the Galactic bulge and the central galactic disk. This data will allow defining the relationship of the bar to the populations of the Galactic plane and Center, and the effect of the strongly boxy potential of the bulge on dynamics, and the presence of a ``long'' bar. In particular, both N-body models and self-consistent models will be compared with direct dynamical measurements from the stellar maser velocities. From near-infrared spectra elemental abundances and properties of the circumstellar envelopes will be determined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator's studies will also be important for understanding the structure of all spiral galaxies. The Galactic bulge provides a unique laboratory, as it is the only place where detailed studies are possible for the processes taking place in many disk galaxies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  The project produced a survey of 20,000 SiO maser sources toward the Galactic bulge.  SiO masers arise in red giant stars; in this case, we detected them in stars toward the center of the Milky Way.   Masers produce extraordinarily intense emission that is detected in the radio region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and we studied these sources using the Very Larage Array in New Mexico, and the Atacama Large Millmeter array, of which the US is a partner, in Chile.     Our project is the Bulge Asymmetry and Dynamics Project, or BAaDE, named after Walter Baade, who pioneered study of the Milky Way's bulge in the 1940s.  We report two findings (1) we detected the loss of mass in the red giant stellar atmosphere, using the thermal emission from the v=1-0 ground state emission of SiO.  The 20 brightest red giants had clearly detected emission that could be fit to a mass loss model, and the velocity of mass loss detected (Dike et al. 2021; Figure 1).  We also discovered 2 classes of maser sources.  For the first time, we see a large number of masers associated with the disk; these are closer to the Sun (around 5000 light years).   We also see a large number associated with the central bulge, some 25,000 light years distant.   The bulge masers show a larger velocity dispersion, because the orbits of stars in the bulge are random while those in the disk are more regular and circular.   Our paper (Trapp et al. 2018; Figure 2)  was the first ever to report both a disk and bulge population of red giants with maser emission. The bulge population is of special interest:  the giants are intrinsically luminous stars near the end of their red giant phase, and appear to be so bright that the progenitors must be 1 billion years old, or younger. This would appear to contradict what we know about the bulge (it is an old stellar population and there is a lot of evidence point toward 10 billion years as the age of most of its stars).  We are following up with additional studies to understand this.  For the moment, the two populations of masers point toward  an interesting direction for additional study.  Broader Impact:  We trained graduate students at UCLA and the University of New Mexico.  Veronica Dike is a first generation college student, and also a Native American, who was partially supported by, and involved in, this research. Results were presented at international scientific meetings and in the form of review articles, and in refereed journals.  References:   Dike, V. et al. ApJ 2021 in press.
