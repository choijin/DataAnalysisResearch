<AbstractNarration>As the Internet grows, the need for skilled workers to create digital content for different types of venues and applications also grows. This generates a demand for educating both students and faculty about changes in programming, interface design, and mobile application development to respond to a demonstrated need in Illinois and Chicago and its surrounding counties for trained professionals in the mobile design application field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Interface Design and Development for Mobile Devices project will develop curriculum and educational materials for new certificates and degree programs at McHenry County College. The goals of the project are to 1) prepare incoming students and incumbent workers in the field of mobile development and design to address the problem of the shortage of skilled technicians in the field; and 2) provide professional development on mobile interface design, usability, and marketing to the educational community. Computers and digital media faculty will seek training and use their expertise in developing a new, innovative program with strong intellectual merit in the emerging field of interface design and development for mobile devices. The broader impact includes meeting business and industry needs, resulting in a more highly trained workforce and helping to fill the demand for trained technicians in interface design and mobile applications development. By offering beginning programming classes as dual credit in partnership with area high schools, McHenry County College will strengthen the pipeline of trained individuals in an emerging field. Students completing the program will earn certificates or a degree in interface design and development for mobile devices, preparing them for employment. In addition to developing a website on which newly developed teaching materials and videos can be accessed by other colleges, this project will be disseminated through TeachingTechnicians.org and conference presentations. Faculty will coordinate with colleagues to evaluate and share the curriculum, increasing the broader impact of the project.</AbstractNarration>
