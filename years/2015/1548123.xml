<AbstractNarration>This project engages research teams in the US, Spain, Germany and France to develop tools for the design of microorganisms to perform valuable functions including cost-effective synthesis of important chemicals or capabilities for the decontamination of toxic waste.  The investigators will develop a predictive mathematical model of a bacterial cell that will guide the design and genetic manipulation that will allow the development of a minimal organism that is optimized to perform specific functions or behaviors. This project will provide interdisciplinary research training for postdoctoral scholars, support a summer course that will provide twenty-five graduate students training in computational systems biology, and includes activities that will disseminate the most advanced computational and experimental bioengineering methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses key challenges for synthetic biology, such as the limited capabilities to design, synthesize, and fully understand whole genomes. Bacteria with minimal uncharacterized components, such as Mycoplasma pneumonia, are ideal for this purpose. Data derived from detailed experimental characterization of the organism will be used to create predictive models that will guide the design and development of a streamlined version of the progenitor strain. This collaborative project combines expertise in genomic profiling, whole-cell modeling, and genome engineering to rationally construct an optimized cellular chassis to specification.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is the US collaborative component of a project funded through the ERASynBIO EU-US transnational funding mechanism.</AbstractNarration>

Most engineering fields, such as mechanical engineering, use mechanistic models to quickly, reliably and efficiently design complex systems such as planes. In contrast, synthetic biology relies on slow, ineffective, and expensive trial-and-error methods, such as directed evolution, because we do not have mechanistic "whole-cell" (WC) models that predict the phenotypes of cells from their genotype and environment.  Recently, we and others demonstrated the feasibility of WC models by reporting the first model that represents each characterized gene of a small bacterium. However, the model does not represent several key processes, the model mispredicts several phenotypes, and the model was constructed by hand and simulated ad hoc.  Substantial work remains to build and leverage WC models that can transform bioengineering. This includes systemizing the construction and simulation of WC models; building comprehensive, accurate models; and developing methods for using WC models to design cells. Achieving this vision will require an interdisciplinary community of scientists and engineers.  The primary results of this project were an improved WC model of a better-characterized bacterium which is one of the primary causes of walking pneumoniae, several technologies which make it easier to build WC models, and several initial efforts to build an interdiscplinary WC modeling community.  First, we produced the most comprehensive data set for any organism to date. Second, we used this data to produce an expanded model of M. pneumoniae which represents more cellular processes in more detail. Third, we used the model to generate hypotheses about how M. pneumoniae accomodates the large amount of noise in the expression of its genes. To enable the model, this project initiated efforts to develop several new computational tools for systematically aggregating data for WC modeling, systematically designing models from large data sets, clearly describing WC models and their provenance, and accurately simulating multi-algorithmic WC models. We anticipate that these tools will accelerate our efforts to build a more comprehensive and accurate model. We also anticipate that they will enable more precise communication of large datasets in related the related fields of proteomics and synthetic biology.  The project also enabled us to foster a WC modeling community through outreach to the research community and the public. This included publishing one of the first roadmaps for WC modeling, developing a website that disseminates information about WC modeling, organizing some of the first WC modeling meetings, conducting a community survey that solicited input into the goals and approaches of WC modeling, and presenting several seminars on WC modeling.
