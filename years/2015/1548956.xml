<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a social robot that will provide initial evidence for the feasibility and promise of a new generation of life-like animation-based and emotionally intelligent robots that provide companionship for individuals with cognitive disabilities (e.g. Dementia and AD) and increase their happiness and independence. The application and the potential societal and commercial impact of the project is not limited to aging population and dementia therapy and can be used in a variety of applications such as science, math &amp; reading tutoring in classrooms or homes, language and speech therapy, autism therapy (e.g. special Ed programs in school districts), and even as concierges and front desk receptionists in hospitals, museums, hotels, and restaurants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of developing and deploying of emotionally intelligent light-projected life-like conversational robots for improving the quality of life, self-efficacy and cognitive abilities of elderly individuals with Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and dementia. Older people with AD and other dementias have significantly more hospital stays, skilled nursing facility stays and home health care visits than other older people.  There is thus a critical and growing demand in society and in our healthcare system to find efficient, effective and affordable ways to provide care and improve the quality of life of elderly individuals with dementia. This project will create an innovative, empathic social robot which will engage elderly individuals in assisted living facilities in a variety of activities, including exercises, games, and especially natural spoken dialogs that relevant to their interests and needs.  The project extends the capabilities of current social robots through research that integrates computer vision, spoken dialog, character animation and robotic head movement technologies to develop an emotionally intelligent and empathic robotic caregiver and companion. A pilot study will be conducted, in collaboration with health care practitioners and residences of senior living facilities, to study how naturally and effectively the social robot communicates with elderly individuals and engages them in therapeutic activities (e.g. Montessori-based activities and Spaced Retrieval memory care techniques), and whether interacting with the robot over several weeks improves their self-efficacy and sense of well-being.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The main objective of the Phase I research was to develop an intelligent, emotive and perceptive social robot (aka companionbot) and learn how to design interactions with the robot to improve the quality of life of elderly people with dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease living in either assisted or independent living facilities. Ryan, the companionbot prototyped in this project, is a light-projected life-like conversational robot equipped with computer vision and artificial intelligence software tools that can (1) interpret and respond to users&rsquo; emotions through facial expressions and spoken language, (2) proactively engage in conversations with users, (3) answer their questions, and (4) remind them about their daily life schedules (e.g. taking their medicine on time). A tablet in Ryan&rsquo;s torso engaged users in cognitive computer games and reminiscence activities developed during the project. The tablet was also used to enable users to listen to music, watch YouTube videos, and view a narrated family photo album. To assess Ryan&rsquo;s feasibility as a companionbot, we conducted pilot studies with six elderly individuals with dementia and depression living in the Eaton Senior Living Facility in Denver, Colorado. Each individual had 24/7 access to Ryan in their rooms for a period of 4-6 weeks. Our observations of these individuals, interviews with them and their caregivers, and analyses of their interactions during this period, revealed that they interacted with Ryan daily, greatly valued their interactions and felt they benefited from them. In sum, the Phase I effort accomplished all tasks, which included the design, fabrication and successful integration of a companionbot to improve the quality of life of elderly individuals with dementia and depression. The pilot study indicated that an emotionally intelligent conversational companionbot that supports a variety of engaging activities can fully engage and improve the quality of life of elderly individuals with dementia and depression.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/22/2016<br>      Modified by: Mohammad&nbsp;H&nbsp;Mahoor</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
