<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a novel analysis tool for III-V semiconductor compounds with immediate impact in Light Emitting Diode (LED) manufacturing and high-mobility channel device industries.  Currently, relatively low yields during epitaxial growth of the LED semiconductor layers cause a significant loss to the industry.  High mobility integrated devices and LED epitaxial development teams have access to methods that provide partial information and metrology about the semiconductor layers.  The system proposed here will provide complete electrical data on the materials and could cut significantly improve the feedback time, resulting  in higher yields and lower manufacturing costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will build a prototype system to directly measure high-resolution mobility and activation profiles for III-V semiconductors.  Currently, electrical profiling methods do not measure mobility profiles of activated materials that form the basis of the III-V semiconductor device industries.  Thus, researchers cannot take into account the effect of process variations on the mobility profiles of the electronic materials.  This prevents the complete electrical characterization of the material, and the optimization of the material growth/implantation and activation processes. The anticipated outcome of this project is a functional system that will provide better and quicker analysis on electronic materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Traditional semiconductor material profiling techniques largely fall into two categories: Physical/chemical data: as provided by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), all imaging technologies - scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), High-res TEM, etc., and Electronic characterization: as provided by spreading resistance data, scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM), Electrochemical CV (E-CV), etc. The profiling techniques are typically used to guide and correct material growth/implantation and activation processes.   III-V materials are unique in that they can be used to build high-mobility devices (ca. 10^5cm2/V-s) used in the High Electron-Mobility Transistor, and III-V: Silicon integrated device industries, and also be used to build low power usage LED devices.   Unfortunately, the electrical profiling methods provided above do not provide mobility profiles, and assumptions may be incorrect. Electrical defect analysis for materials is not possible, and optimizing high-mobility devices is difficult when actual material mobility profiles are not available. The industry lacks a large part of data-set that is needed to fully characterize these materials.   This project successfully demonstrated a prototype system to fully electrically characterize III-V compound semiconductors. The resolution achieved was in the ~1-5nm range for the prototype system. Profiles that completely characterize the electrical nature of these materials were collected.  This data can then be used to analyze the "goodness" of the III-V material and provide crucial and relevant electrical data to accurately model devices. This system may provide rapid electrical feedback in the process line.  Intellectual Merit:  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project demonstrated  a prototype system to directly measure high-resolution mobility and activation profiles for III-V semiconductors. Currently, electrical profiling methods do not measure mobility profiles of activated materials that form the basis of the billion $ logic device and LED industries. Thus, researchers cannot take into account the effect of process variations on the mobility profiles of the electronic materials. This prevents the complete electrical characterization of the material, and the complete optimization of the material growth/implantation and activation processes.  This is completely novel technology distinct in nature and performance from the current technologies.  Broader Impacts:  The system will be a completely novel analysis tool with immediate impact in LED manufacturing and High-mobility channel device industries. Currently poor LED epi-layer yields (~60-80%) cause a loss of $300-600M/yr. Both III-V: Silicon &amp; HEMT integrated device &amp; LED-epi industries have access to methods that provide partial information. This system when deployed will provide complete electrical data on the materials and could cut feedback time to minutes implying high yields and time-cost savings. This system could indirectly affect the lives of many millions of people by providing them with better-optimized LED lights and better high-mobility reliable electronic devices. The anticipated commercial impact in Phase III is well over $200M/yr.       Last Modified: 04/19/2016       Submitted by: Abhijeet Joshi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
