<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Hannah L. Owens is "Integrative analysis of the tropical diversity gradient from museum collections of New World swallowtail butterflies." The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Florida, and the sponsoring scientists are Robert Guralnick and Akito Kawahara.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most profound patterns in geographical ecology is that biodiversity is higher in the tropics than in temperate zones.  Understanding the contributions of various hypothesized drivers of species, diversification rates and, ultimately, observed diversity, makes it possible to predict future biodiversity in regions undergoing rapid environmental change. Using cutting-edge methods for collecting new data from existing biological specimens, this research promises to develop a synthetic understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes that lead to the tropical diversity gradient in New World swallowtail butterflies. Innovative analyses of the tropical diversity gradient involves incorporating traditionally-hypothesized drivers of the pattern, such as evolutionary history, lineage age, and diversification rate, with novel factors such as tropicality of suitable environments, breadth of suitable environments, and morphological variability. This work is being conducted at the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity (MGCL) and Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH) at the University of Florida, which houses one of the largest and fastest-growing collections of Lepidoptera in the United States, and also uses the collection of the National Museum of Natural History. This work is transformative in its use of cutting-edge methods for collecting genetic and morphological data from museum specimens, and by improving the connection between specimens and the data derived from them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training goals include genomics, digitizing museum specimen information, teaching, and public outreach to develop as an independent researcher and educator. Data collected during the course of research is being incorporated into laboratory activities for upper and lower division college courses, in order to familiarize students with the vast array of useful information to be collected from museum specimens. Further, as papillionids are colorful, charismatic, and easy to observe, they represent an ideal group for developing public outreach opportunities. In collaboration with the FLMNH?s Center for Science Learning, public education materials are being developed to explore distributions of Florida native papillionid butterfly species, especially that of the endangered Schaus swallowtail.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit:</p> <p>As a cornerstone of this project, I have collaborated with colleagues at my home institution, the Florida Museum of Natural History, to develop a specimen digitization pipeline that includes standardized imaging of specimens (Figure 1), transcribing labels, and georeferencing specimens. To date, 1300 swallowtail butterflies housed at four institutions have been imaged and processed via this pipeline (Figure 2), and the pipeline is now being used to more broadly digitize the Florida Museum&rsquo;s butterfly collections. These digitized specimens are being made publicly available via the Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN) by the end of the summer to facilitate a diversity of museum-specimen-based studies in the future.</p> <p>In the first manuscript to be submitted as part of my project, I collaborated with researchers in Canada, Jamaica, and France to understand basic ecological, evolutionary, and biogeographic drivers of the latitudinal diversity gradient in swallowtail butterflies by considering both the ecology and evolutionary relationships of these species. Our approach was novel in that I generated distribution maps of each species of swallowtail butterfly, incorporating georeferenced museum records as a key information source, and estimated the degree to which each species was considered tropical based on the classic latitudinal definition versus a more recent climatic definition. While we found no evidence for increased ecological opportunity as latitude decreases (as defined by the breadth of climatic conditions available at each line of latitude), nor increased diversification rate among closely-related butterfly species found closer to the equator (two common hypotheses explaining the latitudinal diversity gradient), we found that the biogeographic history of the group may have played a key role in present-day swallowtail butterfly diversity. Specifically, highland habitats in tropical latitudes are climatically similar to habitats at temperate latitudes (e.g. average temperatures decrease as elevation increases). Particularly striking was our finding of the putative origin of the <em>Pterourus</em> subgenus in temperate North America, and its subsequent dispersal to the geographic tropics via temperate climates in the highlands of the American Cordillera. This suggests a mechanism by which temperate lineages may disperse into the tropics, a pattern which may be much more prevalent than thought. I have developed collaborations to investigate the ubiquity of this pattern in other groups, including neotropical birds and other butterfly lineages.</p> <p>Furthermore, I have two ongoing collaborations to further utilize specimens digitized for this project as a unique resource to understand the relationship between climate and morphological diversity. In the first, I am working with a graduate student at the University of Florida to examine variation in wing shape within and among species in a geographic context to test hypotheses that climate effects, as well as competition with co-occurring related species, may drive morphological diversity. In the other study, I am working with researchers at Georgetown University to test similar questions using semi-automated measurements of wing color.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Broader Impacts:</p> <p>To transcribe specimen labels as part of the digitization pipeline, I participated as a data provider in the Notes from Nature citizen science initiative. The Notes from Nature platform allows researchers to post collections of specimen images to a website; worldwide volunteers can access these images and transcribe label data which is then returned to the researcher. Notes from Nature, in addition to showing the public the diversity of data and specimens found in natural history museums and providing researchers with volunteers committed to producing high-quality transcriptions, allows volunteers and researchers to interact through discussion boards, humanizing the process of research. In my role as a researcher, I wrote several blog posts outlining my project and how data volunteers generate contributed to ongoing progress in my research.</p> <p>I have also participated in two informal educational outreach events at the Florida Museum in which I discussed the role of collections-based data in my research. The first, &ldquo;WeDigBio&rdquo;, was a worldwide event in which museums worldwide host specimen digitization activities using several specimen digitization platforms, including Notes from Nature. For the second event, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a Scientist&rdquo;, Girl Scouts from local schools came to the Florida Museum to learn about different facets of museum science from female role models.</p> <p>From interacting with graduate students at the Florida Museum, it became clear that there was interest in training in ecological niche modeling and related methods, a cornerstone of this project and research in general. As such, I designed and delivered a niche modeling graduate seminar in close collaboration with Rob Guralnick, one of my project mentors, in which we trained 31 undergraduate and graduate students (including several international students and students from underrepresented populations) in the theory and practice of niche modeling. Several students plan to use what they learned in their graduate research or other independent projects in topics ranging from primary biodiversity assessments to applied conservation.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/20/2017<br>      Modified by: Hannah&nbsp;L&nbsp;Owens</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523732/1523732_10367412_1497985219696_HLOPP347Dorsal--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523732/1523732_10367412_1497985219696_HLOPP347Dorsal--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1.
