<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for a symposium at the annual meeting of the Society  for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) in Portland, Oregon in January 2016 entitled, "A bigger picture: Organismal function at the nexus of development, ecology,  and evolution."  The symposium will focus on a fundamental question in integrative biology: What links the developmental stability and instability of phenotypes with the patterns of morphological diversity seen across the tree of life? The symposium will constitute a platform to foster dialogue and collaborations among junior and senior career scientists conducting cutting-edge research on the ontogeny, function, and evolution of phenotypes. Due to its multidisciplinary nature, the SICB meeting is an ideal venue for the symposium. Importantly, the symposium will be the first to help recruit Native American undergraduates to attend the meeting and to provide a mentoring framework for these first-time minority student attendees. Through an explicit assessment of these activities, the symposium will also aid in creating a model of direct intellectual and financial support for future conference participation by students of underrepresented groups.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comparative anatomists tend to approach the question of ontogenic and morphologic diversity from one of two perspectives. For key anatomical complexes (e.g., feeding apparatus, locomotor systems, sensory structures), morphological changes during ontogeny are often interpreted in functional terms and linked to their putative importance for fitness. Across larger time scales, morphological transformations in these complexes are examined through character stability or mutability during cladogenesis. Because the fittest organisms must pass through ontogenetic changes in size and shape, it is predicted that addressing such transformations at different time scales, from life histories to macroevolution, would illuminate major factors contributing to phenotypic diversity.  The symposium will feature contemporary questions in integrative and comparative biology and the cutting-edge tools used to study them, hence creating a platform for discussion about the frontiers of functional morphology, evolutionary, and ontogenetic research. The symposium and its products (a minimum of 11 peer-reviewed publications, along with supplementary data, published in the  journal Integrative and Comparative Biology) will contribute to the understanding of the patterns and processes that characterize phenotypic diversity at various scales.</AbstractNarration>

The award provided financial support for travel, lodging, and/or registration for 6 undergraduates, 6 graduate student mentors, and 7 of the symposium speakers.</p> <p>The symposium showcased 10 presenters who are conducting cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research in integrative and comparative biology (<a href="http://www.sicb.org/meetings/2016/symposia/organismal.php">http://www.sicb.org/meetings/2016/symposia/organismal.php</a>). These speakers included 8 faculty, 1 postdoctoral scholar and 1 graduate student (laboratories led by 6 male and 5 female investigators, including 1 Hispanic and 1 Native American). Additionally, the Principal Investigators (PIs) organized a complementary session to the symposium, which allowed 6 graduate students (3 male, 3 female) to present their work. As a result, this award created a platform to discuss the frontiers of functional morphology, evolutionary, and ontogenetic research, and prompted new avenues for collaboration among participating researchers. Symposium presentations were published as 11 peer-reviewed articles (2 with open access) in the journal <em>Integrative and Comparative Biology</em> (<em>ICB</em>, Volume 56,&nbsp;Issue 3, September 2016). The journal cover for this issue of ICB featured images of the speaker&rsquo;s study organisms.</p> <p>One important achievement resulting from this award was the recruitment of 6 Native American undergraduates to attend their first national scientific meeting (1 male, 5 female; hailing from the Choctaw, Kiowa, and Cherokee Nations, as well as the Tlingit, Haida, and Naknek tribes). Each undergraduate was paired with a graduate student mentor who served as liaison to the conference environment. Graduate students were selected on the basis of previous attendance to SICB, scientific excellence, and mentorship experience. These graduate students presented their work at the symposium&rsquo;s complementary session, and one of them received a SICB best student presentation&nbsp;award.</p> <p>Through pre- and post-conference surveys, the PIs were able to assess the participants&rsquo; experience within this mentorship program. The surveys demonstrated that 100% of undergraduate and graduate students achieved their conference goals, which included networking with academics, learning more about academic opportunities across the United States, and learning about the natural world. Surveys also indicated that their understanding of and interest in scientific research doubled as a result of participation in the meeting. One of the undergraduate participants has become actively engaged in functional morphology research at one of the symposium speaker&rsquo;s lab, and several are considering applying for graduate school within STEM fields or folding research into their medical school goals (e.g., as MD/PhD students). The recruitment strategy and mentoring model developed through this award will inform future models of direct intellectual and financial support for future participation of underrepresented groups at SICB.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/11/2016<br>      Modified by: Sharlene&nbsp;E&nbsp;Santana</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1539880/1539880_10382958_1473624168449_ICBCOverVolume56Issue3September2016copy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1539880/1539880_10382958_1473624168449_ICBCOverVolume56Issue3September2016copy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ICB Cover"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1539880/1539880_10382958_1473624168449_ICBCOverVolume56Issue3September2016copy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ICB Cover"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Integrative and Comparative Biology issue featuring the articles produced by the symposium, and the speaker's study organisms in its cover</div> <div class="imageCredit">ICB</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sharlene&nbsp;E&nbsp;Santana</div> <div class="imageTitle">ICB Cover</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1539880/1539880_10382958_1473624229262_PhotoJan07,111804PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1539880/1539880_10382958_1473624229262_PhotoJan07,111804PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Undergraduate participants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1539880/1539880_10382958_1473624229262_PhotoJan07,111804PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Undergraduate participants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Native American undergraduates sponsored by this award to attend their first national conference</div> <div class="imageCredit">Paul Gignac</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sharlene&nbsp;E&nbsp;Santana</div> <div class="imageTitle">Undergraduate participants</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1539880/1539880_10382958_1473624351956_PhotoJan07,112109PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1539880/1539880_10382958_1473624351956_PhotoJan07,112109PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Symposium participants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1539880/1539880_10382958_1473624351956_PhotoJan07,112109PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Symposium participants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Undergraduate, graduate student, postdoc and faculty participants of the symposium</div> <div class="imageCredit">Paul Gignac</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sharlene&nbsp;E&nbsp;Santana</div> <div class="imageTitle">Symposium participants</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
