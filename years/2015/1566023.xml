<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by Professor Thomas Rauchfuss of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Professor Rauchfuss studies the preparation of molecules called alkoxysilanoates, with special emphasis on molecules of small size. While these compounds are intermediates in the production of silicone rubber, their fundamental properties are rarely examined.  This research enables less expensive, and more earth-abundant resources to be used in the formation of this commercially important class of compounds.  The alkoxysilanoates also bind to metal ions, and the basic properties of these metal complexes are being evaluated.  Graduate students are trained in fundamental research protocols.  In addition, undergraduate researchers, drawn from a broad pool, are recruited, not only to conduct research on this project, but to gain additional training through their participation in checking procedures for the book series Inorganic Syntheses. The checking process provides a benchmarked and mentored framework for students to develop skills in synthetic chemistry, culminating in their coauthorship as checkers. Similar training projects involve the students in developing experiments for a synthesis textbook, coauthored by Dr. Rauchfuss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methoxy and ethoxy derivatives of alkoxysilanoates are of practical significance both from the perspective of applications and the fundamental consideration of synthesis.  Professor Rauchfuss is preparing and characterizing the simplest sodium alkoxysilanoate salts and the protonation of these salts to form silanols that rapidly polymerize. These salts are used to develop the basic coordination chemistry via salt metathesis reactions with transition metal halides. Other routes to alkoxysilanoate complexes are pursued via the reaction of metal hydroxides and metal oxides with the methoxysilyl ethers. The mechanisms of these reactions are studied via kinetics measurements and isotopic labeling. These studies contribute knowledge relevant to the tin-catalyzed condensation of methoxysilanes to give siloxane resins, as practiced industrially.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Award Title: Synthesis and Reactivity of Alkoxysilanoates and Derivatives  Federal Award ID: 1566023 Report Submission Period: 09/01/2017 to 08/31/2018      The grant allowed for the initial survey of the chemical properties of new kinds of organosilicon compounds, which we call unhindered alkoxysilanoates.  Silanoate salts were produced by treating commercial organosilicon compounds with strong base.  Silanoates were found to make new compounds with several elements.  We also found that these metal-silanoates could be prepared by reactions of metal hydroxides and methoxysilanes.  The structures of the new compounds were established by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance.  The properties of the new compounds were assessed.  Since the compounds are of a new type, we were especially interested in the degradation pathways.  Indeed the alkoxy group of the silanoate ligand was found to transfer to the metal center.  One publication has appeared describing the results of this work.     During this work, my coworkers learned about the very active organosilicon industry that resides in the U.S.  Unexpectantly, we also learned about (and advanced) organotin chemistry since this theme is relevant to the industrial use of alkoxysilanes.  We hosted several undergraduate researchers, who, under the auspices of NSF, gained experience relevant to their careers.  One of the senior coworkers on this project took a teaching position at an undergraduate institution (Ohio Wesleyen), where he is teaching chemistry.
