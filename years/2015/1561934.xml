<AbstractNarration>This project considers the development of techniques to assist in the design and optimization of micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) that utilize resonant vibrations.   These micro-scale devices are important elements in many consumer electronics and products including wireless telephones, automobiles, and entertainment devices. The capabilities of these systems are often limited by a number of factors that restrict their range of operation, such as their maximum amplitude of vibration.  This research pursues a fundamental understanding of these limitations and developing systematic tools for improving the performance of these devices.  The broader impact of this project includes outreach, mentoring and training, inclusion of students from underrepresented groups, development of classroom materials motivated by the research, and dissemination of results.  This project will result in multidisciplinary training of students, who benefit from the close collaboration and integrated theoretical and experimental research approach of the PIs.   Also, the PIs and their graduate students will continue their longstanding participation in summer outreach programs to middle- and high-school students, and the inclusion of undergraduate research assistants. The PIs also plan to create an alumni mentoring program for graduate students, in which current graduate students will be connected with alumni who will offer professional advice and support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most commercial devices that employ vibratory MEMS are designed so that the resonant elements operate in their linear range and the designer can rely on simple models to analyze their response.  However, this sets limits on their operating range that do not take full advantage of their potential.  There have been recent efforts demonstrating significantly improved performance when nonlinear effects are systematically included in the MEMS design process.  The focus of this project is to embrace nonlinear behavior in resonators, to develop an understanding of the attendant limits, and to develop and experimentally demonstrate design methods that allow one to optimize performance in this realm.  The research focus is on MEMS that operate with one or two fundamental vibratory modes that can be described by weakly nonlinear models so that analytical methods, namely perturbation techniques, and the theory of normal forms, are applicable.  These models are linked with multi-physics computational tools and optimization techniques, using normal forms to formulate objective functions for the applications of interest.  Devices developed with these tools will be fabricated, characterized, and tested to validate the approach.  Applications will include frequency generation, frequency conversion, and inertial sensing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit    The vast majority of resonant MEMS devices are designed to operate in their linear dynamic range, limiting their bandwidth.  Certain MEMS devices, such as frequency converters, rely on generating sub and super harmonics, a nonlinear behavior.  Existing categories of MEMS devices can be enhanced by employing nonlinearity, for example reducing phase noise by modal coupling, or tuning amplitude-frequency space nonlinearities to create locally linear domains at nonzero amplitudes.  During the course of this project, the collaboration between UCSB and Florida Institute of technology developed a technique to employ optimization to allow design of nonlinear (or linear performance) at the idea conception stage.  Electrostatic forces add a controllable non-linearity to micro-electromechanical (MEMS) resonators which can be used to optimize their behavior. In this work, we describe resonators whose electrostatic and mechanical nonlinearities have been adjusted using modeling and shape optimization methods. This approach generates geometrically nonuniform beams with nonuniform electrode profiles which have tunable nonlinearities of varying order. We designed and characterized bridge-type microbeams in which geometric nonlinearities are minimized, and electrostatic effects are maximized. Experimental results have demonstrated that these shape changes allow a DC bias to vary the magnitude of cubic (Duffing) nonlinearities, and introduce counteracting higher order nonlinearities.The manipulation of these nonlinearities to improve linear dynamic range has significant interest in many applications, including precise mass sensing, accurate measurement of angular rates, and timekeeping. This can be applied to resonators/oscillators, resonant accelerometers, gyroscopes, as well as mass detection devices, and other micro/nanoscale devices.     Broader Impacts    The Broader Impacts of this project include design and invention of techniques to improve the performance of resonant microsystems.  Resonant microsystems are used in so many devices important to life today including wireless communications, automobile safety and operation, smart homes, and infrastructure monitoring.  This project was a collaboration between theoreticians and experimentalists at two USA and one international institution (non-budgeted collaborator). The UCSB budget supported 2 full time Ph.D. students, one of whom obtained their degrees and the other who is still progressing on-time. Additionally, it supported an undergraduate research assistant for 2 years.  The undergraduate research assistant went on to graduate with Highest Honors from UC Santa Barbara, and is currently in a PhD program at Stanford University.  The graduate student from the collaborative institution gained significant experience through communicating with the UCSB team on the basics of design, layout, fabrication, and testing/characterization.  The work led to a journal publication, a peer-reviewed conference paper, and a number of talks at national and international conferences and workshops. In addition, the students learned and were mentored by alumni students from both the UCSB team and the collaborators team, many of whom are now in industry.  This alumni networking expanded the reach of the impact, and enhanced the training for the students involved.
