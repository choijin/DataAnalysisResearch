<AbstractNarration>The past decade has seen rapid growth in media use by infants and toddlers, and in marketing of educational media products for young children, yet researchers know little about how the use of media such as smart phones and tablets influences young children's development. For older children, educational media can foster school readiness through increased cognitive, language, and social skills, making it a valuable intervention tool for promoting successful school entry. For infants and toddlers, these benefits are less evident. Toddlers do learn from interactive media such as mobile applications under some circumstances, but the specific conditions that result in learning from screen media remain unclear. The studies supported by this grant are designed to identify whether, how, and for whom screen media can be educationally valuable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two studies will explore: (1) the relation between children's gaze patterns and whether they learn while watching video and (2) the cognitive skills that predict toddlers' ability to learn from different media. The investigators will test how well toddlers (24-36 months) learn from different media, utilizing innovative approaches such as head-mounted eye tracking, which enables researchers to observe where children look while completing tasks. Of particular interest will be the extent to which individual differences in visual attention and cognitive skills predict toddlers' capacity to transfer from various screen media to real-life problems. It is expected that toddlers will learn more from video that is interactive, especially when interactive features help children focus attention on important information. It is further hypothesized that younger toddlers and those with poorly developed cognitive skills will benefit most from these applications. This work will inform the mechanisms by which screen-based learning occurs (or fails to occur) and address variability in toddlers' success in learning via electronic media.  By establishing how and for whom screen media support learning, results from these studies may also inform the development of scalable, cost-effective interventions that capitalize on mass media to reach millions of children, especially those at risk of school failure.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The past decade has seen rapid growth in the amount of time that infants and toddlers use digital media, and many mobile applications claim to be educationally valuable for young children. However, researchers know little about the impact of digital media during the first few years of life. While educational television may be able to help older children develop cognitive, language, and social skills, previous research demonstrates that television may not be educationally valuable for children younger than three years of age. Nonetheless, some studies suggest that toddlers can learn from a video screen if the children can interact with it. For instance, toddlers were more likely to learn when they interacted with a real-life person through video chat or used a simple touchscreen app than when they simply watched non-interactive video. With support from the National Science Foundation, the research group led by Dr. Heather Kirkorian (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and Dr. Tiffany Pempek (Hollins University) tested whether some types of interactive media are more effective than others, and whether some toddlers benefit more than others.</p> <p>The studies supported by this grant were designed to help identify whether, how, and for whom digital media can be educational. In a series of experiments, the researchers asked toddlers (24-36 months) to learn new words, imitate actions, and find hidden objects using different types of digital media. See Figure 1 for an example of one of the learning games. Children also completed other games to measure their cognitive and language skills.</p> <p>The researchers predicted that some children would learn more from the videos than others, because many toddlers have trouble learning from videos compared to real-life experiences. In fact, the researchers found that children were more likely to learn from videos when they had relatively high scores on a measure of working memory. That is, children who were better at mentally holding and updating information were also more likely to learn from videos. This supports the researchers? prediction that learning from video is challenging for young children.</p> <p>The researchers also tested whether toddlers would learn more from some types of digital media than others. Some children simply watched non-interactive video demonstrations. For instance, these children might watch videos of an actress showing them how to use a new toy. Other children used a simple touchscreen application to view the video demonstrations. For these children, the actress in the video might instruct them to touch a box in order to see the toy inside. Still other children used a different touchscreen application that was designed to draw their attention away from (rather than toward) the most important information. For these children, the actress in the video might instruct children to touch an irrelevant spot on the screen (e.g., a star in the background). See Figure 2 for an example of the different types of digital media.</p> <p>The researchers predicted that toddlers would be most likely to learn when they interacted with relevant information on the screen, such as tapping a box to see the toy inside (?relevant app?). This was true in some studies, with children learning more after interacting with a relevant app than after watching non-interactive videos. However, that was not always the case. On the other hand, sometimes children learned just as much (or even more) when they interacted with irrelevant information on the screen, such as tapping a star in the background (?irrelevant app?). See Figure 3 for an example from one study.</p> <p>These studies are the first controlled experiments to compare toddlers? learning from non-interactive videos, relevant apps, and irrelevant apps. Together, the findings challenge some previously held assumptions about how young children learn from digital media. It seems that very simple interactivity may help toddlers learn from video, regardless of whether the interactivity emphasizes relevant information on the screen. It remains to be seen whether the same is true of more complicated interactivity that is often found in commercial apps for young children. Additionally, the findings from the project demonstrate that learning from digital media is difficult for young children, and some children are more likely to learn than others&nbsp;</p> <p>Findings from this project will help to inform parents, teachers, policymakers, and practitioners about the usefulness of educational, interactive media products for young children. The PIs shared findings from this research with the general public through several parent workshops, educator trainings, public presentations, and interviews for news media. The PIs also shared findings from this research with some children?s media creators. This new knowledge will help media creators to develop educationally valuable products for children.
