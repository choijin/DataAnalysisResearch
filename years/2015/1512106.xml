<AbstractNarration>PI: Bruce Alphenaar&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1512106&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sun represents the most abundant potential source of sustainable energy on earth.  Solar cells made from thin films of nanometer sized crystals of titanium oxide are potentially much less expensive that crystalline silicon materials currently used in commercial solar cells, but suffer from low solar energy conversion efficiencies.  The goal of this project is to determine how the addition of rare earth materials into the titanium oxide layer can improve solar energy conversion efficiency.  The research plan will focus on neodymium oxide as model rare earth material.  The fundamental science gained in this research may also lead to the discovery of new quantum mechanical processes for enhancing current production from solar cells.  As part of this project, students at the University of Louisville will collaborate with a world-renowned solar energy research facility at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells containing titanium oxide nanocrystal thin films which act as the acceptor for photoexcited electrons offer low-cost fabrication relative to doped crystalline silicon materials, but solar energy conversion efficiencies are still below 20%.  The overall goal of the proposed research is to understand how the incorporation of rare earth oxides into the titanium oxide layer of perovskite and dye-sensitized photovoltaic materials can be optimally realized to increase solar energy conversion efficiency.  The incorporation rare earth oxides into the titanium oxide layer can potentially enhance short circuit current densities exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit by three possible mechanisms. First, the coupling of optical transitions between the rare earth and the sensitizer provides the opportunity for carrier multiplication effects.  Second, exchange interactions between the spin moment of the f-state electrons in the rare earth and the sensitizer causes mixing between the triplet and singlet excitons, leading to enhanced optical absorbance. Third, the low electron affinity and high dielectric constant of rare earth oxides enable efficient hole transport.  The research plan will elucidate the efficiency enhancement mechanisms through correlation of the optical and electronic properties with the composition and morphology of the rare-earth oxide doped films using electron and scanning probe microscopy, spatial photoelectrochemical measurements, scanning energy dispersive X-ray elemental mapping, and Raman chemical mapping.  This knowledge will then be used to develop, fabricate, and test rare-earth oxide / perovskite hybrid solar cells using neodymium oxide as the model rare earth oxide material.  At the most fundamental level, these studies could lead to the discovery of new mechanisms for photocurrent enhancement involving electro-optic and electron spin interactions which can potentially be applied to other types of photovoltaic materials.  The analytical and materials synthesis methods used in the research will be adapted for use in nanotechnology instructional modules at the undergraduate level.   Outreach and broadening participation activities will be coordinated through the Technology Fellows Program and the Conn Center for Renewable Energy Research at the University of Louisville.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we learned about the properties of materials used to make new types of solar cells, and how variations in the material properties could improve the solar cell performance.  First, we studied how rare earth materials improved the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells.  Dye sensitized solar cells use a kind of dye to absorb light, and use nanometer scale titanium oxide particles to collect the light-generated current.  We learned that the rare earth materials improve the electrical properties of the titanium oxide by filling up electrical defects that exist on the particle surface.   We determined that the performance of the solar cell could be improved substantially by adding enough rare earth material to fill the defects, but not so much that it blocked the current flow.    Next we studied solar cells made using hybrid perovskites, made from mixtures of methyl ammonia, lead iodide and chloride.  We saw that it was possible to switch the electrical resistance of the hybrid perovskite by applying a large voltage on the material.  This means that it is possible to use the hybrid perovskite as a memory storage device, called a memristor. We studied the mechanism causing the electrical switching and concluded that it was due to the movement of ions within the perovskite under high voltages.  The resistance of the device changes depending on the relative orientation of the ions in the material.  This same ion motion produces an electrical field inside of the material, that remains even after external bias is removed.  We developed a techniques to measure this field, and saw that its magnitude could be used to determine the quality of the hybrid perovskite material.  Solar cells made from material with high built in electric field produces solar cells with higher efficiency.    Finally, we studied how the performance of hybrid perovskite solar cells can be improved by soaking the solar cell with sunlight in the presence of a non-reactive gas, like argon.  We think that this improvement is due to the absorbance of the non-reactive gas by the perovskite material.        Last Modified: 01/30/2020       Submitted by: Bruce W Alphenaar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
