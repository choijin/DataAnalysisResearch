<AbstractNarration>1557851&lt;br/&gt;PI: Santore, Maria M. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide support for a technical conference entitled 2016 Colloidal, Macromolecular and Polyelectrolyte Solutions GRC/GRS: Non-equilibrium and Bio-Inspired Systems. The conference, which will be held February 6-12, 2016 in Ventura, California, will bring together up to 200 leading academic, industrial, and governmental researchers, postdoctoral students and graduate students to present their research in colloid and polymer science. The theme of the conference is non-equilibrium and bio-inspired systems, which is a field that is currently seeing rapid advances and significant translational potential for innovative products in the energy, food, construction, and healthcare sectors. The conference will be preceded by a Gordon Research Seminar, which is intended for doctoral and postdoctoral students in a variety of academic disciplines. The seminar will include presentations by leading scientists on early career development, poster sessions for student researchers, and informal opportunities for students to meet peers and established leaders in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference, which is held every other year, has a strong interdisciplinary tradition and will include researchers from physics, materials science, chemical and mechanical engineering, and chemistry.  The conference will feature presentations and discussions on colloidal, macromolecular, and polyelectrolyte solutions.  Topical sessions will include colloidal and nanoparticle assembly, interfacial deformations in colloidal and macromolecular interactions, nanoparticle-cell and virus-cell interactions, similarities and differences in nanoparticle and viral assembly, effects of external forces on colloidal assembly and new materials synthesis, glassy and constrained phases, and rheology in concentrated suspensions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF funds were used to support the 2016 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Seminar (GRS) on "Colloidal, Macromolecular, &amp; Polyelectrolyte Solutions: Non Equilibrium and Bio-Inspired Systems."  These meetings took place February 6-12, 2016 in Ventura, California.  Maria Santore (UMass Amherst) was the conference chair and Fred MacKintosh (Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam) was the Co-Chair. While covering diverse and current topics in the area of colloidal, macromolecular and polyelectrolyte solutions, the special focus of this GRC was Non-Equilibrium and Biomimetic Systems.  This common theme, chosen based on its current importance, was emphasized throughout the talks and posters, unifying the conference in an area of current importance and novelty.     The GRC was attended by 171 scientists representing broad diversity in terms of gender, nationality, sector, field of training, and experience. 9 out of 31 oral presenters and discussion leaders at the GRC (in addition to the conference chair) were women, unprecedented for this conference.  The GRS, focusing on Emergent Behavior in Complex Fluids, was attended by 53 students and post docs from around the globe (36% female), with 6 speakers, discussion leaders, and mentors from academia, industry, and national labs.  All GRS junior scientists stayed for the GRC.        NSF funds supported registration and travel expenses both the GRC and the GRS, and, in particular, these funds played a critical role in facilitating the GRS.  The previous conference in 2014 was the first GRS associated with this meeting and was supported in 2014 by the GRC organization.  The enthusiasm for a second GRS in 2016 prompted us to move forward, but without support from the GRC organization, NSF funds were critical.    In addition to the GRS, NSF moneys supported the GRC through the conference fees and travel expenses of presenters and attendees. More than in the past, this GRC targeted a international participation, from leadership (co-Chair MacKintosh from Amsterdam, and vice chair Poon from Edinburgh) to speakers and attendees from Asia, Europe, and Australia.  This substantial international contingent brought with it large travel costs.  NSF funding was instrumental in bringing these international leaders, especially through support of registration fees so that other resources could be direct to airfare.  As a result of the outstanding representation present for the week, this GRC-GRS were also supported by ACS publications (Langmuir, Macromolecules, and Biomacromolecules), WR Grace, Johnson and Johnson, PPG, and Proctor and Gamble, Carnegie Mellon, the University of Delaware, the University of Massachusetts, Vrije Univeriteit Amsterdam, and FOM (the Dutch Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter).        Intellectual Merit:  The 2016 unifying theme for the conference, Nonequilibrium and BioInspired Systems, was chosen based on its scientific importance, for instance as identified in the 2014 DOE Basic Energy Sciences Grand Challenges Report, and the 2013 NCBI report on Challenges in Bionics and Biomimicry.  The Conference on Colloidal, Macromolecular, and Polyelectrolyte Solutions presented a unique fundamental perspective with broadly important new concepts, applicable to, but not tied to any particular sector.  The conference content was unique and distinct from other seemingly related GRCs, for instance differing, via its interdisciplinarity (inclusion of chemists and engineers), from the Soft Matter Physics GRC, and differing from the Biomimicry GRC in its mechanistic focus rather than building forward exclusively from molecular parallels.  The topics in the 2016 GRC, drew mechanistic parallels between biological, biomimetic, synthetic, and polymer systems, as borne out in symposia on assembly, rheology, active gels and coacervates, and cooperative / living systems.   With the GRC active since 1984, the 2016 conference remained true to the original definition of the field at the same time demonstrating its current importance and new directions.     Broader Impacts:  The GRC and its associated GRS targeted diverse groups (gender, research sector, scientific seniority, nationality and country of employment).  The numbers of female leaders and presenters exceed that in past years.  The GRC format of  facilitated interactions outside the conference hall, and the organizers advocated, through the appointment of activity chairperson Matt Lynch (P&amp;G) for inclusive afternoon activity groups (hiking, whale watching, wine tasting) so that attendees chose not to working in their rooms.  The GRS was proactive in mentoring young scientists, with roundtables and breakout groups to promote interactions between established and new scientists, and the development of networks that would last beyond the conference.  The outcomes from the GRC and GRS included new collaborations and partnerships, new research strategies (for instance the agreement to develop a database of common bacteria among different programs internationally, so that they could be characterized and studied from different perspectives), and new connections for scientists seeking employment.
