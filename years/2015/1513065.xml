<AbstractNarration>This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by drawing explicit connections between the artistic practices in the studio and the practices of STEM professionals. It will also contribute to the field's understanding of how to develop interdisciplinary educational experiences that capitalize on naturally occurring opportunities for transfer of knowledge and skill across disciplines.  Artists for Humanity and Education Development Center, Inc. are collaborating to develop and study a model for using authentic art-making to promote high school students' interest in STEM learning and STEM careers. The project builds on a highly successful Artists for Humanity out-of-school-time art and design program for Boston youth, which uses an apprenticeship model to educate under-resourced youth through mentor-guided creation and sale of artworks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Youth at Artists for Humanity represent a racially and ethnically diverse, low-income demographic. Few teens entering AFH experience success in STEM learning, or express interest in STEM careers. Yet many engage in sophisticated art-making that calls on a variety of STEM-related practices, dispositions, and knowledge without recognizing the connection to their in-school STEM studies. STEAM Power will highlight the STEM thinking students do in the art studio, drawing explicit connections between the artistic practices in the studio and the practices of STEM professionals to help youth: develop a view of STEM that expands their school experiences, recognize their own STEM strengths, and increase their interest and confidence in pursuing further STEM study and careers. The goal of the project is to increase teen artists' interest in STEM and STEM careers by highlighting the STEM thinking they do in the studio and deepening their STEM learning within this relevant and motivating context. By looking to impact the STEM interests and potential career choices of youth whose artistic training places a premium on thinking creatively, working collaboratively, and communicating effectively,   a segment of the youth population is impacted that, while currently underrepresented in the workforce, has much energy and vision to offer STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A collaboration of Artists For Humanity (AFH) and the Education Development Center (EDC),&nbsp;<em>Authentic Artmaking as a Vehicle for Connecting to STEM Learning and Careers&nbsp;</em>aimed to highlight and document AFH's existing workforce development model that demonstrates to youth where art and design intersect with STEM knowledge and skills, such that they gain a greater sense of how STEM practices are relied on in a non-academic setting - in the real world - and the possibility for themselves as future STEM professionals.</p> <p>At AFH, teens are paid employees who work alongside professional artist/designer mentors to create fine art and design solutions for businesses. The challenge for this project was to find and, if possible, capitalize on STEM moments that naturally exist in the creative process without losing the primary focus on the client's scope of work as it relates to function and aesthetic. Several different kinds of connections were found and we believe that these connections can be used to guide other educators seeking to leverage the development of practices characteristic of STEM disciplines in the practice of art and design.</p> <p>The design process guides AFH's studio work, emphasizing an iterative cycle of discovery, concept development, testing, design/engineering, and revision. This cycle articulates a process of planning, creating, reflecting, and revising that is common to a wide variety of disciplines and endeavors - from experimental sciences to designing prosthesis, mathematical problem solving to software development, computer programming to creative writing. &nbsp;At AFH, the design process is seen as the clearest connection between the work of artists/designers and the work of STEM practitioners, with the exception of the 3D Design studio, where science and engineering play a prominent role.</p> <p>AFH mentors also leverage the design process to engage STEM professionals. This reinforces connections to STEM practices inherent in art and design, and likewise, the role of design in industries that involve STEM practices. Specialists add value to the conversation, provide vital feedback, and offer specialized STEM skills (both technical or process-oriented) that inspire and enable the team to surpass obstacles or validate assumptions. These encounters reinforce the alternative applications of design thinking, creative problem solving, and the STEM-based, and collaborative practice they are building throughout the process.</p> <p><em>Creating art and design products based on artistic interpretations of STEM content.&nbsp;</em>AFH teens are often commissioned to create artworks that draw on science-related themes. This task requires youth to create visual representations of scientific ideas that are complex and challenging. As part of the initial research and ideation process, teens learn about the client's work and often visit the client to learn from employees about their jobs and the STEM ideas and skills that lie behind their work. Teens draw on this learning as they complete their final work.</p> <p><em>Thinking about scale, proportion, and perspective.&nbsp;</em>Teens across all studios confront challenges related to scale, proportion, and perspective. They must consider how small-scale studies and models may read differently, visually and emotionally, when they are re-created in the actual dimensions of the final work. In mural painting, public art sculptures, and large format photographs, teens grapple with both technical and aesthetic challenges involved in moving from smaller prototypes to the final product. In the Graphic Design studio, teens meet challenges involved in changing scale in either direction - from design studies that begin with sketches quite a bit smaller than the final product to the opposite, where sketches may be substantially larger in scale than the final product.</p> <p><em>Attention to environmental sustainability.&nbsp;</em> AFH's commitment to sustainability is reflected in the 2004 design and construction of the AFH EpiCenter, Boston's first Platinum LEED certified facility that houses AFH operations, and communicated regularly to teens. &nbsp;A number of projects, particularly in the 3D Design studio, address issues of environmental sustainability through both thematic choices and, wherever possible, using recycled materials.</p> <p><em>Similarities/overlaps in disciplinary practices.&nbsp;</em>Other connections to be drawn between artistic and STEM endeavors lie more in the realm of similar practices, dispositions, or "habits of mind."&nbsp;While the specifics differ across disciplines, there are important overlaps among studio art habits of mind and STEM practices and dispositions, such as making sense of problems or attending to precision. The emphasis on <em>21st century skills</em> highlights the importance of enacting such practices in the service of problem solving, and in the context of effective collaboration and communication among teams.</p> <p>The authentic nature of complex, commissioned work at AFH (in comparison to the often contrived and personally disconnected contexts in which teens are asked to learn in school) provides teens with the unique opportunity to cultivate fluent, creative thinking and develop skills, autonomy and responsibility needed to work both individually and collectively - skills that are also central to the work of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians and essential for advancing human development and sustaining our planet.</p> <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p> <div> <div> <div> <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> </div><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Susan&nbsp;Rodgerson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513065/1513065_10387561_1559256049530_AFH_3DDesignStudio_ExhibitionNathanCummings--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513065/1513065_10387561_1559256049530_AFH_3DDesignStudio_ExhibitionNathanCummings--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Electric Jellyfish"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513065/1513065_10387561_1559256049530_AFH_3DDesignStudio_ExhibitionNathanCummings--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Electric Jellyfish"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Created by teen employees at Artists For Humanity, this Electric Jellyfish sculpture shines at the AFH exhibition "Resisting the Tide: Embracing the Future" in New York City.
