<AbstractNarration>Retention of engineering undergraduates, in particular during the sophomore and junior years, is a major national concern. Active learning classroom techniques, Blended online and in-class materials, and Collaborative learning environments have each shown some promise of improving engineering student outcomes. However, these promising tools are seldom deployed together and rarely utilized in core disciplinary classes. This research program will rigorously study the Purdue Mechanics Freeform Classroom (Freeform), an Active-Blended-Collaborative (ABC) structure that has experienced anecdotal success for the last six years. The research team will collect data from multiple sources to understand the student and instructor experience, the importance of disciplinary content and institutional setting, and the juxtaposition of Freeform with students' and instructors' other courses. The project will explore Freeform at Purdue West Lafayette and two other diverse campuses: Purdue University Calumet and Trine University, which serve underrepresented populations that are disproportionately affected by stopout. This study will generate useful outcomes for other interested program adopters, including online course templates and video creation strategies, student study guides, and faculty orientation workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empirical studies indicate that Active, Blended, and Collaborative learning structures (ABC) each enhance achievement and retention in undergraduate STEM. To date, these tools have not been combined, nor have they been widely deployed in disciplinary core classes in the middle two years that are major sources of underperformance. This research program will study Purdue's Mechanics Freeform Classroom (Freeform), a pedagogical framework that fully merges ABC tools in sophomore year Dynamics and has experienced success in improving pass rates. The project's goals are to better understand (a) the student experience in using ABC tools and classroom structures, (b) mediating individual characteristics of the faculty, discipline, and institution, and (c) the way Freeform operates in the context of students' and instructors' other courses. Using an iterative process of research and implementation, the project team is testing Freeform in its most mature implementation (Dynamics), as well as in other mechanical engineering courses at Purdue and at partner institutions: Trine University and Purdue University- Calumet. The team will collect a rich array of qualitative and quantitative data from both faculty and students, including attitudinal, cognitive, and behavioral metrics. This will provide valuable and novel insight into how to implement ABC environments in diverse disciplines and institutions over a sustained time period.</AbstractNarration>

We investigated what we have termed an ?ABC? (Active, Blended, and Collaborative) novel learning environment for core engineering sciences classes, developed and studied in most detail in Mechanical Engineering Dynamics. Freeform merges active learning in class (Active) with a massive video library of learning materials (Blended) and a course blog for asynchronous communication (Collaborative).&nbsp; The Freeform concept rests solidly on the scholarship of teaching and learning, but its practice has inspired important new research questions that we addressed. Our project?s five-year agenda had three important facets, each a novel and unique contribution to the field: (i) to critically assess student learning and engagement with ABC learning tools (separately and in combination) within an integrated learning environment, (ii) to document and evaluate how characteristics of the instructor and institution change the effects of (i), and (iii) to observe and examine the intervention within the context of the student?s and the faculty?s other classes.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Over our five years of work, we made a number of findings that contribute to academic scholarship and to broader impacts. We created and validated baseline and end-of-semester instruments, demonstrating an efficient, scalable, reliable, standardized way to track students? conceptual knowledge gains and the effectiveness of the environment as well as to report on students? initial preparedness and final performance via easy-to-digest reports for instructors. We collected extensive video data on instructors? in-class behaviors and students? use of resources, interview data on instructor and student experiences, quantitative student attitudinal data and blog usage, self-reports of resource usage, and institutional information. Using this, we built a robust, large-scale, individual-level dataset.&nbsp; We used this dataset to demonstrate that the Freeform environment related to a gradual improvement in student performance, and students fell into a number of ?categories? of user types, though their differing usage patterns did not predict differences in performance. We found that instructors varied in their types of activities, but the Freeform environment afforded a scaffolded set of constraints that meant there was little variance in performance between instructors. We found that students had a typical ?worflow? they followed for studying and that there were important differences between students by race/ethnicity and domestic status. We find moderate relationships between students? studying behaviors and their performance in the course as well as by how institutions and instructors implement the full environment.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>We disseminated this work through over 20 conference presentations, 7 peer-reviewed journal publications, and 10 invited keynotes or seminars. We have graduated 3 PhD students from this team, fostered the learning and professional development of 5 engineering education doctoral students, 2 educational psychology doctoral students, 2 industrial engineering masters students, 1 mechanical engineering doctoral student, and 9 undergraduates students.
