<AbstractNarration>The contemporary landscape of information technology production is one that has been profoundly influenced by the emergence of so-called "maker culture" in the 1960s and 1970s.  From Mac OS X to Android, from TiVo DVRs to Linksys network appliances, from Amazon.com to Google Chrome, the technology landscape is full of products that depend upon open source and similar alternative models of production.  Society currently finds itself in the middle of a new maker movement that both harkens back to the earlier model and also departs from it in significant ways.  It is rooted in a growing network of "makerspaces" that expands ideas and practices of the Web generation into hardware and manufacturing.  Makerspaces are cooperative studios where people develop new approaches to technology design based on the open sharing of software code and hardware designs through the use of technology such as computer controlled laser cutters, 3-D printers, and microcontroller kits.  Makerspaces are places where new models of innovation are explored, where values of openness and participation are re-assessed, and where new relationships between people and technology are forged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand these phenomena, this project will conduct ethnographic research at four makerspaces, studying them from a socio-technical perspective.  The goal of the project is to understand the relationship between cultural and material practices in the maker movement.  Accordingly, the focus is on the daily practices in makerspaces, with particular attention to how they experiment with models of social organization, distributed collaboration, and peer production.  Specific research sites have been chosen to highlight key questions.  Two are located in the United States, in centers of information technology (IT) innovation and production (New York and San Francisco); two are located in China, at key sites for the development of new models of commercial development (in Shenzhen, a major Chinese production hub, and in Shanghai, a center for the Chinese creative and IT industry).  Through ethnographic investigation, the project will examine the questions of how DIY (Do-It-Yourself) making as a practice, and makerspaces as physical sites, contribute to the development of new models of technical, economic, and social innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within a broad cultural and sociopolitical context, this research will study peer production, DIY and open source making, models of innovation in action, and the material production of IT work.  This exploration will help us to understand non-professional expertise and alternative forms of technical knowledge, distributed collaboration, and inter-cultural exchange of ideas and artifacts.  This study complements previously published investigations of peer production by focusing on the effect of physical sites on social organization and open source production.  The project provides a concrete, ethnographic foundation for emerging questions of materiality in human-computer interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  As sites of DIY production, makerspaces provide an important interface between technological production and the everyday world.  At the same time, they may also represent important sites for rethinking contemporary processes of technological and commercial innovation.  This research will help to assess and understand these possibilities, support educational developments in this area (such as makerspace infrastructures within schools), explore alternative forms of small-scale commercial production, incentivize participation, and develop intellectual property.  To the extent that makerspaces embody a set of broader cultural values about relationships between people, technologies, and the innovation cycle, this project will provide empirical and conceptual material to support social processes around these questions.  As a large-scale public practice, DIY production provides an important forum for connecting academic-based and citizen-based models of knowledge production, and the opportunity for outreach into communities in which scientific and technical work is part of their identity.</AbstractNarration>

Our research evidences that making has become such a force of sociotechnical change. Maker advocates have advanced the idea that if people transform themselves from consumers into producers of technologies and machines, they can address complex societal and economic challenges. Makerspaces have helped cultivate this mindset of "prototyping alternatives," i.e. the idea that people can take an active role in shaping their individual and collective futures. This idea has brought together diverse stakeholders from grassroots tinkerers to factory owners, government officials, and policy makers.

This includes sociotechnical experimentation not only in grassroots makerspaces, but also at universities and in major corporations. Makers apply methods such as user engagement and participation, the sharing economy, social entrepreneurship, open source, design thinking and so on to build things at scale (Lindtner et al. 2014). For instance, partnerships between American and Chinese maker advocates has led to interventions in established industrial production networks, supply chains, and economies of scale (e.g. Lindtner 2017). These experiments confront researchers and designers of cyber-human systems with the broader uptakes of some of their core ideals and methods for purposes of commodification and economization (Lindtner et al. 2014, Lindtner and Avle 2017).</p> <p><strong>Contested Innovation:</strong> Our research shows that while the ideals of the maker movement have found global appeal, there are regional, historical, political and societal specificities (e.g. Sun et al. 2015, Lin and Lindtner 2016, Avle, Lindtner and Williams 2017). What counts as innovative is often defined based on Western histories and practices of computing (Avle and Lindtner 2016). Our research contributes by demonstrating how such widespread understandings of what counts as good design are increasingly contested. As Western design models from ?design thinking? to start-up incubators and lean management have spread across the globe as seemingly universal templates for economic development, they are morphed into a variety of idiosyncratic approaches (Avle and Lindtner 2016; Avle, Lindtner and Williams 2017).</p> <p><strong>Tinkering with Data &amp; Self Care:</strong> Making has intersected with data science and health care (Kaziunas et al. 2017, Kaziunas et al. 2017b).

Our research was as such rooted in a nation-wide project on advancing making. Likewise, in 2015, Lindtner got invited to participate in two policy conversations, hosted by the Shenzhen and Shanghai city governments respectively. Taken together, these engagements allowed us to directly inform policy makers and to incorporate key findings of this research in specific policy recommendations. We have hosted several panels and debates in the US, and have organized an interdisciplinary and outward facing workshop on how making intersects with shifts in our economy. Through these efforts, we have developed a publicly engaged research program that moves beyond critique and towards what we call anticipatory design. In our research we found that there are two dominant approaches towards making: on the one hand, making has been endorsed for its innovation and democratization capacity and on the other hand, critiqued for its underlying technosolutionism, i.e. the idea that technology provides solutions to complex social problems (Lindtner, Bardzell and Bardzell 2016, 2018). We developed "anticipatory design," i.e. a reflexive-interventionist approach that simultaneously takes seriously the critiques of making's claims as technosolutionist while also embracing its utopian project as worth reconstituting in broader sociopolitical terms.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/02/2018<br>      Modified by: Silvia&nbsp;Lindtner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
