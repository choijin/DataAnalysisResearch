<AbstractNarration>Divergent thinking, which is related to ideation, continues to be a not fully  understood and yet a very important part of the design process.  Using cognitive neuroscience experiments to study divergent thinking for various idea generation methods and design tasks, and studying the effectiveness by comprehensive evaluation design outcomes, we can better understand the idea generation process.  Cognitive neuroscience uses different techniques to study the brain in action, and each technique has specific characteristics that make a technique optimal for a given research question.  Hemodynamic neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) in comparison to electromagnetic techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) are difficult to utilize for providing direct measurements of brain activation patterns related to creative cognition and divergent thinking.  Research on utilizing these important techniques to scientifically investigate idea generation process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposes to use a cognitive neuroscience model that utilizes EEG measurement techniques in combination with engineering ideation performance analysis to assess student divergent thinking and creative processes.  This multidisciplinary research is being explored by a team that has combined expertise in the fields of engineering, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology. The intellectual merit is that it focused on using cognitive neuroscience to develop a systematic way to measure effects of different techniques on divergent thinking to develop effective creativity curriculum for engineering. The study uses assessments based upon changes in spectral power of the in different EEG frequency bands and the analysis of Event-Related BRAIN Potentials to track changes in brain activation patterns associated to assess divergent thinking The broader impacts is insight into the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying divergent thinking related to experimental design and innovation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) Program.  The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM Education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Researchers use two broad cognitive functions, convergent and divergent thinking, to explain creative thinking activities. Divergent thinking is generally associated with ideation, and refers to the process of generating diverse and original ideas with fluency and speed. Our main goal is to understand the divergent thinking mechanism to effectively develop competencies to solve open-ended problems.  Intellectual Merit:  Engineering studentsâ€™ responses to novel metaphorical and anomalous sentences were more accurate than those of non-engineering students. However, response accuracy to literal sentences was not different for the two groups. Also, overall responses to novel metaphorical sentences referring to engineering knowledge were less accurate than those referring to general knowledge. Taken together, it might be inferred that the level of engineering knowledge in a person might impact their perceptions of novelty in designs they encounter, and may potentially require teams with diverse backgrounds more time to talk through the differences in their perceptions of designs.  Analysis of electrophysiological responses indicate that the Sketching creativity training, but not the TRIZ creativity training, facilitated the comprehension of metaphorical sentences, indexing creative language use, in undergraduate students majoring in engineering.  Even though the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and the Utopian Situations Task (UST) are used extensively in ideation research, a comprehensive description of the quantification process combining neural data and behavioral assessments of creative potential (fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration) had not yet been applied in an engineering context, testing the neural and behavioral correlates of creative thinking in engineering students. The present project provides a first empirical basis for this quantification. It was found that participants generated slightly more ideas to general knowledge rather than engineering knowledge. Further, engineering undergraduate students generated more creative ideas in the Alternate Uses Task than in the Utopion Situations Task, but the idea fluency or originality of their ideas was not markedly different for domain-specific (engineering) or domain-general (world knowledge) ideation items.  During Engineering design tasks of mapping function to objects showed electrophysiological responses for the creative and nonsense conditions.  Broader Impact:  In collaborative engineering design settings, team members should be provided a safe environment to clarify misunderstandings relevant to designs presented by others. When metaphors are used in descriptions of novel designs, multiple ways to describe the function and form, and their impacts should offered.  The use of sketching during the design ideation process for engineering students should be encouraged. Because computer aided design has been the dominant way of communicating form ideas, sketching has been less emphasized in recent years. We recommend dedicating a class lecture to benefits of sketching in support of design ideation and design communication.  It is important to build self-efficacy in design ideation in support of ideation performance. We recommend including warm-up exercises before a graded project related design ideation. We also recommend using AUT during this warm-up time, and for a common object (e.g., brick, hanger). As needed and if time allows, AUT for an engineering object, and UST task can also be added.  For engineering design projects for which an increased level of novelty is desired, designers should be provided tools to reduce their mental load.
