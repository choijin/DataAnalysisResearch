<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on learning expectations of market participants about probability distributions of future asset returns from the current prices of options on those assets combined with assumptions and historical data about the underlying risk-return trade-offs in the economy. Risk assessments are based on historical data.  The limitation of the historical approach is in potentially underestimating the probability of events that did not occur in the historical data under consideration.  The goal of this research is to improve probability models of markets by developing theory and methods for calibrating them to additional sources of information in addition to historical data.  This will help put risk management and investment decision making on a more solid foundation and will aid the financial services industry and market regulators in extracting implied probability distributions from market prices of options to improve risk management. The project is interdisciplinary, drawing on the fields of operations research, economics, probability theory and mathematical analysis and will have a positive impact on education and human resources development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodology is based on far-reaching extensions of the recent Recovery Theorem of Ross that shows that when all uncertainty (risk) in the economy is modeled as a discrete-time irreducible finite-state Markov chain and the stochastic discount factor is transition independent, then there exists a unique recovery of the Markov chain's transition probability matrix from options prices. We aim to extend the recovery methodology to general classes of continuous-time Markov processes, including diffusions and jump-diffusions. On the other hand, we aim to relax the transition independence assumption by building on the fundamental work of Hansen and Scheinkman on long term risk.   Our approach aims to combine structural assumptions on the stochastic discount factor drawn from the macro-finance literature with the joint calibration of the resulting models to currently observed market options prices together with historical time series data on the underlying asset returns. This will involve analytical development of the spectral theory for Markov processes and computational implementations of recoveries in specific classes of models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on theoretical and empirical issues related to stochastic modeling in financial markets, in particular recovering market participants? expectations about future probability distributions of financial variables, such as future interest rates and stock prices. Economic theory says that by observing current market prices today it is impossible to disentangle markets expectations about the probability distribution of future evolution of prices and rates from market participants? risk preferences. The probability distribution we can recover from today?s prices alone is the so-called risk-neutral distribution, not the physical probability distribution. Recent research (Ross Recovery Theorem) posited that under some assumptions it may be possible to recover the physical distribution. The projects goals were to clarify these assumptions, establish their economic consequences and empirical limitations, show how a comprehensive approach needs to combine historical data with the current data in order to estimate both risk preferences and physical probabilities separately and implement the models on empirical data.  The following are the main scientific contributions of the project.  1. The recent Recovery Theorem of Ross states that if the underlying uncertainty in the economy is modeled by an irreducible finite state and discrete time Markov chain, under the assumption that the stochastic discount factor (SDF; a fundamental object in financial economics that both discounts for the time value of money and for risk) is transition independent, it is possible to recover the physical distribution of the Markov chain directly from observed current market prices of derivative securities (such as options) without relying on historical data to estimate the model, by appealing to the Perron-Frobenius Theorem to recover the unique positive eigen-vector.

The long bond volatility and the volatility of the martingale component are explicitly identified in terms of this fixed point (Qin and Linetsky, Mathematics and Financial Economics, 2017).  2. Our second major theoretical result is the extension of the Hansen-Scheinkman factorization originally formulated for Markovian models to semimartingale models, without assuming the Markov property and alternatively relying on the martingale theory. In particular, we extend the long-term factorization of the SDF to general semimartingale models.

Our empirical contribution is to demonstrate on the study of the U.S. Treasury bond market that the long bond is far from growth optimality based on empirical data and that the martingale component in the long-term factorization of the SDF is highly volatile and economically significant, governing the maturity structure of the risk-return trade-off in the economy. We do this by jointly estimating the physical distribution and the risk-neutral distribution for the dynamics of interest rates on the historical time series of U.S. Treasury yields (Qin, Nie and Linetsky, Review of Financial Studies, 2018).  These theoretical and empirical insights contribute to our understanding of the risk-return trade-off in the economy, potentially contributing to improved risk control and financial stability.  This project contributed to the development of human resources by providing research training to Ph.D. students at Northwestern.
