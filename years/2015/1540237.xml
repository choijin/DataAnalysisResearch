<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program supports a travel award for three graduate students at US universities to participate in the 14th International Congress on Combustion By-Products and their Health Effects held June 14-17, 2015 in Umea, Sweden.  The International Congress has met every two years since 1990, the Congress usually attracts between 100 and 200 delegates from all over the world. The students are selected by the Standing Organizing Committee for the conference based on need and the quality of abstracts submitted for presentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental research is interdisciplinary and this meeting brings together scientists, engineers, and health care researchers to discuss the environmental issues surrounding combustion. This meeting brings academic, government, and industrial representatives together to present research findings, update international policy, and discuss critical issues concerning emissions of toxic by-products from the combustion processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Louisiana State University proposes to provide continuation of the Management of the International Congress on Combustion By-Products and Their Health Effects through management of the 14th Congress in Umea, Sweden on June 14th-June17th, 2015.  Emissions from combustion and thermal processes have always been an important issue of the remediation of Superfund sites and the SRP.  The use of on-site, controlled high-temperature incineration as a remediation technology has been reduced by EPA in recent years due to intense public scrutiny. However, it has frequently been replaced by low temperature thermal desorption/treatment and off-site incineration of the volatilized materials. All of these processes lead to emission of toxic air pollutants, in come cases greater than for on-site incineration.  In addition there is the risk of accidental fires and transportation fires than can significantly impact the local environment.  Furthermore, many Superfund sites contain wastes that were partially burned before or during disposal.  Consequently, the hazardous materials at the site are combustion-derived pollutants that deserve specialized study not normally afforded to the originally abandoned material.  The goal of this congress is to provide an international forum to discuss topics on the origins, fate, and health effects of combustion by-products.  The Congress proposes a forum for advanced learning through emphasis on internationally-known invited speakers, advances scientific and engineering research presentations and an extensive poster session. This focus provides an extensive learning experience and knowledge exchange for all participants, but primarily for students, as special emphasis is placed on attracting abstracts and encouraging participation from graduate students.  Other forums related to air pollution and combustion processes do not provide the specialty venue combustion-derived air toxic pollutants from which student researchers can present and share their research while learning from other students as well as leading researchers in their field.  The delegates included 4 graduate students at U.S. universities.   The U.S. students each received stipends totaling $10,000.  Listed below are the names and affiliations of each student.
