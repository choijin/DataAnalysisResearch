<AbstractNarration>Friction of rubbery materials against a stiff surface is of great practical importance in many applications. For example, it determines the performance and efficiency of tires, windshield wipers, and seals.  Much of the previous work on control of their friction mechanisms has either varied surface chemistry or altered properties of the rubber itself.  Recent research on biological attachment devices has shown how adhesion of rubbers can also be strongly enhanced by design of their near-surface architecture, but usually their sliding friction is reduced rather than increased. The principal goals of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)project are to investigate surface architectures for enhancement of sliding and static friction against rough and smooth surfaces.  The target application is improving friction of tires, and the planned research requires work on design &amp; theory, fabrication, and testing under realistic constraints and conditions.  For this reason, the project is a collaboration between two university labs (at Cornell and Lehigh) and an industrial researcher at Michelin North America.  The Lehigh group is responsible for fabrication and experiments, the Cornell group for theory and modeling, and Michelin for testing under realistic conditions and constraints.  The project will train graduate students in use-inspired and industry-relevant collaborative research and will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students.  The results of this research will be incorporated in an ongoing collaboration with the Da Vinci Science Center in Allentown, PA, for informal science education.  A new exhibit will be designed for the general public on bio-inspired design of surfaces to bring out the immediacy and impact of national investments in research and education.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Preliminary work has shown that certain surface architectures, for an appropriately designed set of materials and geometrical parameters, exhibit significant enhancement of sliding friction and maintain static friction enhancement against rough surfaces. For example, a film-terminated ridge-valley design (an anisotropic structure with direction-dependent frictional properties) can strongly enhance sliding friction in a direction orthogonal to the ridges by complex internal deformation mechanisms that dissipate energy.  For certain combinations of parameters, sliding friction along the ridges can also be enhanced.  Such film-terminated fibrillar structures also results in strong enhancement of static friction that is substantially retained even against rough surfaces.  These bio-inspired surface architectures have the potential to be transformative by providing dissipation mechanisms at the micron scale that can be optimized by quantitative design of the architecture.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Controlling friction between a soft material in contact with a hard surface is of fundamental interest in a variety of phenomena and applications. Examples of soft materials range from biological tissue, bioinspired materials, to industrially important materials such as rubber for tires.  Conventionally, friction is viewed as a result of interfacial intermolecular interactions and energy loss at the molecular scale, coupled to bulk deformation energy losses, for example by viscoelasticity.  Recent work has shown how appropriately designed structures at a meso-scale intermediate between the molecular and continuum scales can be used to strongly modulate friction and adhesion.  Some of these mechanisms are meso-scale versions of molecular level phenomena that underlie the fundamental question of how friction arises between surfaces.   As an example, the traditional approach to improving tire grip has been to increase viscoelastic dissipation. However, this approach also increases rolling resistance, leading to higher fuel consumption as well as elevating the the tire temperature. This places a limit on how much viscoelasticity rubber can have.   An outcome of our project is to solve this problem by imitating the behavior at the molecular scale, where friction arises because much of the energy that goes into stretching molecules is lost as heat when they slip back to an unstretched state. We have shown that, when the material has proper periodic variation in elastic modulus, an indenter sliding on the surface experiences additional friction. These mechanical instabilities work similarly to molecules which stretch and relax during adhesive friction, dissipating energy.  This discovery has been submitted as a patent.    We also made two new important scientific discoveries:  First, we found that the interface between soft elastic surfaces patterned on either side with a periodic array of surface features accommodates misorientation and lattice parameter mismatch by spontaneous generation of an array of meso-scale interfacial dislocations.  Friction between such surfaces can be controlled through design of the structure and relative misorientation.  The friction mechanism is meso-scale dislocation glide on the interfacial plane that is broadly analogous to motion of atomic-scale dislocation defects. This finding offers a novel way of controlling friction and adhesion of soft material interfaces.  Second, we recently discovered that, with proper patterning of a surface with different elastic compliances, an indenter sliding on this surface will experience considerable friction even though the surface is highly lubricated.  This enhancement of friction is due to elastic hysteresis where energy is loss by mechanical stability when the indenter (e.g. tire) moves from a soft(hard) to a hard(soft) surface.    The result of our work have impact on applications ranging from soft biomaterials to soft robotics to tires.  While our focus will be on the fundamental research questions, the investigation will be carried out in close collaboration with Michelin with potential future application to tires in mind.
