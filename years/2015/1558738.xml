<AbstractNarration>Manganese (Mn) is an important trace nutrient for biological growth in marine organisms.  In the past, all Mn dissolved in seawater was thought to exist in only one chemical form: Mn(II).  Recent work in waters and sediments with little or no oxygen has shown that Mn(III) can be the dominant form of dissolved Mn and can even be present in oxygenated water if attached to specific organic molecules called ligands. This research will further investigate these discoveries, aiming to quantify the chemical and microbiological processes responsible for Mn(III) cycling under varying oxygen concentrations. The research will compare field sites in the Broadkill River wetland, the Chesapeake Bay, and the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary; measuring the water column and sediments known to have strong oxygen gradients and different organic carbon sources that could change the availability and binding strength of ligands that would stabilize dissolved Mn(III). In some chemical forms, Mn tends to act like iron, so this research may have broader implications by helping marine chemists to understand more about iron cycling in similar oxygen gradients. With growing concerns over diminished oxygen concentrations (hypoxia) in the ocean, and particularly in coastal regions, understanding the reactions of Mn(III) with organic ligands across oxygen gradients could become important for understanding Mn availability to organisms. The project includes support for the participation and mentoring of one graduate student and two postdoctoral researchers, and there will be a U.S.-Canada collaboration. A variety of public outreach activities are planned with a K-12 teacher to be selected as a participant on a research cruise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mn(III) has only recently been recognized as an important redox state for Mn in seawater. Previously, it was widely accepted that all Mn that passes through a 0.2 or 0.4 Âµm filter is dissolved Mn(II) while the retained portion is solid Mn(III, IV) oxide.  Research in the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Chesapeake Bay has shown that soluble Mn(III) can be up to 100% of the dissolved Mn in the water column.  Also, Mn(III) can exist as complexes with organic ligands in oxygenated seawater. This project will quantify and constrain the mechanisms surrounding weak and strong Mn(III) ligand transformations across vertical and horizontal oxygen gradients.  Field sites to be studied include systems with a variety of organic carbon sources and oxygen dynamics: the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary, Chesapeake Bay, and Broadkill River wetland estuary. This research will continue to inform the fundamental shift that is taking place in our current understanding of Mn biogeochemistry in coastal systems.  The results should also be applicable to redox processes involving Fe(III) ligand transformations, since Mn and Fe tend to exhibit similar redox chemistry under similar environmental conditions.</AbstractNarration>

Previous research into the geochemical cycling of manganese in aquatic systems focused predominately on the cycling between soluble Mn (primarily as Mn in the +II oxidation state), and solid Mn (Mn oxides primarily in the +IV oxidation states) and not on the intermediate +III oxidation state.  Recently, we determined that Mn(III) can be complexed by natural organic substances, which keep Mn(III) in a soluble form (termed a Mn(III) complex).  Soluble Mn(III) is important because it can be transported by tides and ocean currents and can serve as both an oxidant, whereby it accepts an electron from another substance becoming soluble Mn(II), or a reductant, whereby it reduces other chemicals and becomes a solid [Mn(IV)]. Through these processes, Mn cycling can significantly influence the chemistry of the surrounding environment. Mn(III) complexes can accumulate and be abundant in natural waters; these complexes have been largely overlooked as a form of Mn in aquatic systems.   Our research provides new insights into the distribution and behavior of soluble Mn(III) in estuarine and marine systems. We developed techniques to measure Mn(III) complexes and solid Mn oxides at sub-nanomolar levels. We showed that Mn(III) is ubiquitous, and sometimes the most abundant soluble form of Mn. It is found to occur as both weak and strong complexes, which are less or more stable, respectively.  Both classes of Mn(III) complexes can be found in the same waters.  Soluble Mn(III) can be particularly abundant in waters containing humic materials, which complex the Mn(III).  In low oxygen and anoxic systems Mn(III) complexes can be relatively stable, but at the interface between anoxic and oxic conditions, the Mn cycle between Mn(II), Mn(III), and Mn(IV) is very dynamic and Mn(III) complexes can form both during oxidative and reductive pathways with the latter being the more important one.  These Mn(III) complexes can then serve as electron donors (reductants) or electron acceptors (oxidants).   We measured the different forms of Mn in the water columns of the Chesapeake Bay, Saint Lawrence Estuary (SLE), Broadkill River Estuary DE (BRE), Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  In all systems, Mn(III) complexes make up substantial amounts of the total dissolved Mn. For example, in the oxygenated waters of the SLE and BRE, Mn(III) complexes are as high as 86% and 100% of the total dissolved Mn, respectively, and are a source of Mn(III) to the ocean.
