<AbstractNarration>How stars are born and how they die represent the most fundamental kinds of questions we can ask about the Universe.  For many years astronomers believed a star like our own sun would end its life by shedding it outer layers in a series of powerful winds leading to the formation of what is called a 'planetary nebula', a brightly glowing gas cloud that can span a light year or more.  In this study the investigators explore how planetary nebula can form when stars are born with a sibling.  More than half the stars in the sky live their entire life with a companion and that proximity can change the course of evolution for both stars.  They seek to understand how two stars with about the same mass as the sun can interact at the end of their lives exchanging mass and driving winds that will create a planetary nebula.  It may be that only binary stars form such nebula and our ideas of the Sun's eventual demise must be revised. Using powerful supercomputer simulations they will track the gas flows from the two orbiting stars and determine how these mass exchanges can alter the fate of the stars.  These kinds of supercomputer algorithms are also used for other purposes, such as the high performance computer industry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is focused on understanding magnetized outflows in evolved binary stars through specific new studies of Planetary Nebulae (PNe). As the final stage of mass loss for these stars, PNe represent a critical step in the mass and chemical evolution cycle for more than half the material ejected into the ISM.  The ubiquity of PNe and their ease of observation also make them premier laboratories for testing new astrophysical theories. They will explore the dynamics of binary star mass transfer and mass loss through collimated outflows.  The research will explicate routes through which accretion disks can form in evolved binary systems and attempt to provide limits on the accretion rates onto and through those disks.  Using the conditions in the disks they will then study the formation and propagation of magnetic tower collimated outflows.  These Poynting-Flux Dominated flows are of fundamental interest because they represent a different category of MHD outflow from the kinetic energy dominated flows that have received greater study. The binary evolution (Common Envelope), mass transfer and magnetic outflow processes they study are of fundamental importance to the study of many astrophysical systems from Type Ia SNe to Microquasars. In addition their work developing the AstroBEAR AMR code is of particular benefit computational astrophysicists &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Beyond the direct scientific research benefits of their study and the dissemination of the AstroBEAR software, the PI is a co-founder of National Pubic Radio's 13.7 Cosmos and Culture Blog, a regular on-air science commentator for NPR's All Things Considered and regular contributor to the New York Times.  In this project they will develop a series of on-air programs for radio that will track the progress of a student and the post-doc as they carry out the research project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many stars are born with siblings and live their entire lives in close proximity to these companions.  Interacting binary stars - where two stars orbit each other closely enough that they effect each other’s evolution - represent the fate for a significant fraction of the Suns in the galaxy.  Our study attempted to shed new light one of the most important events in the life of interacting binary stars.  Common Envelope Evolution occurs when one of the stars, nearing its death, has swelled into Red Giant with a radius that could be as large as Earth's orbit.  A companion orbiting this giant gets engulphed and plunges deep into the older stars’ inner layers.  The outcome of Common Envelope evolution is an expected to be a massive disruption of the Giant star as the companion dumps so much energy into its outer layers that they are blown into space.  In the process, the companion spirals inward until it is either ripped apart or ends up in a tight orbit where it swings around the remaining core of the giant every few hours.  While these are the expectations that come from relatively simple theoretical studies, more detailed work using supercomputer simulations have shown that common envelope evolution can be much more complicated than expected.  In particular the envelopes do not get driven away from the Giant star core as easily as was expected.  In our work we developed and used advanced state of the art supercomputer codes to study Common Envelope evolution at high resolution (like taking a picture with a very high pixel camera).  Our results showed us that, among other things,  material falling onto the companion as it spirals inward through the Giant star envelope, may play an important role in Common Envelope process.  Our models showed a lot of "accretion" onto the companion and this gas would likely end up being driven outward in the form of two oppositely oriented jets.  The jets could be powerful mechanisms for pushing envelope material into space.  Our study of accretion in Common Envelope provided new insights into what exactly happens within the turbulent outer layers of the giant as it's disrupted by the violence of the merger between the two stars.  Understanding anything about Common Envelope means tracking where the energy in the two stars orbit's goes.  That's why we also we did a careful and through study of energy transformations across the entire Common Envelope process.  This work was helpful to the community of researchers because we worked hard to separate out all the ways energy flows between the two stars.  Our final paper revealed new details about how the binary orbit decays in Common Envelope  evolution and how the giant star’s envelope responds.  To disseminate our results to the wider public we wrote a number of popular articles about our research which were published at the online science web magazine Orbiter.
