<AbstractNarration>Although Earth orbits a single star, most stars in our Galaxy are located in binary or multiple systems - groups of two or more stars that are gravitationally bound to each other.  The time it takes the two stars in a binary to complete one full orbit around each other can be anywhere from hours to days, weeks, month, years, or millennia.  The stars in the closest pairs with orbits that take months or less, comprise a special category called "spectroscopic binaries".  They move so rapidly that it is possible to measure the velocities of each star, and from the velocities we can determine the ratio of their masses.  Among very young, newly formed stars, these spectroscopic binaries provide a way to measure the most fundamental stellar property, mass, during a poorly understood period in the life-cycle of stars.  This can help us calibrate the relationships between fundamental stellar properties at a key epoch: the onset of planet formation.  In&lt;br/&gt;this program, the PI will observe a sample of 140 candidate young spectroscopic binaries to confirm their&lt;br/&gt;multiplicity and to measure the mass ratios of the bona fide pairs. This research will be carried out by the PI in collaboration with undergraduate and junior graduate students, some of them from groups traditionally underrepresented in astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measuring the mass ratios and masses of young stars is important for understanding the physical processes of star and binary formation. Usually, this is accomplished by comparing the locations of stars on an H-R diagram to theoretical tracks of young star evolution. However, the wide variety of available calculations predict a large range of possible stellar masses at young ages. The PI's work in this area has helped to renew interest in improving these models. In this program, she will observe a sample of 140 candidate young spectroscopic binaries to confirm their multiplicity with multi-object visible light spectroscopy on the MMT Telescope and to measure the mass ratios of the bona fide pairs with 3 epochs of infrared spectroscopy using the Discovery Channel Telescope.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This NSF award provided the resources to discover, verify, characterize, and analyze young spectroscopic binary stars.  These are a special class of binary system with mutual orbital periods of just days to months.  The two stars in these systems are gravitationally bound and will orbit their common center of mass throughout their lifetimes of billions of years.  Because they move so quickly around each other, following the basic laws of physics, it is relatively straightforward to measure the stars' velocities using spectra taken many times throughout the orbital period.  From these velocities we can learn about the mass ratio of the system and the other orbital properties, i.e. how round or eccentric the orbit is, how long, how far apart the stars are, etc. This work is important because most stars are located in binary systems.  Thus they dominate the stellar census and it is therefore critical to understand their formation, characteristics, and potential for planet formation.   Furthermore, once stellar mass ratios can be measured, other techniques for measuring the total mass of the system may be applied to allow for the determination of the individual stellar masses in the binary. For young stars this is very important because it aids astronomers in understanding how young stars form and evolve and change during the critical epoch of planet formation.  An important product of this research is the model grid of synthetic spectra that the team has developed in order to determine the fundamental properties of the stars in the close binary systems.  These include temperature, magnetic field strength, surface gravity, rotation velocity, and other properties.  This research was carried out by the PI and by undergraduate student and post-undergraduate interns.  A postdoctoral scholar also participated.  The training of this next generation of scientists is probably the most important and significant aspect of the research because these young researchers have continued on into careers in data science, teaching, telescope technical jobs, and graduate schools.  Many of the participants in this work were from groups which have been historically underrepresented in the physical sciences.  Therefore, in a small but significant way, this work has created a stronger and more diverse astronomical community.
