<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Human Resource Development contribute funds to this award. It supports theoretical research and education aimed at understanding a particular kind of defect in crystalline diamond where a nitrogen atom replaces a carbon atom and an adjacent carbon atom site is unoccupied. This NV center traps electrons in a small region where they occupy a quantum state with angular momentum - in a sense it appears as though the electronic state is spinning. Control of the quantum state of the NV center is a route to performing computation through the manipulation of quantum mechanical states - quantum computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI aims to study NV center interactions with various impurities and contaminants in diamond. By elucidating how undesirable quantum mechanical effects may be minimized, the research may lead to advances in ultra-high resolution imaging and magnetic field detection. The PI will use formal theoretical methods and computer simulations, to investigate the mechanism of stability and loss of coherence - the deterioration of a quantum state. The resulting models will be compared with the experimental results of collaborators at Harvard and Delaware State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports the education of a graduate student and two undergraduate students at Delaware State University, one of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The students will benefit from exposure to modeling, mathematical calculations, programming, and data analysis techniques, and will have opportunities to interact with other researchers at the Institute for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics at Harvard. The PI will develop a new graduate course incorporating various many-body physics techniques and results from the research. Analysis algorithms developed in this project will be distributed to the greater scientific community through freely available user-developed code libraries. The research results will also be incorporated into a scientific presentation at the Physics Open House, an outreach activity held annually on the Delaware State University campus to promote science in the vicinity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Human Resource Development contribute funds to this award. It supports theoretical research and education aimed to advance understanding and controlling the stability of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers due to structural defects and contaminants.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The PI aims to develop a theoretical framework for understanding NV center interactions with various impurities and contaminants. The research will concentrate on three specific objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Interactions of NV centers having various surface terminations with water molecules covering the surface. The PI will develop a model to calculate the stability of the NV center at various depths from the surface and to predict the probability that the NV center will be neutralized and that a nitrogen atom will migrate to the surface. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Interactions with bulk substitutional atom impurities. The PI will determine how the impurity population distribution changes at various implantation energies and temperatures, and will calculate the decoherence rate of a NV spin in a dilute spin bath of substitutional atom impurities.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Line broadening in electron spin resonance spectra. Line broadening reduces the sensitivity of magnetic field detection in NV-based devices. The PI will determine the cause of line broadening and will develop a scheme to minimize it. By elucidating how undesirable quantum mechanical effects may be minimized, the present research may lead to advances in ultra-high resolution imaging and magnetic field detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will use analytical and numerical methods, including computer simulations, to investigate the mechanism of decoherence. The resulting models will be compared with the experimental results of collaborators at Harvard and Delaware State University. &lt;br/&gt;This award also supports the education of a graduate student and two undergraduate students at Delaware State University, one of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual merit:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are highly sensitive to magnetic fields and are thus ideal as ultra-sensitive magnetic sensors. We investigated two problems that reduce the sensitivity of NV center sensors: (a) neutralization that when the NV center is placed close to the surface; and (b) electric field and magnetic field noise.</p> <p>(1) NV center neutralization problem</p> <p>We investigated necessary conditions for NV centers to remain stable and not be neutralized. Stability depends on: the depth of the NV centers below the surface, the concentration and distribution of the NV centers, and the acidity of the water that condenses onto the surface. Our calculations reveal a ?sweet spot? ?a combination of conditions that allow experimenters to maximize the sensitivity of NV center based sensors. The results have been published in the Journal of Applied Physics.</p> <p>(2) Noise problem</p> <p>Two types of noise affect NV center devices, electric and magnetic field noise. The electric and magnetic fields interact differently with NV centers, so we investigate them separately using different theoretical models.</p> <p><em>a. Electric field noise</em></p> <p>Surface charge fluctuations are the main source of electric field noise. We calculated and analyzed the noise spectrum for six different surface layer materials in common experimental use. We found that four parameters affect the noise spectrum: effective relaxation time, effective loss tangent, power law exponent, and layer thickness. Our results suggest that a surface covering layer helps decrease surface noise, but which material is most suitable depends on the frequency. This work has been published in Physical Review Applied.</p> <p><em>b. Magnetic field noise</em></p> <p>Magnetic field noise comes from two distinct sources, bulk and surface impurities. The bulk noise comes from the NV center electrons? interactions with impurity nuclear spins, while the surface noise comes from their interactions with impurity electron spin. We treat the bulk and surface cases separately. The combined results have been written and it will be submitted to a journal for publication in the near future.</p> <p>b (i) surface impurity noise</p> <p>We investigated the interaction of surface impurities with NV centers with three different surface finishings. &nbsp;</p> <p>Surfaces with short spin relaxation time have less noise, since only one mechanism, spin slip-flop fluctuations, contributes to the noise. Surfaces with longer spin relaxation time have an additional contributing mechanism, spin precessing fluctuations, resulting in higher noise.</p> <p>b (ii) bulk impurity noise</p> <p>The bulk noise sources are carbon-13 atoms that are naturally present in diamond, and nitrogen atoms that are by-products of NV center creations. The amount of bulk noise generation is mostly determined by the amount of impurities, which controls both the interaction strength and the frequency of noise generation. We also find that the commonly used approximation method is applicable only when the applied magnetic field is strong. Moreover, applying a high magnetic field actually reduces the noise, because the field effectively shields the NV center electron spin from the impurities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>This project has contributed to solving two problems NV center devices face: NV center neutralization and noise. The results can aid experimentalists developing new NV-based technologies such as single-spin magnetic sensors and quantum registers.</p> <p>The project participants include seven undergraduate and four graduate students under the supervision of the PI. Six of the students are from underrepresented groups, and ten are first generation college graduates. Two of the undergraduates spent a summer at the Institute for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (ITAMP) at Harvard University. They attended seminars and workshops and discussed the project with colleagues. These activities fueled the students? enthusiasm toward the project and toward physics research in general. Four undergraduate and two graduate students presented results at APS March Meetings. All of the undergraduates participated in the honors program research presentation on campus.
