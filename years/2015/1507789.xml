<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1507789&lt;br/&gt;PI: Morelli, Donald T.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thermoelectric materials are capable of converting heat into an electrical voltage or an electrical voltage into heat. These materials can be used for power generation, for capturing waste heat in combustion processes, and for cooling applications. This project comprises experiments and atomistic modeling of tetrahedrite minerals, which have shown promise as especially efficient thermoelectric materials. In addition, the tetrahedrite family of minerals is abundant on earth and environmentally benign compared with other semiconductor thermoelectrics, which incorporate rare or toxic elements to achieve thermoelectric efficiency. Results from the project will be incorporated into a web-based education and outreach program called Atoms in Materials in 3D and into a science newsletter for elementary and middle school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will identify connections between atomic and electron density and thermoelectricity in copper-rich tetrahedrites. Research will focus on the influence of doping of metal ions on the copper site, ionic mobility and ion migration in copper-rich tetrahedrites and effects of isoelectron substitution on the anion site. The project will use x-ray and neutron scatter techniques to provide structural information, insight into atomic displacement and diffusion, and electron density characteristics. Results will be combined with thermoelectric property measurements and atomistic simulation studies to develop quantitative relationships between atomic and electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of the materials. Enhanced thermoelectric performance can have a strong influence on the efficiency of energy usage in diverse industrial processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the proposed research is to investigate the fundamental relationship between electronic and atomic structure and the thermoelectric properties of tetrahedrite-based thermoelectric materials.  First, several synthesis and processing methods (including wet chemsitry approaches, mecahnical alloying, and reactive spark plasma sintering) for obtaining high quality single phase tetrahedrite semicondcutors have been established which allows facile and repeatable materials preparation with consistent electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity.  Second, computational methods to study atomic dynamics have been developed to obtain mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties of materials.  Third, the anomalous atomic dynamics related to Cu rattling has been revealed and correlated with the extremely low lattice thermal conductivity of tetrahedrite.  The project provides research opportunities for two graduate students work in a collaborative environment within the same department and with an external undergraduate institution.  The established experimental synthesis and processing methods is likely to greatly reduce the material development cost, bring one step closer to the large-scale commercialization of tetrahedrites.  The computational methods enabled by this grant can be generalized to any type of functional materials, which could greatly benefit the materials screening and design processes.  Similarly, the synthesis mehhodsd developed (wet chemistry, mechanical alloying, reactive spark plasma sintering) may also be applied to a variety of materials systems.
