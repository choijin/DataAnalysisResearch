<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the 2015 Houston Summer School on Dynamical Systems, taking place May 20-28, 2015 at the University of Houston. This event introduces graduate students to recent progress and novel techniques in probabilistic dynamics and ergodic theory, as well as giving a bird's-eye view of fundamental areas of dynamics. The school also covers applications to other areas where these ideas are useful, such as mathematical neuroscience, statistical mechanics, and information theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the school consists of four lecture series covering topics in uniform hyperbolicity; partial hyperbolicity; parabolic dynamics and renormalization; and decay of correlations via spectral gap, coupling, and cones. These lectures will be given by internationally recognized researchers in dynamical systems: Boris Hasselblatt (Tufts University); Keith Burns (Northwestern University); Jayadev Athreya (UIUC); Vaughn Climenhaga (Houston); Matt Nicol (Houston); Will Ott (Houston); Andrew Torok (Houston). The school also includes further lectures on advanced topics and applications, informal review sessions, problem sessions, and project sessions, with particular emphasis on maximizing interactions between students and lecturers and allowing plenty of opportunity for discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summer school web site:  www.math.uh.edu/~climenha/2015-school.html</AbstractNarration>
