<AbstractNarration>In this Project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Alexander Nevzorov is studying membrane proteins (MPs) under their native-like conditions by solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Membrane proteins perform a plethora of biological functions, yet the number of their solved structures remains relatively small. The solid-state NMR technique allows researchers to perform structure-function studies of MPs that are difficult or impossible to crystallize at nearly physiological conditions.  NMR spectroscopic methods developed during this research expand capabilities of this technique to multihelical MPs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main purpose of this project is to transform solid-state NMR of oriented membrane proteins (MPs) by developing new spectroscopic tools including methods for distance measurements and assignment of crowded spectral regions. Moreover, new membrane mimetics of flexible lipid composition based on nanopores and oriented macrodisks are being created to monitor lipid-induced conformational changes of MPs. Dynamic properties of lipid bilayers are probed including rotational diffusion of membrane-embedded proteins and the bilayer viscosity. Potential future applications include structure determination of the human Acetylcholine receptor involved in the Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. As broader impacts of this project, the highly interdisciplinary nature of this research provides versatile training for the young scientists involved. As outreach activities, via mentorship of a Kenan Fellow, Dr. Nevzorov promotes the results of his research to high-school education and STEM programs.</AbstractNarration>
