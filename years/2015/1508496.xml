<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Intermetallic phases are a class of metals and alloys that exhibit a vast range of materials behaviors valuable for technological applications.   Examples include the catalysis of reactions for chemical synthesis or energy generation, the conversion of temperature gradients into electrical energy, the maintenance of strong and permanent magnetic moments, and the ability to recover an original geometry after drastic mechanical deformations.   A pressing problem is relating these desirable behaviors to the often complex atomic arrangements within intermetallics, the solution to which could allow rational approaches to enhancing these properties.  The focus of this research supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program in the Division of Materials Research is the development of such connections between atomic arrangements and materials behavior for intermetallics.  Theoretical methods are used to make predictions about atomic geometries within these compounds, the physical properties arising from these structures, and their responses to changes in pressure or temperature.  Experiments involving the creation of new materials and the measurement of their properties are then used to test these predictions and revise the theoretical models.  In addition, this project involves the development of resources for teaching solid state and materials chemistry, a subject typically underrepresented in the undergraduate curriculum.  New content is being developed for the online textbook Interactive Solid State Chemistry, which harnesses the interactive capabilities of the webpage format to enhance students' experience of the material.  This resource is available to a broad range of educators and students through its inclusion as a Living Textbook in the Chemical Education Digital Library, a pathway in the National Science Digital Library.  Interest and awareness of materials chemistry is also promoted through the production of Science Through Comics, a website in which aspects of the field are illustrated in a non-technical and humorous way.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Intermetallic phases comprise a broad family of solid state materials that are remarkable for both their structural diversity and rich range of physical properties.  Intermetallics thus show great promise for materials design efforts, in which structural features are adjusted for the optimization of particular properties.  A limiting factor in realizing this potential, however, is the need for clear relationships between their often complex atomic arrangements and the physical properties they exhibit.  Under prior NSF support, a theoretical method was developed that offers a way of bridging these aspects of intermetallics:  Chemical Pressure (CP) analysis.  In this approach, the output of density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to construct maps of the local pressures within solid state structures, which reveal how conflicts between electronic interactions and atomic packing constraints underlie a broad range of structural phenomena in metallic phases.  In this project supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program, the CP approach is built into a predictive conceptual framework that accounts not only for structural trends within intermetallics, but also their properties and phase transitions at high temperatures and pressures.  The ultimate goal of this research is a unified understanding of structures and properties in intermetallics, which can be applied in materials design.  Progress toward this aim is being achieved through three subprojects adapting the DFT-CP method to experimental design:  (1) the synthetic exploration of new structural chemistry driven by CP relief, (2) the development and validation of principles connecting structure to vibrational properties, which in turn influence such physical properties as thermal stability, thermal conductivity, and superconductivity, and (3) the discovery of new pressure-induced structural transformations.  The first subproject involves the synthesis in intermetallic systems motivated by CP calculations, the determination of newly encountered structures, and the use of data-mining and theory to place these structures into family trees whose branches represent pathways for CP release.  The second and third subprojects leverage expertise and facilities available at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory for Nuclear Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (NRIXS) and high pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements, respectively, to verify the predictions of theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  Intermetallic compounds represent a broad class of solid state materials that emerge when metallic elements are combined with each other.  They stand out from common alloys in the ways they are arranged at the atomic level and the unique materials properties that can emerge from their atomic arrangements.  The development of new technologies from intermetallic compounds, however, is limited by the need for a clearer understanding of how the intriguing atomic arrangements exhibited by these compounds are related to their behavior as materials.   Through a combined experimental and theoretical approach, this project has developed a framework that builds links between these two aspects of intermetallics, based on a theoretical technique that visualizes the ways atoms push and pull on each other in their attempts to find their most stable arrangements.   In some of the compounds examined, the atoms are squeezed most strongly from opposite sides and pulled in the perpendicular directions, leading to a tendency of atoms to pop out of those strained positions and the potential for atomic motions or migrations.  Such directions of easy atomic motion can be connected to the emergence of complicated geometrical arrangements in metals or potentially contribute to materials properties that depend of atomic motion.  By contrast, another system was identified in which the forces between atoms create a jamming of the motions, such that the material is slow to respond to environmental changes.    Broader impacts:  These results form the basis for general principles that extend beyond the systems examined in this research, while demonstrating a theoretical tool that can be used by the broader scientific community to gain insights into materials and the forces underlying chemical bonds. This project has also contributed to the training of the next generation of scientists, with the results being included in the theses of five graduate students who have already earned their PhD?s and then moved into the workforce, and one who will be defending their thesis soon.  Mentoring in research was also provided to four undergraduate students, two of whom have already completed their B.S. degrees and are pursuing graduate studies in chemistry at other institutions.  In addition, scientific outreach to the broader public was carried out through installments of Science through Comics, an on-line collection of comics that introduce concepts in solid state and materials chemistry in a playful way suitable for K-12 students, and presentations to students in grades 5-8 as part of the UW-Madison Institute for Chemical Education?s Fun with Chemistry Summer Camps.
