<AbstractNarration>The Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) will be supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as a distributed, multi-user national facility that will provide the natural hazards research community with access to research infrastructure that will include earthquake and wind engineering experimental facilities, cyberinfrastructure, computational modeling and simulation tools, and research data, as well as education and community outreach activities.  NHERI will be comprised of separate awards for a Network Coordination Office, Cyberinfrastructure, Computational Modeling and Simulation Center, and Experimental Facilities, including a post-disaster, rapid response research facility. Awards made for NHERI will contribute to NSF's role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program.  NHERI continues NSF's emphasis on earthquake engineering research infrastructure previously supported under the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation as part of NEHRP, but now broadens that support to include wind engineering research infrastructure.  NHERI has the broad goal of supporting research that will improve the resilience and sustainability of civil infrastructure, such as buildings and other structures, underground structures, levees, and critical lifelines, against the natural hazards of earthquakes and windstorms, in order to reduce loss of life, damage, and economic loss. Information about NHERI resources will be available on the DesignSafe-ci.org web portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NHERI Experimental Facilities will provide access to their experimental resources, user services, and data management infrastructure for NSF-supported research and education awards. This award will provide a NHERI Experimental Facility at Lehigh University to support research to mitigate the impact of natural hazards, including earthquakes, on structures. This facility will provide experimental resources for accurate, large-scale, multi-directional simulations to investigate the effects of natural hazard events on civil infrastructure systems, with potential soil-foundation effects. The new discoveries and knowledge from these simulations will enable researchers to develop and validate new hazard mitigation solutions and innovative hazard-resistant structural concepts. The research conducted by facility users will contribute to the development of the next generation workforce for natural hazards engineering research, educational activities, and professional practice. The education and community outreach programs, along with the strategic education partnerships of the facility, will target a diverse audience and attract young individuals into science, technology, and engineering, while also reaching out to educate and inform a broader community. This facility will conduct annual workshops for prospective users and will host Research Experiences for Undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The facility's experimental resources, which include a strong floor, multi-directional reaction wall, static and dynamic actuators, and testing algorithms, will support large-scale, multi-direction, real-time hybrid simulations that combine physical experiments with computer-based simulations for evaluating performance of large-scale components and systems. The types of laboratory simulations and tests enabled by the facility include: (1) hybrid simulation (HS), which combines large-scale physical models with computer-based numerical simulation models; (2) geographically distributed hybrid simulation (DHS), which is a HS with physical models and/or numerical simulation models located at different sites; (3) real-time hybrid earthquake simulation (RTHS), which is a HS conducted at the actual time scale of the physical models; (4) geographically distributed, real-time hybrid earthquake simulation, which combines DHS and RTHS; (5) dynamic testing, which loads large-scale physical models at real-time scales through predefined load histories; and (6) quasi-static testing, which loads large-scale physical models at slow rates through predefined load histories. The facility resources will enable multiple, large-scale simulations and tests to be conducted simultaneously, allowing numerous users to work concurrently without significant interruption. The large-scale hybrid simulations are a unique resource for system-level response data, since they enable the definition of the "system" to be expanded well beyond the size of typical laboratory physical models. At the same time, due to its large size, the facility can accommodate large-scale physical models, which reduces scaling effects associated with typical, small physical models. A broad array of instrumentation, large-scale data acquisition systems, and advanced sensors will provide the system-level data needed for advancing computational modeling and simulation. The facility will utilize the HS capabilities for earthquake engineering to develop hybrid wind engineering simulation capabilities within the facility. The HS being advanced at the facility has the potential for broader impacts in other fields of science and engineering, where combining physical models and numerical simulation models will enable more holistic definitions of "the system" in experimental research.</AbstractNarration>
