<AbstractNarration>1547080&lt;br/&gt;Brion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several common bacteria are beneficial in the human system; however, mutations in these bacteria can result in strains that cause infectious disease.  In recent years, deaths attributable to bacterial infections from these strains exceeded those from HIV/AIDS.  In preliminary work the PI has detected high concentrations of infectious bacterial strains in wastewater treatment plants, and she plans to investigate whether these facilities are hot spots for the processes that foster the mutations that create harmful bacteria.  The PI will investigate the prevalence of a particular harmful bacterium across two wastewater treatment plants, one connected to multiple hospitals and the other collecting primarily suburban sewage. The results of this project may guide new methods for wastewater treatment that will reduce concentrations of harmful bacteria and avoid the infectious diseases caused by these bacteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent findings of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in wastewater suggest that our sewage collection and treatment systems may serve as reservoirs and adaptive hot-spots for community acquired MRSA. It is possible that wastewater systems promote conditions that facilitate horizontal gene transfer of mobile genetic elements between Staphylococcus aureus strains and other bacteria. An example is the conjugative plasmid for vancomycin-resistant enterococci that has resulted in the emergence of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Preliminary data from 10 pairs of influent samples at the plants have documented the prevalence of both Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA to be greater in the hospital-fed system. To date, no studies have compared the prevalence of MRSA in hospital sewer systems to that of domestic sewage without hospital waste. The results of this research will expand our knowledge of how engineered systems may create conditions conducive to evolution of more virulent and environmentally robust strains of non-enteric pathogens, spurring a rethinking of the primary purpose of sewage treatment and the control systems engineers put into place to protect health and the environment. Results may change the way we view and design sewage collection, treatment, and distribution systems, track adaptation of microbes, and prevent disease transmission.  In this exploratory research the PI will apply recent advances in clinical and ecological research to understand the potential risks associated with engineered systems with respect to evolving pathogenic microbiota.</AbstractNarration>

We need to understand how these pathogens move between human hosts and the environment, and how this journey may cause them to evolve, so we may mitigate the potential for disease transmission.  Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is an appropriate index organism for study in sewage systems as it has a persistent presence, but is prone to evolve under environmental stresses.

One finding is that the presence of MRSA in the environment may be overstated due to the use of clinical methods not suited for environmental application.  Developing and proving methods that could provide successful separation of SA from SE in sewage samples was a significant part of this research.  SE is present in much greater amounts in sewage and grows well in the selective clinical broths and agars used to grow MRSA.  In fact, SE co-grows in mixed colonies with SA and MRSA on human bodies and shares genome content and MGEs with SA.  In order to investigate the acquisition, or loss of MGEs, either a specific capture method for SA needed to be used, or the growth of SE needed to be suppressed, so that the MGEs isolated could be ascribed only to SA.

Therefore, we changed our approach to evaluate SA enrichment and SE suppression methods.  After assessing several selective and enrichment methods, a modification of an existing clinical media with SE suppressing acriflavin was developed and applied for selective enrichment of SA and MRSA from sewage samples.  This method was completely successful in suppressing SE and provided clean, single organism clones of MRSA from bacterial spiked samples and samples obtained from two treatment plants for further study by whole genome sequencing.  The influent, final sedimentation tank effluent, and final effluent of two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Lexington, Kentucky provided samples that were processed with the new method resulting in prevalence of MRSA and clean clones for genetic sequencing.  These two WWTPs are similar in flow rate and types of processes, but they differ in the type of sewage collected.  The Town Branch plant collects wastewater from a primarily urban area, including several hospitals and high density housings (Prison, nursing homes, hotels, etc.), in addition to wastes from metal plating and other industrial processes.  The other treatment plant, West Hickman, collected sewage from suburban neighborhoods with low-density, or single-family dwellings.  The difference in the relative amount of hospital sewage collected by the two plants gave an opportunity to evaluate differences in the SA and MRSA presence at each facility, and track the acquisition of MGEs across the treatment processes.  The findings were counterintuitive in that the waste from suburban neighborhoods had MRSA present more often than the urban, hospital waste laden, sewage.  This finding supports the current thinking that MRSA is no longer being generated in hospitals and spread into the community, but being brought from the community into the hospitals as the community related strains are acquiring MGEs that allow them to persist, and maybe even thrive, outside of their human hosts in the environment.  The most commonly identified type of MRSA in both plants were from those related to endemic community sources (ST8; USA300).  One of the best outcomes was the creation of an international team with MRSA gene sequencing experts in Switzerland who validated the absence of SE in the colonies produced by the new method, and provided preliminary identification of MRSA types based on the identification of several genes on the genome.
