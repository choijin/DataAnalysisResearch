<AbstractNarration>Researchers from the University of Alabama-Huntsville and their NCAR collaborators will convene a workshop in Boulder Colorado to define issues and to share research and ideas relevant to the role that migration of agriculture might play in sustaining production and how the geography of sustainable production might be defined in terms of food, energy, and water nexus systems.  The primary outcome from the workshop will be a short report that summarizes primary research needs and potential approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geography of agricultural production in the U.S. changed dramatically in the last century with substantial food and fiber shifting to the arid west under irrigation and grain production becoming concentrated in the upper Midwest. The question is whether this paradigm of  the last century is sustainable and reliable for the future. Can some portion of the production in the West now under water stress be migrated back to the East under irrigation? Can some production in the Southwest migrate to the Northwest where water is more plentiful? Can grain production be more geographically distributed to avoid the environmental issues (e.g. nutrient run-off) and vulnerability to small regional droughts that the present concentration of production entails? This geography of agricultural production has also changed energy consumption through electrical energy used to move surface water in the West and to pump water in the High Plains. It has created the need for transportation energy to move refrigerated food from the West to the East and grains from the Midwest to the Southeast for consumption by poultry and swine. On the other hand, a new migration of agriculture back to the Southeast may see competition for water for cooling in thermoelectric generation and hydroelectric losses. This workshop will bring together hydrologists, agronomists, economists, climatologists, ecologists, energy experts, and water resource planners to discuss the vulnerabilities of the present geography of agriculture and discuss whether a new migration of agriculture might sustain production in the coming century.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the last century the geography of the Nation?s agricultural production changed dramatically as food and fiber production shifted from the East to the arid West under irrigated agriculture. Similarly, as transportation improved corn and grain production migrated to deep water holding soils in a small area of the upper Midwest.  As a result agriculture in the East dropped precipitously. In a positive sense, this migration of agriculture produced a bountiful fare of food at a price afforded by ordinary Americans.  However, the present drought in the West and the 2012 Midwest drought perhaps expose the vulnerability of the new geography of U.S. agriculture. Additionally, the shift in agriculture brought about adverse impacts on river ecosystems in the West and the concentration of nutrient export to the Mississippi River. This leads to several strategic questions.  Is the geography that evolved in the last century, due to immediate market forces and government investments, sustainable and reliable for the future?

The workshop discussed whether information might be developed to assess the geography of economic and agricultural sustainability in the future that might guide private sector investments and government policy as needed to sustain production in the coming century.  Data mining and cyber infrastructure components such as software tools and models were introduced at the beginning of the workshop as critical parts needed to meet information gathering needs for informed decisions.  The workshop began the process of determining how the geography of sustainable production might be defined in terms of food, energy, and water metrics.   Intellectual Merit: The main intellectual challenge in this activity is defining appropriate geographic food, energy and water metrics related to sustainability and actually computing these metrics. A key factor is maintaining a broad outlook that can be quantified.  The intellectual challenge is also to bring together separate suites of models and the data needed to exercise the models and produce information of actual use to real stakeholders and policy officials.  Broader Impacts: This activity explores a new path for realizing sustainability of food and energy.  It is expected that the coupled water demand and hydrologic models developed here can be used as water management tools in the Southeast.
