<AbstractNarration>Non-technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of electronic devices lies silicon, a semiconductor material that can be made&lt;br/&gt;pure enough for high performance and is amenable to mass production. While such&lt;br/&gt;circuitry is continually improving, silicon is unable to exhibit quantum phenomena&lt;br/&gt;required for complete solutions in weather prediction, genomics, and secure encryption.&lt;br/&gt;A new class of materials, the so-called topological insulators, holds the promise to&lt;br/&gt;realize such phenomena and revolutionize computing. Topological insulators are, in&lt;br/&gt;theory, non-metallic in the interior of the material but behave like a metal at the surface.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the quantum character of these metallic electrons can be switched, which is&lt;br/&gt;the basic information processing function. While known topological insulators&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate the metallic surface state, these materials have not been made pure enough&lt;br/&gt;for incorporating into electronic devices. Specifically, they are not yet insulating in the&lt;br/&gt;interior. This project will seek to find new topological insulators and to engineer them to&lt;br/&gt;levels of purity needed for an insulating interior and satisfy the performance demands of&lt;br/&gt;electronic circuits. The project will impact the electronics industry as well as train&lt;br/&gt;graduates skilled in the computational and experimental techniques of this new class of&lt;br/&gt;materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to create topological insulator materials that are pure enough in&lt;br/&gt;the bulk to exhibit true insulating behavior. Topological insulators are found among&lt;br/&gt;high-Z atom containing semiconductors with band gaps small enough that the spin-orbit&lt;br/&gt;coupling related to the large Z-number can invert the conduction and valence band.&lt;br/&gt;These materials must also possess spatial inversion symmetry for the relevant orbitals.&lt;br/&gt;The project will explore candidate materials classes among pseudo-binary and&lt;br/&gt;pyrochlore-related structures containing heavy metals such as Ir, Re, and Os. Materials&lt;br/&gt;synthesis by solid state chemistry techniques will be guided by simulations based on&lt;br/&gt;density functional theory. Promising candidate materials will be synthesized in single&lt;br/&gt;crystal form by appropriate methods including vapor transport, zone refinement, and&lt;br/&gt;growth from flux. Crystalline specimens will be studied with angle resolved&lt;br/&gt;photoemission spectroscopy and conventional charge transport techniques. Prototype&lt;br/&gt;transistor devices will be fabricated on a smaller subset of these systems. The results at&lt;br/&gt;each measurement stage will be fed back to the theory and synthesis efforts.</AbstractNarration>

Our design, discover, and measurement team Designing Insulating Topological Insulators included one theorist in computational design and four experimentalists covering synthesis chemistry and single crystal growth, measurement of electronic behavior in electric and magnetic fields, and a spectroscopist who excites electrons and follows their behavior.      Early in the program we discovered computationally that alkaline earth triarsenides, such as SrAs3, have loops in momentum space that provide their charge carriers with a designation a topological semimetals.

Our team synthesized single crystals of this class of materials and performed magnetotransport and angle-resolved photoemission measurements to establish them as nearly insulating topological semimetals. .     Two dimensional materials with a honeycomb atomic arrangement form one of the most heavily studied classes of topological materials. Our team synthesized the first (and still the only) such material based on osmium, Li2OsO3,  a new sister of the more common iridium-based materials. Four principal investigators on our team collaborated to perform a characterization of this material and to provide initial indications of its anticipated topological properties. This discovery establishes osmates as a new crystal class with topological potential.     Topological electronic states occur in more complex combinations. From computational exploration we established initially that the intermetallic compound PbPd3 hosted a combination of topological nodal loops, triple nodal points, and "flat bands."  These properties enable unconventional electronic transport of the electron’s charge and magnetic moment ("spin") behavior that may be useful for electronics applications. Our team synthesized high quality single crystals and studied them under very high magnetic fields to identify their electronic properties at low as well as at high magnetic fields. In high magnetic fields high quality metals display variations of the magnetic response (magnetic susceptibility) with field strength that reveals the most basic microscopic features of a metal. The oscillations observed in PbPd3 indicated, however, that the electrons responsible for the electrical conductivity were not showing effects of the  topological nodal loops, triple nodal points, and "flat bands." This clarification has stimulated our further studies under way to tune the electron concentration toward the regime oftopological nodal loops.      A related computational discovery is that the ternary intermetallic ferromagnet Cr2CoAl harbors topological degenerate points for only one of its two magnetic directions, and it is the direction of "spin" that determines all of the metallic properties at laboratory temperatures and below. Its specific electromagnetic properties might make it useful for applications. A complementary design project surveyed, computationally, a set of 75 compounds whose crystal structure is like that of many common oxides ("perovskite") except that a positive ion such as Ca, Sr, or Ba lies on the lattice position normally occupied by the negative oxygen ion. A few members of this class were identified as promising topological prospects for further study.     An undoped Weyl semimetal (WSM) is predicted to exhibit electrical resistivity varying strongly with temperature as &#120588; &prop; &#120588;0*(1/&#119879;)^4 in the presence of random defects screened by thermally generated charge carriers. However, previously published &#120588;(&#119879;) data for Y2Ir2O7 are highly irreproducible, with different samples measured in different laboratories showing different behavior. We found that in our polycrystalline samples of the WSM Y2Ir2O7,  the expected behavior is obeyed over four orders of magnitude in &#120588;, and the prefactor, &#120588;0, further agrees with theoretical estimates within the random potential model using reasonable materials parameters, with little variation between samples.  This shows that our materials are undoped and do behave reproducibly, with properties consistent with a true zero-gap Weyl semimetal.  Some team-members studied the new intrinsically-heterostructured magnetic topological materials MnBi4Te7, MnBi6Te10, and MnBi8Te13. In these materials the intrinsic magnetic order (either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic) introduces time reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) that removew the protection that keeps the Dirac points closed and massless.  We presented the first electronic structure measurements for most of these compounds and discovered that various layers within the intrinsic heterostructures have various levels of mass-gaps.  These findings can help us engineer optimal structures to take advantage of the mass-gaps and the associated quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) physics that is enabled, including dissipationless edge currents.  Almost 20 students and postdoctoral fellows at the five institutions were supported during the term of this project, with several obtaining PhD degrees largely on the basis of their teamwork on this design and discovery of topological materials. Additionally, undergraduate students who assisted the graduate students in their research efforts experienced Materials Research at an early time in their careers.
