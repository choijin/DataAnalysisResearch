<AbstractNarration>This project is facilitating the growing use of STEM Learning Assistants in STEM departments in institutions of higher education and improving implementations of this approach. Learning Assistants (LAs) are talented highly-trained STEM undergraduates who are hired by university and two-year college STEM instructors to help transform courses to evidence-based approaches and assist enrolled students to get the full impact of active learning methods. The Learning Assistant model has spread rapidly into practice in the last few years. In response to growing use and requests for assistance, the team that created the LA model has recently developed an international Learning Assistant Alliance - a collaborative network of 88 institutions that use Learning Assistants to catalyze education transformation in mathematics, science, and engineering courses. Members of the LA Alliance also engage in collaborative research with peer institutions interested in developing and using improved outcome measures. Project resources are supporting the development and implementation of a web-based process for disseminating research-based LA instructional practices, including a database to provide resources and information for new users that will contribute to the efficient implementation of the LA model. Project resources are also supporting a large-scale research study of the learning outcomes and retention of over 50,000 undergraduates who have enrolled in courses using the LA model. With the initial support provided in this award, the LA Alliance is developing a governing structure and a plan for sustainable funding in years beyond the grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Learning Assistant model is a model for social and structural organization in undergraduate STEM education that is related to and builds on the work of Peter Senge on learning organizations and on the work of Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger on communities of practice. It is an approach to supporting the growing use of evidence-based instructional strategies. However, it is not a specific instructional strategy but rather a method of training and using advanced undergraduate students as course assistants and liaisons between instructors and students enrolled in a STEM course. Built into the model is the baseline expectation that participating institutions are working to bring about change in the way undergraduate courses are taught and to study the effectiveness of these changes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Learning Assistants (LAs) are undergraduate students who, through the guidance of weekly preparation sessions and a pedagogy course, facilitate discussions among groups of students in a variety of classroom settings that encourage active engagement.  The mission of the International Learning Assistant Alliance is to connect people and institutions to support the implementation and assessment of the LA Model, with the goals of improving educational experiences and access across the disciplines.  Boston University was one of four collaborating institutions included in the NSF IUSE grant, SUSTAINED, that helped support and develop the Learning Assistant Alliance. The project had four main goals:  1. This NSF IUSE project was designed to build and test resources and prepare dissemination pathways for the Learning Assistant Alliance. Resources for the LA Alliance have been reviewed, improved, and increased over the life of this project.  In the past year for example, the LA Alliance has addressed the pressing needs of faculty who must convert their teaching to on-line learning and provided resources that will assist faculty in this change.   2. The project proposed further investigation of student outcomes nation-wide by further disseminating the use of the LASSO software platform by instructors and researchers, increasing the pathways for collecting data, collecting broader data by adding dozens more instruments, and integrating tools for data upload.  LASSO is free to use for instructors who want to utilize research-based assessments in transforming their courses.  3. A major goal was to test the LA Campus software platform at collaborating institutions and work out a funding model and mechanism for receiving service fees.  LA Campus assists program coordinators with handling applications and hiring of LAs each semester.  Boston University was the first test site for dissemination of LA Campus.  Faculty, program and departmental coordinators, and LAs at BU are successfully using LA Campus, and BU's LA program has been able to expand to additional departments as well as increasing the number of faculty and students involved in the program, with over 270 LA positions each year.  With the support of Learning Assistants, an ever-increasing number of faculty have adopted active learning practices.  4. The project aimed to establish funding and leadership to sustain the LA Alliance.  A governing body has been created that involves both faculty and learning assistants. They have created some funding methods and continue to expand them.  Currently, the Alliance receives much of its funding from the University of Colorado, Boulder.  The new funding measures will distribute the costs to all participating institutions to make the Alliance sustainable.    The intellectual merit of this project includes numerous articles and presentations which have been written and published by members of the collaboration.  A recent example is: Alexa McQuade, Jayson M. Nissen, and Manher Jariwala, Characteristics of institutions with Learning Assistant programs: An equity investigation, in Proceedings of the 2020 Physics Education Research Conference. doi: 10.1119/perc.2020.pr.McQuade, exploring the distribution of LA programs among minority-serving instituions, two-year colleges, and teaching-intensive institutions.   Each year of the project, Boston University has been proud to help run LA community events like the annual Learning Assistant International Conference in Boulder, CO, as well as to organize two regional LA workshops in Boston, MA.  All of these efforts are designed to disseminate information that will help institutions build and improve their LA programs.  The broader impacts of the project at Boston University include an increase of participation in the program by faculty and students in nine departments, across three colleges, transforming classes enrolling ~10,000 students over the course of the year to incorporate active learning methods. Across the country, several hundred thousand students are similarily benefitting from the use of Learning Assistants and the LA Model, in more than 100 institutions nationwide.
