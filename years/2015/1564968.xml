<AbstractNarration>The Institut Henri Poincar√© (IHP) will host a thematic quarter on the Nexus of Information and Computation Theories, from January 25th, 2016 to April 1st, 2016. The primary goal of this program is to explore the rich interplay between information theory and the theory of computation, and ultimately create new connections and collaborations between both scientific communities. In recent years, methods from information theory have been used to solve longstanding open problems in computer science, most notably in the realm of lower bounds in communication complexity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is organized in 4 thematic sessions, focussing on the areas of Distributed Computing, Inference Problems, Fundamental Inequalities, and Security. Each of these areas will involve talks by both Computer Scientists and Information theorists, with the intent to promote collaboration between the two areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports graduate students and postdocs from the United States to attend the quarter, in cases where attendance would not be possible without support. Each award will provide funds for accommodation and travel.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Recently, a number of advances in the theory of computation have been made by using information theoretic arguments (e.g.,in communication complexity, streaming, and data structures lower bounds). Conversely, some of the most exciting ongoing work in information theory has focused on problems with a computational component (e.g., distributed function computation, relaying over a network, message-passing algorithms). The primary goal of this program is to explore the rich interplay between information theory and the theory of computation, and ultimately create new connections and collaborations between both scientific communities.     From its genesis in Claude Shannon?s seminal paper, information theory has provided the foundation for a powerful theory of communication. Over time, research efforts have turned towards a broader class of problems, many of which involve communication within a network of users. In parallel, research on the theory of computation has aimed at establishing bounds on a variety of computational problems and tasks. This project brings together scientists and students from these two broad areas of study. We expect to spawn new interdisciplinary collaborations and new research outcomes as a result of concentrating some of the brightest minds in these two fields in one location. In addition, our program will educate many students in the basics of both computer science and information theory, enabling long-term collaborations between the two areas.     The goals of the project were to support the travel of academics from the US to Paris to attend the program "Nexus of Information and Computation Theories" held at Institut Henri Poincare from January 25 through April 1, 2016.     The travel of 16 participants from the United States were supported using the grant.  Universities include Boston University, CUNY, Duke University, Harvard University, Indiana University, New York University, Penn State, Princeton University, Texas A&amp;M University, UCLA, UC - Santa Barbara, University of Maryland, University of Utah, and University of Washington.     Participation in such workshops and similar conferences is a valuable part of the graduate school experience.  Students get the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the field and are exposed to new work in the field. The support requested in this grant enabled participation from students who would otherwise be unable to attend the program.

This website lists information about the workshops, dates, speakers for the period of 25 January through 1 April 2016.     The Henri Poincare Institute (IHP) is a research institute dedicated to mathematics and theoretical physics. They organized the workshops, chose attendees, and decided on the travel grant amounts to participants from U.S. univerisities.
