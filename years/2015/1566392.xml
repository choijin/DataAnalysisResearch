<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by Professor Brenton DeBoef of the University of Rhode Island. Professor DeBoef is developing new chemical reactions that convert carbon-hydrogen bonds to carbon-nitrogen or carbon-carbon bonds. These reactions are significant because most organic molecules are constructed with a skeletal framework containing carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bonds, surrounded by many carbon-hydrogen bonds on their periphery. Consequently, the ability to directly convert selected carbon-hydrogen bonds to other bonds is a valuable tool for chemists. The key to the development of these new reactions is the use of new gold and iron-based catalysts. These new reactions will help chemists construct technologically relevant, complex molecules such as pharmaceuticals, conducting polymers and organic dyes. Additionally, Professor DeBoef has formed a joint research and training program with the Community College of Rhode Island in which students in the Chemical Technology program synthesize a potential Alzheimer's drug. This collaboration is having an impact by expanding research infrastructure and scientific workforce training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching objective of the project is to systematically test mechanistic hypotheses concerning the catalytic synthesis of carbon-carbon (C-C) and carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bonds via oxidative carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond activation. Accomplishing these goals provides fundamental knowledge about the mechanistic steps by which noble or earth-abundant transition metal catalysts cleave strong, non-acidic C-H bonds. Specifically, this proposal seeks to discover the active catalytic species in a gold catalyzed regioselective C-H amination reaction and an iron-catalyzed C-H arylation reaction. DeBoef has hypothesized that the former reaction is catalyzed by a unique dimeric gold species. An iron catalyst, whose resting state is in the unique +1 oxidation state, is hypothesized to catalyze the latter reaction. The fundamental knowledge gained by this work facilitates the development of novel chemical reactions and synthetic schemes. The DeBoef group contributes to the training of a diverse workforce in science by providing an excellent training environment for both graduate and undergraduate students, including women and minorities. Additionally, the outreach work with the Community College of Rhode Island provides aspiring chemical technicians with a meaningful and marketable research experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of the work supported by this award was the development of new catalytic processes that could be used to create high-value molecules by directly converting carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds into carbon-carbon (C-C) and carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bonds.  The most difficult component of the project involved studying the mechanism by which iron catalysts performed C-H functionalization reactions.  While these chemical transformations had been reported over ten years ago, the mechanism by which the iron catalyst broke C-H and created C-C bonds was unknown. The work that has been accomplished as a result of this award elucidated the mechanism of these important reactions.      Iron-catalyzed coupling reactions are an excellent alternative to palladium-catalyzed processes, as the iron catalysts are non-toxic, environmentally benign, and affordable.  Furthermore, iron-catalyzed reactions that involve C-H bond functionalization represent a near ideal chemical process.  The work performed as part of this award is basic science, so it is difficult to quantify the impact at this stage, but it is obvious that the move from toxic and expensive palladium catalysts, which are used widely in the pharmaceutical industry, to earth-abundant and non-toxic iron catalysts will have a significant impact on the associated industries and on the environment.       During the course of this project, we have focused our efforts on elucidating the oxidation state of the iron catalysts.  The most common oxidation states for iron are +2 and +3, but our experimental evidence showed that iron species in the +2 and +3 oxidation states were not able to perform the observed reactions.  This led us to hypothesize that iron may exist in the rare +1 oxidation state.  After years of unsuccessful experimentation, we have recently observed definitive proof of iron in the +1 oxidation state. These exciting data represent the first example of an iron(I) intermediate in an iron-catalyzed C-H functionalization reaction.     It is also important to note that the scientists who were trained during the course of this project are as important as the science that was produced.  Through the course of the project numerous graduate and undergraduate students were trained.  Two graduate students who were supported by this award have recently been awarded PhD degrees.  One has a faculty appointment at the University of Ghana; the other is now a scientist for the US Army.  Undergraduates who have contributed to this project have matriculated to top-tier graduate programs such as Columbia and MIT.
