<AbstractNarration>Dr. John O'Shea, of the University of Michigan, Museum of Anthropological Archaeology, and an interdisciplinary team of archaeologists, computer scientists, and ecologists will investigate the early occupation of the Great Lakes region as preserved on landscapes that are now submerged.  The withdrawal of the continental ice sheets resulted in large fluctuations in the water levels of the newly formed Great Lakes.  While archaeological sites associated with high water levels are preserved on land, those associated with low water stages are hidden beneath the Great Lakes.  With NSF support it has been shown that sites associated with the primary low water stand (Lake Stanley stage, 9900- 7500 years ago) are preserved underwater and provide a unique record of the early human occupation during a time that is very poorly known on land.  This research will provide a view of the early settlement and subsistence that is unattainable on land, and fill a critical gap in the understanding of how human societies adjusted to changing environmental circumstances at the end of the Ice Age.  The research will provide important comparative data on prehistoric caribou populations and procurement that will complement accounts from historical and ethnographic sources, and provide a detailed environmental and ecological record of this important transition time in the Great Lakes.  The research will create synergistic interactions among a broad range of academic disciplines, promote international collaboration among American and Canadian scholars, and provide international research experience for American graduate and undergraduate students.  It will also contribute to the development of innovative and cost-effective approaches to underwater research.  The results of the investigation will be disseminated broadly to contemporary scholars concerned with the changing environments of the Great Lakes, and to the general public via museum exhibitions, workshops, and public lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. O'Shea and the research team will investigate the Alpena-Amberley Ridge (AAR), a submerged feature beneath Lake Huron, which was a dry land corridor linking northern Michigan with southern Ontario during the most extreme low water stage.  The unique setting of the AAR will be used to evaluate a series of questions concerning the seasonal and organizational character of the human occupation in light of more recent examples of caribou hunting adaptations in northern circumpolar regions.  The research will also investigate how these early Holocene strategies become transformed into the broad spectrum economies that characterize the later Archaic period in the Great Lakes.  The field investigations couple fine grained remote mapping of archaeological sites within a series of four micro-regions on the lake bottom using sonars and remote operated vehicles (ROVs) with the testing and excavation of preserved sites by SCUBA-trained archaeologists.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At the end of the last Ice Age, the withdrawing glaciers left deep gouges in the land which filled with melt waters and ultimately formed the modern Great Lakes. The water in these new lakes varied greatly before arriving at their present stable level; rising and dropping by as much as a 100m compared with the present day. The most extreme of the low water phases is termed Lake Stanley (roughly 10,000 to 8,000 years ago). During this time, the Alpena-Amberley Ridge (AAR) formed a narrow dry land corridor linking northeastern lower Michigan with south central Ontario. With prior NSF support, research on the AAR documented the ancient environment preserved on this submerged landform and produced clear evidence for the human use of the ancient landscape. This evidence includes stone hunting structures and alignments and debris from stone tool use and manufacture.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The research conducted under this award used the uniquely preserved setting of the AAR to evaluate a series of questions concerning the seasonal and organizational character of the early Great Lakes hunters and compared these hunting strategies with more recent examples of caribou hunters. The key relationship that underpinned the research was the knowledge that caribou, the principal target for the ancient hunters, migrated toward the south in the autumn and toward the north in the spring, and that by observing the orientation of the stone hunting structures we could determine the season in which they were used.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The results of the research were unexpected. We discovered that the ancient people hunted caribou during both the spring and autumn migrations, but that they did so in very different ways. In the autumn, small groups of hunters used the natural features of the landscape to locate hunting blinds along the path of caribou migration. A portion of this autumn kill was stored in stone caches for later consumption over the winter. By contrast, in the spring we observe large, multi-element hunting structures. These more complex features required the involvement of many more people, and they were located at natural choke points where the migrating animals would have to pass. Interestingly, while these complex structures would have resulted in a much larger take of animals, no evidence for meat storage has been observed. Taken together, these observations allow us to model the annual round of the early Great Lakes hunters. We hypothesize that small, family based groups of people journeyed to the AAR in the autumn, where they hunted for provisions for the winter. At the completion of the hunt, with meat stored, these groups moved back to the shelter of the trees of what is now Michigan for the winter. During the winter, hunters would occasional travel across the frozen lake to their meat caches on the AAR. In spring, with stores exhausted, these small groups of hungry people returned to the AAR and came together at the large hunting features to await the spring migration. The meat from this hunt was for immediate consumption and, as it would not store well in the warmer weather, the hunters could enjoy the rare luxury of staying put and interacting with the larger collection of people that had come together for the hunt. Later they dispersed back into smaller groups for summer fishing and hunting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When this model is compared to historic and ethnographic examples of caribou hunters, we see many of the same kinds of structures, but their season of use is reversed, with the major emphasis on autumn hunting. We believe the explanation for the difference can be found in the much larger size of the caribou herds that existed here at the end of the Ice Age, and by the way that colonial boundaries limited the mobility of Native peoples during the contact era.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The research has documented an important new model for seasonal caribou hunting, and one that could only be obtained from the uniquely preserved underwater context of the AAR. It fills a critical gap in our understanding of the development of PaleoIndian and Archaic cultures in the Great Lakes region and it highlights the sophisticated environmental knowledge that early hunters utilized in their pursuit of caribou. Beyond the scientific findings, the research activities promoted international research links between American and Canadian scholars, provided significant research experience for American graduate and undergraduate students, and promoted synergistic interactions between archaeologists, computer scientists, geologists, and ecologists concerned with modeling past landscapes and human activity. The project also supported a range of outreach activities, via museum exhibits, public presentations, and videos, to enable the broader public to see the results of the research and to gain a deeper appreciation of the Great Lakes environment and how it has changed over the past 10,000 years.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/02/2020<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;M&nbsp;O'shea</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1530628/1530628_10374059_1601652489932_FullLakewithunits--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1530628/1530628_10374059_1601652489932_FullLakewithunits--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Lake Stanley"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1530628/1530628_10374059_1601652489932_FullLakewithunits--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Lake Stanley"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure illustrates the area of Lake Huron bottom lands that were exposed for human use during Lake Stanley.
