<AbstractNarration>This project supports a workshop to bring together Additive Manufacturing researchers funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, and to identify synergisms between programs. The National Science Foundation typically funds basic research that has a long-term significance. Additive manufacturing describes a collection of manufacturing processes that manufacture parts layer-by-layer, controlled by a computer, and without the use of expensive tools or dies.  The industry currently has sales in excess of $4 billion, and is expected to grow to nearly $11 billion by 2021, but additive manufacturing is expected to fundamentally change the nature of advanced manufacturing in the 21st Century. The main objectives of the workshop are to: (1) examine and review the state-of-the-art in additive manufacturing equipment, materials, and process technologies; (2) identify pathways for basic research to transition to applied research and associated funding mechanisms; and (3) formulate recommendations for the next steps to advance additive manufacturing technologies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This workshop will promote continued research developments in additive manufacturing. Recognizing research funded by the National Science Foundation is properly characterized as basic research, and Department of Energy-funded programs generally focus on more applied research, there is significant synergy and limited overlap. As basic research is conducted, the focus naturally progresses to applied research as is funded at the Department of Energy. Both communities of researchers depend on each other in order to have impact. One main focus of this workshop is to identify pathways and funding opportunities to have technologies developed by basic researchers (with National Science Foundation funding) be identified, funded and continued by the Department of Energy. Such transfer of projects is hindered by a lack of coordination and exposure of the agencies and their funded researchers. This workshop will provide a forum to promote such technology development pathways.</AbstractNarration>

Both NSF and DOE recognize the importance of AM to the future of manufacturing.

Thus, it should be recognized that NSF and DOE research projects in AM both represent part of the same research pipeline.  Thirty NSF-funded researchers on additive manufacturing attended the workshop, and were able to experience the DOE program review. In addition, they were given a tour of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory additive manufacturing demonstration facility. The NSF-funded researchers presented their research in a poster session attended by DOE researchers and project managers, where potential future (post-NSF) funding opportunities could be investigated.   Conference reviews were very positive; the attendees were asked to provide feedback, and the general evaluation of the workshop was 4.67/5.0; when asked if they would recommend the workshop to colleagues, the response was 4.56/5.0. The high evaluations demonstrated that the NSF researchers found significant value in exposure to DOE facilities and researchers and vice-versa.
