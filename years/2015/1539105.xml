<AbstractNarration>Non-technical description&lt;br/&gt;The conversion of carbohydrates in plant-based biomass (lignin) to ethanol and other useful products is an important area that holds promise for renewable energy production.  This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR* Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) award focuses on developing catalysts and technologies for the efficient conversion of lignin into fuels and useful chemicals.  Research groups from the University of Kansas (KU) and the University of South Carolina at Columbia (USC) are collaborating in this project.  This collaboration synergistically combines expertise of in catalyst synthesis, advanced characterization, and computational work to design novel catalysts and develop enabling research tools for the separation of useful products from lignin.  The project will provide multidisciplinary training for a postdoc and six graduate students and leverage existing Research Experience for Undergraduates and Teachers (REU, RET) programs as well as Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Rational Catalyst Synthesis at USC to engage undergraduates, K-12 teachers, and industry professionals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;This multidisciplinary work aimed at improving catalyst designs and chemical separation methods for converting biomass into fuels has four integrated research thrusts: (1) synthesis and characterization of catalyst systems based on nanoparticulate metals supported on different substrates; (2) study of catalyst surface properties and reaction intermediates; (3) experiments to understand the catalytic conversion kinetics of biomass model molecules and lignin; and (4) computational simulations to interpret experimental results and provide guidance for the design of new, efficient catalysts.  The project combines expertise at the Center for Renewable Fuels at USC and the Center of Environmentally Beneficial Catalyst at KU for the synthesis, characterization, and computational modeling of heterogeneous catalysts for the depolymerization of lignin compounds into cyclic hydrocarbons.  Systematic experimental and computational studies will be performed to understand catalytic mechanisms, reaction kinetics, and to design and evaluate efficient catalysts for lignin deconstruction.  The project employs a team approach to mentor junior faculty, postdoc, and students and offers opportunities to discuss topics such as time management, work-life balance, grant writing, strategic planning, leadership training, and facilitate activities on intellectual property management, lab safety, ethics, outreach and communicating science to the public.  An evaluator provides formative and summative assessment of the project's progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research</AbstractNarration>

The results indicate that both Pd and support acidity are essential to form aromatic intermediates.

Such a hybrid palladium catalyst was able to achieve complete selectivity for hydrodeoxygenation of aromatics without observable ring hydrogenation.

The experimental/computational collaboration between USC and KU confirmed prolonged molecular integrity of the catalyst and sustained binding of the catalyst to the oxide surface allowing for catalyst recycling.&nbsp;</p> <p>Versatile Zr-based mesoporous silicates with tunable Lewis acidity were synthesized to depolymerize industrially sourced lignin with stable activity in a continuous reactor.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition,<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span>lignins from various sources (alkaline, organosolv and milled lignin) were converted to bio-based prepolymers suitable for making resins and plastics by fast ozonolysis of the lignin solution (in acetic acid/formic acid solutions) in a spray reactor to partially break up the lignin into low molecular weight aromatics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such endogenous aromatics are then grafted on to the macromolecular lignin structure by acidification with sulfuric acid.&nbsp;&nbsp;This technology converts &gt;95% of the lignin to prepolymers.&nbsp;&nbsp;These heterogenous and hybrid catalysts open up new avenues for developing biomass conversion catalysts.&nbsp;</p> <p>New&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>&nbsp;reaction cells and a modulation excitation spectroscopy (MES) methodology were developed for characterization of reaction intermediates in biomass conversion catalysts.

This library has been used to reproduce and interpret many characterization experiments, and it has provided important guidance to avoid misinterpretation of these measurements.

The experimental/computational collaboration between USC and KU confirmed prolonged molecular integrity of the catalyst and sustained binding of the catalyst to the oxide surface allowing for catalyst recycling.   Versatile Zr-based mesoporous silicates with tunable Lewis acidity were synthesized to depolymerize industrially sourced lignin with stable activity in a continuous reactor.  In addition, lignins from various sources (alkaline, organosolv and milled lignin) were converted to bio-based prepolymers suitable for making resins and plastics by fast ozonolysis of the lignin solution (in acetic acid/formic acid solutions) in a spray reactor to partially break up the lignin into low molecular weight aromatics.  Such endogenous aromatics are then grafted on to the macromolecular lignin structure by acidification with sulfuric acid.  This technology converts &gt;95% of the lignin to prepolymers.  These heterogenous and hybrid catalysts open up new avenues for developing biomass conversion catalysts.   New in situ reaction cells and a modulation excitation spectroscopy (MES) methodology were developed for characterization of reaction intermediates in biomass conversion catalysts. Operando diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) with pyridine probes confirmed that the high Zr-KIT-5 activity in lignin depolymerization was due to strong Lewis acid sites. Employing ethanol dehydration on supported Co/Al2O3 catalyst as a probe reaction, a novel operando MES-DRIFTS technique was demonstrated to correlate activity, acid site density and surface hydrophobicity.  This technique also revealed mechanistic insights on the catalyst surface by identifying adsorbed ethanol, ethoxide species and terminal/bridging hydroxyls on Al2O3 surface as reaction intermediates.

Direct collaborations with the experimental groups in the CRAFT team at KU and USC resulted in the discovery and characterization of novel heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of lignin into commodity chemicals.   Broader impacts:  Catalysts developed in this program have broad applications in the production of renewable fuels and chemicals. The ozonolysis/acidification technology is being further developed with an industrial partner to transform plastics manufacturing using lignin as a renewable feedstock. Such product diversification will significantly enhance the economic viability of biorefineries.  Blueprints for new instrumentation were broadly shared in publications to enable other researchers to characterize surface events and species in catalysts via dynamic studies, including a DRIFTS/MES technique, aimed at catalyst discovery.  The advances made in computational modeling will be applicable broadly to the rational development of heterogeneous catalysts based on amorphous solid supports.      The CRAFT project adopted a mutual mentoring model to augment traditional mentoring. Early career faculty and postdoctoral researchers had multiple mentors, including the lead PIs, senior scientists, industry practitioners and the Education/Outreach Director. Thanks to the effectiveness of the mentoring program, CRAFT assistant professors made significant accomplishments and were promoted with tenure.  Two of them received NSF CAREER awards.  One led a successful collaborative Department of Energy proposal to develop algorithms for machine learning.  The teaching postdoctoral fellow transitioned to a University faculty position while another early career researcher (non-faculty) was hired by a major chemical company.   CRAFT graduate students learned about related disciplines, using scientific instruments available at USC and KU, making polished presentations, and mentoring students at the next level down.  Several of them enrolled in a multidisciplinary course entitled Industrial Development of Catalytic Processes that deals with the development of innovative, sustainable catalytic processes.   The program thus produced a diverse cadre of uniquely trained engineers and scientists for the future workforce, including several from underrepresented groups.
