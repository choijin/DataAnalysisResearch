<AbstractNarration>The research in the areas of explosives detection and gunshot residue detection has demonstrated a high sensitivity of the device making it applicable for the collection of low concentration volatiles across a range of applications.  The proposed technology (Capillary Microextractor of Volatiles, CMV) was developed for the detection of forensic related compounds including drugs, explosive residues, ignitable liquid residues and gunshot residues. CMV is an inexpensive way to bring sophisticated analytical chemistry capabilities to everyone. Potential applications of the CMV include an active learning toolkit to teach middle and high-school students the science of sampling and detection of small quantities of volatiles in our environment and will include a social network that connects users and provides air quality data around the world. Environmental applications include the use of CMV to sample air suspected of containing hazardous chemicals in the air we breathe, including carcinogens. Biomedical applications include the use of CMV to sample human breath to detect disease markers in a consumer kit, for the first time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CMV device is composed of sorbent-coated glass microfibers with an ultra-high surface area that can absorb volatiles when air is dynamically sampled through the device. The CMV is small (2cm x 2mm), inexpensive and very easy to use to sample and pre-concentrate sub-ng quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from air in less than 1 minute. The CMV is easily coupled to a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and the interpretation of the analytical results can be standardized for specific applications including indoor air quality monitoring, forensic analysis, monitoring of chemical exposure and analysis of breath biomarkers for medical diagnosis and disease monitoring. The commercial advantages of CMV include single-use, simple and inexpensive sampling of ambient air or breath, where very low levels of target compounds are present. The CMV will also be marketed as a research laboratory consumable to scientists for air sampling. Specific applications will be developed for use by the general public that include analytical services and interpretation of results in order to make analytical chemistry more accessible to everyone interested in conducting air sampling. This team plans to market very specific application test kits for monitoring volatile compounds in indoor air, as educational tools to teach chemistry and for human breath air testing.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The I-Corps award allowed for the team consisting of Dr. Natasha Kreitals (Entrepreneurial Lead), Digno Caballero (IM) and Professor Jose Almirall (PI) to participate in the NSF I-Corps curriculum in July and August of 2015. Dr. Kreitals, a visiting postdoctoral research fellow, joined the International Forensic Research Institute and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Florida International University in January 2015 to conduct research on air sampling. The utility of capillary microextraction of volatiles (CMV, <strong>Patent No. US 9,267,866 B2 Awarded in Feb. 23, 2016</strong>) for sampling and preconcentration of volatiles associated with drugs, explosives, gun shot residue and bacteria has been previously demonstrated [<strong>1-6</strong>] and the I-Corps award permitted the customer discovery process for consumer-based applications of the CMV invention. For example, in-home testing for the detection of indoor air pollutants, mold or termites, would provide residents with the means to reduce their exposure to harmful compounds in the home and workplace. The high sensitivity of the technology also provides good analytical resolution for other scientific and some biomedical applications. This is particularly important for applications requiring air analysis where VOCs are present in low concentrations. Ongoing research into the development of a non-invasive disease diagnostic tool indicates volatile markers may provide for early detection of diseases such as cancer, lung disease and communicable diseases [<strong>7</strong>]. The I-Corps team conducted 160 interviews (149 in person) as part of the customer discovery. The entrepreneurial lead travelled outside the state of Florida on two occasions to meet with stakeholders and collect data to support the assumptions laid out in the business model canvas, in particular, the assumptions related to the value proposition of CMV to the relevant audience. In addition, I-Corps funding permitted for the creation of a minimum viable product (MVP, see figure 1) and the testing of the MVP within the consumer application space resulting from the customer discovery process. The decision at the end of the customer discovery process was to start a new venture (Air Chemistry, Inc.) with an aim to commercialize the CMV technology for consumer applications.</p> <p>References</p> <p>1.
