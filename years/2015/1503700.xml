<AbstractNarration>Abstract (Keel, 1503700): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for the Eighteenth Riviere-Fabes Symposium in Analysis and PDE, to be held at the University of Minnesota from April 17 to April 19, 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, fluid mechanics, optimal transport, geometry in high dimensions and Banach spaces. The confirmed speakers are  Alessio Figalli, Nader Masmoudi, Vitali Milman and Laure Saint-Raymond. The award  gives young researchers without other funding the opportunity to participate at the conference.  The organizing committee plans to strive to make this funding opportunity known to the target groups by mailing lists, posters and advertisements in professional organizations.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This sponsored project helped bring over 30 young postdocs and graduate students in the mathematical sciences to the 18th Riviere-Fabes Symposium in Analysis and PDE at the University of Minnesota in April 2015.  The aim of the project was to promote the propogation of new ideas in Analysis and PDE through this Symposium, where four leading researchers gave two lectures each over the course of three days.  The symposium schedule allowed for informal discussion outside the lecture hall, as did the on-site lunch and conference banquet.  The sponsored funds were especially directed at groups currently underrepresented at the graduate and posdoctoral levels in the mathematical sciences, especially women.  The symposium website was used to help collect all material related to the weekend - from travel information to the archiving of the slides used by the speakers in their talks.   In this way the organizers hope the website might be interesting also to mathematicians and scientists  who were unable to attend the meeting.  The symposium speakers reported several fundamental advances in Analysis and PDE which impact not only mathematics but also allied fields in Engineering and Physics, for example.    Intellectual Merit:  The fields advanced by the speakers at this symposium and reported in their talks include several fundamental areas of Analysis and PDE and as such the symposum advanced the mathematical sciences through the dissemination of the ideas behind these new results.    Broader Impact:  The project funds targetted only graduate students and postdocs, with special effort made to attract populations underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.  The project  therefore aimed to impact the training of young mathematicians.  The project also aimed to increase the opportunity for discussion and exposure to fields in mathematics that directly impact disciplines beyond  mathematics.
