<AbstractNarration>Maintaining social order also depends on ordinary citizens perceiving that the exercise of legal authority is legitimate -- that is, deserving deference even in the absence of extrinsic (deterrence-based) compliance motivations. When authorities are viewed as legitimate, citizens have an enhanced intrinsic motivation to comply with the law and to cooperate with those who enforce it. This research tackles two key questions. What features of enforcement institutions bestow legitimacy on authorities? And what are the consequences of legitimacy for citizen behavior? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It employs both laboratory and lab-in-the-field experiments, the latter of which enhance policy relevance by focusing on subjects from low-income, mostly minority communities, whose experiences of law enforcement may differ from those of typical student subject pools.  Assessing the causal antecedents of legitimate authority is a surprisingly tricky empirical problem. Given that citizens' compliance with the law may be motivated both by deterrence and by citizens' perceptions of legitimacy, how can legitimacy be measured in a way that is separate from citizens' anticipations of punishment? This work employs novel experiments designed to decouple the relationship between citizens' extrinsic (deterrence) and intrinsic (legitimacy-based) motivations.</AbstractNarration>

We will submit a final overall project outcomes report when the NYU component is also completed.  The Yale portion of the funding was focused on developing experimental stimuli for studying political legitimacy and testing these stimuli before bringing them to novel subject populations.

We have worked to design both traditional behavioral laboratory experiments in which players interact in real time and non-simultaneous play analogs of these game that are suitable for fielding using online survey platforms.  Substantively, it is widely understood that deterrence alone is insufficient to explain compliance with prescribed laws and social norms.
