<AbstractNarration>A working group of the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) will develop and deploy cyberinfrastructure for mining seismic wavefields through data intensive computing techniques in order to extend similarity search for earthquake detection to massive data sets. Similarity search has been used to understand the mechanics of tectonic tremor, transform our understanding of the depth dependence of faulting, illuminate diffusion within aftershock seismicity, and reveal new insights into induced earthquakes. These results were achieved with modest data volumes ? from ~ 10 seismic stations spanning ~ 10 km ? yet they increased the number of detected earthquakes by a factor of 10 to 100. This geoinformatics project will develop the cyberinfrastructure required to enable high-sensitivity studies of earthquake processes through the discovery of previously undetected seismic events within massive data volumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This goal of this project is to develop a cyberinfrastructure to mine seismic waveform data. The effort will develop methods and hardware to use coherent signal processing on very large waveform databases to detect, locate and characterize events that cannot be detected by standard network operations (detection of single arrivals, association, location by optimization). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodology involves the use of a network-based approach for earthquake detection, especially weak and unusual events that in the current method of treating signals individually go unreported. The PIs will work on the large T and the large N problem, where large T is using waveform similarity of multiple events over time to detect earthquakes over long periods of time; and the large N is using waveform similarity of single events over space as recorded on a dense seismic array with up to thousands of stations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will greatly increase knowledge of the number of seismic sources of various kinds and potentially identify patterns in earthquake occurrence that could inform hazard and near-term rupture forecasting. Seismicity induced by human activities is an emerging problem that adversely affects energy options for the 21st century, including shale gas development, enhanced geothermal energy, and carbon sequestration. A more complete view of seismicity related to these activities is essential to managing the risks they pose.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Earthquake scientists generally use seismic data recorded by high-quality seismic sensors to detect and locate earthquakes. Typically these seismic events can be recorded by up to tens or hundreds of seismic sensors. In recent years, development of sensor technologies allow relatively cheap sensors to be deployed at up to thousands per experiment (e.g., large-N arrays), resulting in massive amount of data and a full capture of the seismic wavefield propagation (Figure 1a).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This collaborative project develops computer programs and techniques needed to discover previously unknown seismic earthquakes within massive data volumes collected from seismic networks ranging from tens to thousands of sensors, and spans up to tens of years. Our research activities in the past two years mainly focused on the following directions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We developed a new method for seismic event detection that can be applied to large?N arrays (Li et al., Sci. Rep. 2018). The method is based on a new detection function called local similarity to measure how similar a signal is recorded at a target station and its nearest four neighbors (Figure 1b). Using the 5200?station Long Beach nodal array, we showed that local similarity functions averaged over the entire array help to detect very weak events below noise levels with high confidence (Figure 2). We applied this method to one-week of recording around the 03/11/2011 magnitude 9.1 Tohoku?Oki earthquake in Japan to detect local and distant events. In the high-frequency 5?10 Hz range, we detected many local events likely generated by natural and anthropogenic sources. However, we did not find a clear increase in local seismicity during and following the Tohoku?Oki mainshock. In the long period range (&lt; 1 s), we detected many seismic events, likely corresponding aftershocks from the Tohoku?Oki mainshock region.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We also applied the same method to the 2016 IRIS community wavefield experiment (Figure 3), and found many long-duration, long-period tremor-like events during its one-month deployment (Li et al., SRL, 2018). Using array analysis, we found that the source locations and waveform characteristics of these events are consistent with train-generated seismic signals from the nearby Union Pacific railway. Additional evidence includes amplitude decay away from the railway track, and similarities in frequency?time contents with other confirmed train-generated seismic signals (Figure 4). This study highlights the need of dense-array observations to distinguish between natural and man-made seismic signals.</p> <p>We have applied our GPU?based waveform matching methods around the occurrence times of several large earthquakes around the world to detect foreshocks and early aftershocks (Li et al., GJI, 2018; Meng et al., JGR, 2018), as well as detecting microseismicity associated with a injection?induced earthquake sequence in central Oklahoma (Chen et al., JGR, 2018). We detected more than 3000 events are detected within 35 day after the 2015 Mw7.5 Hindu Kush intermediate-depth earthquake (Figure 5), as compared with 42 listed in the Advanced National Seismic System catalogue (or 196 in the International Seismological Centre catalogue). The aftershock sequence generally follows the Omori?s law, similar to shallow earthquake sequences. We also apply the recently developed double-pair double-difference technique to relocate all detected aftershocks. Most of them are located to the west of the hypocentre of the main shock (Figure 6), consistent with the westward propagation of the main-shock rupture. The aftershocks outline a nearly vertical southward dipping plane, which matches well with one of the nodal planes of the main shock. We conclude that the aftershock sequence of this intermediate-depth earthquake shares many similarities with those for shallow earthquakes and infer that there are some common mechanisms responsible for shallow and intermediate-depth earthquakes.</p> <p>PI Peng has given his matched filter tutorial at several institutions between 2016-2018. In addition, they shared the resulting earthquake catalogs as online supplementary material of several recent publications. They are also in the process of making their CPU and GPU version of the matched filter code available through peer-reviewed publications.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/12/2019<br>      Modified by: Zhigang&nbsp;Peng</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1551022/1551022_10422849_1549986031383_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1551022/1551022_10422849_1549986031383_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Flow chart for the local similarity procedure"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1551022/1551022_10422849_1549986031383_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Flow chart for the local similarity procedure"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Flowchart and schematic diagrams of the Long-Beach large-N array and local similarity detection.</div> <div class="imageCredit">After Li et al.
