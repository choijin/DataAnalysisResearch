<AbstractNarration>With masses millions to billions times that of our Sun, the strong gravitational influence of supermassive black holes can heat nearby gas so that it outshines an entire galaxy of stars, and slingshot material outward at relativistic speeds. They exist at the centers of almost every massive galaxy, and they may play a significant role in regulating rates of star formation. Our project aims to produce the most realistic simulations to-date of two of the most dramatic events they can make: the inspiral and merger of two orbiting supermassive black holes and the tidal disruption of stars. Both were once thought to be unobservable, but the advent of very large astronomical surveys sensitive to transients have led to the discovery of numerous tidal disruptions and promise the discovery of many mergers. The prospect of extensive observational data make both very hot topics. The great advantage of this program is the opportunity it provides to integrate many existing research programs into a larger community of scientists, students, and the general public. It will foster crossdisciplinary collaborations among undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty at the Univ. of Tulsa, Johns Hopkins Univ., NASA/GSFC, and Rochester Institute of Technology. Through such a network, our previous highly successful outreach programs will be able to reach an even larger and more diverse audience. For instance, S. Noble (PI) will continue to speak about hot physics topics with the 100-200 high school students that attend the monthly ?Journal Club? event sponsored by his department, and will work with his collaborators on building similar activities at their institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major goal of this project is to make specific predictions of electromagnetic signatures of circumbinary accretion and tidal disruption events that will allow astronomers to identify, based solely on EM observations, these spectacular events using HST (optical), JWST (IR), Chandra (X-ray), and ISS-Lobster (X-ray), as well as ground based instrumentation such as the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, which is already in operation, or the planned Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Such identifications will be a tremendous aid in refining our estimates of the population of merging supermassive black holes, both for estimating the numbers of potential gravitational wave targets and for evaluating the impact of black hole mergers on galaxy evolution. Our simulations on Blue Waters will employ a number of new computational developments needed to achieve the most realistic simulations of these systems to date. They include an adaptive load balancer to evenly distribute runs with nonuniform costs, and a multi-patch system for evolving the magnetohydrodynamics equations on different coordinate domains. It is our intent to make the latter tool publicly available for use in other magnetohydrodynamics codes. Our scientific results will also have a wide-reaching impact on the astrophysical community, both theoretically and observationally. We will release detailed spectra and simulation data for use by observers and future mission development teams. This work comes at a particularly opportune time, as the fields of time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy are growing rapidly.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Observing electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves from supermassive binary black and their environments promises to provide important new information about both strong-field gravity and galaxy evolution.  Since little theoretical understanding about the details of these accreting binary black hole systems exists, our project's aim is to continuously advance the realism and rigor with which to simulate these systems. The problem is complicated because dynamical general relativity, plasma physics, and radiation physics all must be calculated together over vast spatial and temporal scales.   This award provided the necessery computer resources on the NCSA's Blue Water System to perform the first realistic calculations electromagnetic spectrum of accreting supermassive black holes in the inspiral regime  Realistic accretion disk simulations are particularly challenging as they involve a multitude of physical processes interacting over large dynamic ranges in space and time.  In actual systems, gas is collected at scales a million times larger than the black holes themselves yet many cells per black hole width must be used to capture the relativistic plasma dynamics in their vicinity.  Our predictions are critical to the success of electromagnetic searches, such as (e.g. PANSTARRS, Catalina Realtime Transient Survey, LSST, VLBA, etc) and source characterization leading up to the launch of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).  This past year we have finished performing the first magnetohydrodynamics simulations of black holes with their own mini-disks surrounded by a circumbinary disk.  We have recently finished creating the first detailed electromagnetic predictions consistent with simulations using post-production radiation transport.  The award also provided critical support for the training of three postdoctoral researchers and a graduate student at RIT.
