<AbstractNarration>This exploratory project is to increase the ability of robots to plan and act on their own in order to safely complete high-level tasks. Whether the task is to search, inspect, manipulate objects, or navigate to target destinations, it generally involves abstractions into discrete, logical actions, where each discrete action often requires complex collision-free motions in order to be implemented. This project establishes a unified framework for handling the discrete and continuous spaces that arise in these problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crucial to this goal, as robots are deployed into less and less structured environments, is their ability to reason and plan at multiple levels of discrete and continuous abstractions. This research makes it possible to specify sophisticated tasks using Planning Domain Definition Languages and automatically compute a sequence of control inputs such that the resulting trajectory satisfies the PDDL task specification, avoids collisions with obstacles, and obeys the motion dynamics and the constraints imposed by physics-based interactions with the environment.</AbstractNarration>

This project developed computational methods that make it possible to specifythe task in a high-level structured language, namely Planning Domain DefinitionLanguage (PDDL) and automatically plan the motions that enable the robot to accomplish the task while avoiding collisions. PDDL makes it possible to express sophisticated tasks bycombining propositions and action schemas through logic.   The technical innovation in these methods is unifying planning at multiple levelsof discrete and continuous abstractions by coupling sampling-basedmotion planning in continuous spaces with AI planning in discrete spaces. The key insight is tosimultaneously search and selectively explore the discrete space of actions and the continuous spaceof feasible motions.    Our methods have made it possible to plan for sophisticated tasks, such as picking objects from some locations and delivering them at other locations, while reducing as much as possible the timeto do so.

As a result, by providing an efficient motion and task planning framework, this project made significant progress towards increasing the autonomy of robotic systems, which could result in better use of resources, increased productivity, andenhanced safety in applications ranging from search-and-rescuemissions, exploration of unknown or hazardous environments, autonomousdriving to surgical robotics.
