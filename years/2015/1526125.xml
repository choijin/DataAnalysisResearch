<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of the US Ignite Initiative is to break a fundamental deadlock: there is insufficient investment in gigabit applications that can take advantage of advanced network infrastructure because such infrastructure is rare and dispersed. And conversely, there is a lack of broad availability of advanced broadband infrastructure for open experimentation and innovation because there are few advanced applications and services to justify it. US Ignite applications are focused on national priority areas of advanced manufacturing, clean energy and transportation, cyber learning, health IT, and public safety/emergency preparedness. Many of the applications under development in this program build on NSF-funded advanced networking and computational infrastructure developed as part of the NSF GENI program. All of the projects demonstrate the value of advanced networking. This project supports the 3rd annual US Ignite Application Summit, an event that will demonstrate the next generation applications currently being developed, educate a broad community on the potential for next-generation application capabilities and recruit cities and individuals for the next round of application development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Applications Summit is being held March 24-25, 2015 at George Washington University's Marvin Center in Washington, DC and the Hilton Crystal City Hotel in Arlington, VA. Co-location with the GENI Engineering Conference (GEC 22) and meetings of the Open Grid Forum (OGF) and Global Lambda Integrated Facility (GLIF) will maximize the potential for advancing technology, education, and outreach.  This project supports academic and student participation in the Summit, along with the costs of hosting the event and broadly disseminating its results throughout the advanced networking research and gigabit application development communities.</AbstractNarration>

The event brought together developers, industry, communities, government, foundations and universities working with SDN, cloud computing, and gigabit networks. US Ignite and GENI, with the help of our partners at the National Science Foundation and Mozilla Foundation, showcased new next-generation applications running on deeply programmable cyberinfrastructure that transcends the current Internet and has the potential to completely transform how we live, work, learn, and play..  The diverse group heard from communities with deployed advanced networks and gave participants a "first" look at the transformative power of next-generation technologies. These "firsts" were "things" that had not previously been demonstrated or seen before, such as:    4K      gigabit-enabled digital microscopy, whereby Summit attendees could see a      live 4K image of a specimen under a microscope in Los Angeles and      manipulate that microscope from the Summit location in Washington, DC;   A      connected-vehicle demonstration showing real-time emergency responders in      Madison, Wisconsin simultaneously using drone camera footage, on-board      vehicle cameras, and remote sensing devices to accelerate the response to      a simulated incident; and A real-time      programming simulator called the "Mars Rover," a collaborative interactive      environment that teaches math and programming in a fun and rewarding 3D      gaming experience. UT Dallas,      SAP America, Hasso-Plattner Institute, US Ignite, and University of      Victoria   researchers demonstrate      distributed collaborative scientific visualization system and distributed      aerosol pollution viewer    The highlights were the 30 application demonstrations. To recognize the greatest achievements, US Ignite presented the following Summit awards:  1.         Best Use of a Gigabit: Multipoint Connected Collaboration, free, open source high definition, high fidelity, point-to-point video conferencing solution over gigabit networks using commodity PC and Mac hardware -  2.         App Most Read for the App Store: Adagio, a cloud-based audio remixing tool that will reach national and international audiences thanks to the GENI rack and its connections to other leading universities and smart cities    3.         Highest Impact Application: Virtual Energy Center: Collaborative Exploration in Networked VR Environments and Application to Remotely-Guided Classroom, an educational virtual reality environment that models a real alternative energy center, seeking to inspire and motivate the STEM workforce of tomorrow through exciting Virtual Reality approaches ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
