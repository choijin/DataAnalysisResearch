<AbstractNarration>Software defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a topic of exploration for addressing the growing challenges in complex traffic and topology management in environments such as large-scale data centers, private wide-area networks (WANs), and virtual hosting environments. Unfortunately, little is understood regarding the security challenges that SDN-enabled WANs introduce. The need for modeling the spectrum of adversarial challenges early in the design stage of this next generation of networking is critical for avoiding an explosion of new exploitable vulnerabilities that will likely plague SDN WANs and hinder their adoption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project facilitates a leap in our understanding of the security challenges that arise across SDN-enabled WAN topologies.  It focuses on the creation of a multi-site (and reproducible) distributed security testing infrastructure for several SDN-WAN topologies, as well as the development of adversarial models against each topology.  The testbed incorporates strong perimeter isolation and environment recovery services.  It instantiates a range of SDN WAN topologies, and facilitates the integration and evaluation of security extensions to the SDN infrastructure itself. The project will also produce a pluggable software-testing framework of exploit methods across the attack surface of the various SDN-WAN topologies instantiated within this testbed. The project will result in an early assessment of concrete security threats and potential solutions that can inform and influence SDN standards, enhance commercial solutions, drive deeper threat assessments of these emerging networks, and stimulate the networking and Information Security (INFOSEC) research communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project sought to provide critical and timely support to the growing momentum toward software-defined wide area networking (SDN/WANs). This included the development of the first international SDN test environment for conducting adversarial modeling and advanced network security research for several emerging SDN wide-area network (SDN-WAN) topologies.  We created and jointly deployed the distributed testbed at SRI International in California and at KAIST University in South Korea.  Through this testbed we examined a wide range of SDN-WAN adversary models for various SDN-WAN topologies, and produce datasets for security research.  A second aspect of our project was to explore a wide range of adversary models that arise as SDNs are integrated into wide-area network architectures.    Our accomplishments are summarized as follows:  We explored solutions to the performance challenges that arise in SDN/NFV security services, which are due to network path extensions and complex forwarding rules that result from implementing traffic steering and service chaining. The root cause of those performance impacts occur because network packets must be detoured to each virtualized security service, increasing network propagation delays and the complexity of the OpenFlow switch flow tables.  We created an SDN data plane architecture that natively supports security services as a set of OpenFlow actions.

We have captured the results of our study in a paper that is currently under submission for publication at an academic INFOSEC conference venue.  We also designed an SDN security evaluation framework, called DELTA, which can automatically instantiate attack cases against SDN elements across diverse environments, and which may assist in uncovering unknown security problems within an SDN deployment. Motivated by security testing tools in the traditional network security domain, DELTA represents the first security assessment tool for SDN environments.   Our DELTA security assessment framework was published in the Proceedings of the ISOC Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS).   The paper is entitled DELTA: A Security Assessment Framework for Software-Defined Networks.   The new attack scenarios exposed by DELTA have been reported to the Open Networking Foundation (ONF), the standards body dedicated to the promotion of SDN and defining the OpenFlow protocol. The results of our analysis have also informed our collaborations with the ONF Security Working Group in drafting white papers defining best practices for securing SDN environments.  DELTA is now an open-source project that is hosted as one of ONF?s official open SDN projects, and is being used for security conformance benchmarking of SDN devices for researchers and SDN industry players.   In addition to the DELTA conference paper, we published a journal article in IEEE Transactions on Networking, entitled Flow Wars: Systemizing the Attack Surface and Defenses in Software-Defined Networks.  This paper provides an in-depth assessment of the vectors for potential abuse or attack that arise in OpenFlow network stacks.   We conducted a comprehensive survey of possible methods for abuse or exploit of an example SDN stack that is implemented in OpenFlow. We then organized these vulnerabilities within the well-known CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability) model, assessing the severity of these attacks by replicating them in our NSF-sponsored physical SDN testbed, and evaluated them against three popular SDN controllers.   The journal paper provides an in-depth categorization of 22 separate vectors for abuse or direct attack, which arise from diverse interaction avenues that are supported by popular OpenFlow network implementations. Furthermore, we validated the feasibility and impact of these abuse and attack scenarios through implementation and testing, including 12 novel SDN attack scenarios.  Finally, one area of significant relevance to the design and management of emerging SDN environments is the integration of virtualization technologies, such as containers.  We explored the challenges of extending our SDN security solutions to container-based applications and found that there are several critical weaknesses in container-based network security isolation that cannot be addressed by network-based SDN security services. With respect to virtualization technologies that exist in large-scale SDN environments we examined two significant security issues that container environments must address when container applications are compromised: topology leakage and traffic exposure.

This security extension introduces a container-aware network flow control that restricts the ability of a compromised container to access the network operations of other containers. It also provides secure forwarding mechanisms, eliminating non-local traffic exposure to attackers.   We have captured our results in a paper that is currently under submission for publication at an academic INFOSEC conference venue.
