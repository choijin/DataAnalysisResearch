<AbstractNarration>This award uses funds, under the auspices of the Rapid Response Research (RAPID)concept, to maintain long-term monitoring sites at Genovesa and Bainbridge crater lakes, Galápagos to capture the 2015/2016 El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event and identify the impact of a potentially strong El Niño events on key Galápagos lake sediment archives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sediment records from Genovesa and Bainbridge have provided long records of past changes in tropical Pacific climate variability, particularly variability associated with the ENSO. However, existing hypotheses for the impact of climate variability on sedimentation in these lakes have not been field tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2009, the PI and her research collaborators deployed weather stations and in-lake sondes, as well as simple sediment traps, to test existing hypotheses for sedimentation in these lakes.  These instruments have produced nearly continuous daily data on the climate and limnology of the crater lakes from December 2009 to present, a period that covers more than five full seasonal cycles and includes a weak El Niño, a moderate El Niño, and sustained La Niña conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research results to date have prompted a re-thinking of published interpretations of lake-based climate reconstructions.  However, the real-time monitoring has not captured the impact of a strong El Niño event on the climate, limnology and sedimentation of these lakes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher argues that it is therefore critical that she be able to isolate the impact of the strong 2015/16 El Niño on sedimentation in these lakes to test competing hypotheses for the impact of ENSO events on sedimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the funds will be used to support two trips for a team of three researchers to collect data and redeploy long-term monitoring instruments at Bainbridge and Genovesa crater lakes prior to and following the 2015/2016 El Niño event. This data will be used to address two key research questions regarding sedimentation in these key archives: (1) What is the signature of strong El Niño events? and  (2) What is the primary driver of carbonate precipitation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential broader impacts include providing a long-term monitoring dataset and improving reconstructions of the strength and frequency of ENSO events in the past, which will help constrain the range of variability observed in the region. This project will support an early-career female researcher and provide educational and research opportunities for U.S. and Ecuadorian graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary of activities and findings:  This funded project aimed to assess the impact of the 2015/2016 El Ni&ntilde;o event on the climate and lake conditions of two key Galapagos climate archives: Bainbridge and Genovesa Crater Lakes.  Sediments accumulating at the bottom of these lakes have provided records of Galapagos climate and the frequency of El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a events over the past ~6000 years.  Motivated by the importance of these lakes for our understanding of climate in the tropical Pacific Ocean, we have been monitoring the link between climate, lake conditions and the physical and chemical properties of the sediments accumulating in these lakes since 2009.  However, the 2015/2016 El Ni&ntilde;o event provided the first opportunity to assess the impact of a large El Ni&ntilde;o event on these lake systems.   This RAPID funding supported 2 trips for a team of three to collect data and re-deploy long-term monitoring instruments at Bainbridge and Genovesa crater lakes prior to and following the 2015/2016 El Ni&ntilde;o event.  By allowing us to isolate the effects of a strong El Ni&ntilde;o event on the sediments accumulating in the lakes, we were able to directly test two competing hypotheses for what drives the formation of white calcium carbonate (CaCO3) layers in the lakes.  Earlier work suggested that these layers formed during El Ni&ntilde;o events, while our monitoring results (now including the large 2015-16 event) suggest the opposite: that these layers are deposited in these lake systems during cool, dry, productive La Ni&ntilde;a events.  Based on this new interpretation, lake sediments accumulating at the bottom of these lakes may provide a record of the frequency of both El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a events over thousands of years.       Broader Impacts:  This project supported an early-career female PI and provided valuable field experience for 2 Ecuadorian masters students, 1 new PhD student, and 2 postdoctoral researchers. The samples collected during this trip have also seeded a new collaborative geobiology project investigating stratification, hypoxia and biological productivity in these lakes.  This project will provide the basis of at least one new PhD student?s thesis, whose decision to pursue a PhD was motivated in part by his field experiences during these trips.   The PI also communicated the results from this RAPID project to the general public over the past year. Throughout both trips (Nov 2015 &amp; May 2016), the PI posted on her blog site (http://dianemthompson.blogspot.com/) to show the team?s field experience, observations, and findings.  These blogs also placed this latest El Ni&ntilde;o in the context of previous events using historical records (e.g., family letters, anecdotes and papers) obtained from local collaborators on the islands.
