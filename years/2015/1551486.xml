<AbstractNarration>This award supports the Stochastic Networks Conference to be held June 20-24, 2016 at the University of California, San Diego. Information about the conference is available through the conference website at &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;          http://stochasticnetworks2016.ucsd.edu/ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2016 Stochastic Networks Conference will provide a key forum for researchers from different quantitative disciplines, including mathematics, probability, operations research, computer science, electrical, mechanical and industrial engineering, to come together to hear and discuss the latest research developments related to stochastic networks. The program includes a broad spectrum of leading researchers amongst the invited speakers, including some speakers who are junior researchers, underrepresented minorities or women, as well as senior researchers. Participant support will help early career researchers, underrepresented minorities and women attend the conference to discuss and present their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic networks is a multifaceted area of research concerned with the modeling, stability, control, performance, approximation, and design of networks which are subject to the effects of stochastic variability. Research in this area is strongly motivated by applications in diverse domains of science and engineering. Examples of application areas include telecommunications, computer networks, high-tech manufacturing systems, service networks, social and biological networks, and health care management. The study of stochastic networks gives rise to challenging and subtle mathematical problems, whose solution often requires an innovative combination of ideas and techniques from several branches of mathematics. Many of the above aspects will be discussed at the conference.</AbstractNarration>
