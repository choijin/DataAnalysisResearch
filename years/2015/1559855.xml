<AbstractNarration>This project is the continuation of an ongoing REU site at DIMACS (Rutgers University). Undergraduate students recruited from across the nation participate in summer research projects relating to foundations and applications of theoretical computer science. Each year, the program recruits 10 outstanding undergraduate students from diverse groups including women, underrepresented groups, and non-research institutions. A strong point of this site is the experience and expertise of the mentoring team, which has been able to produce valuable research experiences and excellent research publications in the past. Many past students have gone on to pursue successful research careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site offers a wide variety of projects ranging from theoretical topics such as circuit complexity, graph matching, and error-correcting codes to more applied topics such as robot planning, active learning, security and privacy. It also offers socially relevant projects such as food webs, analyzing immune-tumor interactions, and genome folding. Many of these are leading-edge research projects that not only develop students' research skills but also give them exposure to respective research areas. The students also benefit from DIMACS industry partners in the region. The project will lead to publishable research and contribute to building the future work force.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The DIMACS Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program prepares students to be part of the next generation of computer scientists and mathematical scientists, the most successful of whom will have the capacity to look both within and beyond the confines of computer science (CS) or the mathematical sciences (MS) for inspiration. Our program nurtures this capacity by exposing REU students to a broad range of CS topics, applied in contexts that range from bioinformatics to big data, but also cognizant of the need for foundational and potentially transformative theory. A particular emphasis of our program is on crossing boundaries -- between disciplines, between theory and practice, between academia and industry, and between nations -- to solve problems. We achieve this goal by involving mentors from different areas of CS and MS and even different disciplines, by integrating activities with nearby industry partners, and by involving graduate students as assistant mentors. In addition to students funded by this NSF grant, the DIMACS REU program includes additional students and collaborating programs that add cultural diversity and an international element.</p> <p>The broader impacts of our Research Experiences for Undergraduates program come from informing students about their future education and career choices and giving them the confidence and grounding to pursue and succeed in these choices. Our program enriches students by exposing them to the varied perspectives offered by different cultures, by different fields, by theory and application, and by industry and academia. DIMACS is a well established research center with many scientific activities (seminars, workshops, etc.), open to REU students, and with long-standing relationships with industrial partners. Each year of the program, students visit DIMACS industry partners to broaden their view of career possibilities.</p> <p>The intellectual merit of the DIMACS REU program lies primarily with the research projects introduced to students by their mentors. In addition, REU students were invited to participate in other activities at DIMACS, including workshops, seminars, and research meetings that are part of the rich intellectual life at DIMACS. We had 80 US undergraduate students in our DIMACS REU program between 2016 and 2018, 31 of whom were directly funded through this NSF site grant. Since 2016, project research has led to at least 11 publications co-authored by students funded by this NSF grant and their mentors and at least 10 presentations at regional, national, and international conferences. Students were mentored on research topics as varied as complexity in theoretical computer science, algorithmic applications in cancer research, graph theory, algorithmic fairness, robot planning, and bioinformatics.</p> <p>The scientific output of the students' work can be seen in the numerous publications of their original research in scientific journals or conference proceedings. For example, Michael Rudow (REU2016, U. Pennsylvania), mentored by Eric Allender (CS, Rutgers), published his work on the complexity of the minimum circuit size problem. The 2018 REU students Rahul Ilango (REU2018, Rutgers) and Neekon Vafa (REU2018, Harvard) also published their work with Eric Allender and presented their results in an international conference. Ondrej Maxian (REU2017, Case Western Reserve University) worked with Wilma Olson (Chemistry, Rutgers) to develop mathematical tools for the analysis of chromatin and presented his work at the ACS National Meeting. Andrea Burns (REU2017, Tulane University) was mentored by Waheed Bajwa (ECE, Rutgers) on a project that showed the advantage of using multimodal data in the classification of liquids using machine learning and image processing. This work was presented at the 2018 SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing Conference.</p> <p>Our program also includes an international component, where 6 Czech students participate in the REU program at Rutgers and 5 US students work in Prague for the last two weeks of the program, where they are mentored by local faculty and they have the chance to attend a research workshop. The response of the participating students is overwhelmingly positive and they all praise the experience of conducting research in another country.</p> <p>For most student participants in the program, this was their first introduction to a research environment in which they worked on open-ended problems that do not have a clear pathway to a predetermined solution. Most of our participants have gone on to, or are planning on going on to, graduate school. Many of them cite their DIMACS REU experience as a determining factor in their decision and in their later success. An evaluation by the Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline (CERP) that surveyed the computer science majors and minors in our 2017 program found: "Participants of the DIMACS REU program report satisfaction with their experience in the program, particularly regarding their research mentor. Participants also indicated a great deal of involvement with research projects, and felt their REU experience influenced the likelihood of pursuing a PhD and getting a job related to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science."</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/16/2019<br>      Modified by: Rebecca&nbsp;N&nbsp;Wright</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div
