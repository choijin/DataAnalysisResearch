<AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the growing focus on female empowerment in the developing world, many women remain largely excluded from the political process and a substantial gender gap in political participation persists today. Across the globe, women accounted for only 17% of members of parliament in 2009, up from 10% in 1995.  Evidence suggests that when women are actively engaged in politics, public goods are allocated differently and development outcomes improve.  This project seeks to understand better why women in developing countries are disengaged from politics and to identify the mechanisms through which the prevailing political gender gap is reduced. Contrary to seminal work in the U.S., the PI argues that low levels of women's political participation are not due to women's lack of economic resources. Instead this project evaluates two alternative explanations for women's lack of political participation: limited access to social networks outside of the household and a lack of exposure to the political system. To empirically fill this gap in our knowledge and test these hypotheses, the PI collects and uses both survey and experimental data from India, in coordination with the NGO Pradan, to identify the determinants of political engagement for rural women and evaluate whether access to social networks and political information increase women's political participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project evaluates two mechanisms aimed at increasing women's political participation. In doing so, the proposed research will address two principal questions: 1) Can providing political information and exposure through gender and politics trainings increase women's political participation? and 2) Can this political training activate social networks to further increase women's political participation and combat prevailing social norms limiting women's role in politics? These questions will be answered through a series of experiments: a natural experiment using a geographic regression discontinuity (GRD) design to identify the impact of social networks and a randomized control trial (RCT) to identify the effect of political exposure and its interactive effect with social networks. Random assignment of networks will be approximated using a GRD design, which leverages an arbitrary boundary to identify villages in which Pradan has operated and mobilized women into small groups. This allows for an estimation of the average impact of networks on women's political participation. For the RCT, a randomized gender and politics training intervention with the NGO Pradan, will provide women with information about the political system and their rights and entitlements within this system and will be directly exposed to existing political institutions, with the aim of reducing informational barriers to political participation. By providing this training on both sides of the GRD boundary, the RCT further tests the necessity of social networks for women's political participation and the ability for the gender and politics training to activate existing social networks and further generate political engagement.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>India is not only the largest democracy in the world but it has for the most part maintained democratic institutions for nearly 70 years. Yet we continue to see large swaths of the population excluded from politics. We have learned a lot from the study of the exclusion of lower caste citizens and ethnic minorities in India, but the gender gap in participation persists even when the caste gap has diminished. This project seeks to draw attention to the role of gender in local politics in India and begin to unpack the underlying causes of the political gender gap. While there are many factors that have contributed over time to women&rsquo;s exclusion from politics, and many possible paths to political inclusion, this project highlights two possible channels to political empowerment: gender-based economic networks and gender-oriented civics training targeted at women&rsquo;s groups. As a result, this project contributes to our understanding of women&rsquo;s political participation in India, but may also present an opportunity to shed light on the future of political inclusion in newer developing democracies. This research questions individualistic models of political behavior and instead demonstrates the importance of social ties, social capital and civic networks in explaining political behavior and understanding local politics. Finally, this project contributes to our understanding of women&rsquo;s role in moderating the relationship between the state and economic development.</p> <p>First, a principal reason behind our lack of understanding of women&rsquo;s political behavior in India is a lack of data, particularly for women. This project aims to fill this gap by collecting detailed data from 7,700 women and men in rural Madhya Pradesh on political behavior, policy preferences, community norms, and household economics and bargaining dynamics. This data provides critical insights into the gender gap in political participation &ndash; less than 25% of women from this sample report actively participating in politics as compared to more than 75% of their husbands.</p> <p>Additionally, while the gender gap in political participation is clear, the reasons behind women's persistently low levels of political participation in rural India remain murky. A first working paper from this study evaluates the impact of women's networks on women's political participation. This paper documents that women's social mobilization leads to significantly more political participation &ndash; women&rsquo;s likelihood of attending the village assembly meeting nearly doubled. It additionally shows that this intervention increased women&rsquo;s free mobility outside of the household but did not substantially improve women&rsquo;s empowerment in the household or reduce domestic violence.

These findings have major implications for the design and evaluation of development interventions targeted at women. In recent decades, there has been a continuing trend of targeting women as the beneficiaries of economic development programs and vast numbers of women have received economic transfers from state and non-government actors with the aim of economic empowerment.
