<AbstractNarration>The design, upgrade, and real-time operation of a power network are all contingent upon sev-&lt;br/&gt;eral optimization problems that are hard to solve due to two main reasons: (i) the nonlinearity&lt;br/&gt;induced by the laws of physics, and (ii) the presence of integer variables. The existing solvers&lt;br/&gt;for energy-related optimization problems either make potentially conservative approximations or&lt;br/&gt;deploy general-purpose local-search algorithms to handle the non-convexities, which may incur&lt;br/&gt;tens of billions of dollars annually. The general intractability of power optimization problems has&lt;br/&gt;a direct impact in the practice of energy efficiency, and this is arguably one of the most fundamen-&lt;br/&gt;tal issues that hold back the power engineering. The primary objective of this project is to address&lt;br/&gt;this non-convexity issue by developing high-performance optimization techniques that can be ap-&lt;br/&gt;plied to a broad set of nonlinear energy problems. This work is expected to produce significant&lt;br/&gt;breakthrough in nonlinear optimization at large and nonlinear energy optimization in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The results of this project can be utilized for the design, modernization, and&lt;br/&gt;operation of many power grids around the world. This project will have a significant impact on&lt;br/&gt;the power industry by revolutionizing their energymanagement systems, leading to the following&lt;br/&gt;immediate benefits: (i) reducing the electricity cost through a cheaper way of dispatching and&lt;br/&gt;delivering power, (ii) decreasing the likelihood of power outages by optimizing the reliability&lt;br/&gt;and robustness of the grid, and (iii) reducing gas emissions by optimally utilizing the sustainable&lt;br/&gt;energy. This project has major outreach activities for a local school, where more than 85% of the&lt;br/&gt;student population are significantly underrepresented in STEM-related fields. Management of &lt;br/&gt;nonlinearities in real time is especially important to the economics of trying to use more renewable&lt;br/&gt;energy sources; thus work on this challenge may be crucial to our ability to accomplish this in an&lt;br/&gt;affordable way.</AbstractNarration>
