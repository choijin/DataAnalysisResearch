<AbstractNarration>This CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award funds a new REU site focuses on cybersecurity at Wright State University. Each summer, students will work with experienced faculty mentors state-of-the-art facilities and emerging tools and techniques to solve problems that are timely and important.   The challenges of cybersecurity research provide an exciting opportunity for students to investigate fundamental principles and strategies to develop real-world, secure systems that we can all trust. This project is co-funded by the Cyber Corps (R): Scholarship for Service Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is led by an outstanding team offering modern facilities and professional mentors to guide undergraduates in explorations of problems related to cybersecurity.  The team will use proven strategies to recruit undergraduate students from groups traditionally under-represented in computer science. The team will also seek to include veterans who are returning to pursue computing degrees   The students will participate in research and professional development activities all designed to achieve the goals of retaining and graduating undergraduate students in computer fields, recruiting students from groups traditionally under-represented in computing fields,  developing students' confidence and capabilities of conducting independent research, and motivating students to pursue graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>

First, we have recruited a diverse group of 31 motivated undergraduate students to participate in our REU site, who are mainly from institutions with limited cyber security research programs.

Second, students have learnt, wherever applicable, through the &ldquo;end-to-end&rdquo; approach, the entire process of problem-solving methodologies. Third, our REU site implemented various faculty-student and student-student interactions to promote the dialogues between faculty mentors and students, and dialogues among students, thereby generating academic interaction and discussions that extend beyond research.
