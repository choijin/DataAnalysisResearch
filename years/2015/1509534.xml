<AbstractNarration>Customers in cultural heritage institutions, both large and small facilities, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, hold thousands of silver objects under their care.  The current method for corrosion protection includes the manual application of polymeric nitrocellulose, which protects objects for 10-20 years and can take 3 to 40 more hours per object depending on its size and complexity. The relatively short film lifetime and long application process leaves museums with thousands of silver objects in a constant cycle of replacing plastic coatings or leaving many objects unprotected. The proposed atomic layer deposited (ALD) coating developed by this I-Corps team is expected to fulfill the rigorous requirements required by cultural heritage institutions such as museums, archives and libraries, and fine silver jewelry manufacturers such as artisans or jewelry retailers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALD films will allow for the long term protection of cultural heritage objects, as they protect silver significantly longer than the current coating technology, applying nitrocellulose films. By reducing the amount of tarnishing and frequency of polishing, objects can be preserved longer without loss of original surface details. This I-Corps grant will allow ALD coating technology to be transferred to the cultural heritage and museum conservation community. As part of this technology transfer, the team will also develop a better understanding of how ALD metal oxide films affect the chemical structure and visual characteristics of the substrate. While ALD films applied to clean, flat, 2D surfaces is well understood, little work has been completed on the effect of using ALD films on rough, 3D objects with prior surface treatments. The knowledge and experience gained through the I-CORPS program will be shared with other potential entrepreneurs and students through a proposed seminar with the University of Maryland's Clark School of Engineering, Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program, and Hinman CEOs program. This seminar would further disseminate the knowledge gained through I-CORPS to other entrepreneurially-minded students at the University of Maryland.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes for this project were evaluations of the possible markets for the technology that we developed under previous NSF support, the application of transparent metal oxide films as protective barriers for cultural heritage objects crafted from precious and semiprecious metals.  The initial market surveys revealed that the museum conservation community is not yet ready to accept this technology for their objects without substantial testing in their environments.  Subsequent investigations probed the readiness of private collectors, and this does indeed look to be a potential entry point for a startup under an SBIR or STIR framework.  Finally we investigated the market for application of these films to other types of objects including optical components fabricated from polycarbonate, and jewelry manufacturers.  The indications are that these could be alternative market entry points for a startup, allowing it to establish a reputation in the business community while the type of long term tests needed to convince the museum community of effectiveness, acceptability in terms of appearance and reversibility (one of the requirements in the conservation community) in a museum setting.  The intellectual merit of this activity was in the development of a market plan for an eventual science-based technology to cultural heritage.  The broader impact was in the training of a graduate student in the approach of entrepeneurship and business.       Last Modified: 08/30/2017       Submitted by: Raymond J Phaneuf]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
