<AbstractNarration>There is a critical need in this nation for well-educated, well-prepared STEM professionals. Ocean industries, in particular, are experiencing a severe shortage of skilled workers, with the demand for electronics technicians, engineers, and computer scientists at the top of their lists. This project seeks to address the demand for STEM professionals, with a focus on those with knowledge of ocean applications, by building the pipeline of students interested in and well-prepared for STEM careers. The typical customer of the proposed innovation is a middle or high school science/engineering/technology teacher looking for a creative, semester-long curriculum that integrates engineering, science, and applied math and is aligned with the Next Generation of Science Standards (NGSS).  It is believed these teachers would make up 70-80% of the customer base; the remainder would be elementary school teachers, informal educators, parents, and college and university educators (who are providers of K-12 education activities or professional development).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed innovation is a comprehensive learning package that includes curriculum (e.g. a lesson and activity book) aligned with NGSS?s Engineering, Technology, and Applications of Science standards, an ROV (remotely operated vehicle) kit, and lab packs of resources (e.g. electronic components) for  middle school and high school. The team envisions these efforts to result in an e-book(s) that includes how-to videos and demonstrations; and perhaps a hard copy also.  The ROV kits are in the beta stage of development, and the team continues to make improvements based on customer feedback and own R&amp;D. The curriculum is in a proof-of-principle stage; foundational learning outcomes have been defined, but more will be added.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) CenterÆs mission is to use marine technology to improve STEM education and to provide the marine technical workforce with well-educated STEM professionals (see www.marinetech.org for more information). MATE was established as an Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Center of Excellence in 1997 with funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and currently continues as an NSF ATE Support Center.  The MATE CenterÆs proposed innovation for I-Corps L was a comprehensive underwater robotics learning package to support middle and high school teachers in delivering STEM to their students. The package was proposed to include a lesson and activity book that addresses the Next Generation of Science StandardÆs (NGSS) Engineering, Technology, and Applications of Science; an underwater robotics kit (remotely operated vehicle or ROV); and lab resources (e.g. materials for demonstrations of STEM concepts).  The motivation for this innovation stems from MATEÆs ROV competitions. Each year the MATE CenterÆs ROV competitions use underwater robots as a platform to instruct thousands of students in STEM subjects and demonstrate how these disciplines are applied in the real world. To support these activities, MATE develops curriculum, conducts professional development workshops, manufactures and sells ROV kits, and authored and sells a textbook.  The MATE I-Corps L team interviewed 103 current and potential customers and confirmed that there is a need for underwater robotics kits and that we need to expand our product line. We learned that a lesson and activity book is not a must-have for most teachers.  Rather, they want a one-stop source for reliable building materials and a way to easily pay for them.     Professional development is much more important than we realized.  Not only do teachers want continuing professional development opportunities, they would also like national recognition for the professional development that they receive.  Most school districts have money for professional development; some are actively seeking programs that can help their teachers prepare for the NGSS.  Through I-Corps L we defined a vision for where we want to be as a business.  Our sales over the past 12 months come to roughly $200,000.  Our goal is to increase sales to $2.5 million/year over the next 5 years, while still maintaining the character of our student-run business &ndash; SeaMATE.  SeaMATE is our social enterprise that provides community college students with workplace experience while creating products and services that promote marine technical education.   To achieve this goal, over the next 2 years we will need to focus on and invest in the following: improving the online shopping experience, expanding our product line, developing a complement of online and in-person professional development, and expanding to new audiences.
