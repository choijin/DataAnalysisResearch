<AbstractNarration>The Sahel region of North Africa experienced dramatic swings in precipitation patterns over the latter half of the 20th century, with devastating impacts on food security during the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s. Looking ahead, projections of future climate change in the Sahel show little agreement, with some climate models predicting significantly wetter conditions in the 21st century and others suggesting drying, leaving great uncertainty as to the impacts of climate change on this sensitive region. This project aims to improve understanding of controls on North African climate by reconstructing regional climate changes over the last 1 million years using deep-sea sediments located off the west African coast. This long-term sampling of climate variability will reveal the region's response during multiple ice age cycles, including periods when the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere were substantially warmer and colder than at present and periods when North Africa was much wetter and drier than at present. By systematically documenting North Africa's response during this range of climatic conditions, the results will provide important new opportunities to test climate models' ability to accurately represent past climate variability in the region. The project will employ recently developed tools to reconstruct windblown dust emissions from the Sahara desert (a tracer of winds and aridity), the carbon isotopic composition of fossil leaf molecules in the sediment (a tracer of vegetation on the continent), and the hydrogen isotopic composition of the same leaf molecules (a tracer of monsoon strength.) This dataset will enable a better understanding of what has driven climate change in the past, and what this will mean for future change in North Africa. The project will also include public outreach projects to offer education about the impact of climate change in North Africa, and it will provide training and career development for a female postdoctoral researcher and multiple undergraduate researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present understanding of African climate evolution over the Plio-Pleistocene is based in large part on a benchmark set of marine records of the accumulation rate of windblown dust that provide some of the only continuous data spanning thousand to million year timescales. Now, 25 years after the initial publication of these records, recent advances in hydroclimate reconstruction offer the opportunity for a new generation of insights into North African climate. Constant flux proxies (230Th, 3He) allow fundamental improvements in the accuracy of fluxes by minimizing the effects of lateral advection and age model uncertainties; as a result, dust fluxes can be compared through time and space with much greater confidence. Additionally, the carbon and hydrogen isotope composition of terrestrial leaf waxes (n-alkanes) have been established as hydrological proxies that can offer independent insights into monsoon precipitation and vegetation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At present, these methods have received only limited application to periods prior to the last glacial cycle, precluding rigorous exploration of the drivers, timing and amplitude of North African climate change over the Pleistocene. This project will use measurements of dust flux (determined by 230Th- and 3He-normalization) and leaf wax isotopes (dD, d13C) to reconstruct changes in the mean state and variability of African climate over the last 1.1 Ma. This interval includes periods with broad variations in orbital parameters, ice volume, and high-latitude temperatures, including maximum high latitude warmth during so-called "super-interglacials", low-amplitude ice age cycles during the "luke-warm" interglacials, and times of especially high and low eccentricity. By pairing high-fidelity dust fluxes with complementary data reflecting land cover and hydrology, the project will offer detailed insights into the nature of past changes in this water-stressed monsoonal region and will test specific hypotheses relating to the roles of high-latitude temperatures and local insolation in driving past hydrological changes. The project will offer new opportunities for testing climate models used to forecast future changes in the region by providing robust records of the response of North African climate to a wide range of forcings and boundary conditions. This dataset will also enable improved testing of hypotheses relating changes in the mean state and variability of African climate to human evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The broad spread of climate projections for the vulnerable region of North Africa call for a better understanding of the region?s hydroclimate variability on longer timescales. Recent advances in techniques to reconstruct dust accumulation, rainfall patterns, and ecosystem change provide an opportunity to understand how and why these parameters have evolved in North Africa.     The first major result from this study comes from a new complete dust flux reconstruction extending to 240 kyr before present.  These data clearly demonstrate that North African dust emissions have primarily been paced by changes in local summer insolation over this time period, with minimum dust fluxes occurring at times of maximum summer insolation, and increases of more than a factor of 3 in dust fluxes during times of minimum summer insolation. This finding agrees well with the timing of sapropel development in the Mediterranean Sea, but it contrasts with influential dust flux records from this region that form the foundation of our understanding of the long-term evolution of North African climate. These older dust records suggest that North African climate has dominantly varied on glacial-interglacial (~100 kyr) timescales over the last 1 Myr, and that there have been substantial changes in the frequency of North African climate variability over the Plio-Pleistocene. Our results, however, suggest that this 100 kyr periodicity is an artifact of the way in which these dust flux records were generated, and indicate that, like the Asian summer monsoon system, North African climate has dominantly varied on precessional (~20 kyr) timescales over the Late Quaternary.     The second part of this study combined two independent reconstructions of the hydrological cycle extending from marine isotope stage 13?10 (530 to 350 ka BP).  The results show that North African rainfall and dust emissions are controlled by low-latitude insolation and track changes in moisture delivery associated with the summer inter-hemispheric insolation gradient. The importance of the inter-hemispheric insolation gradient, found here, is also compatible with our conclusions from the 0-240 ka time period that variations are dominantly precessional, as precession frequencies are strong in the inter-hemispheric insolation gradient and local (precessional) insolation also likely contributes to African monsoon variations.  While increases in precipitation on precessional timescales are associated with expansion of savanna grasslands into the desert landscapes, changes in pCO2 on 100 kyr glacial-interglacial timescales predominantly drive the C3 trees/C4 grass plant composition of savanna ecosystems. These findings suggest that, despite widely varying forecasts of Northwest African precipitation change, future predictions of woody plant cover within existing African savannas may in fact be better informed by pCO2.     Extending further back in time to marine isotope stages 33?29 (1.1?1.0 Ma BP), an interval during which glacial-interglacial cycles were much weaker in intensity, we find that both monsoon rainfall and the C3/C4vegetation makeup of savanna ecosystems track changes in low-latitude insolation. As during marine isotope stages 13?10, increased rainfall and expanded savanna grasslands are associated with increased summer insolation, however the ecosystems demonstrate less vegetation variability with glacial-interglacial cycles compared to later in the Pleistocene. This suggests that atmospheric CO2 content less variable during the mid-Pleistocene consistent with the weaker glacial-interglacial temperature and ice volume variability. As a result, vegetation change in North Africa was predominantly driven by rainfall variability during this time. This observation is in line with recent evidence from measurements of atmospheric CO2from blue ice which showed muted CO2 variability during the mid-Pleistocene.      This unique multi-dimensional record advances our understanding of the timing, drivers and magnitude of North African hydrological change over the last million years.  Our results lead to a substantial revision of Plio-Pleistocene changes in North African climate variability, suggesting that even in a time of high-amplitude glacial-interglacial variations, local insolation and insolation gradients are the primary driver of regional climate.  These results also indicate that an interplay of pCO2 and rainfall patterns shape changes in the geographic extent and plant community of North African savannas, with CO2 playing a larger role than expected. These data offer new opportunities for testing climate models with a wider range of forcings and boundary conditions than has been observed during the last glacial-Holocene transition.  Such data also provide new opportunities to test coupled climate-vegetation models? ability to accurately represent ecosystem change under past conditions that are relevant to future changes.     The project offered important professional development opportunities for an early-career female researcher, graduate student, and undergraduates. It has also offered outreach to children in the Boston area to increase awareness of paleoclimate research and climate science.
