<AbstractNarration>1548385 (Badurdeen). "Value Creation through Sustainable Manufacturing" is the theme for the 5th International Forum on Sustainable Manufacturing (IFSM) organized by the Institute for Sustainable Manufacturing (ISM).  It will be held 24-25 September 2015 on the campus of the University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky. Sustainable manufacturing, with its emphasis on increasing sustainability performance in the product, process and systems domains, is now recognized as an enabler for increasing competitiveness through innovation. However, to make the business case for sustainable manufacturing, there is a need to identify and mobilize opportunities for value creation through sustainable manufacturing from economic as well as environmental and societal perspectives. The 5th IFSM will focus on this theme and bring together industry practitioners and academic researchers to discuss opportunities and challenges to enable value creation through sustainable manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This forum will feature invited speakers, tenure-track faculty presentations in a "Emerging Researcher Showcase" and a panel discussion. In addition, a poster session will be held to highlight research achievements in sustainable manufacturing by students and young faculty. NSF funding will be used to provide travel support to U.S. based invited speakers, particularly tenure-track Assistant Professors conducting research in related areas as well as selected graduate students to attend the 5th IFSM.</AbstractNarration>
