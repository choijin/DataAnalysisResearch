<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for an international conference sponsored by the Loess Focus Group of the International Quaternary Union (INQUA) to be held at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire in September 2016.  The conference will foster networking and collaboration among an international assemblage of geologists, geographers, and soil scientists whose research interests focus on loess, which is an eolian sediment largely consisting of wind-blown silt.  Because of its distinctive character and origin, loess has been the topic of considerable research in geography, geomorphology, and soil science.  The conference will bring together scholars from around the world to share results from recent research, discuss topics and issues of mutual interest, and provide opportunities for scholars to explore possibilities for new collaborative relationships.  Although a series of conferences focusing on loess have been convened periodically since 1999, this will be the first such gathering in North America.  The conference will provide an opportunity to highlight much of the loess research in the mid-continental U.S. being done by U.S. researchers to an international audience, and it will provide a venue within which many Americans, who often do not interact directly with loess scholars in Europe and China, to meet, network, and collaborate.  In addition to facilitating interactions among scholars from different nations, the conference will catalyze advances in loess science that will enable better mapping and use of the distinctive soils associated with loess, and it will promote research in loess areas that have received little research attention in the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the soils in the richest agricultural parts of the world are formed in loess, which means that research about the geology and spatial properties of loess provides important information about past geologic and climatic conditions wherever it is found.  The conference is expected to attract between 125 and 150 scholars, and it will be one of a number of gatherings preceding the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Denver.  The conference will be conducted over four days, with two days in meeting rooms and two days at field sites where scholars will be able to examine representative loess-based features firsthand.  Topics of special emphasis during indoor and field-based discussions will be on fluvial and glacial systems as loess sources; on the role of loess in regions with only thin veneers of wind-blown sediments; and on loess landscapes, eolian transportational systems, and the concept of loess transport surfaces.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&ldquo;LoessFest&rdquo; is the informal name give to the annual meetings of the INQUA (International Quaternary Union) Loess Focus Group. The 2016 LoessFest, held in western Wisconsin and supported by NSF and INQUA, was a huge success. It was one of the largest such meetings in recent memory, with 75 registered participants from 10 countries, and the first LoessFest EVER on US soil. Non-USA participation was at 40%, and 18 of the registered participants were students. In all, 29 oral papers and 14 posters were presented.&nbsp;</p> <p>The conference included two days of oral papers and posters, followed by two days of field trips (two one-day trips). Most of the conference participants attended all four days of the event. The field trips included 13 stops, most of which were exposures or backhoe pits in loess or related sediments.&nbsp;</p> <p>The two one-day field trips were a big success. Almost all of the registered participants attended the trips; we took one 55-passenger coach bus and a smaller, 20-passenger bus. The trips focused on the Chippewa River and its fluvial history (stops 1-3), because the river was a loess source. Stops 4 was in an excavation into thick (&gt;5m) loess just downwind of the valley. Stops 5 and 6 were in the Chippewa end moraine, which was also a loess source. Then stop 7 featured a pit, just a few miles south of the moraine, in loess that we believe was at least partially sourced from it. On Day 2 we examined loess transportations surfaces; all stops were in pits that had been dug previously, just for the field trips. First we examined a sandy-silty sediment ON the transportation surface, then we went to the east, which would have been downwind, to examine this sediment as it got increasingly silty. Three pits, in succession, were examined to illustrate this point. Lastly, we examined two sites, on either side of a large bedrock ridge. On the western side, sands with some silt were ramped up, against the ridge. Silts that were carried across it accumulated on the lee side, where we stopped to examine a soil that had formed in the silts.</p> <p>In summary, the conference was a good exmaple of international cooperation and participation on a topic (loess - wind-blown silt deposits) that is global in scope. All the world's nations have loess deposits and most of the world's best soils are formed in it. This conference led (and will lead to) to increased cooperation on loess research worldwide.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/06/2017<br>      Modified by: Randall&nbsp;J&nbsp;Schaetzl</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559045/1559045_10414126_1499353594723_DSC_1268--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559045/1559045_10414126_1499353594723_DSC_1268--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Overview of the Chippewa River stop"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559045/1559045_10414126_1499353594723_DSC_1268--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Overview of the Chippewa River stop"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The field trip group examines a map of the region near the Chippewa River.</div> <div class="imageCredit">R Schaetzl</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Randall&nbsp;J&nbsp;Schaetzl</div> <div class="imageTitle">Overview of the Chippewa River stop</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559045/1559045_10414126_1499353712184_DSC_8264--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559045/1559045_10414126_1499353712184_DSC_8264--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pit in a loess soil"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559045/1559045_10414126_1499353712184_DSC_8264--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pit in a loess soil"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The group crowds into a pit showing loess - windblown silt.</div> <div class="imageCredit">R Schaetzl</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Randall&nbsp;J&nbsp;Schaetzl</div> <div class="imageTitle">Pit in a loess soil</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559045/1559045_10414126_1499353823634_DSC_8289--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559045/1559045_10414126_1499353823634_DSC_8289--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Field trip route"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559045/1559045_10414126_1499353823634_DSC_8289--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Field trip route"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">DR.
