<AbstractNarration>Non-technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;Living matter can change its structure as it responds to changes in its environment.  With support from the Solid-State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the goal of this research is to replicate this type of responsiveness using artificial materials that can reconfigure themselves in response to an external stimulus, in this case light.  Reconfigurable matter consists of a structure composed of smaller elements whose properties can be switched by light.  After switching, these elements can reassemble into a new composite structure that has different properties.  Many workers in the field envision the switchable elements to be nanoparticles or colloids, but it is clear that the smallest switchable element is a molecule.  A molecule that undergoes a photochemical reaction represents a switchable element.  A crystal composed of photoreactive molecules can then restructure itself after exposure to light.  This proposal is concerned with the development of molecular crystal materials that can undergo photoinduced shape changes as a route to reconfigurable matter.  Materials that undergo structural changes in response to light have potential applications a wide range of disciplines ranging from engineering to medicine to cell biology.  Participating students will receive advanced training in spectroscopy, materials characterization, and data analysis.  Outreach efforts supported by this grant will improve science education at Taft Elementary, a Title I (&gt;70% socioeconomically disadvantaged) school that is also &gt;70% underrepresented minority.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;This research program has three main goals.  First, new materials and approaches to molecular crystal-based photoinduced motion will be developed.  This motion usually originates from the presence of a mixture of reactant and product molecules within the crystal that form a bimorph structure.  New halogenated anthracene derivatives will be synthesized to improve the robustness and reversibility of the [4+4] photodimerization reaction that powers the crystal mechanical response.  New types of photochemical reactions based on the unimolecular cis-trans isomerization of divinyl(anthracene) derivatives will also be explored.  The materials development will include efforts to develop novel micron-scale crystal morphologies that can give rise to new modes of mechanical response.  A second area of focus will be to improve the physical understanding of the photomechanical response by studying its mechanism and limits.  By measuring how light intensity, direction, wavelength, and crystal shape affect the rate and magnitude of crystal bending, different theories proposed to explain the mechanical response can be evaluated.  Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments will measure spin diffusion dynamics to assess whether the reactions proceed homogeneously throughout the crystal or heterogeneously with domain formation.  These experiments will provide information on both the size and shape of nanoscale domains that grow during the photochemical reaction.  Third, we will prepare arrays of nanocrystals that can reshape themselves after exposure to light.  Surface patterning followed by microdrop printing will generate separated nanocrystals composed of photoreactive molecules.  These crystal arrays will be characterized by optical spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electron microscopy.  Photoinduced shape changes will be measured and correlated with starting crystal shape and size, as well as light exposure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biology uses chemical fuels to drive microscopic "machines" like proteins that perform useful work.  Our research is focused on creating artificial machines, powered by light, that can also perform useful tasks. Photochemical reactions in solid-state molecular crystals cause mechanical deformations that can be harnessed to do work.  The immediate goals of this research project are to identify new molecules that undergo reversible photochemistry, assemble them into crystals with different shapes and sizes, and characterize the motions and dynamics of these structures.  This interdisciplinary project spans the fields of synthetic organic chemistry, physical chemistry, and materials science.  The ultimate goal is to develop materials that can generate mechanical work and motion using only light.  Such remote-controlled machines could find wide applications in medicine, manufacturing, and defense.     To improve the molecular properties, work with collaborators from Saudi Arabia and Japan has resulted in the development of new types of photomechanical crystal materials based on divinyl-anthracenes and diarylethenes, expanding the toolbox of photomechanical crystal materials.  Novel crystal growth methods have also been developed to make arrays of nanowires, single sheets and ribbons, and highly branched crystals.  These different crystal morphologies exhibit possibly useful motions and can interface with other objects like inorganic microcrystals.  An interesting offshoot of this research was the finding that photochromic molecules in polymers can induce noncovalent adhesion to glass surfaces.  To develop quantitative models for these materials (which is necessary if they are to be engineered into practical devices), an extended Finke-Watzky kinetic model was derived in order to predict enhanced photoinduced bending in these crystal needles and ribbons.  The role of surface dynamics and surfactants in catalyzing photochemistry and crystal shape changes.  New structural methods have been applied to structure and the mechanism of the photoinduced expansion seen in anthracene-ester nanorods.  The most challenging aspect of the project is to grow arrays of photomechanical nanocrystals on centimeter lengthscales.  In order to characterize the work output and displacement of these actuators, a new apparatus that uses optical interferometry has been constructed. Finally, a method has been developed to encapsulate organic crystals underneath single-layer graphene.  This atomically thin coating can prevent air and solvent from damaging the crystal, while not affecting its bulk photophysical behavior.      Support from this grant have enabled multiple outreach activities to Taft Elementary School, a Title I (&gt;70% socioeconomically disadvantaged) school that is also &gt;70% underrepresented minority.  These include Science Fair coaching in the fall for grades 1-5 and science demonstrations during the spring for grades 1 and 3 to reinforce concepts they have learned in class. The PI hosts an annual visit by the entire 4th grade class from Taft to the UC Riverside campus.  This introduction to college life includes a lecture on electricity and magnetism, a campus tour, and lunch at a university cafeteria.  At the University of California, Riverside, three undergraduate students (two from underrepresented minority groups) have begun working the lab supported as RISE (Research in Science and Engineering) Scholars.       The scientific results from this research have been disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, presentations at national and international conferences, and invited seminars at other universities.  PI Bardeen also organized and hosted an Optical Society of America Incubator Meeting "Materials for Optomechanical Actuation" from June 25-27, 2017 in Washington, DC.  This meeting brought together researchers from Chemistry, Physics and Engineering to discuss future research challenges and possible applications of photomechanical materials.  The research supported by this grant has centered on gaining fundamental scientific information that will move the field of organic photomechanical materials closer to applications.
