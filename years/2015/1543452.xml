<AbstractNarration>Previous studies of the Indo-Pacific region of Antarctica show that the margin of the ice sheet in this region has advanced and retreated into deep interior basins many times in the past.  The apparent instability of this region makes it an important target for study in terms of understanding the future of the East Antarctic ice sheet and sea level rise.  This project will study a number of processes that control the ice-shelf stability of this region, with the aim of improving projections of the rate and magnitude of future sea-level rise.  This project will engage a range of students and train this next generation of scientists in the complex, interdisciplinary issue of ice-ocean interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will integrate geophysical data collected from aircraft over three critical&lt;br/&gt;sections of the East Antarctic grounding line (Totten Glacier, Denman Glacier, and&lt;br/&gt;Cook Ice Shelf) with an advanced ocean model. Using Australian and French assets,&lt;br/&gt;the team will collect new data around Denman Glacier and Cook Ice Shelf whereas analysis of Totten Glacier will be based on existing data.  The project will assess three hypotheses to isolate the processes that drive the differences in observed grounding line thinning among these three glaciers: 1. bathymetry and large-scale ocean forcing control cavity circulation; 2. ice-shelf draft and basal morphology control cavity circulation; 3. subglacial freshwater input across the grounding line controls cavity circulation.  The key outcomes of this new project will be to: 1. evaluate of ice-ocean coupling in areas of significant potential sea-level contribution; 2. relate volume changes of grounded and floating ice to regional oceanic heat transport and sub-ice shelf ocean dynamics in areas of significant potential sea-level and meridional overturning circulation impacts; and 3. improve boundary conditions to evaluate mass, heat, and freshwater budgets of East Antarctica's continental margins.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The East Antarctic Grounding Line Experiment (EAGLE) combines aerogeophysical survey and numerical ocean circulation modeling to evaluate the sensitivity of the major glacier outlets of the Aurora and Wilkes Subglacial basins of East Antarctica to ocean forcing. The Aurora Subglacial Basin (ASB) drains into the Sabrina and Knox coasts; the Wilkes Subglacial Basin (WSB) drains into the George V Coast. Multiple satellite altimetry time series have shown that the grounded ice along the Sabrina and Knox coasts have had the highest rates of thinning in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) but that glaciers along the George V Coast have been relatively stable. The overarching goals of the EAGLE project are to determine the major controls on each system, explain why they are behaving differently, and, by extension, evaluate the factors that could destabilize the WSB. &nbsp;EAGLE was a collaboration between the University of Texas, the Australian Antarctic Division, the Institute for Geophysics of the Environment in France, and the Polar Research Institute of China.</p> <p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Intelletual Merit: </strong></span>The EAGLE project successfully densified gravity and magnetics coverage in front of the Sabrina Coast, an area largely inaccessible to ships but vital for understanding Antarctica's most sensitive outlet, Totten Glacier, which drains the Aurora Suglacial Basin in the center of the region of interest.
