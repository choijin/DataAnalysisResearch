<AbstractNarration>A better understanding of erosion rates and their influence on sediment loads in streams is important for assessing the impacts on water availability and agricultural land productivity.  This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate the abrupt incision of streams into their floodplains caused by extreme temperature and precipitation events in the southwestern U.S. that led to increased sediment loads and impacted the water resources of many communities.  The doctoral student will provide new insights into how erosion rates and sediment yields and the effects of sediment supply on these streams will help predict future channel adjustments and manage societal impacts.  The student will work closely with local communities and government agencies to assess the vulnerability of water and agricultural land to these changes.  The impact on water resources has important policy implications for land and resource managers as well as for stakeholders.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because variability in erosion rates influences the sediment content of a stream, rapid changes in those rates may damage productive agricultural land and impact water resources availability.  This project will address the core question regarding how erosion rates vary as a function of climatic variables, lithology, and topography, and how such variability influences resource variability in the region.  The doctoral student will collect sediment samples from two catchment areas in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument area in Utah.  She will analyze the terrestrial cosmogenic-nuclide Beryllium-10 (TCN 10Be) concentrations in fluvial sediment.  The analyses will provide a quantitative assessment of the landscape's response to bedrock and environmentally related changes in erosion rates and sediment supply.  The research outcomes will influence resource and landscape management of the large tracts of public lands in a region that is both shaped and impaired by high sediment loads.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project analyzed sediment samples from streams draining the Grand Staircase region of southern Utah to understand modern and past rock erosion rates.  The colorful cliff and bench topography of this region is controlled by alternating bedrock properties and the charismatic cliffs and canyons of the region were created by river incision driven by base level fall associated with the cutting of Grand Canyon 6 million years ago.  Berrylium-10 cosmogenic nuclide concentrations were measured in 52 samples of quartz sand to calculate the rate of bedrock erosion.  Inferred erosion rates varied spatially from 20 to &gt;900 meters per million years (mm/thousand years) and are interpreted to be a function of rock type (resistance to erosion) and topography.  Hotspots of erosion were found at prominent cliff-face escarpments and are interpreted as the location of migrating knick zones and basin expansion due to base level fall driven by incision of the Grand Canyon.  Rather than reflecting mean upstream erosion rates, Berrylium-10 concentrations measured in trunk streams systematically reflect local erosion rates highlighting the effect of cascading sediment supply and intermittent sediment conveyance between cliff and bench topographies.  These data provide a baseline to understand the role of sediment erosion and sediment yield in these charismatic erosional drylands.
