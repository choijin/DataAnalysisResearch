<AbstractNarration>Cooperation and Learning over Cognitive Networks&lt;br/&gt;Studies on herding and self-organization in economics and the social and biological sciences have observed that coordination among multiple agents leads to regular patterns of behavior and swarm intelligence, even when each group member shows limited behavioral complexity. In ant colonies, for example, individual ants cannot capture rich spatial information from their environment because of their limited sensing ability. Nevertheless, when the ants coordinate their activities within a colony, the group ends up exhibiting better sensing abilities. Using signal processing and communications techniques, the research studies how and why such manifestations of rational and organized behavior arise at the group level from local interactions among agents with limited abilities, what communication topologies enable such behavior, and what type of signal processing enables such formations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to understand and reverse-engineer the distributed intelligence encountered in socio-economic-biological networks, by investigating relations with learning and rationality over cognitive networks. The latter are adaptive networks that avoid centralized information processing and perform in-network inference and control decisions. Cognitive networks contrast with networks that rely on centralized and parallel information fusion, which are not scalable, are hard to adapt to changing topologies, and suffer from points of vulnerability and information bottlenecks.  The research considers large scale networks of agents and studies how global (rational or irrational) patterns of behavior emerge, including herds, contagions and bubbles in economics. An understanding of how the biotic environment influences collective behavior in animal societies provides a real world guide to good cognitive networks, which can be used in turn to design engineered systems. Cognitive networks have applications in areas ranging from precision agriculture, to environmental monitoring, disaster relief management, and smart spaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project advanced the understanding of swarm intelligence and network coordination, by studing models and developing new decentralized algorithms for distributed computation that rely on the local and random interaction of several network agents, without central control. These computation mechanisms are fault tolerant and scalable, in the sense that local computations have small storage requirements and complexity relative to their centralized counterparts.  The advances have been in two fields:  1) in the field of signal processing and networking we advanced significantly the suite of algorithms that are applicable to sensor networks, and that allow to perform inference (detection, estimation and more generally optimzation) or coordination tasks (such as scheduling and syncrhonization) without central coordination. We focused on the solution of a non-linear non-covex regression problems, and applied our methods to state estimation in power systems and to sensor array processing applications that deal with the separation of a mixture of signals with uknown sturcture for monitoring applications.  We also studied scheduling and syncrhonization for Internet of Things applications that are inspired by the dynamics of coupled oscillators from biological physics, modeling the interaction mechanism of pace-maker cells.   2) we studied swarm intelligence in the context of social networks. In this case we focused on the potential disfunctions of learning phenomena in social systems, considering herding and polarization in the opinion dynamics of the social group as well as the influence of mavens that try to steer the opinion of society.    All of the outcomes were disseminated through conference presentation, proceedings articles and several journal publications.
