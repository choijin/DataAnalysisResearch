<AbstractNarration>This coastal geomorphology project is relevant to the large coastal populations that rely on dunes for protection during storms and it could provide useful information for coastal planners and engineers. The project aims to advance understanding of the recovery and building of coastal dunes with a focus on the welding of intertidal sandbars to the shoreline. The investigators will develop novel approaches to measure the effects of waves and wind on the movement of sand. They will communicate findings to coastal management agencies and will train one PhD student and two undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to improve understanding of beach-dune dynamics by testing the hypothesis that sediment supply to the backshore beach and dunes is dominated by the welding of intertidal sandbars to the shoreline. While this mechanism has long been proposed as critical, only limited quantitative data exists. The investigators propose a comprehensive field experiment (SEDEX2, the Sandbar-aEolian-Dune Exchange EXperiment) in which measurements of waves and wind, subaqueous and aeolian sediment transport, and subsequent morphological changes will be collected synoptically during an intertidal bar welding event along a highly progradational beach. The findings will inform conceptual and numerical models of beach-dune interaction and help to improve management of vital backshore resources.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Despite the importance of coastal dunes to many low-lying coastal communities and ecosystems, our understanding of how climatic, ecological, and human pressures affect foredune growth and evolution on time scales of events to decades is still relatively poor. Therefore, the goal of the project titled ?The Influence of Intertidal Sandbar Welding on Dune Growth? was to improve our understanding of beach-dune dynamics. We approached this problem by designing a project that tested the hypothesis that sediment supply to the backshore beach and dunes is dominated by the welding of intertidal sandbars to the shoreline during the low energy seasons of summer and fall.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The primary goal of the project was achieved via the planning and execution of&nbsp;a detailed, process-based field experiment which quantified the contribution of intertidal sandbar welding to beach, backshore, and dune growth. The <strong>S</strong>andbar-a<strong>E</strong>olian-<strong>D</strong>une <strong>EX</strong>change <strong>EX</strong>periment (SEDEX<sup>2</sup>) was performed during summer 2016 along the Long Beach Peninsula, WA, USA (Figure 1). This study location is a high-energy dissipative coastline experiencing rapid shoreline progradation (&gt; +3 m/yr) and long-term dune growth. Using the detailed morphology and hydrodynamic data from the inner surf zone, intertidal, and beach, collected during the experiment, we have been exploring the trends in onshore bar migration that contribute to beach and dune growth (Figure 2).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The field experiment and subsequent analyses of results (Figure 3) were designed to&nbsp;answer the following questions:<em> What are the primary formation mechanisms of intertidal sandbars? What are the dominant physical mechanisms responsible for onshore migration of intertidal bars? Under what conditions is beach sand delivered from the intertidal zone via sandbar welding mobilized via wind-blown processes? &nbsp;What is the residence time of sand on the beach prior to blowing into dunes? How does spatial variability in intertidal sandbar welding affect rates of aeolian sediment transport? What is the relative contribution of sandbar welding to annual sediment supply to dunes? </em></p> <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Our most significant result from this project was the discovery that hydrodynamic processes can be important in dune growth. Coastal foredune growth has typically been associated with aeolian sediment transport processes only, while foredune erosion is associated with destructive marine processes. Our new data sets suggest that total water levels in the collision regime can cause dunes to accrete?requiring a paradigm shift away from considering collisional wave impacts as unconditionally erosional (Figure 4). From morphologic change data sets, it is estimated that marine processes explain between 9% and 38% of annual dune growth with aeolian processes accounting for the remaining 62% to 91%. The largest wind-driven dune growth occurs during the winter, in response to high wind velocities, but out of phase with summertime beach growth via intertidal sandbar welding. The lack of synchronization between maximum beach sediment supply and wind-driven dune growth indicates that aeolian transport at out study site is primarily transport, rather than supply, limited, likely due to a lack of fetch limitations. These new findings have been described as 'eye opening' by international colleagues working in this field.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Another major accomplishment of this study was the development and testing of Windsurf, an open-source coupled numerical model capable of simulating the co-evolution of the nearshore, beach, and dunes (Figure 5). Windsurf couples three state-of-the-art open-source models that account for subaqueous (XBeach) and subaerial (Aeolis and the Coastal Dune Model, CDM) processes to explore evolution of the beach profile in response to both marine and wind forcing. Consistent with our field measurements, recent Windsurf applications have shown skill at simulating coastal change by winds and waves at time scales of hours to years (Figure 6).
