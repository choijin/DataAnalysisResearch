<AbstractNarration>This project supports 10-15 students for their travel to attend the 2015 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC). ACSAC, which just celebrated its 30th year, is a top-tier academic security conference that attracts averages about 250 highly skilled security professionals and student attendees per year. ACSAC has carved a unique role as a security conference equally attended by academia, industry, and government. In addition to the technical papers, the conference program will include keynotes by distinguished speakers, tutorials, case studies, panels, a poster session, and works-in-progress talks. This project will support attendance by students, with particular attention given to those have a paper, poster, or works-in-progress submission accepted at the conference. In so doing, it will help to provide cybersecurity students with a broad perspective of the discipline.</AbstractNarration>
