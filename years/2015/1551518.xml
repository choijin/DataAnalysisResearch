<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation is conducting a portfolio review for the facilities, science programs, and other activities of the Geospace Sciences (GS) section in the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS). The portfolio review is, in part, a response by the NSF to the recommendations highlighted for the Geospace scientific community in the National Research Council's (NRC) 2013 Decadal Survey, "Solar and Space Physics: A Science for a Technological Society". The review is being carried out by a Portfolio Review Committee (PRC), organized by NSF under its Advisory Committee for Geosciences. NSF has stated that the primary goal of the review, and of any resulting adjustments of the Geospace Section's portfolio, is to ensure that investments in the Geospace science disciplines and respective facilities are properly aligned, both now and in the future, with the needs and priorities of the Geospace scientific community and with the interests of the nation in funding cutting edge scientific research of relevance to national priorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, under the auspices of the National Research Council, will examine the portfolio review (PR) and undertake the following tasks: (1) determine how well the PR's findings, conclusions and recommendation align with the issues and priorities highlighted in the NRC decadal survey, (2) examine actions already taken by the GS section in response to the decadal survey, (3) provide a forward-looking focus on the potential of all GS funded facilities, programs and activities for delivering the desired science outcomes, and (4) provide a clear set of recommendations on how the GS section should implement the decadal survey's priorities within the context of the NSF/Geosciences strategic planning process. The activities covered by this award will be done by a committee of up to 12 members who will be appointed under the auspices of the Space Studies Board and its Standing Committee on Solar and Space Physics (CSSP). The committee will meet up to three times over a five-month period. The committee's analysis and evaluation of the GS portfolio review will be based on its collective expertise supplemented by information and data gathered independently during the course of the study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published the Assessment of the National Science Foundation's 2015 Geospace Portfolio Review that assesses how well the 2015 report to the NSF Geosciences advisory committee, Investments in Critical capabilities for Geospace Science 2016 to 2025, (the Portfolio Review) provides a clear set of findings, conclusions, and recommendations for NSF Geospace that align with the science priorities of the solar and space physics decadal survey, and adequately takes into account issues such as the current budget outlook and the science needs of the community. The report?s recommendations focus on options and considerations for NSF's implementation of the Portfolio Review's recommendations.      The report concluded that the Portfolio Review fulfilled its charge and represents a conscientious, thorough, and good-faith effort to review the NSF GS portfolio and make recommendations for portfolio evolution and renewal.      The report recommended that: The lack of a strategic plan for the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) and the Geospace Section hinders the ability of the Geospace Section to act fully upon the recommendations given in Investments in Critical Capabilities for Geospace Science 2016 to 2025. AGS should develop a strategic vision and a strategic plan that recognizes all components within its portfolio relevant to geospace and interfaces with other programs across other National Science Foundation (NSF) divisions and directorates and across the agency. The plan should be aligned with the 2013 solar and space physics decadal survey, demonstrate awareness of the evolving capabilities outside NSF, and should be regularly updated with close community involvement in response to emerging discoveries, evolving budgets, new imperatives, and developing partnerships.     The report also presented conclusions regarding the Portfolio Review?s recommendations on cuts to Geospace Section?s support of Arecibo Observatory and Sondrestrom and potential future partnerships.     The report recommended supporting community efforts to establish requirements for future distributed arrays of small instruments (DASIs).     One decadal survey recommendation that the Portfolio Review could not implement within the challenging constraints is the creation of a midscale funding program to support development of ground-based facilities and experiments that are too small for the NSF Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction account but too large for the NSF Major Research Instrumentation program.     The report recommends that: The Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences should work with the Directorate for Geosciences and the National Science Foundation to implement the 2013 solar and space physics decadal survey recommendation for a Midscale Projects Program to address midscale priorities.      The Portfolio Review recommends a stricter set of guidelines for CubeSat missions, finding that publication results from the program "are predominantly engineering-oriented and that, on average, basic science productivity is low in comparison to . . . the same financial investment in [other] GS programs." The Portfolio Review recommends that investment in the CubeSat program be reduced from $1.5 million to $1 million per year to reflect "a focus on mission concept, instrument development, and science exploitation of the data" and a reduced scope of mission development. The Portfolio Review recommended that GS support two new mission starts per year, as suggested by the decadal survey, only if additional funding is obtained from elsewhere in NSF.    The report notes that unless partnerships are established, there is concern that the GS CubeSat program will be unduly slowed. The assessment committee endorses the Investments in Critical Capabilities for Geospace Science 2016 to 2025 recommendation to seek partnerships for CubeSats outside of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Geospace Section. However, mindful of the growing potential of CubeSats to be platforms for science and of the 2013 solar and space physics decadal survey recommendation to augment support for CubeSats, the committee recommends that the NSF Geospace Section carefully consider the impact associated with decreasing funding for the CubeSat program before additional resources through intra-divisional partnerships can be obtained.     Also, the assessment committee recommends that to realize Recommendation 4.6 of Investments in Critical Capabilities for Geospace Science 2016 to 2025 fully, the lack of diversity and representation in solar and space physics should be attacked aggressively. The National Science Foundation Geospace Section should identify best practices and provide guidance for new approaches to diversifying geospace.     Additional conclusions endorse recommendations regarding periodic senior reviews and note that the Portfolio Review?s suggestions regarding management processes are excellent.     To conclude this assessment, the portfolio review report represents a comprehensive program for the GS portfolio that is aligned with decadal survey priorities. The exception is funding for a Midscale Projects Program, which cannot be implemented within the budget constraints provided by NSF. The responsibility now passes to NSF to implement the GS portfolio recommended in the portfolio review and to engage with the community in developing a strategic vision and plan that identifies and builds on the strengths of AGS and GS within the broader solar and space physics enterprise.
