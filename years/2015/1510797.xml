<AbstractNarration>1510797(Tafti)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to investigate the unsteady flow around the wings of a bat and to uncover the fluid dynamics phenomena that are responsible for the highly maneuverable flight of bats.  Bat wings are very different than wings of birds and insects, and these differences allow them to adapt to different flight conditions.   Results from the proposed work could have wide-ranging applications from the design of autonomous flying vehicles to the development of more efficient turbines for the extraction of wind or water current energy, addressing a National need in energy research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective is to study the fluid dynamics around flexible, flapping membrane-like wings that can provide unique maneuverability and flight efficiency. Bats can control their wing beat amplitude and frequency, stroke plane, wing membrane deformation, wing camber, wing area and aspect ratio in a synthesis of a very complex motion.  Much of the current work in understanding the mechanics of flapping flight is not applicable for such multi-articulated wing motion and the ensuing unsteady fluid dynamics observed during bat flight. It is proposed to use flight experiments and computations to understand the mechanics of bat flight. Flight measurements will be conducted with live bats using 3D high-resolution cameras in redundant configurations to generate complete, detailed and accurate motion data of maneuvering in flight. The images will be analyzed to produce kinematic descriptions of fixed points located on the bat body.  Based on the flight data, a general and rigorous formulation for deriving low dimensional dynamic models of flapping flight will be developed. The goal is to identify the low-dimensional manifolds that characterize the flight dynamics and the induced forces on the wings. The approach can be viewed as an extension of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method to consider a wider class of nonlinear, low-order models of wing motion validated by the resultant unsteady aerodynamics. The project will actively recruit qualified minority candidates and leverage this activity through the Virginia Tech, ADVANCEVT program and minority students from HBCUs and majority Hispanic serving institutions. The PIs will continue their participation in the VT College of Engineering CEED program for recruiting and outreach to K-12 women and minorities.</AbstractNarration>
