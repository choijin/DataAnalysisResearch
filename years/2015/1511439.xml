<AbstractNarration>1511439&lt;br/&gt;Ergas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Management of the nitrogen cycle was identified by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) as one of the grand challenges of the 21st century. High ammonia strength wastewaters, such as anaerobic digestion effluents, are difficult and costly to treat in conventional biological nitrogen removal systems due to their toxicity and high oxygen requirements. The PIs overall goal is to investigate nitrogen metabolism in algal-bacterial shortcut nitrogen removal and identify the optimum conditions needed to sustain this novel process. The proposed research is significant because it has the potential to reduce the costs, energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions associated with nitrogen removal from wastewaters. The guiding hypothesis is that the close association of algae and bacteria and light/dark cycles results in conditions within biological particles that favor shortcut nitrogen removal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through interdisciplinary and international collaboration, the PIs propose to: 1) investigate the effects of varying operating conditions and substrates on system kinetics and performance, 2) investigate the microbial consortium, which includes algae, ammonia oxidizing bacteria, nitrite oxidizing bacteria, and denitrifying bacteria using molecular tools, 3) optimize the system design through coupled process-optimization modeling, and, 4) develop global competency in US students though an international collaboration. The interrelationships between nitrogen loading, light penetration and oxygen production will be studied using bench-scale SBPRs operated at varying illumination, temperature and loading rates. The presence and activities of algae nitrogen metabolizing microorganisms will be tracked via measurements of key chemical constituents and by using molecular biological tools to target functional genes encoding steps in the N cycle relevant to nitrification/ denitrification. Additional experiments will investigate the use of volatile fatty acids harvested from livestock waste fermentation as an electron donor for denitrification and coupling of partial algal-bacterial ammonia oxidation with anammox technology to improve system economics. A framework that couples an algal-bacterial shortcut nitrogen process models and an optimization models will be used to minimize system footprint with target total nitrogen removal as a constraint. The optimization model will allow the PIs to find the optimal operating conditions to minimize reactor footprint for different geographic regions. The PIs have assembled a team of researchers in the US and Netherlands with expertise in biological nitrogen removal and algae production, autotrophic bacterial physiology, and wastewater process and optimization modeling. Graduate and undergraduate students, secondary science teachers and HS students will receive training in interdisciplinary, globalized science and engineering research in developed and developing world contexts. We will build on student exchanges between University of South Florida and UNESCO-IHE in Delft, the Netherlands and University of South Florida's Peace Corps Masters International Program to gain additional resources (students, facilities, and research expertise), build developing world sustainable water treatment capacity and continue co-development of the shortcut algal-bacterial nitrogen removal process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ High ammonia strength wastewaters, such as anaerobic digestion sidestreams, livestock wastes, and industrial wastewaters, are difficult and expensive to treat in conventional treatment processes.  These treatment systems have high energy costs to supply oxygen to bacteria that convert ammonia to nitrate. In addition, high organic carbon inputs are needed for microbes that convert nitrate to nitrogen gas.  Many researchers have looked at the potential to use algae for treatment and resource recovery from these wastewaters; however, algae are very sensitive to high ammonia concentrations and their ability to assimilate nitrogen into their cells is limited.  This research investigated the use of a consortium of algae and bacteria to promote shortcut nitrogen removal in high ammonia strength wastewaters.  The process occurs naturally in photo-sequencing batch reactors (PSBRs) that experience alternating light and dark periods.  During the daytime, algae produce oxygen through photosynthesis, which stimulates ammonia oxidizing microorganisms to convert ammonia to nitrite.  During the nighttime, algae stop producing oxygen and the PSBR naturally becomes anaerobic.  An organic carbon source, such as acetate, is added to the PSBR, which stimulates denitrifying bacteria to convert nitrite to nitrogen gas.  Our guiding hypothesis was that the close association of algae and bacteria and light/dark cycles results in conditions within biological flocs that favor shortcut nitrogen removal.  Our research team set up laboratory-scale PSBRs and investigated the effects of varying mean cell residence times (5, 10, 15 days) on the algal-bacterial shortcut nitrogen removal process.  We assessed the changes in PSBR chemistry under these conditions, developed molecular biology tools and used these tools to track the expression of key genes involved in the nitrogen cycle.  We also learned that the addition of natural zeolite minerals, such as chabazite and clinoptilolite, could improve the performance of the PSBRs and produce algal biomass with intracellular storage products that could be harvested for use as a fuel, animal feed or fertilizer.  We also developed mathematical models of the algal-bacterial shortcut nitrogen removal process.  We validated the models with data from experimental studies run with varying feed compositions and light conditions.  The models provided insights into the physical, chemical and biological processes in the PSBRs and can be used as a tool for full-scale system design.  Our research team collaborated with an international partner, IHE Delft Institute for Water Education, in Delft, the Netherlands.  This collaboration facilitated the exchange of students and faculty between the two institutions, which improved their global competency.  We also collaborated with several water utilities on this project, including Hillsborough County Florida, Pinellas County Florida and DC Water in Washington DC.  Pinellas County and DC Water hosted our graduate students for extended internships.  The project supported one (1) postdoc, two (2) doctoral students, two (2) masters students, four (4) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) students, two (2) secondary science teachers through the Research Experience for Teachers (RETs) program, four (4) high school students, and one (1) volunteer intern.  In addition, two (2) MSc students from IHE Delft derived their theses from this project.  The research team published two (2) doctoral dissertations, four (4) MS theses, six (6) peer reviewed journal articles, and one (1) patent.  Two (2) journal articles are currently under review and two (2) are in preparation.  In addition, seventeen (17) papers were presented at national and international conferences and seven (7) posters were presented at regional conferences.  The research was also disseminated to the local community through the annual Engineering EXPO at USF.             Last Modified: 06/05/2021       Submitted by: Sarina J Ergas]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
