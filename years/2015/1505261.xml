<AbstractNarration>Hampton University's Targeted Infusion Project entitled - Educational Partnership in Climate Change and Sustainability (EPiCCS) - seeks to enhance the continuing partnership among the Marine &amp; Environmental Science Department at Hampton University, the Biology Department at Elizabeth City State University, and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, which is part of the College of William &amp; Mary, by supporting integrated cross-institutional research and educational experiences centered on sustainability and the effects of global climate change. These three institutions have had a long history of successful synergistic collaborations that train underrepresented undergraduate students and provide conduits and trajectories to graduate training in the geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EPiCCS proposes to support the recruitment, development, and retention of talented students at two Historically Black Universities and Colleges (HBCUs) to participate in interdisciplinary training and education on sustainability and global climate change; to improve technology and cyber infrastructure at the two HBCUs to enrich experiential inquiry-based learning, support the development of new course offerings, and modernize current offerings; to emphasize curricular training that fuses practical applications and inquiry-based research experiences to provide new opportunities for hands-on learning; to promote collaborative cross-campus cyber and peer-learning; to build essential competencies in oral and written scientific communication in the next generation of geoscientists; and to guide students toward post-graduate STEM degrees via peer and faculty mentorship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EPiCCS network will form a model of sustainability that may later be extended to other HBCUs and research partners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Education Partnership in Climate Change and Sustainability (EPiCCS) provided research and educational experiences thematically centered on sustainability and the effects of global climate change. EPiCCS built upon a partnership among Hampton University (HU), Elizabeth City State University (ECSU), University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) and the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences.  This project aimed to attract and retain underrepresented students in the sciences, educate students in areas of climate change and sustainability, support new teaching technologies and guide students toward post-graduate STEM degrees.    The grant supported the development and enhancement of courses at three HBCUs in the areas of sustainability and global climate change.  Specifically, at UMES, the new course materials in Climate Change and in the area of sustainability were incorporated into the General Environmental Science.  This course was taught during the Spring and Fall 2015 plus Spring 2016 semesters thereby exposing 50 students to Global Climate Change issues.  A new course on sustainability was introduced at UMES and taught as a one credit laboratory course.  The lab focused on renewable energy and sustainability topics.  During the course the students were exposed to how their life styles contributes to fossil fuel emissions, material on energy conservation, energy efficiency and passive designs.   The EPiCCS project funded the purchase and installation of SmartBoard technology into the classrooms at the HBCUs thus improving classroom technology.  At UMES, it supported the renovation of a laboratory in Carver Hall into a classroom that better supported the use of Student Centered Learning techniques.  In addition, the classroom was used in support of online seminars.   The EPiCCs project created research opportunities for undergraduate students.  Students were able to conduct research on topics from sea turtle strandings to habitat selection by juvenile blue crab.  These projects exposed students to the full range of science from hypotheses development, to data analyses and conclusions.  The project also helped to improve the science skills of the students through workshops on topics like how to develop a science presentations.  Students were able to present their research results and national meetings (e.g., Association of Science on Limnology and Oceanography).  Finally, this project successfully trained underrepresented undergraduates and provided paths towards graduate education. Students were able to transition from undergraduate school into graduate programs and one student has successfully completed their MS degree.
