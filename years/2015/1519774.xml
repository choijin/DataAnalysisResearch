<AbstractNarration>This project will support the participation of students and early career faculty and professionals in an inaugural broader engagement program at the SIAM CSE15 conference. Specific conference activities that will comprise the broader engagement program include The Workshop Celebrating Diversity, Professional Development Days, Student Days, and a Career Fair. The Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) 2015 Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE15) is a biannual event with approximately 1300 attendees. Given that level of participation, bringing a modest size cohort of students and faculty into CSE represents a unique opportunity to blend the ideas of community building and critical mass with integration into the mainstream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will provide CSE15 participants scientific training, mentoring, and career and professional development.  The program will serve as a pilot project to test the model as a technique to apply proven methods of engaging people from under-represented communities in mainstream scientific and engineering communities.  This project will directly impact the broadening of computing and computational science participants.  The program attendees will be recruited from populations traditionally underrepresented: women, under-represented minorities, first-generation students, and people with disabilities and people serving these communities.  The project will increase the participation in a major technical conference of people traditionally underrepresented in the field and provide important and meaningful mentoring and professional development opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Transforming Broader Engagement (BE) from SC to SIAM CSE15 project provided scientific training, mentoring, and career and professional development to 40 students, faculty, and professionals from under-represented groups by supporting their attendance at the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) 2015 Computational Science and Engineering (CSE15) conference.  The project attendees were recruited from populations traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM): women, under-represented minorities, first-generation students, and people with disabilities and people serving these communities.  In addition to attending the CSE15 technical conference sessions, participants attended sessions developed to provide academic and psychosocial support and career, professional, and leadership development.  Activities included a mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; program, a poster judging contest designed to teach students the what makes a good poster presentation, community building activities aimed at assisting participants get to know each other and members of the CSE15 community, a motivational workshop, a room to meet with mentors and other participants and a workshop to develop professional skills.  Data from a survey of participants indicate a very positive project response and impact.  When asked about their expectations, 90-100% of responses were affirmative. One-hundred percent of respondents indicated they would recommend the program to others and 95% of respondents indicated they would attend another BE program provided the timing and funding was available.  All BE and conference activities received the highest or second highest rating out of four; no low ratings were indicated.  A comparison of a variety of factors ranging from confidence in pursuing research interests to confidence in developing a successful career demonstrated that for all points of comparison, confidence increased after the program.  Nearly all participants in the mentor prot&eacute;g&eacute; program met at least once on their own with 67% of respondents meeting more than once during the conference.  Ninety-six percent of mentors and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s said their expectations were met and 80% said they gained valuable and/or unexpected experiences.  The project directly impacted the broadening of computing and computational science participants in STEM fields.  The project increased the participation in a major technical conference of people traditionally underrepresented in the field and provided important and meaningful mentoring and professional development opportunities.
