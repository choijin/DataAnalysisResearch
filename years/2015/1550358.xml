<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;A non-technical description explaining the broader significance of the project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extreme rainfall events are significant shapers of landscapes in arid regions. However, the processes of flood generation and the relative importance of various landscape components in producing and conducting the water flow is relatively unknown. This RAPID project provides a rare opportunity to use previously-collected data together with new observations and remote-sensing information to examine the response of different types of arid landscape features to sudden, heavy rainfall. Knowledge of landscape response to these extreme events will aid in planning for communities in these regions, since flash flooding is a common result and the source of the water is often unpredictable. The project involves collaboration with Chilean scientists. The results will go beyond the immediate are of the Atacama Desert that is the site of the investigation and encompasses the semi-arid regions of the US and other parts of the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A technical description of the project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID project will use previous research along a transect of the Atacama Desert to test the hypothesis that as the imprint of chronic hyper-aridity increases on the landscape due to the accumulation of salt and dust, the landscape becomes more  resistant to runoff and overland flow from rainfall. Conversely, the nearly plant-less but relatively salt-free environments at the desert margin may be subject to rapid runoff and the generation of new fluvial features such as fans and mudflows. The recent rainfall is a rare opportunity to build on earlier investigations and to develop knowledge of the different landscape responses to a locally extraordinary event.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Atacama Desert contains the driest regions on Earth, and significant rainfall may occur a few times per century based on sparse historical records. However, the geological frequency and magnitude of rainfall remains speculative. On March 24-26 of 2015, an unusual storm caused rainfall rates and quantities that matched or exceeded many historical records. Of interest is whether this storm was able to activate geomorphic processes whose impacts are evident in numerous landscape features. Here, the results of a reconnaissance N to S transect through the plant-free expanse of the Atacama Desert, between 22 and 26&#730; S, are examined in relation to evidence of past fluvial activity. The results suggest the recent rains initiated some minor fluvial responses on the upland landscapes. However, the rainfall was too small to reactivate many features that appear to be driven by larger storms that must occur less frequently over time. The field evidence suggests that larger scale rainfalls have occurred throughout the Quaternary, and that there are fossilized (or infrequently active) features in various stages of &ldquo;repair&rdquo; that provide evidence of rainfall re-occurrence. The soils in the lifeless portion of the Atacama desert have unique hydraulic properties; in most arid regions, a rainfall of this magnitude and intensity would cause flash flooding, while in this region due to the salt rich soils, infiltration is high and the landscape is more resilient to intensive rainfall events. However, based on the apparently fossilized geomorphic and hydrological features on the landscape, there is a rainfall threshold, whose magnitude remains uncertain, above which this landscape undergoes alteration and fluvial reshaping.&nbsp;<strong><ins datetime="2019-09-12T16:25" cite="mailto:Marco%20Pfeiffer%20Jakob">&nbsp;</ins></strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Ronald&nbsp;Amundson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
