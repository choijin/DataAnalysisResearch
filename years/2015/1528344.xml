<AbstractNarration>SES-1528344&lt;br/&gt;Prema Kurien&lt;br/&gt;Syracuse University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to uncover the factors that influence the form that mobilization takes, whether it is "ethnic," "racial," or "religious." It examines how different opportunity structures (both national and local) and differences in the characteristics of the groups shape how they frame their grievances and mobilize. Focusing on Hindu and Sikh communities and advocacy organizations serving these groups in Toronto, Vancouver, New York/New Jersey, and northern California, this project is being conducted both through interviews and analysis of available information about the organizations.  The PI will complete interviews with community activists, other members who are closely involved with the community, and with academic experts.  The PI will also conduct an analysis of newspaper and media articles, materials produced by the advocacy organizations, and materials discussing differences in opportunity structures and the characteristics of the two groups in North America. This research will contribute to a better understanding of why diasporic groups in different countries might or might not support particular types of long-distance nationalism.  Ethnic nationalism and inter-group tensions can also lead to violence in host countries and is of concern to Western states, as well. More broadly, this project will reveal the factors shaping the very different patterns of civic activism and integration of immigrant groups from religious minority backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This project contributes to civic incorporation and social movement theories by examining the reasons for the differential mobilization of two important religious minority groups--individuals of Hindu and Sikh background. Hindus and Sikhs have broadly similar patterns of migration to the U.S. and Canada and have close ties with their compatriots across the border, but manifest divergent political activism profiles both within and between the two countries. Dominant paradigms of social incorporation emphasize the opportunity structure of the host country or the characteristics of groups in explaining differences in involvement. However, neither paradigm can satisfactorily explain both inter-country differences between the mobilization of varying religious groups in Canada and the United States and the intra-country differences between the public visibility and activism of the two groups. This research aims to uncover the factors that influence the form that mobilization takes. The study of "negative cases" (the relative lack of mobilization of Hindus in Canada and Sikhs and Sri Lankan Tamils in the U.S.) will help to clarify the relationships between the different factors shaping civic involvement and integration. Some scholars have argued that there has been a shift in group mobilization patterns over time from class, to race/ethnicity, to religion, based on research on Muslims in Europe. This project demonstrates, however, that the global resurgence of religion does not necessarily mean that individuals from the same religious background with group-based grievances will mobilize around a public religious identity. The study examines how different political opportunity structures (both national and local) and differences in the characteristics   of the groups shape how they frame their grievances and mobilize.</AbstractNarration>
