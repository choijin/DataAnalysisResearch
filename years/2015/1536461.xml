<AbstractNarration>The workshop entitled Monsoons and Inter-tropical Convergence Zones (ITCZ): the annual cycle in the Holocene and the future will be held at Columbia University, September 15-18, 2015. It will foster interactions between scientists versed in paleo climate observations and modeling, theorists of the general circulation of the atmosphere, experts in convection and the organization of rain-bearing disturbances, and climate modelers and climate scientists focusing on future projections. The workshop will provide a forum for a lively exchange of ideas between eminent leaders in the field, early career scientists, and participating students from both the host institution and nearby institutions, including those with high minority enrollment, such as the City University of New York. NSF support will go towards support for the participation by students and postdoctoral scholars, in particular from groups underrepresented in science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus will be on modeling and theoretical understanding of the annual cycle of oceanic ITCZ and land monsoons in the present climate, the past, and the future. Coupled General Circulation Models fail to accurately reproduce the position and strength of the Tropical precipitation maxima both in the current climate and in the past. Talks will be posted on the symposium website after the event, and a summary article highlighting the conclusions of the workshop will be published.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the participation of 15 early-career scientists (PhD candidates and Post-Docs) to a 4-day workshop on ``Monsoons and the ITCZ: the annual cycle in the Holocene and the future'', held at Columbia University in the city of New York on September 15th through the 18th, 2015.    Understanding and predicting rainfall changes over tropical land constitute a pressing and formidable challenge; viewing the monsoons as facets of the planetary circulation is the critical first step. In the zonal mean, the tropical rain belt---i.e., the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ)---is governed by  energetic arguments that allow us to determine its movements from hemispheric  asymmetries in the atmospheric energy budget. Over many continental regions,  however, regional rainfall is not well described by the longitudinal mean and  involves geostrophic monsoon circulations. Moreover, state-of-the-art climate models have  known systematic biases in their simulations of the monsoons in today's climate and, as indicated by evidence  from paleoclimate records of the Holocene, in their response to external forcings.   Presentations and discussion at the workshop argued that, in order to make progress in our understanding and simulation of the monsoons, we need to extend the energy budget framework to encompass the  complexities of monsoon dynamics, i.e. zonal asymmetries, land versus ocean differences in surface fluxes, and the  variable character of convective cloud systems. This integrates our understanding at all relevant scales: from  global circulations  down to the fine details of how moisture and energy are lifted vertically in  the updrafts of thunderclouds.
