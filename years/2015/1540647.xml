<AbstractNarration>PI: Bush, Tamara    &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Michigan State University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Undergraduate Design Competition at the Summer Biomechanics, Bioengineering and Biotransport Conference, June 17-20, 2015 in Snowbird, UT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Undergraduate Design Competition in Rehabilitative and Assistive Devices will be held at the 2015 Summer Biomechanics, Biotransport and Bioengineering Conference (SB3C 2015) in Utah on June 17-20.  In this competition, undergraduate student teams (usually at a junior/senior level) from across the nation submit an initial abstract with their prototype idea and design for a device that addresses a need in rehabilitation or assistive devices. A cohort of faculty who have design experience review and score the abstract submissions.  Based on these scores, the top six teams (approximately 30 students and their mentors) are invited to attend the conference and present their device, design, and business case at a special podium session.  The team presentations are scored by a set of judges, including faculty and industrial representatives. The undergraduate design competition will impact many undergraduate students and their faculty mentors across the country.  This competition provides a national venue (with many international attendees) for teams to showcase their innovations in the areas of rehabilitation and assistive devices. Undergraduate students attending the conference will participate in a research-driven event with technical sessions, workshops and presentations by faculty, clinicians and industrial representatives who have expertise in device design, rehabilitation, disabilities, and numerous other areas. Attendance at the conference provides valuable networking opportunities for the students, including contacts for graduate school and employment. The inclusion of the competition at the conference also exposes attendees to innovative solutions for needs of individuals with disabilities, or those undergoing rehabilitation.  The inclusion of the undergraduate design competition at SB3C goes beyond the standard senior design projects, offering the opportunity for students to attend an international conference within the US, give a podium presentation, and exchange ideas with internationally recognized researchers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Undergraduate Design Competition in Rehabilitative and Assistive Devices will be held at the 2015 Summer Biomechanics, Biotransport and Bioengineering Conference (SB3C). The opportunity for students to participate in this competition offers many benefits. SB3C will promote state-of-the-art research, collaboration, and scientific discourse in the broad field of bioengineering with focus on Biomechanics and Biotransport.  Undergraduate students attending the conference, through their involvement in the competition, will learn about bio-solid mechanics, bio-fluid mechanics, device design, rehabilitation, cellular and molecular mechanics, functional tissue engineering, bio-heat and mass transfer, and bioengineering education. Numerous podium sessions, poster sessions, workshops and plenary talks are designed to engage and excite the attendees including the session for the undergraduate design competition.  Further, the students will have opportunities to showcase their innovative devices in the areas of rehabilitation and assistive devices with conference attendees, and discuss the potential of these devices with other faculty and innovators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal funded an undergraduate design competition in the area of Rehabilitation and Assistive Devices at the Summer Biomechanics, Bioengineering and Biotransport Conference (SB3C) in Snowbird, Utah in June 2015. This grant was used to help offset prototype and travel costs to the conference for the  top six teams who were selected via a review process from all the entries.  At the conference, the teams presented their designs, prototypes, and business findings in a special podium session.   Not only were the undergraduate students able to disseminate their knowledge and showcase their innovations, but they were also educating the attendees on needs of people who require assistive devices or rehabilitation.  The students and their advisors were exposed to research in an array of topics related to biomechanics and biotransport in a variety of forms &ndash; from workshops to technical sessions, and plenary talks by faculty renowned in their field.  Clinicians and industrial representatives were also at the conference and talked with students about assistive device design, rehabilitation, and disabilities. This competition provided a specific avenue for participation of undergraduate students at the conference.  As participants in the conference, they were exposed  to state-of-the-art research, networking opportunities, and were able to talk with contacts for graduate school and/or employment. For most of the undergraduate participants, this was their first technical conference.  Teams provided followup e-mails experssing their gratitude for the event and indiating the powerful impact the event had on them. Statements such as "eye-opening", "and exciting event that we will not soon forget" were provided by the undergraduates following the event.   Further, as part of the undergraduate design competition, teams participated in the sharing of ideas and innovations around rehabilitative and assistive devices. This sharing occured across teams of students and faculty mentors as well as with other conference attendees.  Through their participation, students met attendees from a variety of backgrounds and engaged in discussions in not only topics of rehabilitation and device design, but others including biomechanics, biotransport and bioengineering education.  The competition information was featured in the ASME Bioengineering Division newsletter and also on the ASME web site.  Details of the products from the winning teams can be located in the SB3C conference proceedings under the Undergraduate Design Competition Podium Session.
