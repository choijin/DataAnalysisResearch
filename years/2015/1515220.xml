<AbstractNarration>Single-celled organisms, such as protists and bacteria, inhabit fluctuating environments where nutrient availability isn't always guaranteed. To cope with this "feast or famine" uncertainty, cells have evolved processes that allow them to respond appropriately by growing and dividing when nutrients are present (proliferation), or by becoming dormant and adopting an energy-conserving state when starved (quiescence). This project utilizes a single-celled reference organism, the green alga Chlamydomonas, to investigate how molecular switches that govern proliferation and quiescence are controlled and how they are coordinated to ensure that they don't interfere with each other. Microorganisms like these can accumulate large quantities of valuable compounds, e.g. oils, but only when starved. It is anticipated that knowledge about the molecular switches governing transitions between the states of proliferation and quiescence will allow predictions about how these states can be controlled and engineered. Thus, newly discovered details about these molecular switches provide potential engineering strategies to uncouple high yields of valuable compounds from starvation responses. Students and postdoctoral fellows from the two research locations will collaborate to identify and model the interactions between key regulators of quiescence and proliferation that have counterparts in many other species including plants and animals. The diversity of approaches and quantitative training components prepare the trainees for science careers in industry or academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long term goal of this project is to gain a predictive understanding of how nutrient and metabolic cues are integrated into coherent decisions that control life cycle state transitions. In the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, two nuclear protein complexes, CHT7-C and RB-C, have been identified that govern the transitions between nutrient-deprivation induced quiescence, cell growth, and commitment to cell division. It is hypothesized that the quiescence regulator CHT7-C, and the cell cycle commitment regulator RB-C form an interlocking transcriptional network that coordinately controls cell growth and division responses to nutrient or metabolic cues. The objectives of this project are to: (1) characterize purified CHT7-C and RB-C complexes in order to define their subunit composition and modifications under different life cycle states; (2) Identify CHT7-C and RB-C target genes followed by generation of a transcriptional network model to observe common nodes that functionally couple the two complexes; (3) combine mutations affecting different components of the two complexes into isogenic lines to obtain synthetic phenotypes that provide insights into function and interrelation of the two complexes in vivo; and (4) build a testable logic switch model and develop quantitative markers to test and revise the model. The collaborative approach taken for studying the interactions between quiescence and cell proliferation regulators is aimed at transforming the understanding of the networks that establish and maintain coordinated global responses to metabolic and nutritional cues.</AbstractNarration>

To cope with this ?feast or famine? uncertainty cells have evolved metabolic programs that allow them to respond appropriately by growing and dividing when nutrients are present (proliferation), or by becoming dormant and adopting an energy-conserving state when starved (quiescence). Under this award we investigated molecular switches governing transitions between the cellular states of proliferation and quiescence in the model unicellular alga, Chlamydomonas, controlled by two conserved regulators of gene expression, the retinoblastoma complex (RBC) and the CHT7 complex (CHT7C). We made the unexpected finding that the Chlamydomonas RBC most likely does not control the cell cycle through activation of cell division genes as its counterparts do in other organisms. This result led us to investigate alternative means by which RBC functions to control cell division in Chlamydomonas. To do so we developed tools for purifying Chlamydomonas RBC and analyzing its composition across the cell division cycle, and we also developed methods for investigating whether RBC might influence packaging of DNA as an alternative means of regulating cell cycle progression. Using these tools, we confirmed an association between RBC and CHT7 and discovered additional components of the RBC that might help mediate its role in gating cell cycle progression. These included discovery of interactions with an essential cell cycle regulator, BSL1, and with another conserved protein that may coordinate cellular growth capacity with genome replication. We tested whether RBC might be controlled by phosphorylation, a protein modification that governs its activity in other organisms, and found that we could alter its activity by replacing the endogenous RB protein with a version that cannot be phosphorylated. In summary, our work has led us to a revised view of the RBC and how it might interact with CHT7C. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, RBC is unlikely to govern the activation of cell cycle genes, and may work largely independently of CHT7C to control cell cycle progression through DNA packaging or other means, while CHT7C does appear to play a critical role in ensuring that cell cycle genes are repressed during starvation. Results from this project have led to additional avenues of investigation to more deeply examine the impact of RBC on DNA packaging into chromatin during the cell division cycle, and on potential mediators of cell division that act on or through changes in chromatin such as histone protein modifications.</p> <p>Broader impacts: Many microorganisms including microalgae can accumulate large quantities of storage compounds such as triacylglycerols, but only when starved. This conundrum hampers efforts towards the efficient generation of industrial feedstocks. Our data provided insight into how two conserved regulators, RBC and CHT7, interact to limit proliferation and growth under starvation conditions. Our finding that the RBC probably does not potentiate the activity of the CHT7 complex helps establish CHT7C as a candidate target for engineering strains that uncouple cell proliferation signals from neutral lipid accumulation.
