<AbstractNarration>Recent discoveries of early human ancestors (hominins) highlight the importance of understanding how climate shaped early hominin evolution and behavior. This project will study the ways in which hominin distributions and behavior were shaped by local habitats between 3.2 and 3.6 million years ago in eastern Africa. Data about modern plant and animal diversity will be integrated with paleoecological data for the ancient environment of the same area. The innovative combination of data sources will help to reconstruct ancient ecology at finer-grained time intervals. Broader impacts of the project include graduate training, public science outreach through museums and curriculum development, and support of underrepresented minority students in the STEM sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, current vegetation (isotopes from soil carbonates) and fossil mammal databases will be standardized to make analytical connections between ancient habitats and their associated mammal communities and to gain insight into variation of the hominin ecological niche. The investigators will combine theory from multiple disciplines, such as landscape archaeology, macroecology, and taphonomy, and conduct analytical experiments to connect hominins to environmental proxies (such as soil isotopes) at an appropriate temporal and spatial scale. The proposed ecological relationships are especially important to test in the mid-Pliocene (between 3.6 and 3.2 million years ago), when dietary behavior shifted significantly and innovative behaviors may have occurred, such as the use of stone tools in the Afar basin. Data from the project will be curated to promote the integration of future ecological proxies and data through the use of an open source database that will be created by the co-PI, using PostgreSQL software. The co-PI collaborates with the Koobi Fora Field School and the Evolution in Education program at the George Washington University (GWU) to develop curricula for students from pre-school to university levels, and is also the co-developer of the Young Empowered Scientists (YES!) program at GWU to bring underrepresented, minority students into STEM sciences through mentoring.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our middle-Pliocene ancestors (hominins), those alive during the period of 3.6&mdash;3 million-years-ago, are rare in highly forested environments. Though this statement may sound simple, it adds an important component to the growing evidence that our early human ancestors, such as <em>Australopithecus afarensis </em>and <em>Kenyanthropus platyops</em>, preferred the expanding grassland and savanna ecosystems of eastern Africa. The research from this dissertation contributed to this knowledge by comparing the abundance of early hominins and other large mammals from four middle Pliocene sites as well as by analyzing the geochemistry of soil to reconstruct the vegetation at hominin sites. Another fascinating outcome of this research is that Pliocene eastern Africa was likely substantially more wooded relative to modern African environments, which supports global climate models that suggest that this region was also wetter throughout this period than it is today. That the rift valley of eastern Africa may have been more forested and productive as compared to the modern eastern Africa, supports a hypothesis that the hominins thrived and diversified in the middle Pliocene due to their exploitation of mixed woodland and grassland habitats, which was a change from earlier hominins, who likely depended on woodland resources, much like modern-day chimps.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This dissertation project also supported the research of numerous undergraduate and graduate students from the United States, Kenya, and Ethiopia due to the Co-PIs involvement in the Koobi Fora Field School&rsquo;s research and training program. Students at the Koobi Fora field school were a mix of international students, underrepresented minority students, many of which were present because of an NSF IRES scholarship, and those who could afford to pay tuition. All students were taught both neo-ecology and paleoecology at the field school using the data collected during this dissertation. Further, the Co-PI, also an underrepresented minority in science, worked one-on-one with two undergraduates and one graduate student to complete independent research projects based on the questions and methods proposed for this dissertation. All three students presented their research at professional meetings and used their research experience to develop their own projects and, in the case of the undergraduates, apply to and attend graduate school. Further, published data from this project will be available on earthchem.org. Thus, this project contributed both new geochemical data that can be used for future ecological analyses of Pliocene eastern Africa, as well as trained a new generation of STEM scholars for a future of research and academic contribution. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Amelia&nbsp;Villasenor</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1534824/1534824_10383709_1512106308285_IMG_0543--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1534824/1534824_10383709_1512106308285_IMG_0543--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Dissertation site map"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1534824/1534824_10383709_1512106308285_IMG_0543--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Dissertation site map"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Map of the study sites: Red diamonds mark the location of East Turkana, West Turkana, and Omo-Shungura within the Turkana Basin, Kenya and Hadar within the Afar Basin, Ethiopia.</div> <div class="imageCredit">A.
