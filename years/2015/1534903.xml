<AbstractNarration>Enhanced geothermal systems are potentially a major contributor to the nation's supply of clean, sustainable energy.  An enhanced geothermal reservoir is an engineered subsurface heat exchanger designed to improve a conventional hydrothermal reservoir, or to create a circulation system where hot reservoir rocks have low permeability.  This is most often done by injection of pressurized fluids.  This injection has been shown to induce seismicity. Understanding why injection-induced seismicity occurs is fundamental for utilizing this resource.  Understanding the mechanisms of induced seismicity is also necessary for the exploitation of the country's rich deposits of shale gas, and for carbon sequestration.  Because the in situ mechanisms of injection induced seismicity are so complex, there still is a lack of deep understanding.  The project will carry out a set of experiments in very specialized equipment that can model the Geysers geothermal field.  This will bring the understanding needed to engineer for the mechanisms behind induced seismicity so that subsurface injection of fluids for energy resources can be used without causing earthquakes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is based on a carefully designed sequence of tests, each informing the next.  The first stage is the investigation of the effects of fault unloading vs. increased shear loading on foreshocks and rupture.  Preliminary work by Glaser shows that the dynamics are quite different.  These experiments will take place in a laboratory earthquake machine.  The next set of experiments will take place in the Glaser lab's true-triaxial geothermal reservoir simulator. Integral to this device is a high pressure boiler that floods 250 mm cubes of rock with 2 MPa steam, duplicating the Geysers field. Specimens will be fractured to represent a rock mass rather than a solid cube of rock.  We will investigate the effects of thermal contraction, and injected water flashing to steam, as proximate causes of fault weakening.  Both through-going and growing hydraulic fractures will be modeled.  The dynamic asperity-level displacement "seeds" that lead to macro-rupture will be studied through nano-seismic imaging.  This is made possible by absolutely-calibrated nanoseismic sensors, which have a noise floor of 0.2 pm.  Over many years, laboratory analysis methodologies have been developed based on tools used by seismologists, to accurately measure absolute metrics of rupture kinematics, including the source-time function to mN sensitivity.  Because similar tools are used to study seismicity at the Geysers, it is possible to reasonably scale our results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) have been increasingly exploited as they provide an alternative and virtually unlimited energy source. The energy extraction process requires injection of water that can induce microearthquakes on pre-existing faults. Larger than expected earthquakes are induced, for example, in Basel, Switzerland in 2006 and in Pohang, South Korea in 2017, which caused public backlash to the EGS projects. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanism of triggered earthquakes during geothermal energy extraction.  In this study, we employ a 2D thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) coupled hybrid finite-discrete element method (FDEM) to investigate fault slip induced by injecting cold water to a critically loaded, hot, fault under geothermal environment. We systematically study the influence of different variables including fluid temperature, pressure, and injection rate, fracture aperture, fault roughness, and ambient conditions such as in situ stresses and temperature.  Simulation results suggest that injection of cool water causes fault surface temperature decreases exponentially over time, and the decreasing rate decay as the system approaches an equilibrium. The largest temperature decrease is at the injection point and the amount of temperature decrease (&Delta;T) declines away from the injection. Fault aperture is positively related to &Delta;T, and the effective normal stress on fault is negatively related to &Delta;T. As a result, thermal contraction can induce kPa scale reduction of the effective normal stress on the fault. These results suggest that cool injection water can cause the fault surfaces to contract, decreasing normal stress on the fault, leading to sliding of critically stressed faults.  The experiment suggests that thermal contraction can lead to sliding of critically stressed faults. This may explain the unexpected induced earthquakes in geothermal reservoirs. This experiment also implies that thermal effect is an important aspect to consider to alleviate induced earthquakes during geothermal energy extraction. Injection rate and fluid temperature need to be considered alongside in situ rock properties to avoid unexpected induced earthquakes due to thermal contraction.  We provide a complete measurement of energy budget of a laboratory earthquake, which on its own is a significant contribution. Our observations help to link microscopic and macroscopic fracturing processes to the energy budget obtained in structural geology, rock mechanics and seismology, improving our understanding of earthquake physics.  We also developed machine learning algorithms for locating acoustic emissions. Our method effectively solves the problem of relocating acoustic emission on a surface with unknown material properties.
