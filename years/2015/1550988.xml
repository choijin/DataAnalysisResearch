<AbstractNarration>The human brain is remarkably adept at integrating information from the different senses to create rich representations of the world. For example, understanding what a dog is can involve information not only about how the dog looks and acts, but also about how it sounds, feels, and even smells. Consequently, one sense, such as hearing, can exert an influence on processing in another, such as vision. There has been some suggestion from prior research that this is why deaf children often struggle to process some types of visual information. However, this may not be due to a direct effect of lack of hearing on vision. Deaf children often have delayed exposure to language, which may also influence how children's visual processing develops. The effects of language exposure and auditory deprivation can be disentangled by studying deaf children who are exposed to a natural visual language - American Sign Language. This project will provide information about how hearing and language influence vision during development, and will also provide information about how deaf children come to learn about the world around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred and fifty deaf children aged 6-13 years, who vary in both their hearing loss and their exposure to American Sign Language, will be followed longitudinally for 2-3 years. During the first wave of data collection, each child's audiological profile, ASL skills and language background, and nonverbal IQ will be assessed. At each of four waves of data collection, their ability to process sequential streams of visual information will be measured. Moderation analyses will be used to determine the effects of hearing loss and natural language exposure and skill on the development of this visual processing ability. In doing so, the researchers will be able to test competing hypotheses about the basis for visual sequence processing deficits in deaf children.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research literature suggests that deaf children struggle to pay attention to visual information. In particular, their ability to sustain their visual attention has been extensively researched. There have also been research reports to indicate that deaf children are more impulsive than their hearing peers, and that they struggle more with working memory demands - holding information in mind and consciously manipulating it. These cognitive abilities - sustained attention, impulsivity, working memory - are often discussed under the umbrella term "executive functions".  The purpose of this project was falsify the theory that it is deafness that leads to deficits in executive functions. We also sought evidence to support the proposal that it is language that plays a crucial role. That is, deaf children struggle with executive functions because they do not have fully developed language, nit because they cannot hear and access the auditory world around them.  We followed a group of over 100 deaf children for three years, spanning the ages 6 to 13 years. By testing the same children repeatedly, we were able to chart how their executive functions grew over time. Our question was whether that growth was predicted by their hearing loss, or by their ability to understand language - either spoken or signed.  Our main findings are as follows:  (1) Hearing loss - as measured by how loud a sound must be for it be heard by the child - has no relationship with their executive function development. A lack of hearing does not have a negative impact on the visual processing of information in deaf children.  (2) The best predictors of sustained attention, impulsivity and working memory are receptive language skills. Whether signed or spoken, the better a deaf child's language, the better their cognitive ability.  (3) Early exposure to a sign language reduces levels of impulsivity in deaf children. Even after controlling for receptive signing skills, deaf children who learned ASL earlier in life were better at controlling impulsive responses than were those who learned ASL later in life.  (4) Despite previous claims in the literature, deaf children were as able to learn visual sequences of colors (like in the electronic Simon game) as hearing children, provided that they had good receptive ASL skills. Again, deafness does not impact learning, it is a negative consequence of not being exposed to accessible language early in life.  (5) The deaf children performed well academically in reading, mathematics, and reasoning. Their performance on these measures was predicted by their language abilities, but not by their executive functions.  Together, these findings falsify theories that predicate poor cognition in deaf children on a lack of access to sound. They provide data which suggests language is an important predictor of executive functions in deaf children, with early access to a natural signed language (such as ASL) providing a pathway for health cognition alongside no detectable negative impacts on oral or written language.
