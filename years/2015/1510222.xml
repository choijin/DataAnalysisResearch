<AbstractNarration>1511791(Chelliah)/1511520(Cutler)/1510222(Edwards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-speed and supersonic combustion is of vital importance to high-speed transport.  The research team comprised of experimentalist and numerical modelers will try to understand, using a unique facility and state-of-art numerical models, how fuel burning at such high speed happens and how stable combustion can be achieved.  A team of undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the research and the data and results will be widely published. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand the flame stabilization mechanism requires the understanding flame structure resulting from the interaction between the chemical reaction, which releases heat, and the flow.  Under high-speed conditions, the flow is turbulent.  The proposal focuses on this interaction under supersonic conditions where compressibility also plays a role.  The flow geometry chosen is high-speed reacting shear flow over cavity, which is commonly believed to be a good candidate for supersonic combustion and propulsion. The proposed facility (located at the lead PI's institution - UVa) is unique, which has been developed over the past decades and is well and appropriately leveraged for the proposed research. Fundamental data on flame structure and statistics on key species are to be obtained experimentally. Computational results using DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation) will supplement the experiments to provide additional information not accessible from experiments in developing submodels, which can be used in the future development of high-speed propulsion combustors. The experimental data are of archival value. Close collaboration proposed with researchers from government labs would likely amplify its usefulness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is a joint effort conducted in collaboration with researchers at the University of Virginia, George Washington University, and Sandia National Labs The focus is the study of premixed flame propagation in high Mach number, high turbulence intensity environments, with a goal being to minimize combustor length within dual mode scramjet engines.  The NCSU team, consisting of Dr. Jack R. Edwards and Tanner B. Nielsen (now employed at LaNL) conducted several large-eddy simulations of the reactive flow of ethylene within two rigs tested at the University of Virginia.   The first rig stabilized a premixed flame at the lip of a large cavity.  Fuel was injected at the upstream end of an isolator section; shock-induced turbulence amplification helped mix the fuel, resulting in a nearly uniform premixed state upstream of the cavity.  Dual mode operation, characterized by the presence of a shock train in the isolator, was attained by the formation of a thermal throat in a straight-walled portion of the combustor.    NCSU simulations were conducted using a new version of the REACTMB flow solver that incorporated a novel matrix-partitioning strategy to reduce the expense of solution advancement in time by upwards of a factor of three for the moderately large (22 &ndash; 26 species) reaction sets employed in this study.   The proper modeling of heat retention within the rig was found to be crucial for sustaining a stable operating point.   Simulation results were compared with available CARS, wall pressure, SPIV, and OH-PLIF measurements and were found to capture experimental observations with high precision.    The second rig scaled down the cavity, which was located within an insert suspended from one wall of the tunnel.     The down-scaling was done to permit eventual DNS simulations of the cavity response by researchers at Sandia.   The NCSU team conducted several LES simulations of this rig using a combination body-fitted mesh / immersed boundary strategy to render the cavity insert.    Air throttling was necessary to stabilize the shock train, and later experiments and simulations used the air throttle as a means of fixing the shock train at a specific location.  Fuel was injected through on one side of the isolator section, meaning that stratification effects were present.   The REACTMB framework was modified to include several modes of heat transfer through the various surfaces comprising the rig.  This included transient wall conduction through surfaces coated by Zirconia and through glass-walled surfaces used to permit flow visualization.  An accurate capturing of the heat retention effect was found to be crucial for capturing a stable flame response.   Agreement between LES predictions and experimental CARS, SPIV, wall pressure, and OH-PLIF measurements was again satisfactory, with the most notable deficiency being a general under-prediction of the blockage effects caused by shock / boundary layer interactions in the isolator.  The combustor was found to operate in the classical thin reaction zone regime, and the flame propagation angle was well-predicted by a correlation from Peters.    Analysis of cavity residence time distributions showed the expected three-fold reduction in the most probable residence time compared with the large cavity but that the residence time was long enough to permit flame stabilization within the cavity.   One student (Tanner Nielsen) was supported under this grant.  Tanner received his Ph.D in December of 2018 and is now employed at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
