<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Fisk University seeks to develop and implement a two-semester integrated course-laboratory experience in polymer chemistry as an alternative to the traditional General Chemistry two-semester course for undergraduate students. The lecture/discussion and research-embedded laboratories will be interdependently linked to serve as a basis for engendering excitement about the impact that scientific discovery has on society and to build research skills that would be relevant for students' continued engagement in research as an undergraduate STEM major and beyond. Fisk students are disproportionately under-represented minorities; thus increasing student interest and efficacy in STEM will have the direct effect of broadening participation in STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed project is to further enhance student learning and academic outcomes in Chemistry, and to increase student retention in STEM. Specifically, the goals are to: 1) deepen student learning of core concepts in General Chemistry via an Introduction to Polymer Chemistry two semester course sequence integrated with authentic research as an option for meeting the requirements for General Chemistry; 2) develop enduring materials to permit replication of this course (classroom, laboratory and Supplementary Instruction) nationally; and 3) utilize assessment of student outcomes, broadly defined, as embedded educational research. The benefits of achieving the goals of this project include increased student deeper learning of fundamental concepts in General Chemistry, whetting students' interest in STEM fields as a major and as a career.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this HBCU-UP TIP proposal was intended to increase the number of students at Fisk University, an historically black institution, who pursue research in STEM careers post-graduation and who evidence deep learning of basic concepts by applying them in novel situations.

Ongoing enhancement of the course has occurred in response to student evaluation and faculty perception.</p> <p>In CHEM 113P, two of the three weekly lecture periods were designated for discussion of traditional course materials while the third period was designated as &ldquo;Polymer Fridays&rdquo;, where Polymer Chemistry concepts were taught to prepare for weekly laboratory sessions.&nbsp; Though the initial CHEM 103P associated laboratory used a highly structured research readiness format, the second iteration of CHEM 103P made students employee/share-holders of a pseudo company, PolyNat LLC, who worked in research teams to design and characterize an innovative polyamide membrane for desalination of water. Inter-dependence among the three-member lab groups included expecting each team to identify roles for their colleagues: Senior Scientist, Analytical Chemist, and Polymer Chemist, and assign project duties accordingly. Weekly tasks, like reagent &lsquo;ordering&rsquo;, required proactive engagement as well as critical thinking to apply class concepts to experimental designs. We intended for students to feel a little uncomfortable at times in lab and to experience temporary failure in order to help them figure out what to do when, as is necessary in discovery science. Progress in design, synthesis and characterization was monitored by 5 min pre-lab team reports, for instructor and peer feedback, and submission of weekly reports, which also improved oral and communication skills. A final report also was required.</p> <p>The CHEM 114P Spring course involved more in-depth research, as the students identified their own polymers of interest, working from primary journals for synthesis and characterization insights, and requiring a brief proposal to be completed and improved by the instructor before beginning in the laboratory. Student communication of their research goals, strategies, and outcomes occurred during the Fisk University Research Symposium, where their constructed posters were graded on all-team member participation, clarity of presentation, and ability to answer questions about their work.&nbsp;</p> <p>Assessments through-out the polymer-focused course included a pre-lab quizzes for newly introduced instrumentation, feedback on proposals, poster abstracts, weekly data update reports, and laboratory notebooks.

It is premature to know the relationship between taking this course and post-Fisk STEM training and careers.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Initially we observed that polymer students obtained course averages lower or comparable to those in the traditional course. Development of a lab course where students were considered employees <strong>seeking to fulfill a goal and not students trying to get a grade</strong> proved to be the key to improve understanding of core concepts and critical thinking skills.&nbsp; Ultimately the academic performance of students in the polymer based course exceeded that of those in the traditional course, where students take the same exams, resulting in 14% (CHEM 113P) and 10% (CHEM 114P) higher average grades, respectively.&nbsp;</p> <p>Student comments reflect their appreciation for the courses, based on evaluation statements that included: &ldquo;learning how to use different lab equipment and being exposed to what chemistry research is like&rdquo;. &nbsp;One student affirmed: &ldquo;Yes, I think we had an advantage to learn something not only new but something cool.
