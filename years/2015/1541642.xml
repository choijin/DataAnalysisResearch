<AbstractNarration>1541642 (Miralles-Wilhelm). This workshop will focus on development of principles, algorithms and model formulations for understanding and evaluating the potential of implementing approaches, developed through research, to handling food-energy-water (FEW) nexus challenges.  The workshop will take a broad systems perspective, linking application of tools and areas of disciplinary expertise to optimization of engineered FEW systems.  An objective is to address shared needs of FEW stakeholders, providing an interactive environment to explore trade-offs, explore potential synergies and evaluate alternatives among a broad list of FEW options and objectives including flexibility to facilitate tailored analyses over different geographical regions and scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to contribute to sustainable management and development of the food, energy and water sectors by increasing awareness and capacity of interdisciplinary modeling towards integrated planning and identifying/evaluating trade-offs and synergies. The focus of the workshop will be on exchanging insights, experiences and research results on innovative approaches and evidence-based operational tools to assess the economic and social tradeoffs of constraints in food, energy and water security. Designed tools may focus on upstream sector planning in order to identify primary opportunities and constraints to water, energy and food development, as well as evaluating opportunities to curb demand growth without compromising quality of service, thus indicating priorities for more detailed analysis as well as providing characterization of alternative scenarios of investment in each sector. This will also be an important step toward improved understanding of economic and social tradeoffs among competing uses (i.e., water for energy conversion versus food production, industrial and municipal uses, and environmental benefits of in situ water). The results of this exchange on research ideas and approaches thus aims at supporting decision-making in integrated food-energy-water planning and prioritization of research investments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ FEW: Development and Application of Analytical Tools in Support of   Food-Energy-Water Nexus Planning     Project Outcomes Report     The FEW Nexus Globally  The interdependency between food, energy and water (FEW) is growing in importance as demand for each of these vital resources? security increases.  Several regions of the world are already experiencing FEW security challenges, which adversely affect sustainable economic growth. In addition, there is already evidence of the effects of climate change on the availability and demand for water, energy and food, especially in fast-growing countries. At the same time, scarcity in either water, energy or food is caused not only by physical factors, but there are also social, political and economic issues at play that effect the allocation, availability, and use of these resources.     Population and economic growth are expected to increase demand for food, energy, and water. Yet, 783 million and 2.5 billion people remain without water and sanitation, respectively. Stresses such as rapid urbanization and climate change are growing on all water uses. Cities in developing countries will face meeting the demand of 70 million more people each year over the next 20 years. By 2030 we will need 45 percent more water just to meet our food needs. Further, over 1.3 billion people are still without access to electricity worldwide and closing the energy gap has implications on water, such as for fuel extraction, thermoelectric power plant cooling water, and hydropower.       As a consequence, there is a pressing need for information and quantitative tools to support integrated planning of FEW resource development and use, in an effort to avoid unwanted and unsustainable scenarios in the coming years.  Although the FEW nexus is fairly evident, these three sectors have historically been regulated and managed separately; and despite growing concern over these trends, decision makers often remain ill-informed about their drivers and ill-equipped to deal with possible outcomes. In addition to this, the simultaneous realization of climate change effects on FEW resources magnifies and accelerates the need for such integrated planning.     Workshop Outcomes: Towards Building FEW Nexus Interdisciplinary Modeling Capabilities  An integrated FEW nexus modeling system needs to address the shared needs of energy, food and water producers, resource managers, regulators, and decision makers at the federal, state and local levels. Ideally, the system should provide an interactive environment to explore trade- offs, explore potential synergies and evaluate alternatives among a broad list of energy/water options and objectives. In particular, the modeling system needs to be flexible in order to facilitate tailored analyses over different geographical regions and scales (e.g., national, state, county, watershed, interconnection regions), as well as define potential synergies and constraints for the sustainable development of water, energy and food planning and investments.     The proposed workshop generated knowledge (in the form of interdisciplinary FEW Nexus modeling approaches) that can be used for integrated planning (management of sources, production and distribution) of water, energy and food resources, supporting the building of capabilities such as:     Decision making: A well formulated integrated modeling tool      would help decision and policy makers assess their options in terms of      their likely effects on the broad energy-water system. The toolkit should      be able to transparently evaluate the trade-offs reflected in different      options.      Policy assessments: Given limited resources, it is important for      policy makers to ensure that policies are as cost-effective as possible.      If multiple objectives can be achieved by a single policy, it may advance      development more than policies focused separately on single objectives.      The toolkit should therefore provide a more complete, multi-system policy      assessment.      Facilitating policy harmonization and integration: There are instances of very      contradictory policies, e.g., electricity subsidies that accelerate      aquifer depletion&mdash;that in turn lead to greater electricity use and subsidy      requirements. The toolkit should help harmonize potentially conflicting      policies.      Technology assessments: Some technology options can      affect multiple resources, e.g., nuclear power could reduce GHG emissions,      reduce the exposure to volatile fossil fuel markets, but may increase      water withdrawals and use. As with other policies, the toolkit should      allow a more inclusive assessment of technological options.      Scenario development: Identify consistent      scenarios of possible socioeconomic development trajectories with the      purpose of identifying future development opportunities as well as of      understanding the implications of different policies. This is important      for exploring possible alternative development scenarios and the kinds of      technology improvements that might significantly change development      trajectories.
