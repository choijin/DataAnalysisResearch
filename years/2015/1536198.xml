<AbstractNarration>In the last decade, tsunamis have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and hundreds of billions of dollars in damage to coastal communities around the world.  While a major tsunami has not impacted the United States in some time, there is significant risk to the Pacific Coast and recent storm surge events have shown a potential for damage to domestic infrastructure similar to what was seen in East Asia and the Pacific.  Interest in tsunami load predictions for structural design has grown, but it is difficult to develop models that accurately predict the tsunami load response of an individual structure, much less the tsunami risk for multiple structures within a specific region.  The framework presented here is designed to improve the safety and sustainability of coastal structures and, consequently, improve tsunami hazard assessments, post-event response, and recovery efforts.  Ultimately, this work will result in safer communities through increased public awareness of the risks posed by these types of hazards and enhanced tools to develop resilient infrastructure systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased computing power has prompted the development of novel numerical approaches to tsunami-structure interaction modeling tailored to capture specific physical phenomena with high-levels of resolution and accuracy, including coupled multiphysics models to simulate complex system interactions.  If community-specific assessments of structural vulnerabilities are to be achieved, they must be based on a fundamental understanding of these interactions and an ability to efficiently model the associated physical processes in a probabilistic framework that accounts for the uncertain nature of these events.  The primary goals of this research project are to establish an open-source modeling framework where 3D computational fluid dynamics solvers can be used efficiently to inform the development of load-prediction capabilities for existing, widely used inundation models and to develop a probabilistic framework for predicting the fluid loading and structural response of coastal structures at a community level.  The research team will validate this framework against existing experimental data, assess the effects of bathymetry and community layout on flow, refine the models to include force predictions, and extend probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment methods to include fluid loading criteria.  This work will provide users both the framework and the software tools necessary to develop site-specific numerical models to increase the safety and sustainability of coastal structure by improving our understanding of the probabilistic risk posed by tsunami events on these structures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Much of the past tsunami research on coastal infrastructure at the community scale has focused on inundation modeling and evacuation strategies.  Recent interest in tsunami load predictions for structural design has grown, but it is difficult to develop models that accurately predict an individual structure’s response to tsunami loads, much less to predict the tsunami risk for multiple structures within a specific region.  The uncertain nature of these events creates an inherently probabilistic design problem for which a singular deterministic estimate of the wave-structure interaction response is insufficient.  Consequently, if reliable, community-specific assessments of structural vulnerabilities are to be achieved, they must be based on the ability to understand and efficiently model the associated physical processes in a probabilistic framework.   To that end, the primary goals of this research project were to establish a modeling framework where 3D computational fluid dynamics solvers can be used efficiently to inform the development of load-prediction capabilities of existing inundation models and to develop a probabilistic framework for predicting the fluid loading and structural response of coastal structures at a community level.  The specific research goals of this proposed project included validation of computational models against existing experimental data at several scales, assessing the effects of bathymetry and building layout on flow predictions, and refinement of the inundation model to include force predictions.  Concurrently, a ten-week experimental program was developed and conducted at the O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Lab to compare with the numerical predictions and help validate the modeling framework.   Results of this work have shown that incorporation of the built environment in community-scale numerical models of tsunami inundation is necessary to accurately predict both the local flow characteristics (i.e., water height, flow velocity) and the forces that the fluid imposes on coastal structures. These models have been developed at multiple scales and using open-source software and this is among the first set of results to showcase the ability to perform complex, three-dimensional CFD at community scales.  Several key outcomes were achieved during this research project:   This work showed that a computational fluid dynamics approach is possible at a community scale. This is a critical step forward in the state-of-the-art in inundation modeling and preliminary load prediction. It was shown that traditional two-dimensional inundation models (e.g., the GeoClaw SWE solver) is capable of predicting many of the physical phenomena associated with a tsunami indundation through a built environment, and that subsequent physics-based load predictions provide a reasonable preliminary estimate of fluid forces. Analysis of the experimental results found that integrated pressures on one face of a structure map well to forces measured on the opposite face, which is key for numerical modeling of the fluid, where often force predictions are made through integration of the fluid pressure. Surrounding structures were found to have a notable effect on the flow surrounding a structure as well as the corresponding forces caused by localized effects due to channeling and shielding.   These developments will help bridge the gap between computationally practical simulation techniques and high-fidelity numerical models and will provide numerical tools specifically designed for improving the safety and resilience of coastal communities.  Results from this research have been distributed to relevant parties through journal papers, conference presentations, and invited talks.  In addition, the research team has become more involved in developing safer and more resilient communities across the Pacific Northwest.  This has been accomplished by both direct involvement such as design review of vertical evacuation structures and indirect involvement such as informing relevant agencies of local tsunami risk and best practices in tsunami inundation modeling and tsunami resilient engineering. Through work related to this project, we are helping to inform the both the engineering and non-engineering communities about the risks to infrastructure that tsunamis pose.
