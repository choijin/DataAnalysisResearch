<AbstractNarration>PI: Dutt, Meenakshi&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1542276 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Materials Research Society&lt;br/&gt;Title: Symposium on Modeling and Theory Driven Design of Soft Materials (Boston, MA, Nov 29 ? Dec 4, 2015)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks funds to partially support the attendance (which includes the registration, travel and subsistence) of early career scientists (junior faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students) and partial registration support for the invited speakers to the symposium  "Modeling and Theory Driven Design of Soft Materials," to be held at Boston, MA, between Nov. 29 and Dec. 4, 2015.  This symposium is motivated by the growing importance of soft materials ? these encompass a wide range of materials, such as polymers, colloids, foams, gels, composites, bioinspired materials, and functional organic-inorganic structures, whose predominant physical behavior occurs around room temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will be attended by both prominent and young scientists. The aim of the symposium is to bring together researchers from academia, industry and federal laboratories who are exploring both simulation and theory to explore and validate the design of synthetic and organic soft materials to enable the dissemination of state-of-art developments in the field along with educating the next generation of young scientists. The organizers will encourage the participation by prioritizing the travel, subsistence and registration support for women and  underrepresented minority researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Symposium WW, Modeling and Theory Driven Design of Soft Materials, was held at the 2015 Materials Research Society (MRS) Fall Meeting during November 29-December 4, 2015.  It encompassed 7 half-day oral sessions and 1 poster session and provided a platform for nurturing scientific exchanges on the latest developments on the design of soft maerials resulting from the integration of computational and theoretical approaches.  It was successful in bringing together researchers from academia, industry and federal laboratories.   The organizers strived to promote interdisciplinary, multi-national and multi-scale interactions among computational and theoretical scientists involved in the area of soft materials.  The symposium program featured 104 abstracts which included 15 invited talks, 52 contributed talks, and 37 posters.  The symposium was inspired by the Materials Genome Initiative and addressed theoretical and computational modeling of soft materials with focus on their design, structure, and characterization of physical properties, as well as predictive power in connection with experimental observations.  The organizers gratefully acknoweldge support from the National Science Foundation which was critical to the success of the symposium.  The support provided partial travel support for students and early career scientists.  Proceedings for Symposium WW will be published in electronic format only in MRS Advances (www.mrs.org )          Last Modified: 05/04/2016       Submitted by: J. Ardie Butch Dillen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
