<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations to successfully complete high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (LSAMP BD) activity provides two-year support at the post-baccalaureate level for students from historically underrepresented minority populations to matriculate in STEM graduate programs with the ultimate goal of earning a doctoral degree in a STEM discipline. Participants are selected from LSAMP institutions nationwide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Louis Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-LAMP), under the leadership of the Louisiana Board of Regents and Southern University, has chosen Louisiana State University (LSU) as the site for the seventh cohort of LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate &lt;br/&gt;participants during 2015-2017. This cohort of twelve LSAMP BD students will engage in STEM research, academics and professional development leading to acceptance and completion of the doctoral program. The LS-LAMP graduate BD program at LSU has the potential to promote systemic change in graduate education practices and policy in ways that will increase the success of individual students on the doctoral pathway and the effectiveness of STEM graduate programs with a goal of diversifying America's STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BD program at LSU employs a proven program of systemic mentoring with components for innovative recruitment, engagement, retention, evaluation, student tracking and dissemination. The program includes collaborations and linkages with other STEM networks and resources, such as the Louisiana Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (Louisiana EPSCoR), other state fellowship&lt;br/&gt;programs as well as institutional resources to ensure students successful completion of the STEM doctoral degree. The program will be&lt;br/&gt;externally evaluated and students will be tracked throughout the program and into&lt;br/&gt;STEM careers following completion of STEM doctoral degree programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview     "LS-LAMP/BD-Cohort 7 &ndash; LA-BRIDGE: Louisiana Broadening Resources for Increasing Diversity in Graduate Education," at Louisiana State University (referred to herein as LA-BRIDGE) and its related activities represent a transformative and strategic institutional approach to build human resource capital at the doctoral level.      The vision of LA-BRIDGE is to create a successful model, which can be adopted nationwide, to increase minority student persistence and global competitiveness at the doctoral level.  The goals of LA-BRIDGE are a logical extension of the LS-LAMP Senior Alliance: (1) to increase the quality and number of minority STEM students pursuing doctoral degrees at the bridge institution; (2) to increase the retention to graduation rate of minority STEM PhD students; and (3) to investigate a national model for increasing the share of minority STEM PhD holders.     LA-BRIDGE has four main programmatic components: (1) A systemic mentoring program to provide infrastructure for students to integrate into the university culture; (2) An academic support structure that prepares students for the rigors of doctoral study; (3) International research experiences that incentivize early success and  prepare students for life-long engagement in the global STEM research enterprise; and (4) Individual Development Plans (IDPs) to enable self-efficacy and support student success.     Summary of Project Impacts: This LS-LAMP BD 7 project has been one of eight received by Louisiana State University to date. Through these BD activities, LSU has experienced a dramatic increase in the overall diversity of its STEM doctoral programs.  Before LS-LAMP BD, the minority STEM PhD student population campus-wide had leveled off with a critical mass of approximately 40 students, about 70% of which were housed with the chemistry department. Notably, LSU has and maintains a reputation for being a top producer of African American PhDs in chemistry. The mentoring efforts of its faculty, particularly professor Isiah M. Warner, have been recognized for not only increasing minority student matriculation within the university but also mentoring to increase retention to graduation.     Via NSF BD support, and working closely with the LS-LAMP partners, the PIs of the prior LS-LAMP BD activities have been able to expand the success in chemistry to other LSU departments and divisions.  With BD support, LSU was able to double its minority STEM doctoral student population to nearly 80 students and sustain this over multiple years. Notably, the minority student population in chemistry has leveled off and the net increases have been realized as a direct result of increased minority student matriculation and retention within campus-wide STEM doctoral programs.     Recent years yielded the largest graduation of minority PhDs in LSU history, i.e. over 33 minorities completed STEM PhD between August 2009 and May 2012. While not all minorities PhD graduates have been BD Scholars, greater than 75% have been supported by mentoring programs housed within the LSU Office of Strategic Initiatives, and the BD program has been the cornerstone of OSI?s mentoring efforts for minority STEM doctoral students.      Programmatic Components     The 12 recruited LA-BRIDGE Fellows have been totally immersed in a systemic mentoring environment.  Specifically, in addition to being fully supported financially, these fellows are in individualized mentoring relationships with their advisors in the respective departments. They attend monthly research and enhancement seminars of the BD program as well as additional discipline-specific research seminars in their units. Further the current cohort participates in international training that has included bi-national engagement with scientists. Their academic and professional integration includes their research participation and their attendance at national, professional conferences. LSU is committed to supporting the current BD cohort beyond their two-year tenure in the BD program.     The 10 maintained LA-BRIDGE (BD-7) Fellows were engaged in systemic mentoring (i.e., woven into the instructional, research, and service fabric of the institution) central to LS-LAMP-BD and provided a seamless pathway for success at the PhD level. Specific programmatic activities included (1) a systemic mentoring program that included effective faculty-to-student and student-to-student interactions that work collaboratively to increase the number of minority students earning PhD degrees in STEM fields; (2) academic support structures that increase students? acclimations to the rigors of doctoral study; and (3) minority students exposure to international research opportunities that prepare them for long-term scholarly engagement in the global STEM research enterprise.     In addition to presenting their own research and attending technical seminars, the scholars were expected to attend LAMP-BD seminars on a variety of topics that demystify doctorate and postdoctoral programs, help them thrive in graduate school, and provide insight into the intricacies of the global STEM workforce enterprise, with the focus on the professoriate.
