<AbstractNarration>Yazgulyami is a severely endangered Pamiri (Southeastern Iranian) language, spoken primarily along the Yazgulyam River in the mountains of eastern Tajikistan.  Recent history has seen the encroachment of Tajik culture and the concomitant death of several neighboring Pamiri languages.  This project has two primary aims, one descriptive and one theoretical.  Firstly, this work will create a living language corpus of Yazgulyami speech composed of annotated audio and video recordings alongside a multilingual dictionary.  Additionally, this research will examine and formally model the syllabification of consonant clusters.  In Yazgulyami, up to three consonants may begin a word.  Previous work on the language suggests that these clusters may be polysyllabic, creating syllables composed entirely on consonants, like pt and zv.  If this is the case, Yazgulyami is one of the very few languages that allow vowel-less syllables.  Languages like this raise the question of what makes up a syllable, an important empirical question. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In pursuit of these two goals, speech data will be collected from a Yazgulyami village in eastern Tajikistan.  A variety of stories, conversations, and songs will be recorded, including poetry and language games, which will supplement acoustic analysis of word-initial syllables.  Poetry and language games (e.g. Pig Latin) often refer to syllables, giving the researcher an opportunity to access native speaker conceptions of syllable boundaries.  Empirical findings from this study will be formalized according to contemporary phonetic and phonological theory, addressing the underlying as well as surface realization of these syllabic structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a needed documentation of a swiftly changing language in an understudied region of the world.  Moreover, the project will enable a graduate student to collaborate with an endangered speech community on the description of their language while producing a theoretical analysis of a rarely attested sound pattern.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The co-PI travelled to the fieldsite, but encountered numerous bureaucratic issues during fieldwork and during subsequent attempts to secure the appropriate visa for fieldwork.  The co-PI spent several weeks in the destination country before leaving due to these apparently intractable visa issues with the consulate and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  In addition, increased security concerns during preparation for the second trip to the target destination precipitated terminating the project. Before the termination of the project though, the co-PI was able to meet and interact with community members.  The co-PI stayed at the fieldsite for a week, celebrating a holiday with the community.  During that stay, the co-PI established a number of relationships with stakeholders in the community, including governmental and educational contacts.  Additionally, the co-PI was able to identify, in cooperation with leaders from the community, documentation projects deemed desirable to the community.  Unfortunately, as a result of the  bureaucratic and security concerns encountered, there are no project outcomes to report since no actual documentation or linguistic fieldwork was conducted. However, given the interest in a documentation project expressed by the community and the relationships initiated during the co-PI's stay in the village, future opporuntinities for documentary fieldwork are plausible if conditions become more favorable.
