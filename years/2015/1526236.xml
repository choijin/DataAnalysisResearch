<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on R/V Atlantis, a 274? general purpose Global vessel operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The vessel is owned by the U.S. Navy, has state-of-the-art instrumentation and supports all disciplines of oceanographic research. The Global vessel and can accommodate a scientific party of up to 32 persons for as many as 60 days. The vessel works in all the world?s oceans supporting science funded primarily by U.S government agencies. R/V Atlantis is specifically outfitted for launching and servicing Alvin, the human occupied submersible as well as other vehicles of the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF). R/V Knorr was retired in 2014 after over 30 years of excellent service in the Academic Fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2014, R/V Knorr completed 251 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 51% of the total sailing schedule (128 days). R/V Atlantis completed 316 days at sea in 2014. NSF funded projects accounted for 92% of the total sailing schedule (291 days). In 2015, Atlantis is scheduled for 285 days with NSF accounting for 245 of those or 86%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lowered Digital Autonomous Video Plankton Recorder $114,009&lt;br/&gt;MC-800 Shipping and Sampling Equipment $23,508&lt;br/&gt;      $137,517&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts   &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ WHOI operates two major research vessels, each having different characteristics, capabilities and equipment needs.  Cruise support is not only provided by permanently installed shipboard equipment but also by a variety of land-based instrumentation and an extensive pool of items that must be maintained ashore to ensure availability to users of all two vessels.  To the maximum extent possible, equipment and capability standardization has been attempted, but for numerous reasons stemming from differences between the vessels and their operating modes, this grant addressed a variety of loosely related equipment requirements.  This grant requested instrumentation intended for use at sea aboard the research vessels Atlantis, and Armstrong as well as others available within the UNOLS fleet.  Availability of this equipment amplifies the effectiveness of these ships in accomplishing their research and educational missions. A day at-sea represents a significant investment and this proposal?s objective is to maximize the scientific and educational return by insuring that necessary equipment is available and in good working order.  WHOI operates a large pool of shared-use sediment sampling systems. These include Soutar Box Corers, Van Veen Grabs, Gravity corers, Various rock dredges, the UNOLS Long Core, and three MC800 multi-corers. These multi-corers see extensive use within the WHOI fleet, but are also requested quite frequently for use on other UNOLS vessels. Transporting these systems requires extensive packaging and despite the best efforts of the shipping department to palletize and crate the components safely, damage during transport and loading is always a concern.   Additionally, effective and safe handling of the core tubes while on the ship requires specialized holding equipment for the tubes. WHOI has some sample tube holding assemblies and replacement tubes, but some of these have become lost or damaged over time and are now of insufficient quantities to accommodate all of the available multi-core systems.  This grant provided funds to procure one set of 10 sample tube holding assemblies and sample tubes as well as three shipping cases to accommodate the inventory of MC-800 frames.  This allowed the cadre of multi coring equipment to be successfully used on over ten scientific cruises within the UNOLs consortium.  .
