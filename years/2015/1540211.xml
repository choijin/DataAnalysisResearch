<AbstractNarration>The proposal seeks funding to support graduate and undergraduate participation in the 24th meeting of the North American Catalysis Society (NACS) to be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania June 16-20, 2015.  Specifically, the funds will provide assistance to 30 students from U.S. universities for registration fees and travel related expenses as administered through the Kokes Travel Award program sponsored by the NACS.  The students will present their research at the conference, attend lectures by leaders in the field of catalysis, and provide assistance to the organizers in running the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biennial NACS meetings are the largest North American meetings dedicated to catalysis.  Student participation helps train young researchers in this vital aspect of science and enginering that supports advances in environmental pollution control, energy utilization, sustainability and greenhouse gas reduction, and competitiveness of the U.S. chemical and petroleum industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 24th bi-annual meeting of the North American Catalysis Society was held from June 14-19, 2015 in Pittsburgh, PA.  The theme of the meeting, "Catalysis at the Confluence of Science and Technology" was the premier scientific event in the field of catalysis research and development during the 2015 calendar year.  The meeting highlighted the technical challenges, breakthrough discoveries and state-of-the-art academic and industrial research in catalysis.  The conference was attended by 1,395 individuals with 465 oral presentations delivered and 592 posters presented.  Additionally, 3 plenary lectures (Houdry, Emmett and Boudart awards) and 21 keynote lectures were delivered throughout the week.  Student participation has always been encouraged throughout the history of the meeting and the 24th meeting was no exception.  As part of this meeting, a select number of students were chosen to receive the Richard J. Kokes Travel Award.  Application submission opened in August 2014 and applicants were informed in February 2015.  Two hundred applications were received from students performing research in catalysis at universities in Canada, Mexico and the United States.  Nearly 80% of the applications received were from students attending U.S. based universities.  Awardees were chosen utilizing merit-based guidelines with some consideration of need-based criteria which enabled the Kokes Award committee to ensure appropriate representation from underrepresented groups, including minorities and women, first-time attendees, and graduate students of young faculty.  The process included the peer-reviewed evaluation of the studentÆs submitted extended abstract, letter of recommendation from the studentÆs adviser and the studentÆs CV.  Provided to 110 students, they received in kind a total of $1000 in order to offset the cost of registration, hotel accommodations and round-trip travel.  All awardees regardless of geographic origin were provided with the same travel allowance amount.  Kokes awardees were required to either deliver an oral or poster presentation, attend the meeting in its entirety and assist the organizing committee in certain meeting operations.  Awardees received a certificate of recognition for being chosen to receive a Richard J. Kokes Award.
