<AbstractNarration>Scientists long have explored and measured a range of decision-making traits, such as the ability to inhibit impulses or to understand other people's emotions.  Researchers have developed, validated, and refined a wide range of neurocognitive assessments, some of which have been used to try to make reasonable predictions of how dangerous prisoners will be in the future.  This interdisciplinary research project will build on these previous efforts to test whether a newly developed tablet-based battery of tests can approve capabilities to improve prediction of future dangerousness by identifying and evaluating the relationships among several aspects of decision making and criminal recidivism.  The assessment battery is designed to quantify an individual's decision-making profile, even if a user has limited reading proficiency and little to no previous experience with tablet computers.  The project will explore a methodology than may be able to better tie details of individual decision making directly to past and future behavior.  Although this project will focus on the topic of criminal recidivism, the software to be tested will provide an open-source, validated tool for correlating decision making with a variety of behavioral variables.  Project findings will provide a deeper understanding of offenders' deficits, which may yield more rational, evidence-based policies aimed at the prevention and control of crime.  The project also will provide education and training opportunities for graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher who are members of groups that are underrepresented in scientific research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on the core question of whether signatures of individual decision making can help to identify high-volume and high-risk criminal offenders.  Past studies have employed a range of techniques, such as psychiatric assessment, behavioral inventories, and brain scanning, which have generally found that offenders have problems with anger, empathy, aggression, impulse-control, and self-management.  The project advances efforts to directly measure those traits among offenders by accomplishing three specific aims: (1) finalize development of the battery, (2) validate it against standardized neurocognitive tests, and (3) quantify patterns of criminal recidivism by correlating decision-making metrics with future criminal activity of 300 released probationers.  This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project sought to develop tablet-based software to improve predictions of future criminal dangerousness by identifying and evaluating the relationships between several aspects of decision making and criminal recidivism.  The project team successfully developed and validated portable, engaging versions of classic psychometric assessments.  In 25 to 35 minutes, the tablet battery measures 6 decision making traits: self-control, executive function, risk-taking, planning, cognitive empathy, and reactive aggression.   Nearly 700 adult non-offenders, offenders, and reoffenders were assessed using the final version of the tablet battery.  Through univariate and multivariate analyses, patterns were identified between certain decisionmaking traits and criminal activity.  Specifically, the research team identified significant differences in risk-taking and inhibitory control between non-offenders and offenders.  They also identified significant differences in inhibitory control, planning, and reactive aggression between offenders and reoffenders.    These decision making differences were combined with the structured risk assessment tool recently deployed in Texas, which is based on the Ohio Risk Assessment System designed at the University of Cincinnati.  The combination yielded significant improvements in risk prediction explained further in the Journal for Criminal Justice and Behavior.    The team also explored the ethics of relying on decision making profiles to tailor sentencing in an article at the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics.  The project has provided a wealth of data to be analyed.  The team is in the midst of drafting manuscripts with anticipated homes in the fields of law, statistics, psychology, and criminology, as well as trade articles for practitioners.  This means the project has had an interdisciplinary intellectual impact across multiple fields, befitting the mission of the specific NSF program solicitation.    Relationships between industry and academia were also strengthened thanks to the NSF's funding of this project.  The local medical school, local historically black university, local downtown university, and local criminal justice centers have all collaborated on different aspects of the project.  The team anticipates that the findings, paired with the new working relationships, will lead to a quick diffusion of results from bench to practice.  This should, in turn, help criminal justice agencies better evaluate the risk of their criminal populations.  Results have been disseminated in several different ways to a wide range of audiences.  Two articles have already been published (or accepted for publication) for medical and criminology audiences.  We are currently completing a manuscript for a statistical audience that uses cutting-edge techniques from neural networks and machine learning to best identify differences between offenders and reoffenders.  They are also working on practitioner articles, criminology manuscripts, and future collaborations with researchers.    Results have also been presented in person to different local audiences within the criminal justice fields.  Top level administrators and practitioners at local agencies -- including juvenile probations, adult probations, the county jail, and the primary mental health care provider for detainees and offenders -- have all received the results of the ongoing research and provided valuable feedback.  The results have also been presented in person to mainstream public audiences through Dr. Eagleman's talks and through postdoc presentations at local schools and universities.
