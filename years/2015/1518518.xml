<AbstractNarration>The globalization of trade in agricultural commodities is increasingly connecting consumers and producers around the world. A growing fraction of forest conversion and other land placed into agricultural production is associated with commodities produced for global markets. Much of the demand for food that was historically met by local agriculture is increasingly being met by global trade; in the past three decades food exports have increased 10-fold. This project will quantify and model this type of global scale connection that links natural and human systems by studying how agricultural markets and land use in China and Brazil are linked via commodity trade. The natural environment is incorporated in this model in two ways: first, the local land use choices affect soil quality and water, which in turn affects subsequent agricultural choices; second, the expansion of agriculture into tropical forest has an effect on global climate and biodiversity. The models produced by this project will increase our understanding of how human and natural systems change in concert even when the connections are over great distances (telecoupled). This project is a first effort to quantify complex dynamics of distantly coupled agricultural and economic systems by going beyond the traditional focus on a single system, one-way impacts, or comparative analysis of systems. It represents an exciting new frontier of research in coupled systems, with substantial contributions to the theory, methods, and applications of telecoupled systems. The work is of further importance in providing a broader view and new perspective on international commodity trade, which is in the national interest, and in training the next generation of scientists&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to quantify the telecoupling framework to address fundamental questions about human and natural systems such as: What are the effects of telecouplings on human-nature dynamics across scales in distant systems? How do telecouplings and local couplings enhance or offset each other in terms of their effects on human-nature dynamics?  To address these questions and associated hypotheses, the project will focus on major telecouplings involving the trade of agricultural products (e.g., soybeans for food and animal feed) between Brazil and China, two of the world's most important emerging economies. These two countries constitute an excellent example of telecoupled systems, but little is known about the effects of their rapidly increasing trade on human-nature dynamics. By leveraging existing remote sensing and socioeconomic data and collecting complementary new data, researchers will model complex dynamics and relationships among key components of telecoupled systems. Analyses at the international and national scales will be conducted with the widely used Global Trade Analysis Project model. They will be complemented by in-depth studies at the regional and local scales through ecological fieldwork and socioeconomic surveys, as well as through developing and validating a telecoupled agent-based model. These studies, spanning local to international scales, will be joined via systems integration.</AbstractNarration>

While the production of agricultural commodities for global markets is increasingly connecting consumers and producers around the world, it is also inducing a significant transformation from natural to agricultural land cover types worldwide, with multiple socioeconomic and environmental consequences.

Because the economy of every nation is linked with each other through telecoupling processes such as trade, while each national economy is underpinned by a full set of intermediate input demands, it was necessary to perform multiscale analyses. Thus, using the telecoupling framework applied through the lens of the soybean trade, the project analyzed the socio-economic and environmental links between China and Brazil at international/national and regional/local scales, as well as spillover nations such as the USA. For the international/national scale, the project developed a modified global general equilibrium model to investigate the economic and environmental impacts of sector- and region-specific agricultural/environmental policies acting simultaneously with the global trade. For the regional/local scale, the project developed an agent-based model to conceptualize and analyze the impacts of the global agricultural trade on land-use decision-making processes.
