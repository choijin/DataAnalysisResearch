<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to recruit rural high school students into community college technician degree programs that are linked to manufacturing jobs in the region. The project activities include: 1) developing a new Electronics Engineering Technology dual-enrollment program, 2) creating awareness among high school and college counselors, teachers and faculty, parents and students on the content of and career potential for Electronics Engineering and Computer-Integrated Machining technicians, 3) providing activities including summer camps to increase the recruitment of female and male high school students to dual enrollment technology programs, and 4) educating high school and college counselors on technician careers through externships and return to industry programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is improving student learning in engineering technician programs by building on a pilot dual enrollment technician program established in computer-integrated machining. It is adapting materials, methods, and marketing materials from ATE Centers in Florida, Connecticut, and South Carolina. To increase opportunities for students to work in high paying jobs in manufacturing, the project is focusing on groups that are currently underrepresented in the field, particularly females. There is strong institutional support and there are strong partnerships with the public school system, manufacturers, and the economic development community.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: In order to meet the skills gap faced by regional manufacturers, the project is developing and strengthening a pipeline of skilled employees for area manufacturers that is not dependent on incumbent worker retraining. The creation of a close partnership between manufacturers, the community college and the high schools is providing a response to changing technology in manufacturing to ensure their long term profitability. The expansion of dual enrollment programs is affording students new career options not previously understood and doubling the pipeline by focusing on both females and males. Long term, the success of the project is enabling the development of additional technician dual enrollment programs and creating a model Career Academy for high school students that can be adapted by other rural communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project "Dual-Enrollment Technician Pathways and Careers in Electronics Engineering and Computer Integrated Machining" had two goals.  The first goal was to create an electronics engineering dual-enrollment program at Haywood Community College (HCC) to enable more high school students the opportunity to build skills and credentials needed by manufacturers.  The second goal was to recruit male and female students into the new dual-enrollment electronics engineering technology program and the existing computer-integrated machining program at HCC.  The project was initially two years but was extended to four years with Johnston Community College (JCC) added as a partner for the third and fourth years.  The major activities of the project were summer camps for students and professional development seminars for high school counselors.  A one week summer camp was created at HCC and offered for high school students during two summers, to promote the new degree.  A two to four day summer professional develop program on advanced technology degree careers and programs was developed at JCC for public school counselors.  The professional development was offered for three consecutive summers and is continuing with funding from other sources.  The summer camps and the professional development promoted the engagement and involvement of women in technician training and careers.  Professional women in technology were instructors, speakers and industry representatives in the activities.  The barriers women encounter were identified and resources were provided to overcome those barriers.  NSF ATE materials on women in technology from FLATE, NGMFG and IWITTS were used.   Overall, few students took advantage of the dual-enrollment programs.  The impact of the camps and professional development may have had a delayed impact and students enrolled in the college programs after graduating from high school.  The awareness of the advanced technology careers and degrees was enhanced in the community and aided in the development of the Career and Technical Leadership Academy (CTLA - early college), a joint effort of Johnston County Public Schools and JCC.  The CTLA has an Industrial Systems Technology track for students, enrolling 15 students per year, for an expected 65 students active in the five year program.  The Industrial Systems CTLA students take all of their technology classes on the college campus at the William R. Britt Advanced Technology Center.  The CTLA students will earn a high school diploma and an AAS in Industrial Systems Technology.   A deeper understanding of the relationship between the North Carolina public schools and community colleges was gained.  Finances, scheduling and transportation are barriers to collaboration of the public schools and colleges for dual-enrolled students in technician programs.  Tuition for dual-enrollment students is waived under state law, but the books and fees are negotiated between the local school system and college.  In North Carolina, each school system and community college are governed locally, and may have different goals and objectives for their students.  Even though the "free college" offered by dual-enrollment sounds attractive, it does not appear to be a priority of the public schools system, and is sometimes perceived as a threat to high school faculty employment.  The one exception is the CTLA (early college) for Industrial Systems Technology formally established on the JCC campus.     One of the most important outcomes of the project was the engagement of the faculty and staff at JCC in the NSF ATE project.  The college administration learned about the value of the NSF ATE community to improve programs and the grant and business office staff gained skills in administering a federal grant. The college hosted another NSF ATE project, STEM Guitar, and have adopted the material into the technology curriculum for the CTLA (early college).   Two JCC faculty members participated in the summer public school counselor training and one later attended the NSF ATE PI conference.  These experiences introduced them to the NSF ATE network and resources, and together they have started to develop a new concept to continue their involvement with NSF ATE.
