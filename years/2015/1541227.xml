<AbstractNarration>A wide range of health outcomes is affected by air pollution. In March 2014 the World Health Organization (WHO) released a report that in 2012 alone, a staggering 7 million people died as a result of air pollution exposure, one in eight of total global deaths. A major component of this pollution is airborne particulate matter, with approximately 50 million Americans have allergic diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop and field the first integrated IoT in-situ sensor package tracking pollution and pollen to provide airborne particulate mapping for Chattanooga. Longer term it is hoped that the data collection approach and initial visualization tools developed in Chattanooga can be used to support a nationwide, open access dissemination platform on the order of Google's StreetView, but called PollutionView. Such scaling of the project's pilot results through a PollutionView tool will contribute significantly to a transformation of the Environmental Public Health field in the United States. The project involves real-time big data analysis at a fine-grain geographic level. This will involve trades with sensing and computing especially if the sensor package is to be deployed at scale. The project will help determine if real-time allergen collection and visualization can improve health and wellness. Thus, this project will combine Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and gigabit networks to address major health concerns due to air pollution. A working demonstration of this project will be presented during the Global City Teams meeting in June 2015 with an update in June 2016. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Airborne particulate matter particularly affects the citizens of Chattanooga, TN. The objectives of this project are twofold: first, to develop and deploy an array of Internet of Things (IoT) in-situ sensors within Chattanooga capable of comprehensively characterizing air quality in real time, including location, temperature, pressure, humidity, the abundance of 6 criterion pollutants (O3, CO, NO, NO2, SO2, and H2S), and the abundance of airborne particulates (10-40 µm), both pollen-sized and smaller PM2.5 (&lt;2.5 µm) particles; and second, to have a pollen validation campaign by deploying an in-situ pollen air sampler in Chattanooga to identify specific pollen types.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project delivered a real-time low-latency network of low-cost sensors calibrated using machine learning for measuring accurate size distributions of airborne particulates across Chattanooga, TN.  Since the seventeenth century, the scientific method has involved answering scientific questions by making observations and doing experiments.  The rise of the  IoT has seen the advent of a wide range of new and connected sensing capabilities. With the use of inexpensive sensors calibration usually becomes more important than ever if meaningful results are to be obtained. In many cases, these sensing capabilities use much \textit{lower cost} devices to make observations than traditional scientific instrumentation. For example, the equipment that the EPA traditionally uses to measure air quality costs of the order of $100k, our smart cities IoT air quality sensors cost just a few thousand dollars. The benefit of the reduced cost is the potential to distribute these capabilities at scale and greatly facilitate the potential for public engagement and citizen science. However, for these sensing systems to facilitate improved data-driven decision making we would greatly benefit from a framework that allows us to deal in real-time with measurement uncertainty, inter-sensor bias, and real-time continual calibration. This will facilitate long-term, consistent, and calibrated data and derivative products to be developed using massively distributed sensing systems.   To date, much effort has been placed on the IoT sensor connectivity. Little to no effort has been placed on the automated calibration, bias detection, and uncertainty estimation for IoT devices.  The network of sensors delivered by this project goes beyond what the EPA reference sensors provide in two key areas:  First, low latency real-time observations. Measurements are made every 10 seconds and streamed live in contrast to the hourly time resolution of the EPA regulatory sensors which typically have a delay of a couple of hours. Second, they provide the full size-distribution of airborne particles in the size range from just under a micron in diameter to 40 microns. This includes the airborne pollen and mold size range not normally measured.   This network of sensors goes beyond what the low-cost sensors usually provide in three key areas:  First, the sensors went through a rigorous calibration in the lab. Machine learning was used to individually calibrate each sensor against a primary standard. This calibration also accounted for the instantaneous humidity and temperature. The calibration transforms the low-cost sensor into a highly accurate sensor. Second, each measurement value is quoted with an associated uncertainty. Third, the continual construction over appropriate spatial and temporal windows of observation probability distribution functions (PDFs), i.e. instead of inter-comparing individual pairs of observations between a given pair of sensors, inter-compare probability distributions of all observations acquired over a time scale (e.g. an hour/day/month) and over a spatial scale (e.g. within a radius of 1 km). Inter-comparing the PDFs is more robust as it typically involves hundreds or thousands of observations rather than just a pair of observations. By continually inter-comparing sensors within some neighborhood radius in this manner, it becomes easy to identify and address any sensor drift/bias that develops over time. Further, the shape of the distribution contains much useful information. For example, the width of the PDF characterizes the representativeness of observations, i.e. how representative is a single observation of observations made over a spatial and temporal window.    At the start of this project the NSF funding led to matching funds for 20 additional sensors:  10 More sensors to be deployed at DFW area schools from Earth Day Texas. 10 More sensors to be deployed across the UT Dallas campus as part of a smart campus initiative.   There has been significant local media interest.  Now we have had additional further funding for:  10 More sensors to be deployed across the Joppe neighborhood right next to a cement plant in Dallas funded by a local community group. 40 More sensors to be deployed across the City of Plano, TX. A grant for $500k from the army to local at the human performance (physical &amp; cognitive) aspects of air quality. A fellowship at the United States Special Operations Command at SOFWERX, J5 Donovan Group, futures studies directorate. This may lead to a further large-scale deployment.
