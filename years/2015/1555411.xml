<AbstractNarration>This joint workshop between US and Dutch researchers explores technical and societal topics in privacy.  The two-day workshop is jointly organized with the sponsorship of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) and NSF, and is scheduled for October 2 &amp; 3 2015 in Washington DC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will contribute to a thorough scientific understanding of the intercultural issues surrounding privacy which is necessary for societal debates between nations. The workshop participants will identify topics of mutual interest between US and Dutch researchers, for consideration as submissions to potential future funding opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
