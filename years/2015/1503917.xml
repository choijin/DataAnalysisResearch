<AbstractNarration>Snow cover plays a key role in Arctic sea ice processes, and it has thinned significantly in recent decades. In winter, it insulates sea ice from cold air temperatures, slowing sea ice growth. In spring-summer, snow albedo exerts a control on solar heat absorbed by the sea ice and underlying ocean, impacting ice melt processes. Thus, snow thickness, distribution, and density, can moderate the recovery of the sea ice pack or exacerbate its loss. Airborne and satellite remote sensing are used to monitor snow depth over sea ice. Interpretation of the remotely sensed microwave signals requires accurate models of how the microwaves interact with the snow. This project will develop electromagnetic models that relate the microwave signatures quantitatively to physical parameters of snow. It will contribute to STEM workforce development by providing support for the training of a graduate student. The computer code for the model will be made publicly available and provide a resource for the Arctic science community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will improve the extraction of snow parameters from airborne and spaceborne observations through the modeling of the interaction between snow particles and electromagnetic waves in the microwave region. In particular, the project will generate 3D simulations of the solution to Maxwell's equations in the presence of 3D snow microstructure. Results will be applied to the analysis of active and passive microwave remote sensing data of snow over sea ice. Three-dimensional computer simulations of microstructures of snow that resemble that of real snow will be performed on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems to compute scattering and emission of snow covering sea-ice. The use of large scale high performance computations will permit the simulations to be run over relatively large spatial domains.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the project period, we have developed the bicontinuous medium model to computer generate 3D microstructures of snow that resemble that of real snow. We also have developed techniques for 3D full wave numerical solutions of Maxwell equations (NMM3D) for snow over sea ice. We have applied the 3D simulation results to the analysis of active and passive microwave remote sensing data of snow and sea ice. We have generated lookup tables (LUTs) that relate different properties of snow and sea ice to Tb and backscatter responses with NMM3D. For passive remote sensing, we have generated LUTs of Tb at Ku and Ka band for retrieval of snow depth (SD) over sea ice with AMSR-E/2 observations. For active remote sensing, LUTs of backscatter at X-, C- and L-band have been built. Radar backscattering respond to roughness of sea ice and empirical relations have been established between sea ice thickness and sea ice roughness. In addition, our wok also included rough surface effects for both snow/ice and ice/water interface. The roughness of the snow/ice interface weakens the coherent layer effects. Our simulations also demonstrated that both Tb and backscattering are highly related to roughness of the snow/ice interface and the ice/water interface. The snow/ice interface roughness increases Tbs and backscatter more at high frequency and for thick ice, while the ice/water interface roughness increases Tbs and backscatter more at low frequency and for thin ice.

Simulation results demonstrate backscattering enhancement effects and coherent layer effects. All these features are not able to be acquired with the radiative transfer theory.
