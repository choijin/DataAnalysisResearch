<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research and education in computational materials science with application to modeling of disordered materials.  The paradigmatic system that will be investigated is the "spin glass".  Spin glasses are magnetic materials that order in a complex fashion due to competing interactions at the microscopic level.  Theoretical models of spin glasses incorporate these competing interactions and reproduce many of the complex phenomena seen in these materials.  Spin glass models have also found applications in neuroscience and evolutionary biology and turn out to have close connections to difficult optimization problems arising in computer science and industrial engineering.  The PI's group will develop and use a powerful new computer algorithm called population annealing to study spin glasses and related models. Population annealing has potential applications in many areas of computational science ranging from chemistry and biology to optimization problems in computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve both graduate students and undergraduate students in computational studies.  Students will learn advanced computational methods and modern techniques in statistical physics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research and education in computational materials science with applications to disordered systems.  The population annealing Monte Carlo algorithm is the primary computational tool that will be developed and used. The main emphasis will be on spin glass models but other systems to be studied include the hard square/hard sphere fluids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glassy systems present formidable intellectual and computational challenges and have remained controversial for decades. Understanding the low temperature properties of spin glasses is a foundational problem of materials science. The large scale computational approach based on the population annealing algorithm combined with new analysis methods promises to clarify the nature of the low temperature phase of Ising spin glasses and to distinguish between competing theories. Spin glass models are closely related to combinatorial optimization problems and understanding spin glasses thus could shed light on many other hard computational problems. For example, temperature chaos in spin glasses is closely related to the computational difficulty of finding ground states using heuristics such as parallel tempering, population annealing or quantum annealing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Population annealing is a new paradigm for equilibrium simulations in statistical physics.  The population annealing algorithm promises to find application in a wide range of fields including chemistry, biology and computer science. It is useful both for simulating thermal equilibrium and as a heuristic for finding solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. It is a massively parallel algorithm well suited to distributed computing and thus may pave the way to solving problems in computational physics on a larger scale than previously possible.  Combining population annealing with other algorithmic ideas such as kinetic Monte Carlo will expand the range of effective tools available to computational statistical physics for studying systems with rough free energy landscapes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve both graduate students and undergraduate students in computational studies.  Students will learn advanced computational methods and modern techniques in statistical physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding glassy systems is a long-standing and difficult problem in statistical physics and materials science.  The defining property of glassy systems is that they relax toward thermal equilibrium extremely slowly.  This property also makes it difficult to carry out computer simulations to investigate glassy systems.  Our group has developed a new computer algorithm for studying glassy systems .  This algorithm is related to the well-known "simulated annealing" algorithm that is widely used in industry to solve optimization problems.    The new algorithm is known as "population annealing"  and is well-suited for use on massively parallel computing platforms.   Population annealing works by simulating in parallel a large number of copies of the system under study.  During the simulation the copies are slowly "cooled" from high temperature where it is easy to carry out the simulation using standard Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to low temperatures where interesting glassy behavior is manifest but standard methods perform poorly.  The new twist in population annealing is that at each cooling step, a resampling procedure is carried out.  In the resampling step, some copies of the system are eliminated while others are reproduced. Whether a copy of the system is eliminated or reproduced depends on its energy in a way that ensures that the ensemble of copies remains near the equilibrium distribution throughout the cooling process.  Resampling is analogous to "survival of the fittest" in Darwinian evolution. By supplementing standard methods with resampling and by maintaining a large number of copies of the system, it is possible to obtain results deep in glassy phases where standard methods fail.  Our group has developed and analyzed population annealing and then applied it to several important problems in statistical physics.  These problems include the low temperature phase of disordered magnetic materials known as spin glasses and the thermodynamic properties of configurational glasses. For configurational glasses we have developed and applied a new method to measure configurational entropy.  Understanding the behavior of configurational entropy may allow us to address one of the most fundamental questions in glass physics:  Is glassy behavior a purely dynamical phenomenon or is it associated with an underlying thermodynamic transition where the configurational entropy vanishes?
