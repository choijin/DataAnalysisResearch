<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this project is to understand, at the molecular level, one of the most remarkable chemical defense systems found in nature - the explosive, extremely hot spray of the bombardier beetles. Insects make up much of the animal life that has evolved on Earth. Understanding why there are so many different kinds of insects and why they are so successful is fundamental to understanding how the wide diversity of life evolved. Insects are well known for producing many different chemical compounds that are required for their communication. Some chemicals help them to locate mates and food resources, others help them to organize activities within the nest or hive, and many others are used to warn off and defend against predators. This project focuses on this last aspect and is specifically testing the idea that the genes responsible for production of the hot chemical spray of the bombardier beetles are closely related to the genes responsible for producing similar chemicals in the insect's outer shell or exoskeleton. A main strength of the project is that it tackles this question by using multiple complementary approaches and by comparing eight different beetle species that are related to varying degrees. Half of these species have evolved a chemical defense system, the other half have not evolved this ability. Many college students and young scientists will receive scientific training in conjunction with the project. People of all ages are highly captivated by these beetles, particularly school age children. With the bombardier beetle as a model, the project will help develop elementary school level hands-on activities and lesson plans on topics in chemical ecology and biological chemical defense evolution that will reinforce the Next Generation Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground beetles and their relatives form the largest clade of organisms that use a single homologous gland system to produce no less than 19 distinct classes of chemical compounds for defense. This project will develop a detailed functional and evolutionary understanding of defensive chemistry evolution by focusing on species from the four lineages of quinone producing carabid beetles, including species commonly known as the bombardier beetles, which chemically blast their defensive quinones at extremely hot temperatures (up to 100 Â°C). Using a multidisciplinary approach, this project will identify genes involved in quinone production, elucidate chemical biosynthetic pathways, and describe the genetic architecture of quinone evolution. From gland-specific transcripts, candidate genes related to the production of defensive secretions will be identified and gene function will be validated experimentally by blocking gene transcription and looking at phenotypic changes in the compounds produced. The researchers will test the hypothesis that the genes up-regulated in secretory cells during quinone synthesis are closely related to those involved in quinone production in arthropod cuticle. Thus the project will empirically address the well-known, but untested, scenario of how the bombardier beetle evolved its explosive defense abilities. Ultimately, this project will explore how genetics and chemistry can interact over time and will reveal insights into the fundamental process of evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Beetles are natural chemists, producing an incredible array of compounds. Some beetles and other insects use very particular compounds to defend against predators. Arguably the most spectacular use of natural chemistry is found in bombardier beetles. These beetles have a pair of large reservoirs that hold a chemical mixture that is largely made up of hydrogen peroxide and quinones. When agitated, bombardier beetles eject the contents of the reservoir, mixing them with enzymes on the way out, to create a chemical explosion with a temperature near or higher than the boiling point of water. Other related beetles don't use the explosive mechanism, but simply spray copious amounts of quinones, which are nasty, irritating compounds even at room temperature.</p> <p>Our project was to investigate the details of how bombardier and related beetles make these quinone compounds. To do this we traced the connections between gene expression and enzyme biochemistry. By feeding beetles a diet of food mixed with labelled precursor compounds we were able to discover that the steps of the chemical transformation has at least two pathways, contradicting the existing idea of a single starting molecule as the basis for all the final quinone compounds. We also have amassed a huge amount of gene expression data that shows upregulation of genes in the tissues that produce these compounds. Another factor that might be important in how these beetles produce their chemicals is the microbiome of the beetle. By feeding beetles a diet laced with antibiotics and testing the chemicals they produce, we determined that the beetles can continue to produce the same defensive compounds. From this we conclude that the microbiome of the gut is not likely to be important for synthesis of chemicals. However, an initial exploration of the tissues that produce the chemicals indicated that there is a notably different microbiome there, suggesting the possibility of microbe-mediated production. This has led us to embark on a wider survey of the microbiome of this family of beetles. Finally, we have for the first time isolated the enzymes that are responsible for the final, explosive reaction and been able to tract the energetics of these reactions. While there is much to learn about the amazing biosynthetic processes in the beetles, we made significant steps in understanding the details. What we have learned in this study can aid future work looking at the production and reactions of natural products, with implications for medicine, the pharmaceutical industry, and agriculture.</p> <p>Many undergraduates were able to gain hands-on experience, participate in laboratory work, and have become co-authors on publications as part of the project.
