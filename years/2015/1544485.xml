<AbstractNarration>As commercial and government institutions adopt new technologies and regulatory instruments, the algorithms for auditing and accounting have become increasingly complex. This workshop project explores the ways in which these algorithms are being meaningfully transformed through human interaction with new technologies. The workshop provides a platform for scientific collaboration, the results of which will benefit those working to develop more effective auditing and accounting practices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Hugh Gusterson of the George Washington University will organize a workshop to explore "roboprocesses", the highly scripted social algorithms that mediate Americans' relationships with commercial and government institutions. Bringing together fifteen anthropologists from a range of subdisciplinary approaches, the workshop would explore how different auditing and accounting practices become routinized and regimented through in a range of contexts: standardized public school testing, health care software, credit and financial evaluation, national security algorithms and homeland security, criminal sentencing and deportation protocols, the promulgation of statistical indices by international aid agencies, and the automated standardization of the American agricultural system. The project will advance scientific understandings of accounting, bureaucracy, and audit culture.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Final Report on NSF Workshop on Roboprocesses     Submitted by  Hugh Gusterson, George Washington University  Catherine Besteman, Colby College           This workshop was conducted on September 24-25, 2015, at George Washington University.  The workshop brought together contributors to an edited volume on "roboprocesses."  Roboprocesses are highly scripted social scenarios, often structured by computerized algorithms, that are increasingly salient in the contemporary United States.  These scripted roboprocesses standardize assessments of people, subject assessments and interactions to rigid (often binary) structuring and evaluation, and reduce the space for improvisation and discretionary judgment in interactions between individuals and institutions.  Examples include "three strikes and you?re out" laws, standardized tests in schools, the protocols for calculating consumer credit scores, and the scripted evaluations doctors use when assessing patients.   The workshop brought together authors of individual chapters in the edited volume with expert discussants selected from the local anthropological community in Washington DC.  The purpose was to create for those writing chapters a shared engagement with a body of theoretical literature and with a common set of meta-questions, thereby increasing the functional integration of the published volume; the workshop also gave authors the benefit of expert critique of their individual chapters.  This peer review component also enabled the conference organizers/editors to develop a stronger sense of the strengths and weaknesses of individual chapters.  Every contributor to the volume was able to attend the workshop except two.  One could not attend because she was on leave in another country; the other was in the final stages of pregnancy, but was able to join the workshop by skype.  In order to maximize the time available for discussion, the chapters were electronically circulated before the workshop, so that author presentations could be brief and the time for discussion greater.  The chapters presented were:  Roger Lancaster of George Mason University on the protocols of incarceration in the contemporary United States.  Sally Merry of New York University on the construction of global statistics to measure economic development, human rights and educational performance.  Miguel Diaz-Barriga and Margaret Dorsey of the University of Texas on the rise of surveillance protocols on the Texas- Mexico border.  Susan Terrio of Georgetown University on the protocols used by U.S. immigration courts to evaluate unaccompanied undocumented minors.  Catherine Lutz (Brown University) and Anne Lutz Fernandez (a public school teacher) on the use of standardized tests in the U.S. public school system.  Joseph Masco of the University of Chicago on the rise of algorithms of risk assessment in surveillance of domestic threats in the United States.  Robert Gehl of the University of Utah on the algorithmic sorting by internet search engines and social media sites of consumer behavior.  Alex Blanchette of Tufts University on the standardization of the U.S. pork farming and food production system.  Noelle Stout of New York University on the protocols through which the U.S. mortgage industry assessed the claims of distressed homeowners after the housing bubble burst in 2008.     Discussants included: Richard Grinker of George Washington University, Brett Williams of American University, Fida Adeley of Georgetown University, Michael Barnett of George Washington University, Khaled Furani of Tel Aviv University, Joel Kuipers of George Washington University, Andrew Bickford of George Mason University, Johanna Bockman of George Mason University, Amy Best of George Mason University, and Ed Liebow, the executive director of the American Anthropological Association.  The workshop was open to academics who wanted to attend and some graduate students from George Washington University and George Mason University sat in on the workshop, making helpful contributions to the discussion.  (They have continued to make suggestions, particularly regarding written sources, since the workshop too).  Thanks to the workshop the editors/conveners have been able to make much richer suggestions to chapter authors for rewriting their chapters.  These suggestions emerged from the focused discussion of individual chapters as well as from the expert reviews at the workshop.  The workshop also greatly enriched the framework of the introductory chapter for the volume.  Also, as a result of critical discussion at the workshop, one author has agreed to withdraw his chapter from the volume and has been replaced by another author writing on the same topic.  We regard this early identification of a chapter that did not fit, and its replacement by another, as a good outcome.  Thanks to the workshop, we are now on schedule for a late summer/early fall submission of the volume to an academic press.
