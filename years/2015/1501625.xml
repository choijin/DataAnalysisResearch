<AbstractNarration>Polynomials are mathematical functions that describe many different kinds of behavior in mathematics, physics, and engineering. They are concrete enough to be easily manipulated by hand or computer, and easy to understand mathematically, but also flexible enough to model many different situations in nature and science. Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry are the large branches of mathematics concerned primarily with understanding polynomials and the geometric shapes they define. Their broader applications range from the computer aided design used in the automotive and entertainment industries to the error correcting codes used in many digital media.  This project in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry focuses on basic research in these fields, while broadly training a diverse group of PhD and undergraduate students in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One specific type of algebra to be investigated are cluster algebras, which are commutative rings defined iteratively that have turned up in many branches of mathematics and physics, including the classical field of total positivity for matrices, the representation theory of lie algebras,  number theory, Teichmuller theory, mirror symmetry, Poisson Geometry, discrete dynamical systems, string theory, wiring diagrams and networks, and more.  The specific proposed research involves 1) developing the commutative algebra of cluster algebras, including basic notions such as localization and blowing up, as well as prime characteristic features such as test ideals; 2)  reduction to prime characteristic  and the iteration of the Frobenius map to understand singularities, cohomology and other features of algebraic varieties and commutative rings, studying invariants defined via Frobenius in prime characteristic, their relationship to cluster structures and their potential use in birational geometry;  and 3) settling a question of  Kollar on the behavior of local cohomology under base change (the main application of which is to reduce questions about maps between local Picard groups of complex varieties to characteristic p). The PI's role as a senior researcher is an integral part of the project: training the next generation of algebraists  is woven into the very fabric of the research and one of the project's main objectives.</AbstractNarration>
