<AbstractNarration>L-functions are functions of one complex variable whose study is central to modern number theory.  They were introduced in order to study deep questions about the distribution of prime numbers.  Today, we know that the values of L-functions at special points are linked to many areas of mathematics, from solving equations in integers to mathematical physics.  When these special values are small, it tells us that certain highly structured mathematical objects are in fact behaving randomly.  This research project project attempts to prove that this happens by using methods from quantum physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will use techniques from semiclassical analysis to approach the subconvexity problem for L-functions.  The link between these two areas is provided by period integral formulae such as those of Rankin-Selberg, Waldspurger, and Ichino-Ikeda.  The PI hopes that the geometric structure of arithmetic manifolds will make it easier to study the oscillatory integrals and equidistribution problems that will arise in this work.  The PI also aims to prove chaoticity results for automorphic forms, by showing that their Lp norms are smaller than those of general wave packets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project concerns research in  number theory, a branch of mathematics that has connections to many  other subjects, including communications systems, data security, and  physics.  It specifically concerns automorphic forms, which are  functions with rich symmetry and which capture information about the  primes.  The aim of the project is to explore relations between  automorphic forms, geometry, and analysis.  There is already a rich  theory connecting these subjects, and the project aims to develop this  further by using methods from harmonic analysis.  The main result of the project is a new approach to the subconvexity problem for automorphic L-functions, which is effective in arbitrary rank.  In particular, for any n it should produce families of cusp forms on GL_n x GL_{n-1} whose Rankin-Selberg L-function satisfies a subconvex bound. Existing methods are limited to n at most 3.  It also made significant progress towards proving the existence of Laplace eigenfunctions on hyperbolic manifolds which have very large integrals over geodesics or totally geodesic hypersurfaces.  This would provide a counterpoint to many theorems and predictions that Laplace eigenfunctions on negatively curved  manifolds should be chaotic.  As part of the award, the PI also mentored graduate students  and postdocs, and disseminated the findings of his research at  conferences and seminars.
