<AbstractNarration>The growing complexity of research requires increasingly sophisticated tools, technologies, data options and solutions. Moreover, scientific inquiry is increasingly reliant on the ability to access a diversity of resources, on and off campus, based on comprehensive technology and infrastructure solutions along with capable networks that facilitate the sharing, management and analysis of data. However, to fully support scientific research it is not enough to simply provide cyberinfrastructure (CI). Expertise in matching resources to research requirements is essential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-year project sustains the activities of a Campus Cyberinfrastructure Engineer (CIE) dedicated to supporting research inquiry. The CIE leads the provisioning and integration of local and remote resources, including those that are sited around the world, that meet the research and training needs of faculty and students while actively advocating for domain scientists' differing CI needs. This project identifies and addresses gaps in CI services and infrastructure, and incorporates new technologies and practices into the existing service portfolio and team skill set, allowing the broader CI team to better support research and training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides enabling and integrative capabilities across multiple disciplines and bridges activities between internal and external communities of practice through: (1) researcher support in pursuit and execution of research activities; (2) design, development, and integration advancement of core cyberinfrastructure services; (3) engagement of local, regional, and national partners in the development of communities of practice; (4) growth and expanded usage of the University's Science DMZ network; and (5) core CI services training.</AbstractNarration>

As data management needs have grown, the limitations of localized solutions have become increasingly apparent. Over the past few years, Northwestern, with the assistance of numerous federal grants, has invested heavily in the creation of a number of centralized data management resources that can provide the necessary throughput and storage capacity to address the burgeoning volume of research data spanning disciplines from social to bio-medical to physical sciences.  The CIE has approached challenges, including lab instruments that require outdated operating systems which run on aging desktops and establishing a common framework for data management that spans research labs and facilities who have several users.

The availability of the CIE has taken research capacity to another level ? ability to analyze more, much quicker than before, therefore speeding up time to discovery     The CIE has been instrumental in teaching scientific staff best practices for upgrading and maintaining the systems to meet the CI challenges that lay ahead.      Developing computational, data, and programming skills in the research community to allow researchers to more effectively conduct computational or data-enabled research.     Providing training materials and best practices in supporting researchers to other academic institutions.     Learning research requirements and making appropriate service improvements to computational services to adapt to and support current researcher needs.     Improved practices related to securing research data when it is shared across research group members and more broadly.
