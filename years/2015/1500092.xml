<AbstractNarration>Gutob is a seriously endangered and poorly described language of Odisha State in eastern-central India. There are many unusual constructions found in Gutob, some traceable to archaic South Munda. Noun incorporation, for example, allows a range of semantic roles to be incorporated into the verb.  For example, 'I wash my hand' is expressed in Gutob as 'I wash-hand' where 'hand' is incorporated into the verb to create a new verb 'wash-hand'.  Moreover, the same noun may occur within the verb and also occur as an independent noun; for example, 'I my hand wash-hand'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gregory Anderson of the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages and K. David Harrison of Swarthmore College will work with Indian scholars over the course of this two-year grant to create a comprehensive scientific description (a reference grammar, corpus of analyzed oral language samples, and analytic dictionary) of Gutob.  They will analyze in depth noun incorporation and other typologically unique Gutob constructions. Since Gutob has through its history been in contact with genetically unrelated languages, Anderson and Harrison will also investigate the extent and nature of Gutob language change through contact. Through their interaction with and mentoring of local scholars, the researchers will build infrastructure for further language documentation in Odisha State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Gutob audio and video data, along with transcriptions and translations, collected during the project will be freely accessible from the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures. An online Gutob Talking Dictionary will be freely available at the talkingdictionary.org website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by co-funds from the National Science Foundation's International Science and Engineering Office.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Project outcomes entail both documentation and community development. With respect to the latter, the original project participants Ms. Kamla Sisa and Mr. Tankadhar Sisa took part in the training where they acquired the skills necessary to make recordings, do ethnographic interviews, upload and back up files on a computer, as well as how to collect metadata and execute file naming conventions. While the Gutob community does not typically value any educational pursuits, both Ms. Sisa and Mr. Sisa report that their family members had become supportive of this project, as indicated by the fact that they were permitted to take part in the workshop in the first place. Two other Gutob community members also took part in the training: Mr. Sukaro Kirsani and Mr. Bondu Kirsani.&nbsp;</p> <p>With respect to the documentation and archiving goals, the massive expansion of the data collection, we collected another four thousand one hundred (4100) lexical items, bringing the total number to just over five thousand seven hundred (5700) lexical items collected. 2500 are currently in the online Talking Dictionary. Transcriptions of the remaining lexical materials have progressed significantly, and only a few hundred remain to be processed. Also during the third field trip, we collected a further one thousand five hundred sixty (1560) elicited sentences and phrases bringing that total to just over two thousand one hundred (2100). To date, roughly two-thirds of such have been transcribed and analyzed.</p> <p>We also were able to collect another three dozen texts representing various extant genres: songs, riddles, aphorisms, personal narratives, traditional stories, ethnographically-themed stories, demonstration videos, etc. This has brought the number of oral texts we have collected to forty (40), and represents the full range of text types that endure in the Gutob community. This includes eleven (11) aphorisms, thirteen (13) riddles, two (2) legacy texts in audio format, three (3) songs, one (1) traditional narrative, nine (9) ethnographic texts, two (2) personal narratives and one (1) demonstration/how-to text in both video and audio format. All transcriptions and translations have been completed and were verified with speakers in late September through early November 2017. All annotated texts have been deposited in PARADISEC, including associated ELAN files. The segmentation of small files out of the large raw lexical sound files continues, and a preliminary version of the Gutob Talking Dictionary is online as of late November 2017. Work on the print version of a Gutob sketch grammar, dictionary and text collection with comparative notes on Remo will continue into 2018. Brill Publishers have expressed a preliminary interest in publishing this volume when it is completed.&nbsp;</p> <p>During the course of the first project year, we were able to make five (5) presentations that used Gutob data collected.&nbsp;Four papers were joint presentations between PI Dr. Anderson and post-doctoral assistant Dr. Bikram Jora. Three more such joint paers were done in the second year of the project. This allowed for considerable opportunities to pursue mentoring by the PI Dr. Anderson for the post-doctoral assistant Dr. Jora.&nbsp;PI Anderson and pre-doctoral research Opino Gomango presented papers at&nbsp;conferences in Shillong, India, at the Austroasiatic Languages of South Asia conference, and in Hyderabad, India, at the Foundation for Endangered Languages XXth Annual meeting in 2016, as well as in 2017 at conferences held at Berhampur, India. Mr. Gomango delivered other joint-talks at the Linguistics Society of Sri Lanka in Colombo, Sri Lanka and at the Linguistics Society of Nepal in October and November 2017.&nbsp;Thus, significant opportunities for mentoring by the PI to the post-doctoral and pre-doctoral team members were taken in the form of joint collaborative work and the writing up of presentations, as well as in scholarly networking for the career development of the two India-based junior researchers.&nbsp;To date, we have deposited sixteen (16) videos in .MP4 format in the open access <a href="http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/collections/GA2">Gutob deposit (GA2)</a> stored in the online PARADISEC archive.&nbsp;In addition, we have twenty-four (24) audio texts representing thirteen (13) riddles and eleven (11) aphorisms. We also have deposited sixty-two (62) long raw sound files totaling roughly thirty (30) hours of grammatical elicitation and just over two thousand one hundred individual sentences and phrases. In addition, we have deposited sixteen (16) photos in .JPG format. We have deposited one hundred thirty seven (137) raw lexical files in .WAV format, representing approximately sixty-eight (68) hours of recorded data. This brings the total of deposited files to over two hundred (200) representing over one hundred (100) hours of data.&nbsp;Furthermore, we also have two thousand five hundred fifty-four segmented sound (2554) files in .WAV format, which can be found in the online <a href="http://talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu/gutob/">Gutob Talking Dictionary</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Gregory&nbsp;D&nbsp;Anderson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1500092/1500092_10395891_1511988647569_DSC02069.JPG--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1500092/1500092_10395891_1511988647569_DSC02069.JPG--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Training Program"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1500092/1500092_10395891_1511988647569_DSC02069.JPG--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Training Program"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tankadhar Sisa works at the computer during a digital training session</div> <div class="imageCredit">Opino Gomango</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gregory&nbsp;D&nbsp;Anderson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Training Program</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1500092/1500092_10395891_1511988457511_ScreenShot2017-11-29at4.10.39AM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1500092/1500092_10395891_1511988457511_ScreenShot2017-11-29at4.10.39AM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Work on Gutob Texts, Odisha"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1500092/1500092_10395891_1511988457511_ScreenShot2017-11-29at4.10.39AM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Work on Gutob Texts, Odisha"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bondu Kirsani (L), Sukaro Kirsani (C), Kui speaker and Living Tongues assistant Gajendra Pradhan (R) go over a recording</div> <div class="imageCredit">Opino Gomango</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gregory&nbsp;D&nbsp;Anderson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Work on Gutob Texts, Odisha</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
