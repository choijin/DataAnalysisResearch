<AbstractNarration>Mass spectrometry instruments with ultrahigh mass resolution and extreme sensitivity are especially well suited for the analysis of complex environmental samples, such as found in the organic mixtures in atmospheric aerosols, and a range of natural waters and hydrometeors. The proposal seeks to acquire and commission an ultrahigh mass resolution Thermo Orbitrap Elite MS, with high mass resolution aiding in more accurate molecular weight determination, and interfaced with 2-D liquid chromatography to aid in separation in mixtures of like compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular signatures and relative quantities of molecules in complex mixtures will be used initially to further our understanding of: (1) atmospheric aerosol processes (e.g., cloud cycling and aging) and properties (e.g., hygroscopicity and volatility); (2) carbon cycling responses to changes in biota and climate; and additional applications such as: (3) multiphase reaction chamber work; (4) fate of organic contaminants during water treatment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced analytical instrumentation also significantly expands the research opportunities and training exercises for students, postdocs and the next generation of researchers/teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We successfully acquired and installed the requested ultrahigh resolution Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer into a university core facility at Michigan Tech. The core facility serves the greater university community.    We also demonstrated sufficient resolving power to baseline resolve peaks with a 3 mDa mass difference, which allows confident molecular formula assignment over a wider mass range of components in complex mixtures. The power of these assignments has been demonstrated in several projects.   In one project, we focused on the detailed molecular characterization of received laboratory combustion samples. New method development revealed that a 2-step solid phase extraction separates components into two relatively distinct fractions. Where the second fraction contains considerably more of the light-absorbing species than the first and is considerably more aromatic.   In another project, we compared the detailed composition of samples that were exposed to advanced oxidation procedures intended for the advanced treatment of wastewater. The results provide evidence for the reaction pathways that occur in these complex mixtures when radicals are introduced to the system.  In a third project, we studied several pore water samples from an extensive poor fen in Nestoria, Michigan, USA. The molecular composition of dissolved organic nitrogen was studied because nitrogen is an essential macronutrient for plants and microbes. When other sources of nitrogen are scarce, microbes decompose higher molecular weight dissolved organic nitrogen species to recover nitrogen for nutritional needs.  Advanced instrumentation promotes innovation in research and education.  It also significantly expands the research opportunities and training for students and post-doctoral researchers, who represent the next generation of researchers and teachers. In this project, we developed a new set of laboratory classes to teach students to operate the ultrahigh resolution Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer. This provides students with the opportunity to conduct explorative analyses for new discoveries.  So far, a total of 22 students from 12 different research groups have used the instrument.  The results from this body of work have been disseminated in 10 peer-reviewed publications and 14 oral presentations at various scientific meetings.
