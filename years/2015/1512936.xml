<AbstractNarration>Stochastic processes and their applications are a subfield of probability theory dealing with modeling real life data, representing the evolution of a system of random values over time.  Familiar examples of stochastic processes include stock market fluctuations, signals such as audio and video, medical data such as a patient's blood pressure or temperature, and random movement, such as random walk. A generalization, the random field, describes evolution in time and space. Examples of random fields include static images, random terrain (landscapes), waves, or composition variations of a heterogeneous material. This research project is concerned with a better understanding of the degree of dependence in a stochastic process or random field by using new techniques for studying the interactions between its variables. These techniques are based on surprising relationships with concepts that appear in other fields of mathematics, such as algebra and dynamical systems.  The results will lead to a more accurate prediction of future values of random evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, in many situations, the interactions between the variables are viewed as a measure of the strength of dependence of a time series. The information about these interactions is given by a function called the "spectral density function," which plays a central role in the theory of time series and random fields. Other spectral notions in mathematics are: "operator spectral measure," which generates the transitions of a Markov process, and "empirical spectral distribution" of the eigenvalues of large random matrices with entries selected from random fields. This research project aims to establish several structural relationships that will build bridges between these three, apparently disparate notions, each having  the word "spectral" in its definition. The results of this research will show that this is not a coincidence. As a matter of fact, they are interconnected and they shed light on one another. These relationships will facilitate determination of the strength of dependence in a random evolution. They will extend and improve tools used for analyzing stationary stochastic processes and fields by indicating new ways to estimate their spectral density. Some of the results will contribute to a better understanding of the limiting empirical eigenvalue distribution for random matrices with correlated entries, exhibiting long range dependence. The research aims to show that this limiting distribution is uniquely determined by the field's spectral density and to find a formula relating them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research has its origin in the study of times series, which are phenomena that evolve in time and in addition exhibit an inherent random variation. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In case when the probability distributions do not change when shifted in time the time series is called stationary. The condition of stationarity  is often a reasonable assumption for modeling various evolutions in time. Furthermore, nonstationary data can be often transformed to become stationary. The examples of stationary time series include auto-regressive schemes and linear time series.  During this award life we developed reliable methods to analyze stationary time series,  in order to better understand the world around us and to predict future outcomes.  One of the most important techniques for studying time series is the spectral analysis, based on correlations between pairs of variables observed at different moments of time. The condensed information given by correlations is encapsulated in a function called the spectral density. The main goal of spectral analysis is to estimate or to test statistical hypotheses about the spectral density. Since the spectral density is a function, its statistical approximation is very difficult to obtain. This problem is a subject of intense research.  The results obtained enhance the study of the spectral density of a time series, by providing unexpected relationships with other areas of research such as harmonic analysis, operator theory and the study of random matrices.  More precisely, our research proves  that the spectral density appears as a characteristic in mathematical objects such as:  -the limits of the Fourier transform in harmonic analysis  - in functional analysis spectral density can be derived from the operators spectral measure  - spectral density also appears as a characteristic in the spectral limiting distribution of random matrices.  These interconnections lead to new tools for constructing estimates and statistical tests for spectral densities. Finally these estimates are used for obtaining  better, more reliable predictions and forecasting. In other words they more accurately describe the likely outcomes of the time series in the immediate future, given the knowledge of the most recent outcomes.  The result on this research is the subject of 15 new research papers by the principal investigator and her collaborators, including two Ph.D. students. All of them are published or accepted for publication in well-established probability journals. Many of these results are also included in a forthcoming monograph which will  be  published by the Oxford Press.  For fast dissemination, the results were presented in national and international meetings and were well-received by the mathematical community. The PI collaborated on several problems with mathematicians from England and France, among others, contributing in this way to the international dissemination of these results.                    The PI incorporated these research results in courses and seminars and also in training two Ph.D. students, which contributed to strengthening the education in the University of Cincinnati.
