<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1511789   Conrad, Jacinta &lt;br/&gt;The investigators have shown that significantly improved sensitivity can be achieved by using engineered bio-active nanoparticles. The applications of the proposed method development, if successful, will simplify pathogen detection in a variety of contexts, including food, water and medical samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is  to identify, understand, and ultimately engineer the properties of phage reporters and membranes that provide sensitive response in lateral flow assays (LFA).  The hypothesis is tailoring the properties of phage nanoparticles and LFA membranes will enhance phage transport and binding and as a result reduce LFA limit of detection. The specific aims are to: (1) vary phage morphology to understand phage performance as LFA reporters; (2) identify membrane properties that enhance phage transport and adhesion onto the membrane; and (3) select phage for superior performance using directed evolution. Phage reporters of varied shape and size will be imaged with confocal microscopy as they diffuse through and bind to LFA membranes. Using high-throughput image-processing algorithms, phage orientation and dispersion, binding will be correlated to membrane properties and pore size. Directed evolution will be used to select phage with improved transport and specificity from libraries of billions of candidates.  Intellectual Merit: This project integrates the expertise of the PI in imaging and confined transport with that of the co-PI in chromatographic interactions and phage engineering to develop LFAs of increased sensitivity. Phage reporters are potentially transformative as LFA reporters, enabling fast, inexpensive and ultrasensitive detection with extremely low non-specific binding. The proposed research will establish ultrasensitive LFAs as a broadly-applicable platform technology. The transport of nonspherical nanoparticles in porous media is under-investigated, and the proposed work will use phage as a new model system in for studing dispersion in complex and confined media. Finally, this proposal introduces phage evolution with separation as a novel method to engineer bacteriophage for applications in the emerging area of nanobiotechnology.  Broader Impacts:  Viral nanoparticle LFA technology can be readily integrated with microfluidics and smartphone-based fluorescence imaging to yield an inexpensive yet ultrasensitive point-of-use diagnostic tool. Bioseparations dominate the cost and process complexity of manufacturing of modern biopharmaceuticals; process analytical (PAT) technologies that do not require trained investigators will immediately impact this area. In addition, a field-portable analytical method may prove useful for environmental contamination, food safety monitoring, and medical diagnostics. The University of Houston is the second-most ethnically diverse research university in the US and is designated as a Hispanic-serving Institution, providing a fertile recruiting ground for broadening participation from underrepresented groups. The PIs will continue ongoing outreach efforts aimed at the local scientific community, by organizing the Texas Soft Matter Meeting for academic and industrial scientists, and at society at large, by writing and presenting popular science radio programs for The Academic Minute and Engines of our Ingenuity.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Overview: This project pioneered the development of ultrasensitive lateral flow assays (LFAs) using a variety of novel reporters. The LFA is most commonly known as the format of the home pregnancy test: it is convenient for testing inexpensively, rapidly, and at the point-of-care.&nbsp;LFA involves capillary flow of a sample along a dry, porous membrane to a line bearing antibodies specific to a target analyte. In the presence of target analyte, reporter particles bearing analyte-specific antibodies are analyte-bridged to the membrane-bound antibodies and accumulate in lines to indicate a positive test. The convenience and ease of LFAs are well-suited to a variety of applications, including biodefense, biopharmaceutical manufacturing, food safety, and (currently imperative) for large-scale surveillance monitoring during pandemics. LFAs, however, suffer from several drawbacks that limit their widespread use: Conventional LFAs are not quantitative, hindering their use in settings in which the course of action depends on the concentration of analyte (for example, in treatment of the viral pathogen Ebola), and may be insufficiently sensitive. There remains an unmet need for more-sensitive reporter technologies that can be adapted to LFAs without compromising their attractive ease of use and minimal equipment requirements.&nbsp;</p> <p>Intellectual Merit: Work supported under this project led to a variety of novel LFA reporter particles that were able to detect model viruses and/or proteins at concentrations that were 100- to 1000-fold below that of conventional LFAs. (1) We established as novel reporters several species of bacteriophage of varying shape and size, which can be engineered to bear fluor labels and antibodies and can be captured through a single analyte interaction. We showed that the anisotropic shape of filamentous phage contributes in at least two ways to enhancing capture and thus the remarkable sensitivity of phage-LFA: by promoting tumbling near the surface of a convex LFA membrane fiber (thereby bringing capture sites closer to the membrane), and through their high surface-area-to-volume ratio (increasing the number of capture sites). We also developed methods to optimize and purify phage constructs and reagents for use in practical assays. (2) &nbsp;&nbsp;Inspired by the sensitivity of cheap, stable, non-toxic "glowsticks", we developed chemically-excited GLOW particlese as LFA reporters. &nbsp;The emission wavelength depends on the fluorophore used, making it possible to excite GLOW-LFA reporters in a variety of colors using a single activating chemical. Thus, this format offers the exciting possibility of multiplexing to detect multiple analytes in a single LFA membrane. (3) Very recently, we showed that gold nanostars also enhance sensitivity in LFA. In ongoing work, we will test hypothesize that the increased sensitivity of nanostars as compared to gold nanospheres arises from their larger surface area.</p> <p>This project also supported studies aimed at understanding the effects of reporter kinetics and transport on LFA signal through flow manipulation. (1) We developed a rapid-filtration method to rapidly expose LFA membranes to phage and thereby study phage binding kinetics. (2) We studied how the dimensions of the LFA membrane affected the speed and signal development in LFA membranes. (3) We investigated the effects of complex media, modeled using charged polymer solutions, on phage transport. Together, these studies provide the fundamental insight needed to increase sensitivity and reduce readout time.</p> <p>Broader Impacts: Cheap, simple, widely-deployable technologies for rapid detection at home are urgently needed during the current viral pandemic. Technology developed under support from this proposal is currently being applied to detection of COVID-19, bolstered by our NSF-supported work on phage reagent optimization and practical assay development. Willsons group has started a company to pursue diagnostic applications of LFAs using the chemi-excitation GLOW technology, again currently focused on COVID-19.</p> <p>This project supported (in whole or in part) the training of six graduate students and seven undergraduate students in biochemical functionalization, LFA development and testing, and microscale flow. As part of their outreach portfolios, Conrad and students participated in two Houston Energy Day outreach events for the general public.
