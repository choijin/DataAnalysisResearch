<AbstractNarration>This REU site will engage students in research related to water resource management issues in the Yucat치n Peninsula in Mexico. Science and engineering undergraduate students will work with faculty mentors from Northern Illinois University, Northeastern Illinois University, and the Yucat치n Center of Scientific Research on projects related to groundwater recharge, groundwater contamination and public health, and groundwater geophysics. The goals of this REU site include: develop scientific skills in the field and laboratory, install in students a global perspective of water resource issues, develop communication skills in the participants, and develop appreciation for international scientific collaborations. The student projects will be interconnected to better understand the water issues in Yucat치n within a cultural and historical context. Because the research project is in Mexico and encompasses a cultural aspect, it is expected that students interested in the region will be attracted to apply. In addition to carrying out research, the participants will produce materials for online platforms to share information with the public, make presentations in Mexico to local officials about the research findings, and publish the results in open access journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During an eight-week period, the program will provide a high quality research environment and mentoring to a diverse group of 8 undergraduate students that may not otherwise have the opportunity to be engaged in scientific activities in an international context. The summer experience will consist of: (1) two weeks at Northern Illinois University where participants will define the research they will pursue in the field, participate in ethics training, discuss the relationship between culture and water issues in Yucat치n, receive safety and travel information, and virtually meet the team members from Mexico; (2) the next four weeks will be spent in Mexico sampling and collecting field data; the participants will stay in local neighborhoods, away from the tourist areas to gain more in-depth appreciation for the culture. During this period, participants will be working side by side with Mexican scientists and students; and (3) the last two weeks participants will return to Northern Illinois University to continue with data analyses and synthesis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Collaborative Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program at Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) created an international alliance of students, researchers, faculty, and other partners to provide students with research experiences related to water quality and water resources issues in the Riviera Maya region in M?xico.  The working partners included NEIU, Northern Illinois University (NIU), and the Centro de Investigaci?n Cient?fica de Yucat?n (CICY), located in M?xico.  This partnership provided 18 students with an international experience that not only included scientific training and international experience, but also provided students a cultural and societal context to the scientific work that they were doing.  Recruitment for the program focused on students that are traditionally underrepresented in the geosciences. This included students that identified as African- American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, Native Alaskan, and Pacific Islander.  Recruitment efforts also focused on institutions where research experiences are not readily available for undergraduate students. Recruitment was carried out by direct emails to relevant department and programs (with a focus on Hispanic Serving &amp; Minority Serving Institutions), promotion at scientific and professional conferences, and through social media tools such as Twitter and Facebook. Our efforts were successful in recruiting from our targeted applicant pool, as out of the 18 student participants, all of them identified as at least one of the traditionally underrepresented groups listed above, 6 were from community colleges, and the remaining 12 students came from institutions without the types of research opportunities available to students at doctoral granting institutions.  Our stated focus was to focus on students that identified as Hispanic/Latinx, and we were able to continually recruit excellent students for this program.  The scientific projects that the student worked on were focused on the impact of tourism on the critical water resources in the area surrounding Canc?n, M?xico.  A well-known tourist area that depends on tourism to support the economy, Canc?n is also an area where the freshwater resource lies in a very vulnerable geological area known as karst.  This type of area is frequented by sinkholes and caves, giving rise to the tourism attractions known as cenotes.  These cenotes are a direct window into the subsurface water resource of the region, and it was through these cenotes that the students were able to perform much of their work.  Research areas included 1) water chemistry and contamination, 2) characterization of the underground network that allows the groundwater to flow, 3) microbiological and virological impacts of contamination, and 4) public perception of the groundwater resource, as it relates to tourism and as an important natural resource for the area.  Our collaboration with CICY was critical to the success of this program. CICY is a federal scientific organization in M?xico that focuses on issues in the Yucat?n region.  We worked with scientists and students from a specific department in CICY that focused on issues related to water in the Canc?n region. This aspect of the program allowed students and faculty to develop rich and meaningful partnerships with our colleagues in M?xico, and to gain valuable international experience.  In connection with our stated focus on Hispanic/Latinx students, this aspect also provided out students with the opportunity to build relationships with role models and mentors that represented their own backgrounds and culture.  This was a key part of our program that helped to build student confidence and a greater awareness of the opportunities available to them.  This program also provided students with historical and cultural context of their scientific work through the collaborations with historians and archaeologists on a cultural/historical tour of the Yucat?n each summer that focused on not only issues related to water, but also on the larger picture of the area as a whole.  Through this experience, students and faculty were able to gain an appreciation of the area they were working in and the people they were working with that not only went beyond their science, but provided a respectful and contextual framework for the work that they were doing.  Students were supported in their attendance at scientific and professional conferences to share their findings with the larger community and to also build their own community of colleagues and mentors, primarily at the national Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native American in Science meeting.  Students also presented at national meetings of the Geological Society of America and the American Geophysical Union.  We continue to communicate with our students as they finish up their undergraduate degrees, consider careers and graduate school options, and explore their opportunities. Students have gone onto 4-year institutions, Master?s and Doctoral Programs, additional international experiences, and careers within their disciplines.  This REU program is looking forward to not only seeing where our alumni progress to, but also to continuing to work with new students in the future.
