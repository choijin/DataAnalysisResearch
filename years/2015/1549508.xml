<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the degree to which businesses at a local level are dependent on computers and the Internet for daily operations. Of those that are, the project investigates the degree to which they implement good or bad cybersecurity practices with an particular emphasis on very small businesses. Understanding their needs helps fill a knowledge gap within the cybersecurity industry and has local as well as national security and economic implications. In particular, knowledge gained will help identify cybersecurity gaps and needs, raise awareness of these gaps and needs, and make progress toward solving problems faced by existing and emerging threats. This in turn will help improve the national situation "from the ground up" by helping to make such establishments more secure in an era where they are increasingly being targeted by malicious actors who see this business demographic as a prime target for exploitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project conducts interviews with key stakeholders and implements a survey of local businesses in El Paso County (Texas) to collect a mix of quantitative and qualitative data on relevant cybersecurity issues. Both technical and human factors related to cybersecurity are be addressed. The methodology for this project is designed to be applicable in other geographical areas (i.e. cities and counties) within the U.S. which allows for a comparison of results providing a perspective on the state of cybersecurity at different levels. Because the small business community is particularly difficult to contact, best practices are also identified for eliciting participation of business owners. To ensure adequate representation of this demographic, the survey is implemented using a mixed mode data collection methodology utilizing paper, telephone, web, and tablet computer based surveys (tablets are utilized for on-site contact of business owners). While cybersecurity is typically regarded as a national or state level issue, this project seeks to demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case. Establishing a secure and trustworthy cyberspace nationally will benefit by focusing on issues faced by local businesses and finding ways to address their needs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Small businesses outnumber and employ more people than large companies. One attribute used to define small and midsize businesses (SMB) is number of employees. This project uses the definition provided by SMB Research (http://smbresearch.net/sizing-up-smb/) to define what are called "Micro" businesses (fewer than 10 employees). For these types, an investigation was conducted to determine the degree to which &ldquo;local&rdquo; businesses are dependent on computers and the Internet for daily operations. The project also investigated the degree to which such businesses implement good or bad cybersecurity practices (e.g. password selection).</p> <p>The primary target was micro businesses or a typical "mom and pop" establishment. Objectives included: 1) Better understand degree to which small businesses implement good cybersecurity practices; 2) Fill a cybersecurity knowledge gap for very small and micro businesses; 3) Get a picture of the "local" threat landscape to see how this relates to the national threat landscape; 4) Raise awareness of the need for cybersecurity at the micro business level; 5) Make progress toward solving problems faced by existing and emerging threats; and 6) Extend the scope of the survey to include businesses in the Paso Del Norte/Upper Rio Grande Region to include the counties of Otero and Dona Ana, NM as well as the counties of Brewster, Culberson, Jeff Davis, Hudspeth, and Presidio Texas. The primary aim of this research is to help make such establishments more secure in an era where they are increasingly being targeted by malicious actors who see this business demographic as a prime target for exploitation.</p> <p>The central activity was development of a survey instrument and subsequent data collectiont. On February 26, 2016 a cybersecurity focus group was held at the Small Business Development Center at El Paso Community College. The aim was to obtain feedback from a mix of business owners and other professionals, including law enforcement, on the types of questions to ask. The final instrument consisted of 45 questions across 8 sections: Business Demographics; Technology; Cybersecurity Awareness; Basic Cybersecurity Practices &ndash; Technology and Information Security; Cybersecurity Incidents; Advanced Cybersecurity Practices - Malware Prevention; Advanced Cybersecurity Practices - User Education and Awareness; and Cybersecurity Budget. The instrument was written so that it can be implemented at a county level.</p> <p>Data was collected between July 2016 and February 2018. Approaches to this effort consisted of &ldquo;in person&rdquo;, phone based, and email contact. Data was collected in real-time using Internet enabled mobile tablets interfacing with a web-based survey tool developed by the PI. The project has collected approximately 310 surveys where respondents answered at least one question. Of these, approximately 210 were fully or mostly completed. Of the 310, 196 respondents report having fewer than 10 employees and of these, 35 have reported having 0 employees, e.g. self-employed (see Image 1).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to survey responses, the project also collected over 6,600 survey technician comments that documented ther experiences with the data collection effort. The primary aim was to better understand why so many businesses elected not to participate in the survey. Results indicate that many were simply too busy to participate at the time of contact (see Image 2).</p> <p>Analysis was conducted using MicroSoft Excel and the R Programming Language text mining package <strong>tm</strong>. Some observations follow:</p> <ul> <li>&ldquo;Does your business rely on any type of information to stay in business or to remain competitive?&rdquo;. Most is not considered High Risk. All that reported High Risk had 3 to 6 employees. (See Images 3 and 4)</li> <li>Majority of companies reported collecting at least Moderate risk data. Employee sizes ranged from 1 to 9 employees. (See Images 3 and 4)</li> <li>Information collected appears to be tightly guarded. (See Image 5)</li> <li>&ldquo;<strong>What three main obstacles to protecting your business from cyber-threats?&rdquo;</strong>. Top reported obstacles included: User training; Funding; Malware; Passwords; and Email. (See Image 6)</li> </ul> <p>The impact of this project went beyond investigation of the business community. Cybersecurity research opportunities were provided for two students in both analysis (text mining and natural language processing) and general cybersecurity research. Both assistants (a psychology student and a computer science student) conducted analysis using the R programming language and SPSS. The computer science student improved his coding skills through hands on coding and through an application security training session. Overall, the project provided opportunities for seven students (one student assistant and 6 survey technicians) of underrepresented groups to increase their cybersecurity knowledge and skills as well as heighten their awareness of cybersecurity. Five were liberal arts majors, so this project helped increase their technical knowledge.</p> <p>Finally, in addition to data collected on revenues and expenditures, the data collected is based on the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS 2012). This allows for analysis such as ecomonic impact analyses that utilize the same industrial coding system.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Mario&nbsp;E&nbsp;Caire</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1549508/1549508_10390979_1527715895834_Howmanypersonnel--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1549508/1549508_10390979_1527715895834_Howmanypersonnel--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1549508/1549508_10390979_1527715895834_Howmanypersonnel--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">How many personnel are employed by your business?</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mario Caire</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mario&nbsp;E&nbsp;Caire</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1549508/1549508_10390979_1527715965389_SurveyTechnicianCommentCategory--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1549508/1549508_10390979_1527715965389_SurveyTechnicianCommentCategory--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1549508/1549508_10390979_1527715965389_SurveyTechnicianCommentCategory--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Survey Technician Comment Summary</div> <div class="imageCredit">M ario Caire</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mario&nbsp;E&nbsp;Caire</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1549508/1549508_10390979_1527716337403_Doesyourbusinessrelyonanytypeofinformation--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1549508/1549508_10390979_1527716337403_Doesyourbusinessrelyonanytypeofinformation--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1549508/1549508_10390979_1527716337403_Doesyourbusinessrelyonanytypeofinformation--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Does your business rely on any type of information to stay in business or to remain competitive?</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mario Caire</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mario&nbsp;E&nbsp;Caire</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1549508/1549508_10390979_1527716606272_Doesyourbusinessrelyonanytypeofinformation-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1549508/1549508_10390979_1527716606272_Doesyourbusinessrelyonanytypeofinformation-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1549508/1549508_10390979_1527716606272_Doesyourbusinessrelyonanytypeofinformation-2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Does your business rely on any type of information to stay in business or to remain competitive?
