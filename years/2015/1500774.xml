<AbstractNarration>This award to University of Colorado, Boulder is made to support travel for twenty US graduate students, and three invited speakers from US institutions to a day-long workshop on model-based phylogenetics and phylogeography on the day prior to the Evolution meetings in Guarujo, Brazil (June 26, 2015). Model-based phylogenetic methods are growing at a staggering pace and now provide researchers with an opportunity to address research questions that were not possible before. This proposal is worthy of funding because it will allow U.S. researchers to learn about these new model-based phylogenetic methods first hand from several of the leading researchers in the field. The workshop is structured to provide an introduction to the theory behind the models followed by hands-on experience with the various software packages using real world data.  The PIs and speakers have a strong track record of running successful workshops on similar topics demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed plan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will support travel to the meeting and accommodation for twenty US graduate students, including members of under-represented groups. All workshop tutorials will be made publically available through a dedicated website and all presentations will be uploaded to YouTube after the meeting.  100 foreign graduate students, predominantly from South and Central America, will also attend the workshop enhancing opportunities for international scientific collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In recent years, approaches to addressing fundamental questions about evolutionary history, such as when and where new traits arose, have become increasingly statistical and model-based. These developments have allowed for stronger inferences with respect to evolutionary patterns and processes, but can make the field of systematics daunting for new students. This project aimed to help students tackle this steep learning curve by providing training in model-based methods through a full-day workshop held in association with the 2015 International Evolution meeting in Guaruja, Brazil. The workshop featured parallel tracks in phylogenetics and phylogeography. Each track, led by a team of four speakers from diverse backgrounds and career stages, included a set of hands-on activities and well-developed empirical case studies to engage students with the methods. The award supported the participation of 20 graduate students from the U.S., and an additional 47 students from Brazil and other Latin American countries attended. The materials generated by the workshop (videos of talks, datasets, tutorials, etc.) have been made publicly accessible through several websites. Also, an online community was established as part of the workshop to allow communication among participants and to foster sharing of information and resources.
