<AbstractNarration>Integration of nanoparticles into polymers leads to enhancement in thermal, mechanical and shape changing properties of composite materials. Functionalizing nanoparticle surfaces with polymers that are chemically identical to matrix polymer are commonly employed in conventional polymer composites simply to control particle dispersion. However, maintaining dispersion and mechanical properties during high temperature processing and applications holds a critical importance in manufacturing and performance of polymeric products. This grant focuses on understanding the role of particle-polymer interactions on dispersion, mechanical properties and processing. Towards this goal, the PIs will focus on a material system design with on-demand control on reversible mechanical response. Reversibly stiffening composites can be used in various applications from soft robotics, flexible electronics to injectable implants where mechanical integrity should be maintained when heated. This collaborative work offers a fundamental research plan integrating the expertise of the PIs on experimental and molecular dynamics simulations on polymer nanocomposites to study the underlying mechanisms. In addition, the project offers to educate graduate and undergraduate students on nanomaterials design and processing. To broaden the knowledge of nanoscience and nanomaterials in high school education, the PIs aim to organize a workshop for teachers in New Jersey and New York area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team aims to explore the phenomenon of reversible stiffening in polymer nanocomposites. It is hypothesized that particles coated with a high glass transition temperature (Tg) polymer and dispersed in a low-Tg polymer exhibit liquid-to-solid transition upon heating. Experimental work is designed to show the universality of this behavior in various miscible blends with different glass-transition temperature differences. The phenomenon will be employed on magnetic nanoparticles to demonstrate that the mechanical behavior can be regulated with local heating of particles. Moreover, additional experiments to relate the local viscosity and particle relaxations in asymmetric blends on interphases are planned in order to capture the physics and mechanical response in the experimental system design. Simulations will run in parallel and will be used to guide the material design and more importantly will identify the atomistic scale physics that leads to stiffening at high temperatures. Processing studies will be conducted to understand the stability of interphase layers, and composite structure (morphology) and properties after processing. The processing results are very relevant for the material design such as for biomedical implants where materials will experience frequent and controlled dynamic loadings during their intended use for in vivo bone formation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The collaborative work performed was aimed at designing reversibly stiffening polymer nanocomposites (see Figure 1). The material design strategy, which relied on the miscibility and asymmetric dynamics of polymer blends in the presence of nanoparticles, was explored through experiments and computer simulations. It was hypothesized that nanoparticles coated with a stiff polymer (having a high glass transition temperature) and dispersed in a flexible polymer (having a low glass transition temperature) would stiffen upon heating (&ldquo;thermal stiffening&rdquo;). Most materials (with the exception of networked and cross&ndash;linked materials such as glass and rubber) present a softening behavior upon heating, therefore, observation of thermal stiffening in an uncross&ndash;linked material is both unique and scientifically interesting. Taking this hypothesis to the biomaterial design, Stevens and Rensselaer teams aim to develop injectable implants that can be used in fracture healing. The main objectives of this proposal are to: (i) design thermo-stiffening biocompatible composites from non-responsive constituents to create stiffening systems that will expedite bone healing process, (ii) determine design parameter space and evaluate life-time cycle (aging) via targeted, fully atomistic computer simulations, and (iii) investigate the influence of processing operations on the designed material structure and properties.&nbsp;</p> <p>Major outcomes of this project are as follows:</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong>Thermal stiffening was observed for the first time in an uncross&ndash;linked material. Experiments indicated that thermal stiffening behavior was reversible and repeatable (Figure 1). The main reasons for the thermal stiffening behavior depend on the presence of three main components in the material: (i) nanoparticles, (ii) a soft polymer matrix, and (iii) stiff polymer chains anchored at the nanoparticle&ndash;matrix polymer interface (Figure 2). Having a glass transition temperature difference between the matrix polymer and interfacial polymer is the main driving mechanism behind thermal stiffening. Computer simulations showed that changes in the structure and dynamics of interfacial polymer could be one reason for the onset of thermal stiffening. At low temperatures (when the matrix polymer is liquid like and interfacial polymer is dynamically frozen) and the interfacial polymer is phase separated from the matrix polymer (Figure 2a), the overall properties of the nanocomposite system follows those of the soft polymer matrix if the interfacial polymer chains are strongly adsorbed to the nanoparticle, and as a result, have very little interaction with the soft polymer matrix chains. However, as temperature increases and approaches to the glass transition temperature of the interfacial polymer, interfacial polymer chains start becoming mobile and assume conformations that extend into the polymer matrix (Figure 2b). This is also facilitated by the fact that interfacial and matrix polymers are miscible in the liquid state. This structural change experienced by the interfacial polymer chains increases the interactions of matrix and interfacial chains, however, the dynamics of interfacial chains are still extremely slow compared to matrix chains around the glass transition temperature of the interfacial polymer. As a result of this difference in dynamical behavior, interfacial chains act as immobile obstacles to matrix polymer chains and slow down the dynamics of the matrix chains, which leads to the whole nanocomposite system assuming the properties of the interfacial polymer (see Figure 1, PNC curve). Most importantly, computer simulations also revealed a direct relationship between interfacial polymer structure (as defined by the average distance interfacial chains extend from the surface of the nanoparticle, see Figure 3) and overall nanocomposite property (thermal stiffening). Similar results regarding structure and properties were observed for an asymmetric blend system (Figure 4) in computer simulations.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong>Four graduate students (two at the doctoral level and two at the master level) were educated on this project. In addition, 12 female and 9 male undergraduate students were involved in the research project. Four of these undergraduate students are currently pursuing graduate degrees, 12 of them are working at various industrial organizations, and five of them are still students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The research outcomes obtained through this project were published in scientific journals and were presented at national scientific conferences. A workshop titled &ldquo;Nanoscience Educator Workshop&rdquo; for middle and high school teachers was developed and offered twice (Stevens Institute of Technology 2016, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 2017) reaching out to ~30 teachers. Approximately 160 underprivileged high school students from the Capital District (Albany, Troy, Schenectady) attended SEMI High Tech U Summer Camp at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute during the summer of 2015&ndash;18. A 1-day workshop on materials and materials characterization via scanning electron microscopy was offered to a mostly African-American Albany High School student group at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on March 27, 2018.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/23/2018<br>      Modified by: Rahmi&nbsp;Ozisik</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538730/1538730_10392253_1543017633578_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538730/1538730_10392253_1543017633578_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538730/1538730_10392253_1543017633578_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Storage modulus as a function of average brush height as measured from the surface of the nanoparticle.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rahmi Ozisik, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rahmi&nbsp;Ozisik</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538730/1538730_10392253_1543017571411_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538730/1538730_10392253_1543017571411_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538730/1538730_10392253_1543017571411_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(a) Elastic modulus of poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, poly(ethylene oxide), PEO, and PMMA/PEO/SiO2 nanocomposite containing 20% SiO2 (by weight) versus temperature (5??C/min heating rate).
