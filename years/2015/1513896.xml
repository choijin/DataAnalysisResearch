<AbstractNarration>Soldering is widely used in electronics manufacturing. Traditionally, tin/lead (Sn/Pb) solders are most widely used. Recently, due to the toxicity and health concerns of lead, Sn/Pb solders are being phased out and Pb-free solders are more widely used. However, most Pb-free solders have a higher melting temperature than Sn/Pb solders and thus impose thermal stress and reliability issues for the printed circuit boards (PCBs) and electronic devices. Nanosolders have the potential to replace or improve the existing micron-sized Pb-free solder powders and to meet the increasing demand in the electronics sector. Furthermore, with the electronics industry's focus on further miniaturization and push to 'nanoelectronics', nanosolders are expected to play a key role in assembling nano-components into nanoelectronics and nanosystems. The successful adoption of nanosolder materials will initiate a new epoch in micro/nano-electronics manufacturing. The smaller sized solder bumps will also promote the revolution of industrial soldering and electronics assembling methods. The lead-free formulation will reduce the usage of toxic material and provide a sustainable approach for future electronics manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this I-Corps proposal is to investigate the commercialization feasibility of lead-free nanosolder paste, which has great potential as a new soldering material for micro/nano-electronics assembly and packaging applications. Specific aims include the development of a technology transfer plan, determination of industrial target and market value of lead-free nanosolder materials, and completion of a detailed commercialization plan for the potential application of lead-free nanosolder materials and nano-soldering technique. Recently, the lead-free nanosolder formulated paste has been developed as the direct replacement of the typical microsolder paste. This innovation is able to satisfy the current solder paste printing technology which has been widely adopted by the electronics manufacturing industry. The mechanical property studies showed that the nanosolder composed solders resulted in enhanced strength&lt;br/&gt;when compared to the currently commercial formulated solder paste. For the next generation nanoelectronics, multiple nanocomponents, such as nanowire, nanotube and graphene, can be effectively jointed by applying nanoscale solder materials to form a functional device.</AbstractNarration>
