<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Arián Avalos is "Genomic analyses of aggression in the honey bee." The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Gene E. Robinson.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Honey bees play a crucial role in agriculture and ecosystems in general and their substantial loss in recent years is of enormous concern in the U.S. and worldwide.  Honey bees also offer a unique system for describing and understanding the genetic architecture of complex behavioral traits such as aggression.   It is widely thought that variation in complex behavioral traits is influenced by the effects of many genes, so identifying specific targets has proven to be difficult. This study addresses this challenge by taking advantage of qualities inherent to honey bee (Apis mellifera sp.) populations and identifies the genetic basis for aggressive behavior using whole genome association methods.  Colonies of honey bees exist in populations with distinct levels of aggression; European derived populations (EHB) have low levels of aggression and Africanized populations (AHB) have high levels of aggression.  Recently a population of gentle Africanized bees (gAHB) was discovered in Puerto Rico. These hybrid bees have low levels of aggression while retaining all other Africanized traits and are being used to identify and describe novel gene and gene networks involved in the regulation and expression of aggressive behavior.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The fellowship provides training in population genomics and neuroethology; further training goals include developing skills in whole genome association and novel gene-specific analyses methods.  The Fellow serves as a role model to other individuals from under-represented groups by participating in minority-oriented conferences and organizing symposia that highlight the contributions to biology from under-represented groups.  As a form of personal outreach the Fellow is establishing working relationships with existing University-sponsored programs such as Upward Bound to assure participation of high-school minority students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying aggressive behavior is important to a wide variety of fields.  Through the support of an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology, Dr. Ari&aacute;n Avalos completed a project titled "Genomic analyses of aggression in the honey bee" which aimed to address challenges in the study of aggression as a complex genetic trait.  To achieve project objectives, Dr. Avalos utilized whole genome sequencing methods to examine a recently discovered gentle Africanized honey bee (gAHB) population that has uniquely evolved in the island of Puerto Rico within a few generations.  This research provided key insights into the evolution of complex behavioral traits and identified distinct genomic regions likely associated with aggressive behavior in honey bees.  The primary finding of this study was that the rapid change in behavior experienced by gAHB coincided with soft selective sweeps across many genomic loci.  This process was often accompanied by the emergence and increase in frequency of novel haplotypes, few of which ever reached fixation.  A few of these haplotypes also contained regions of copy number variation implicating structural variation in some cases.  Ultimately, findings show that a high degree of genetic variation was maintained, a characteristic that may be adaptive in honey bee populations.  Further, many of the genomic regions identified by this project have also been implicated in the expression of aggression in other studies.  Results from this study provide important insights into the evolution of complex behavioral traits.  In addition, regions identified by Dr. Avalos are a valuable resource for both functional assessment of aggression, and as a practical tool in honey bee conservation efforts and commercial honey bee breeding.  Conclusions from this study have been disseminated to the broader scientific community via scientific talks at national and international entomology conferences, and to the public through a variety of outreach efforts.  Findings will also be detailed in at least one major project publication currently under consideration at Nature Communications.  This project also provided training opportunities to underrepresented minorities in science through one-on-one interactions and broader collaborations with graduate students at the University of Puerto Rico.
