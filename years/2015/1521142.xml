<AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support to support students participation in the International Nanotechnology Conference on Communication and Cooperation (INC) to be held at the Hilton Fukuoka Sea Hawk in Fukuoka-city, Fukuoka, Japan, on May 11-13, 2015. The event will address research areas in nanotechnology, nano-optics and nanoelectronics. Academics and industry leaders will be able to interact on the latest issues in nanotechnology and the links with related areas, such as biotechnology, advanced materials development, microsystems and photonics will be explored. The conference's broader impact will be on applications and products in the areas of  computers, communication and consumer industries. The conference will contribute in overcoming fundamental limits of nanotechnology and will promote international collaboration in nanotechnologies between Europe, Japan and the United States.</AbstractNarration>
