<AbstractNarration>Many engineered landfills that accept municipal solid waste are classified as "dry tomb landfills" because waste degrades very slowly due to low moisture conditions.  As an alternative, bioreactor landfills have emerged to counter those conditions.  In bioreactor landfills, leachate recirculation systems increase moisture and accelerate degradation.  The performance of bioreactor landfills results from coupled hydro-bio-mechanical processes; however, industry lacks a comprehensive, holistic mathematical model that considers and effectively analyzes these coupled processes in landfills. This project will develop a new coupled mathematical tool to enable the design and operation of stable, effective and sustainable engineered landfills, thereby minimizing long-term risks to the surrounding environment and public.  The tool will enable practitioners and regulators to predict the highly complex landfill stabilization period, and allow for the planning of beneficial reuse of landfill space, such as recreational facilities, by accurately accounting for a differential settlement and stabilization period.  With controlled, predictable, rapid municipal solid waste decomposition and a reduced stabilization period: (a) non-degradable municipal solid waste may be mined and processed, reducing the amount of landfill mass encapsulated within a landfill; (b) post-closure monitoring can be shortened and associated expenditures considerably reduced; and (c) concerns about the long-term performance of geosynthetic liners and related environmental risks can be addressed.  This research involves multiple disciplines, including geoenvironmental engineering, sustainable engineering, biology, and computational mechanics. The multi-disciplinary research will provide a unique opportunity to underrepresented groups to participate in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed modeling tool will combine and simultaneously solve a two-phase flow model, a large-strain explicit mechanical model, and a first-order decay biodegradation model.  The model will account for concurrent changes in waste properties to predict coupled processes in landfills. Specifically, the project scope will include: (a) development of a new mathematical model that can account for heterogeneous waste, two-phase flow, and coupled hydro-bio-mechanical processes, and effectively predict spatial and temporal behavior of landfills, (b) model validation with laboratory and field studies to attain a confidence level in the accuracy of the modeling results, (c) prediction of spatial and temporal landfill settlement, slope stability and shear response of liner systems due to coupled processes, (d) assessment of the major system variables that control the performance of landfills based on probabilistic analysis, and (e) application of the tool for forensic investigation of past landfill failures.  The project will provide a tool for designing stable and effective engineered landfills and optimizing existing landfills using coupled hydro-bio-mechanical processes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Many engineered landfills that accept municipal solid waste (MSW) are regarded as "dry tomb landfills" due to the low moisture conditions of the waste because of which the waste degradation occurs slowly. An alternative to the conventional landfill is a bioreactor landfill. In bioreactor landfills (also known as leachate recirculation landfills), the collected leachate (a chemical liquid derived from waste degradation) and other permitted liquids are recirculated into the landfills via leachate recirculation systems to enhance the moisture conditions and thereby accelerate waste degradation. This offers numerous benefits including enhanced biogas for energy production, and early waste stabilization among many others. However, the effective and safe design, construction, and operation of the bioreactor landfills is not well understood. This is mainly due to the lack of knowledge on the different system processes (e.g., hydraulic, mechanical, bio-chemical, thermal) and their coupled interactions within the waste mass that ultimately influences the holistic performance of a bioreactor landfill such as slope stability, settlement, and integrity of liner and cover systems (which form the vital components of a landfill). The waste management industry currently lacks a comprehensive, holistic mathematical model that simultaneously considers all the different processes and their coupled interactions for evaluating the coupled behavior of waste and consequently its influence on the performance of the bioreactor landfills. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a practical and reliable coupled thermo-hydro-bio-mechanical model that can enable safe design and operation of stable, effective and sustainable engineered landfills, thereby minimizing immediate as well as long-term risks to the environment and public health.</p> <p>A coupled thermo-hydro-bio-mechanical (CTHBM) numerical model is developed that integrates and simultaneously solves a hydraulic model, a plane-strain elasto-plastic mechanical model, a biodegradation model, and a heat conduction model with temperature dependent heat generation function to simulate the long-term fluid flow through unsaturated porous waste media, mechanical stresses/strains and strength of the waste, biodegradation of MSW, and temperature distributions, within the bioreactor landfill. The biodegradation model has been enhanced to simulate a realistic biochemical behavior/kinetics. Moreover, the heat generation function required for simulating the spatial and temporal temperature distributions is formulated based on the biochemical model. A more rigorous constitutive model that incorporates major waste settlement mechanisms is formulated and incorporated into the numerical framework.</p> <p>The numerical model is successfully validated with lab-scale experimental studies and large-scale pilot tests to predict the long-term spatial and temporal variation of some of the important design parameters such as moisture distribution, waste settlement, gas generation, among others. The prediction of spatial and temporal distribution of temperatures in the MSW landfill by the numerical model is validated with published field-monitoring data. In addition, the influence of coupled processes and the subsequent changes in the waste properties with degradation on the long-term interface shear behavior of the geosynthetic components in a typical composite liner system in MSW landfill is examined for conventional and bioreactor landfill conditions. The effect of unsaturated hydraulic properties of waste on the moisture distribution, and settlement of waste is assessed. The effect of waste temperatures on the settlement of waste is also examined. The numerical model could be used to reasonably predict the waste stabilization period of a landfill, which will aid design practitioners in efficient planning the post-closure care of a bioreactor landfill.</p> <p>Upon validation of the numerical model and its application to full-scale typical bioreactor landfill model for the baseline holistic performance assessment, a parametric study is performed to understand the influence of major system variables such as landfill geometry, leachate injection rates, and mode of leachate injection on the holistic performance aspects (e.g. moisture distribution, pore fluid pressures, waste stabilization periods, slope stability, interface shear response in liner system) for the bioreactor landfill conditions. Further, a probabilistic analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of spatial variability (waste heterogeneity and anisotropy) in waste properties on the reliability of the model predictions based on different performance metrics/criteria using the Monte-Carlo simulations technique.</p> <p>The results from the numerical analyses performed and their implications in practice have been summarized and disseminated as technical articles in peer-reviewed journals, book chapters, and conference proceedings. Technical presentations at national and international conferences and workshops have been made to promulgate the research results to relevant academic and professional community, and to the general public. Field visits to nearby landfills were organized to discuss the research progress with field engineers and obtain their feedback on the practical issues to address in the research project. Periodic seminars were held with academic researchers and practitioners to apprise the modeling approach and the results. This project also allowed for research collaboration and interaction with two researchers and a student from a primarily undergraduate institution. Two doctoral and one master students have had the opportunity to gain research experience through this project in the emerging field of geoenvironmental engineering.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/01/2019<br>      Modified by: Krishna&nbsp;R&nbsp;Reddy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944213972_01-CTHBM_Conceptual_Framework--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944213972_01-CTHBM_Conceptual_Framework--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Coupled Modeling Framework"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944213972_01-CTHBM_Conceptual_Framework--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Coupled Modeling Framework"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Coupled Thermo-Hydro-Bio-Mechanical Modeling Framework</div> <div class="imageCredit">Krishna R Reddy</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Krishna&nbsp;R&nbsp;Reddy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Coupled Modeling Framework</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944341379_02-Surface_Settlement--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944341379_02-Surface_Settlement--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Settlement Response"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944341379_02-Surface_Settlement--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Settlement Response"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Comparison of Surface Settlement in Conventional and Bioreactor Landfill</div> <div class="imageCredit">Krishna R Reddy</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Krishna&nbsp;R&nbsp;Reddy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Settlement Response</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944483323_03-Moisture_Distribution--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944483323_03-Moisture_Distribution--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Moisture Distribution"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944483323_03-Moisture_Distribution--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Moisture Distribution"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Predicted Moisture Distribution at Different Times During Leachate Injection in Bioreactor Landfill</div> <div class="imageCredit">Krishna R Reddy</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Krishna&nbsp;R&nbsp;Reddy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Moisture Distribution</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944605820_04-Temperature_Distribution--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944605820_04-Temperature_Distribution--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Temperature Response"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944605820_04-Temperature_Distribution--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Temperature Response"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Predicted Temperature Distribution at Different Times in a Conventional Landfill</div> <div class="imageCredit">Krishna R Reddy</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Krishna&nbsp;R&nbsp;Reddy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Temperature Response</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944719443_05-Settlement_Distribution--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944719443_05-Settlement_Distribution--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Settlement of Waste"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1537514/1537514_10393523_1569944719443_05-Settlement_Distribution--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Settlement of Waste"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Predicted Settlement of Waste at Different Times During Leachate Injection in Bioreactor Landfill</div> <div class="imageCredit">Krishna R Reddy</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Krishna&nbsp;R&nbsp;Reddy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Settlement of Waste</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
