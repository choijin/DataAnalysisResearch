<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Petr Horava, Mina Aganagic, Raphael Bousso and Yasunori Nomura at Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics, University of California, Berkeley.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first decade of the 21st century, we witnessed a remarkable convergence of the fundamental questions about the origin, structure and the future fate of our Universe.  Now, in the middle of the second decade, we experience the exciting confrontation of the fundamental theoretical questions (what is the Universe made of?  what are matter, energy, space and time?, etc.) with the experimental data which are now becoming available in experimental particle physics, observational cosmology and astrophysics.  These experimental findings are in turn challenging the remarkable developments on the theoretical front. The co-PIs of this award will perform fundamental theoretical research at these crossroads of particle physics, quantum gravity, cosmology and string theory, confronting the experimental challenges from beyond the Standard Model, the ideas of the multiverse, the interface of string theory and condensed-matter physics, the nature of space and time, and the mathematical implications of topological strings.  Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical law.   The significant broader impacts of this research include the training of students and postdocs who become the next generation of scientists in the nation and the world.  The fundamental questions addressed in this research are of deep interest to the general public, and the co-PIs will continue promoting the importance and excitement of fundamental science to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, Mina Aganagic will focus on the interplay of string theory and gauge theories with pure mathematics.  She will study the refined topological string, the refined Chern-Simons theory and M-theory.  Raphael Bousso will work on extracting predictions from the multiverse, and the interconnections of geometry, holography and information, as recently crystallized in the black-hole "firewall" conundrum. He will further study the string landscape and the holographic entropy bounds.  Petr Horava will study quantum gravity, especially in the context known as "Horava-Lifshitz gravity" and its broad applications, including the puzzles of naturalness in particle phenomenology and cosmology, and implications to condensed-matter physics.  He will apply methods of nonequilibrium field theory to quantum gravity and strings.  Yasunori Nomura will work on ideas relevant to the recent and upcoming experiments, such as the LHC, with emphasis on supersymmetry breaking and its mediation, the origin and nature of dark matter, and the conceptual understanding of the implications of the multiverse for the TeV-scale physics.  All four co-PIs will seek unexpected new opportunities for transformative interdisciplinary research in all areas related to theoretical particle physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under theis funding, the four PIs of this award: Mina Aganagic, Raphael Bousso, Petr Horava and Yasunori Nomura (and their postdocs, graduate and graduate students) studied some of the most fundamental questions of modern theoretical physics, with a scope ranging from the microscopic scales of theoretical high-energy physics and particle phenomenology Beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles, with focus on dark sectors and the notoriously difficult puzzles of the hierarchies of scales in nature, to cosmology in the multiverse landscape, the paradoxes of quantum properties of black holes, the ongoing fusion of quantum information science and quantum gravity and related foundational questions of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics in the era of the multiverse, to the physical and mathematical aspects of supersymmetric field theory, string theory and quantum gravity.  In the process, they found new and often surprising insights into these questions, which keeps stimulating new research and even influences seemingly unrelated areas of physics and mathematics (such as condensed matter or quantum geometry).  The research activities of Mina Aganagic focused on the mysterious and remarkable six-dimensional quantum field theory whose existence is predicted by string theory, and which is sometimes referred to as ``Theory X.'' The theory is remarkable in part because it provides striking insights into quantum field theories in lower dimensions. Another reason theory X is remarkable is that it suggests close relations between actively studied areas of modern mathematics. MA  proposed to change the focus from theory X itself, which is a point particle theory, to a six-dimensional string theory which contains it. The six-dimensional string theory is called "little string theory" s As the little string theory is a string theory, there are many powerful techniques to study it that are otherwise unavailable for theories of particles.  MA found out that the little string theory gives not one, but two  solutions of the problem, related by a duality.    Raphael Bousso's research covered a broad area at the interface of semiclassical quantum gravity, high-energy theory, and quantum information, with the central theme of his research often being holography and its various entropy bounds.  He studied the classical Penrose inequality, which specifies a lower bound on the total mass in terms of the area of certain trapped surfaces in spacetime. This fails at the semiclassical level. RB conjectured a quantum Penrose inequality: the mass at spatial infinity is lower-bounded by a function of the generalized entropy of the ``lightsheet'' of any quantum marginally trapped surface. This is the first relation between quantum information in quantum gravity, and total energy!   On a more personal note, RB contributed to the celebratory volume on the life of Jacob Bekenstein, the founding father of the theory of black hole entropy.    Petr Horava worked on nonrelativistic solutions to puzzles of technical Naturalness.  Based on his high-impact results in nonrelativistic quantum gravity theory (known in the literature as ``Horava-Lifshitz gravity''), PH extended the relevance of nonrelativistic systems to also include degrees of freedom of the Standard Model.  The question of why is the mass of the Higgs boson so much smaller than the Planck scale? is put in a new, and rather suprising, perspective.  He also proposed a new, nonrelativistic way of providing short-distance completions of supersymmetric field theories in diverse dimensions.    PH constructed a novel topological quantum gravity theory, which connects three distinct research directions:  Nonrelativistic quantum gravity, topological quantum field theories, and the mathematical theory of the Ricci flows on Riemannian manifolds.  He  made significant progress in an important new research direction -- string theory out of equilibrium.    Yasunori Nomura's research focused primarily on the interface of quantum gravity, information theory, and holography.  YN advanced the understanding of the long-standing black hole information problem. He introduced the idea that the thermality of black holes results from generic entanglement between ``hard'' and ``soft'' modes near the horizon region. This entanglement arises from chaotic string-scale dynamics at the stretched horizon, and is forced by an energy constraint of a total black hole state. For a realistic evaporating black hole, the entanglement has a tripartite  structure that the hard modes are purified by a combined system of the soft modes and early Hawking radiation.   During this Award, all four PIs continued their strong outreach efforts and gave invited talks and lectures at various conferences and schools, and appeared as panelists at various public events discussing aspects of modern theoretical science for our undestanding of the Universe and our place in it.  This group has continued to foster fundamental research with special emphasis on the educational and career growth opportunities of the junior researchers. It has been exceptionally successful in developing future talent, with a remarkable number of junior faculty across the US (and world-wide) having been in a junior position with our group in the earlier stages of their careers.
