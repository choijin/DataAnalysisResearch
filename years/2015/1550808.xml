<AbstractNarration>Funds will support a new conference entitled "Workshop on Plant Development and Drought Stress" to be held from November 1 to November 4, 2015 at Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove, CA.  The purpose of this meeting is to bring together plant developmental biologists and plant stress biologists in order to generate a better understanding of how plant growth and development are altered by drought and related environmental stresses.  Related stresses include heat or the high concentrations of salt that can affect irrigated fields.  Plant stress biologists strive to understand cellular responses to harsh environments: for instance what protective metabolites the cell makes in response to drought and the nature of the machinery the cell uses to sense a harsh environment.  Plant development is the study of how plants grow: for instance how plants make new body parts, such as leaves and stem, from groups of stem cells at the tips of branches, how cells of different types become organized in roots, stems and leaves and how plants control their size. The proposed workshop brings both groups of scientists together for three days.  It is expected the synergy resulting from interactions between the two groups of scientists will lead to advances in understanding how plants alter their growth and development in response to a lack of water.  This in turn is expected to lead to improved strategies for breeding drought tolerant plants. Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students will be chosen from submitted abstracts for travel scholarships, with priority given to individuals from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last two decades, both fields on their own - developmental biology and stress biology - have reached high levels of sophistication with detailed knowledge of core mechanisms.  Much is now known of the regulatory networks controlling development and likewise the regulatory networks controlling stress responses.  The fields are therefore ripe for exploring known development and stress networks for overlap and interaction.  Invited speakers who are recognized leaders in their fields will present talks.  Speakers will also be chosen based on the excellence and relevance of their submitted abstracts.  Junior investigators (graduate students, postdocs and assistant professors) will be encouraged to apply for speaking slots.  Efforts will be made to include speakers and attendees from groups underrepresented in the sciences.  To assure an informal atmosphere that allows for ample give and take between scientists the workshop will be limited to 100 attendees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From November 1 to November 4, 2015, the Workshop on Plant Development and Drought Stress was held at Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove, CA.   The conference brought together plant developmental biologists - scientists who study how plants grow - with plant stress biologists - scientists who study plant responses to harsh environmental conditions. Currently developmental biologists and stress biologists largely attend different meetings.  Bringing them together generated synergy: Together these scientists discussed their latest research findings and devised new ways to tackle the problem of understanding how plants alter their growth in response to water limitation. This information is expected to lead to improvements in breeding drought stress tolerant plants.   This workshop falls within a new discipline, perhaps best called ecological developmental biology, that is emerging at the intersection of stress and developmental biology. This new discipline is the study of mechanisms through which organisms control growth and development in the context of varying environments, many of them suboptimal or stressful to the plant. Studies in this discipline will reveal the long sought after rules through which the interaction of genes and environments become manifest as phenotypes.  As a consequence, we will have a broader knowledge of the birth and survival of life forms in their natural environments.  The conference was fully subscribed: 109 scientists attended the conference.  Scientists came from the US and from abroad, from academia and from industry. All levels of experience were represented from graduate students through senior investigators. This was the first conference on this topic.  Satisfaction with the meeting was high as judged by a survey of participants.        Last Modified: 03/23/2017       Submitted by: M. Kathryn Barton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
