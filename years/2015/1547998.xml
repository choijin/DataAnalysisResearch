<AbstractNarration>Radiopharmaceutical therapy is a type of cancer therapy that delivers short-range radiation specifically to a tumor or to tumor cells distributed in the body as metastases without delivering too much radiation to normal tissue.  This type of treatment is an alternative to chemotherapy and it has worked well in patients with lymphoma and was recently FDA approved for patients with late-stage, metastatic prostate cancer.  By imaging the radiation emitted by the radiopharmaceutical, it is possible to measure how much radiation goes to tumors and to normal tissue.  This information can be used to adjust the dose given so that the patients are not under (not enough tumor radiation to kill the tumor) or overdosed (too much radiation to normal tissue that leads to side effects).  Such an individualized dosing approach requires that a test dose be administered first and that patient images of the radiopharmaceutical in the body be collected and then used to calculate the radiation dose to the tumor and to different organs.  The radiation dose information for the test dose can then be used to administer a larger therapy dose so that the best possible treatment is given to each patient. This "treatment planning" process requires sophisticated data analysis that the proposed team has developed over many years.  This type of analysis is not easily available and radiopharmaceutical treatment has often been given without the individualized dosing described above.  This team hopes to establish a commercial service that will provide the analysis required to deliver radiopharmaceutical therapy to patients without over- or under-dosing them.  The proposed Radiopharmaceutical Imaging and Dosimetry (RAPID) service will ultimately benefit cancer patients by making available a treatment that targets metastatic cancer and that in many cases is more effective and has fewer side effects than chemotherapy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team proposes to commercialize a start-up (RadioPharmaceutical Imaging and Dosimetry - RAPID) for expert quantitative imaging/dosimetry services towards radiopharmaceutical therapy development/commercialization.  Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) is an emerging cancer treatment that delivers radiation directly to tumors. Clinicaltrials.gov lists &gt; 100 trials investigating this modality; &gt; 20 pharmaceutical companies are working in RPT, including Roche/Genentech, and Bayer/Algeta.  The recent FDA approval of 223Ra (Xofigotm) for resistant prostate cancer highlights the potential of RPT.  FDA approval of RPT requires tumor and organ dose estimates. European regulations mandate personalized dosimetry. There are no commercial resources to provide these calculations. Pharmaceutical companies have contracted the Sgouros (Radiopharmaceutical-Dosimetry) lab (RDL) for dosimetry of RPT agents under development.  RDL has also been contacted by numerous institutions running trials of such agents.  The Frey lab has licensed quantitative imaging software to GE.  There is future potential for combining RPT therapy with external beam radiation therapy or other RPT agents, and the RDL has developed technology for rationally combining these modalities. This team has formulated specific hypotheses regarding likely clients and the value proposition for RAPID and propose to test them via the I-Corps program.  Specifically, members of the team will travel to company sites and conduct face to face interviews with previously identified potential clients to ask them questions that will allow us to test the assumptions that we have made regarding value proposition and potential client base.  Potential clients will be interviewed based on personal contacts of the team members that have been acquired over many years of doing radiopharmaceutical therapy imaging and dosimetry research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding was received to allow the founders of a startup to participate in the Innovations-Corps (I-Corps) program which is intended to help university professors learn how to succeed in the business world when they endeavor to launch a startup.  We travelled to multiple sites interviewed potential customers and have started a succesfful company that has licensed intellectual property from Hopkins and have already brought revenue $300k in revenue in 2017.  We have also obtained several SBIR grant awards.  This has allowed us to expand our service operation, develop internal tools that streamline our processes so that we can increase throughput.  We currently have 15 active contracts and another 10 pending.  Two of the Hopkins faculty founders have taken on part time positions in the company and reduced their Hopkins committment.  We have another 4 technical and supprt level staff at various levels of part to full-time commitment.  In 2018 we plan on adding to current staffing and have already placed an ad on the American Association of Medial Physicists web site.  We have also received a competitive project-oriented loan from the Maryland Technology innovation initiative.  To summarize, NSF support of the founder's participation in the Innovations Corps program and the contacts we have made through this as well as the knowledge gained by participating has helped us take technology that would have languished in academia and made it available on a commercial basis to help better treat cancer patients undergiong radiopharmaceutical therapy by providing a service that provides quantitative imaging and dosimetry analysis of patient data in order to bring a precision medicine approach to radiopharmaceutical patient therapy of cancer       Last Modified: 01/31/2018       Submitted by: George Sgouros]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
