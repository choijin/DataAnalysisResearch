<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Naomi Feldheim is "Applications of harmonic analysis to Gaussian stationary processes." The host institution for the fellowship is Stanford University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Amir Dembo.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> Under this NSF postdoctoral fellowship, the PI investigated the long-term behavior of Gaussian stationary processes, which are a classical model of "stable noise" used in probability and applications. Together with my collaborators, we developed and applied analytic tools in order to study these random objects. Three papers were written during the fellowship's period, all of which were published or in advanced stages of revision in top journals. Those are:</p> <ul> <li>"Persistence of Gaussian stationary processes: a spectral perspective", by N. Feldheim, O. Feldheim and S. Nitzan&nbsp; (in revision)</li> <li>"Exponential concentration for zeroes of stationary Gaussian processes" by R. Basu, A. Dembo, N. Feldheim and O. Zeitouni, &nbsp;IMRN (rny277)</li> <li>" On the Probability That a Stationary Gaussian Process With Spectral Gap Remains Non-negative on a Long Interval", by N. Feldheim, O. Feldheim, B. Jaye, F.
