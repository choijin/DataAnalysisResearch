<AbstractNarration>Boreal forests cover 40% of the vegetated land area above the Arctic Circle and are a critical component of arctic ecosystems. Global change models predict boreal forests will become increasingly susceptible to fire activity with climate warming. Because these forests contain a large proportion of global terrestrial carbon (C) stocks, changes in the fire regime are likely to alter global C cycling. Increased fire activity will increase C emissions to the atmosphere, with a potential positive feedback to climate warming. However, an altered fire regime may also initiate cascading effects on forest regrowth and permafrost degradation that could magnify or offset this feedback. Fire effects on these ecological mechanisms remain uncertain but will ultimately determine whether arctic ecosystems act as a C source or sink under future climate change scenarios. The primary objective of this research is to increase our understanding of post-fire C dynamics in boreal forests of the Siberian arctic by elucidating the ecological mechanisms by which increased fire severity could influence C accumulation and storage over the successional interval. The overarching hypothesis is that post-fire soil organic layer (SOL) depth regulates net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) through indirect impacts on forest regrowth and permafrost stability because of its role as a barrier to seed germination and thermal regulator. The team will: 1) link near term fire effects on SOL depth to changes in larch recruitment and permafrost characteristics in experimental burn plots created in 2012, 2) determine the relationship between post-fire stand structure and above- and belowground C pools at the local and landscape level across stands of varying age and topographic positions, and 3) test via experimental manipulations and field observations the mechanisms by which fire-driven changes in stand density indirectly affect moss growth, SOL development, and susceptibility of deeper C pools to warming, decomposition, and release into the atmosphere. This research will offer novel insights into the importance of both vegetation and soil processes within arctic ecosystems in determining the net feedback of an intensified fire regime to the climate system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Larch forests of the Siberian arctic comprise 20% of all boreal forest ecosystems and are distinct from other boreal forests in that they consist of a single tree genus (Larix spp.) with a deciduous growth habit and often grow on continuous, C-rich ?yedoma? permafrost. Thus, their response to warming climate and an altered fire regime is likely to differ from boreal forests in other regions. Uncertainties regarding current C pools in Siberian boreal forests remain a significant factor affecting our ability to predict climate-induced changes to the global C cycle. The proposed study will contribute to our understanding of how arctic forest fires impact global C cycling and provide essential data necessary for scaling-up arctic C pools, estimating C emissions from arctic fires, and calibrating predictive models of future global C cycling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will result in the training of undergraduate and graduate students from two predominantly undergraduate institutions and one Hispanic-Serving Institution. The PI and her students will develop outreach activities with local K-12 schools in south Texas to help teachers create lesson plans involving arctic science, boreal ecology, and climate change and involve researcher presentations to science classrooms to provide real-life examples of arctic research and expose K-12 students to different career and educational paths in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Boreal forests cover 40% of the vegetated land area above the Arctic Circle and are a critical component of the Arctic System. These forests provide freshwater, organic matter, and nutrient inputs to major rivers emptying into the Arctic Ocean, sustain local atmospheric circulation patterns, and influence regional climate through effects on albedo. With climate warming, boreal forests are predicted to expand northward into tundra and may well become the dominant arctic vegetation; thus, current-day boreal forests provide an analog for the future conditions of the Arctic. Because wildfire is the major factor structuring population, community, and ecosystem dynamics within boreal forests, understanding the role of fire in these systems will be critical for predicting the fate of the Arctic under a changing climate.   As climate warms in continental boreal regions of Alaska, Canada and Russia, wildfires are becoming larger and more frequent, intense, and severe.  A unique characteristic of boreal ecosystems is that most of the burning comes from combustion of the ground layer and soil organic matter.  Disturbance to the ground layer impacts carbon stored in soil, soil temperature and permafrost stability, and tree seedling regeneration, all crucial controls over ecosystem carbon dynamics. We used an experimental manipulation of fire severity and a naturally occurring gradient of tree density to better understand how increasing fire severity could affect the carbon dynamics of these forests.  Our experimental manipulation of fire severity showed that deeper burning of the soil organic layer resulted in reduced soil carbon pools, warmer and more deeply thawed soils, and a higher density of regenerating larch tree seedlings.  To understand the longer-term consequences of these combined effects, we studied a gradient of forest stands that originated in a 1957 fire and varied primarily in stand density.  After ~60 years of forest regeneration, low density stands stored less carbon in tree biomass than high density stands, but all stands stored similar amounts of carbon in the soil organic layer, the largest surface carbon pool.  Soils in low density stands were three times more deeply thawed than soils in high density stands due to the shading effects of the forest canopy.  If permafrost thawed deeply after fire in these stands (as we saw in our experiment), the recovery of the permafrost table in the high density stands may have stabilized permafrost carbon pools, protecting them from decomposition and even increasing pools with newly frozen carbon inputs.  Thus, increasing larch density in stands that burn at high severity may be a source of resilience for carbon dynamics in these forests, process that returns the ecosystem to pre-disturbance state.
