<AbstractNarration>It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this award is to measure the quark structure of light particles called mesons.  The proposed research will support the research infrastructure by commissioning new equipment to produce linearly a beam of high-energy photons from scattered electrons produced by the accelerator at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab).  The research will also include computer simulations of the particle detector in Hall D at Jefferson Lab.  Participation of students in the research effort is a central component of this program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental program proposed here embodies one of Jefferson Lab's priorities: to elucidate the underlying structure of protons, neutrons, and mesons. The particles of interest here are called hybrid mesons, which are identified as having quantum numbers not allowed in the constituent quark model, due to extra degrees of freedom provided by gluons, which are the force-carriers of the strong force.  The discovery of hybrid mesons would be a triumph of modern theoretical models based on the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This award will also provide support for personnel to commission the linearly polarized photon beam and the electron tagger as part of the GlueX experiment In Hall D of Jefferson Lab.</AbstractNarration>

UConn graduate student Brendan Pratt was responsible for making the diamond radiators (see figure 2) which need to be very thin to avoid blowing up the electron beam as it passes through. They also need to be stiff enough to be self-supporting, and to shed the heat that builds up from the beam passing through them. Brendan achieved this by starting with a thick diamond block and milling out a thin membrane from the middle, which he was able to reduce to just 20 microns thickness while still maintaining the necessary flatness required to satisfy the precise beam-crystal alignment conditions for coherent bremsstrahlung. Ensuring that these conditions were met required that X-ray diffraction measurements be made on each crystal radiator after milling, which were carried out by the UConn group at the Canadian Light Source in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Figure 3 shows the diffraction results as a false-color image known as a rocking-curve topograph, in which extreme colors indicate regions of high stress.

During the period 2016-2018, the detector has been upgraded in two stages, the first in early 2017 and the second in early 2019, with the purpose of improving the tagger time resolution by increasing the light scintillation light yield.
