<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;The REU site in the School of Physics at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) enrolls undergraduate students in an immersive summer research experience that provides participants with insights into physics research and encouragement to embark on graduate study. In keeping with the nation's interests in creating a highly-trained, diverse workforce in the STEM disciplines, a partnership between Georgia Tech and the institutions in the Atlanta University Center (AUC) provides an opportunity to recruit and train a diverse group of participants from across the nation. Other components of the site include team-building activities, regular group meetings, a research seminar series, a workshop series (e.g., ethics, presentation skills, graduate opportunities), undergraduate research symposia, and field trips to industrial and/or government laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates will participate in an array of projects in physics, ranging from atomic, molecular and optical physics to condensed matter physics; from biophysics to astrophysics; and from condensed matter to computational physics. The program seeks to enhance interactions between Georgia Tech and the AUC and thereby enhance the capacity for research at predominantly undergraduate minority-serving institutions. Undergraduate summer projects are designed to give the participants maximum flexibility in their experimental approach and to foster development of a beginning researcher into an independent investigator.</AbstractNarration>

Nearly seventy percent of the participants were under-represented minorities (~50% Black, ~17% Hispanic). Many students originated from less-research intensive institutions (~70%), and 29% were enrolled at historically black Colleges and Universities.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A secondary goal of this REU Site was to strengthen ties between Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) and the Atlanta University Consortium (AUC: Spelman College, Morehouse College, Clark Atlanta University). This was facilitated by an active recruitment of students from the AUC into the REU program, where on average 2.5 out 10 participants originated from the AUC. Connections between the institutions were also strengthened by the continued support of student research at GT after the REU summer (4 students continued research on average for two additional semesters). We also facilitated faculty and AUC-GT interactions through increased seminar activities led by organized faculty visits both at GT and Clark Atlanta University. Last, GT hosted one Spelman professor for a collaborative summer research project in the School of Physics.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to a strong focus on cutting-edge research for the REU students under the supervision of a supportive graduate mentor and faculty advisor, the REU Site organized a wide variety of professional and enrichment activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;These included a weekly "Lunch and Learn" physics research seminar series, as well 8-10 workshops on topics such as giving presentations, applying to graduate school, abstract writing, voice training, and the responsible conduct of research.&nbsp;&nbsp;The students also participated in laboratory safety training and when relevant, in chemical and biological safety training.&nbsp;&nbsp;Highlights of the REU program include an overnight off-site retreat with the cohort of all REU students in the College of Science at GT, as well as an overnight trip to Oakridge National Laboratory. The retreat took place at the start of the program to facilitate bonding between the students, as well as to drive their understanding of their research projects by having each of them make a short presentation outlining their summer research plans.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many program activities, including the Retreat and REU Symposium held at the end of the summer, included students from several other REU programs at the GT, with whom they were also coordinated to live with in dormitory housing. This provided students a robust social and professional environment in which to interact and build up a network and to position their research in the context of the overall environment at a major research university. The summer research culminated with the presentation of a poster and a fifteen minute talk at the REU symposium, as well as documentation of their work in a final written report.</p> <div> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on student surveys, this REU Site has been successful in encouraging students to consider post-graduate education and in particular to pursue work in a STEM field. One hundred percent of the students "agreed" or "strongly agreed" that the REU experience contributed to their motivation to work in a scientific field. After participation and completion of their undergraduate degrees, 60% of the students went on to pursue higher educational degrees in STEM, while many of the others immediately entered the STEM workforce.</p> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/14/2021<br>      Modified by: Jennifer&nbsp;Curtis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560165/1560165_10413412_1618416796755_REUSUMMER2016GROUPPIC_--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560165/1560165_10413412_1618416796755_REUSUMMER2016GROUPPIC_--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Georgia Tech Physics 2016 REU Cohort"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560165/1560165_10413412_1618416796755_REUSUMMER2016GROUPPIC_--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Georgia Tech Physics 2016 REU Cohort"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Our first REU cohort in Georgia Tech physics in 2016.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Predrag Cvitanovic</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jennifer&nbsp;Curtis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Georgia Tech Physics 2016 REU Cohort</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560165/1560165_10413412_1618416948741_OakridgeNationalLab2017--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560165/1560165_10413412_1618416948741_OakridgeNationalLab2017--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Annual Georgia Tech Physics REU visit to Oakridge National Laboratory"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560165/1560165_10413412_1618416948741_OakridgeNationalLab2017--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Annual Georgia Tech Physics REU visit to Oakridge National Laboratory"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2017 Georgia Tech Physics REU during visit to Oakridge National Lab.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Shaun Ashley</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jennifer&nbsp;Curtis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Annual Georgia Tech Physics REU visit to Oakridge National Laboratory</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560165/1560165_10413412_1618417088146_Summer2018_Photo1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560165/1560165_10413412_1618417088146_Summer2018_Photo1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Georgia Tech REU Symposium, Summer 2018"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1560165/1560165_10413412_1618417088146_Summer2018_Photo1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Georgia Tech REU Symposium, Summer 2018"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU students Sean Snowden and Aaron Bourque discuss their research at a large REU Symposium hosting 60+ REU students from the College of Science at Georgia Tech.
