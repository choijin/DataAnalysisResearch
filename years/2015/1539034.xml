<AbstractNarration>Non-technical description&lt;br/&gt;This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR* Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) project involves the Medical University of South Carolina as the lead and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Furman University, and University of South Carolina, Beaufort Campus as collaborative partners. Much of our knowledge of brain function comes from experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which directly measures blood flow to regions of the brain, but remains an indirect measure of neural activity. The precise relationship between neural events and hemodynamic response (increased blood flow) is unclear. This project will test the hypothesis that universal rules relate these two brain activities, using direct measurements in the brain and retina of mice and macaques.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The research will develop new instrumentation for in vivo imaging and cell subtype-specific stimulation in both the brain and the retina necessary for interpreting functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) measurements.  These activities will help determine the extent of neurovascular coupling and provide a description of the micro-circuitry, which represents a critical and necessary step in understanding the full complexity of the brain.  The consortium will track neural and vascular activity with micron-scale resolution, using two-photon microscopy and adaptive optics to measure the presence of synthetic dyes interacting with genetically encoded sensors.  Cell subtype-specific stimulation will be monitored using optogenetic techniques. A computational team will analyze the data obtained to tease out hemodynamic signals.  Experiments will be performed on macaques, selected because of the similarity in size and functional repertoire with the human brain.  Studies in mice, where genetic and molecular tools are more readily available, will also be performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The outcomes from our EPSCoR titled Bridging Cognitive Science and Neuroscience Using Innovating Imaging Technologies are built around three primary goals established at the outset.&nbsp; The first was to establish brain imaging technology in the states of South Carolina and Alabama that allows researchers to study cellular activity in the brains of behaving experimental animals.&nbsp; The second goal to advance our understanding of how the brain learns and adapts to the world around it, and the third goal was outreach to undergraduate institutions in South Carolina and to high school students and teachers.&nbsp;

The University of Alabama (UAB) needed to purchase and be trained by MUSC in the latest imaging technology, and then apply this technology for the first time to study brain activity in primate brains.&nbsp; All of these goals were achieved.&nbsp; MUSC substantially upgraded its laboratory equipment, hired two new faculty and mentored 6 pre or postdoctoral fellows through their laboratories in multiphoton brain imaging (see attached Image 1 showing the general technology, and how producing a small lesion affects brain cell structure).&nbsp; UAB established the technology in mice and just recently had success in applying the approach to primates (see attached Images 2 and 3 showing successful imaging in primate cortex).&nbsp; In the process they mentored 7 pre or postdoctoral fellows in their laboratory who use the technology in their research.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The scientific goals were largely achieved.&nbsp; As mentioned above, UAB has been able to apply the imaging technology to quantifying the activity of neurons and vasculature in visual cortex of primates after establishing the technology in rodents.&nbsp; At MUSC studies were conducted showing how the vasculature and its coupling to brain activity is altered by producing mini-strokes in the brain.&nbsp; More recently, through the recruitment of two new faculty, the MUSC site has applied the imaging technology to animals that are behaving in a task to get a reward or a motor task (see attached Image 4 showing motor task and resulting imaging data).&nbsp; The former uses a novel application of the technology by using lenses that can image deeper into the brain, while the latter uses the standard window approach (placing a window over the brain in place of the skull) to visualize cell plasticity in motor cortex.&nbsp;
