<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "SEAM 2015--The 31st Southeastern Analysis Meeting" that will be held March 8-9, 2015, on the campus of the University of Georgia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event is the latest in a thirty-year-long series that has hosted conferences covering a wide spectrum of subareas of mathematical analysis and that has become the leading venue in the U.S. for function-theoretic operator theory. SEAM 2015 will again span a broad swath of analysis, featuring four plenary speakers who will address topics in operator theory (Brett Wick), harmonic analysis (Ciperian Demeter), geometric combinatorics (Joshua Zahl), and harmonic analysis and number theory (Lillian Pierce). The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web page:  www.math.uga.edu/~lyall/seam2015/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SEAM 2015 was held at the University of Georgia on March 8-10 in 2015.  The Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM) is one of the leading annual conferences on analysis, has a rich history and has had a sustained run of 30 meetings held every year since 1985 at various universities in the Southeast. The research areas of the conference have focused on complex analysis, harmonic analysis, and operator theory.     The purpose of the Southeastern Analysis Meeting is to disseminate and exchange the latest ideas and developments in analysis, broadly defined. Emphasis is placed on involving junior faculty and graduate students in the meeting. The host school will provided facilities and covered local organizing expenses. NSF funding was be used to pay for the expenses of the junior speakers and for participant support. Priority was given to graduate students, post-docs, junior faculty, and members of underrepresented groups.      SEAM 2015 was a massive success. The conference consited of five invited planary speakers (three of which gave a series of two talks), two of which were women. In addition to this there were 24 contributed short talks. In total 80 individuals particpated in the conference.     The topics of the plenary lectures reflected the major current developments in the area of analysis and the intimate format of the meeting fostered collaborations between younger and more senior mathematicians.
