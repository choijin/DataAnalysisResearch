<AbstractNarration>Lueking&lt;br/&gt;155119&lt;br/&gt;Penn State&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work seeks to design a metal organic framework (MOF) that is oxygen-selective over nitrogen at near ambient temperatures. The combined studies will assess the feasibility of using a gas-selective, structural transformation as a means for separations of gases, with a specific focus on developing a material that retains oxygen selectivity at near-ambient temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oxygen, nitrogen, and air interaction with the oxygen-selective MOF will be investigated using a combination of in situ FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, as well as gas diffusivity and adsorption measurements. The spectroscopy studies will aim to understand which specific gas-substrate chemical interactions lead to an extended induction period to delay opening of the flexible framework. The diffusivity and adsorption measurements will elucidate how this is influenced by a secondary component that drastically differs in affinity to open the structure. Developing a chemical understanding of the specific gas-surface interaction that leads to rapid opening will enable the incorporation of chemical specificity into future material design.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this EAGER proposal, we explored the potential of an easily synthesized metal organic framework (MOF), RPM3-Zn to serve as a selective O2 sorbent over nitrogen from air at temperatures close to room temperature.  Results demonstrate oxygen selectivity at temperatures ranging from 77 K to 273 K with marked decrease in oxygen capacity with increasing the temperature.  The decrease in O2 selectivity is trigger by the temperature-dependent dynamics of the physical expansion of the MOF pores.  This gate opening effect enables oxygen adsorption with near complete nitrogen rejection at low temperatures.  As the temperature increases, both nitrogen and oxygen have similar ability to gate-open RPM3-Zn.  Time-resolved Raman spectroscopy demonstrates the adsorption of oxygen is fast due to strong interaction between oxygen and the organic linkers and zinc metal sites of RPM3-Zn.  At equilibrium, the shift in vibrational bands associated with RPM3-Zn suggests oxygen interacts more strongly with the Zn nodes than nitrogen.  These observations demonstrate RPM3-Zn is incapable of being an effective oxygen-selective sorbent at room temperature, but the low temperature results suggest the selectivity may be "tuned" for other flexible metalorganic frameworks.  Although the low temperature oxygen selectivity is not practical to displace cryogenic distillation, the results suggest a new mechanism for tailoring materials for kinetic selectivity, namely, capitalizing upon the delayed opening process for a particular gas relative to another.
