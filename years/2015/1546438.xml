<AbstractNarration>This is a small RAPID project, co-funded with the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program, EHR Directorate, to utilize the extensive video footage and qualitative data collected through Elder interviews and participatory ethnography in 2013 and 2014, for the production of a series of short topic oriented films on the ethnobotanical knowledge of Alaska Native peoples.   This extensive ecological knowledge is at risk of loss as the pressures of globalization affect food sources and food choices by Alaska Native peoples.  The ethnobotanical knowledge recorded through this project is one key to long-term food security in the Arctic.    In addition, the films will support the teaching of science as interdisciplinary knowledge embedded in cultures and issues in the real world.  These methods have been shown at Tribal college programs to support STEM learning, which increases the success of Native American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian students in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge that is embodied in the above mentioned interviews is in danger of being lost with the passing of the current generation of Elders, and the film series that will be produced will not only preserve this knowledge but will also make it accessible to younger generations of Alaska Natives interested in their heritage knowledge, to scientists interested in accessing and analyzing ethnobotanical knowledge, and to the general public.  In addition,  the applicant will engage Alaska Native students in interdisciplinary science through the production of videos on this knowledge.   Although video production is not a novel way to engage young scientists, the participants will be working with a unique set of interdisciplinary data of ethnobotanical information from their own cultures.  In addition, the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUPS) has supported ethnobotony programs as a means of supporting STEM infrastructure at Tribal Colleges.  These videos will be utilized to introduce interdisciplinary scientific methods to Tribal College students through TCUPS programs at the Rural Colleges of Alaska  and Tribal Colleges in the continental U.S.   In addition, the videos will be available to museums for the public to gain a better understanding of Alaska Native knowledge and tradition.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The NSF grant awarded allowed for Sarah Betcher to produce 10 interview videos, which include 14-featured interviewees from Alaska speaking about and or showing how they use plants for food medicine or products. These interview videos will be archived in the UA Museum of the North and available for use by future UAF students. Betcher produced a transcription booklet from these 10 interview videos featuring the 14 interviewees. The booklet totals almost 100 pages and will also be archived in the Museum of the North.</p> <p>Once archival products had been produced, Betcher produced a free publically accessible nine-part plant use film series titled <em>Ties to Alaska&rsquo;s Wild Plants</em> including <em>Devil's Club: Tlingit Traditions of Helen Watkins</em>, <em>Sourdock: I&ntilde;upiat Traditions</em>, <em>Stinkweed: I&ntilde;upiat Traditions</em>, <em>Wood: I&ntilde;upiat Traditions</em>, <em>Berries: I&ntilde;upiat Traditions</em>, <em>Bark: I&ntilde;upiat Traditions</em>, <em>Willow: I&ntilde;upiat Traditions</em>, <em>Tree Gum: I&ntilde;upiat Traditions</em> and <em>Wild Celery: I&ntilde;upiat Traditions</em>. Once these 9 videos were produced they were all uploaded to youtube. These youtube videos are now being hosted by several different internet sites and facilities. The Museum of the North created a new website section for the Herbarium department, Ethnobotany, that hosts all the videos at: <a href="http://www.uaf.edu/museum/collections/herb/ethnobotany/">http://www.uaf.edu/museum/collections/herb/ethnobotany/</a> . The Museum of the North also created a youtube playlist for the videos at: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvQuX2bn3pWiK99U3bwOq1l1I6kA8w9j">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvQuX2bn3pWiK99U3bwOq1l1I6kA8w9j</a>.&nbsp; The Anchorage Museum is hosting all 9 videos at a semi-permanent display touch screen table. The PI, Steffi Ickert-Bond embedded the videos on the homepage of her website at: <a href="http://www.uaf.edu/museum/collections/herb/ethnobotany/">http://www.uaf.edu/museum/collections/herb/ethnobotany/</a>. &nbsp;Betcher embedded the videos on the homepage of her website at: <a href="http://www.farthestnorthfilms.com/">http://www.farthestnorthfilms.com/</a> .</p> <p>Public outreach of the films has included film showings and talks at several locations across Alaska. Betcher presented excerpts from the film series during Arctic Science Summit Week at the UA Museum of the North in Fairbanks, AK on 03/15/2016. The presentation was from the abstract entitled <em>Ethnobotany of Northwest Alaska: Preserving traditional knowledge and engaging Alaska native students in STEM as</em> part of the workshop: <em>Arctic Museum Collections &ndash; documenting and understanding changes in biological and cultural diversity through time and space</em>.<em> </em>Betcher conducted an in person film showing and talk at a culture camp, called LaVonne&rsquo;s Fish Camp, in Kotzebue, Alaska on 08/08/16. The film showing was advertised on KOTZ radio across the northwest Alaska region. Featured Elders were directly invited as well as made open to any interested parties from the public. Betcher spoke and showed two of the nine films at the Northwest Arctic Heritage Center in Kotzebue, Alaska on 08/10/16. Betcher presented a talk entitled <em>&ldquo;Ties to Alaska&rsquo;s Wild Plants: Preserving Traditional Ethnobotanical Knowledge Through Film Production,&rdquo;</em> at the 5<sup>th</sup> annual Alaskan Plants As Food and Medicine Symposium in Anchorage, Alaska on 09/12/2016. Betcher spoke about her methodology for filming and editing, where the films can be viewed and showed segments of six of the films including <em>Tree Gum, Berries, Bark, Stinkweed, Sourdock and Devil&rsquo;s Club.</em></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/06/2016<br>      Modified by: Stefanie&nbsp;M&nbsp;Ickert-Bond</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div
