<AbstractNarration>Coastal marine ecosystems provide a number of important services and resources for humans, and at the same time, coastal waters are subject to environmental stressors such as increases in ocean acidification and reductions in dissolved oxygen. The effects of these stressors on coastal marine organisms remain poorly understood because most research to date has examined the sensitivity of species to one factor, but not to more than one in combination. This project will determine how a model fish species, the Atlantic silverside, will respond to observed and predicted levels of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2). Shorter-term experiments will measure embryo and larval survival, growth, and metabolism, and determine whether parents experiencing stressful conditions produce more robust offspring. Longer-term experiments will study the consequences of ocean acidification over the entire life span by quantifying the effects of high-CO2 conditions on the ratio of males to females, lifetime growth, and reproductive investment. These studies will provide a more comprehensive view of how multiple stressors may impact populations of Atlantic silversides and potentially other important forage fish species. This collaborative project will support and train three graduate students at the University of Connecticut and the Stony Brook University (NY), two institutions that attract students from minority groups. It will also provide a variety of opportunities for undergraduates to participate in research and the public to learn about the study, through summer research projects, incorporation in the "Women in Science and Engineering" program, and interactive displays of environmental data from monitoring buoys. The two early-career investigators are committed to increasing ocean literacy and awareness of NSF-funded research through public talks and presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project responds to the recognized need for multi-stressor assessments of species sensitivities to anthropogenic environmental change. It will combine environmental monitoring with advanced experimental approaches to characterize early and whole life consequences of acidification and hypoxia in the Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), a valued model species and important forage fish along most of the US east coast. Experiments will employ a newly constructed, computer-controlled fish rearing system to allow independent and combined manipulation of seawater pCO2 and dissolved oxygen (DO) content and the application of static and fluctuating pCO2 and DO levels that were chosen to represent contemporary and potential future scenarios in productive coastal habitats. First CO2, DO, and CO2 × DO dependent reaction norms will be quantified for fitness-relevant early life history (ELH) traits including pre- and post-hatch survival, time to hatch, post-hatch growth, by rearing offspring collected from wild adults from fertilization to 20 days post hatch (dph) using a full factorial design of 3 CO2 × 3 DO levels. Second, the effects of tidal and diel CO2 × DO fluctuations of different amplitudes on silverside ELH traits will be quantified. To address knowledge gaps regarding the CO2-sensitivity in this species, laboratory manipulations of adult spawner environments and reciprocal offspring exposure experiments will elucidate the role of transgenerational plasticity as a potential short-term mechanism to cope with changing environments. To better understand the mechanisms of fish early life CO2-sensitivity, the effects of temperature × CO2 on pre- and post-hatch metabolism will be robustly quantified. The final objective is to rear silversides from fertilization to maturity under different CO2 levels and assess potential CO2-effects on sex ratio and whole life growth and fecundity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to comprehensively evaluate the responses and adaptation mechanisms of an estuarine dependent fish to the combined stressors of low pH and low dissolved oxygen, stressors found commonly in coastal and estuarine waters.  We focused on the early life stages as this model species as they have been shown to be sensitive to these stressors at this stage and because the effects could have population-level consequences.  We hypothesized that this species would be sensitive to these stressors both individually and combined if exposed at fertilization, but that they would develop the capacity to cope with acidification very quickly after hatch.  We found that growth and survival were lower in hypoxic and acidified conditions and hypothesized that energetic costs were incurred to deal with these conditions.  Specifically, we predicted that oxygen consumption would increase in hypoxic and acidified conditions.  In both embryos and larvae, metabolism was extremely sensitive to temperature, as was expected, but metabolic rates did not increase under high CO2 conditions alone.  However, in embryos when pCO2 levels are high routine metabolism becomes depressed under hypoxia. Thus, fish become more sensitive to dissolved oxygen at high CO2 levels, explaining the strong and sometimes synergistic effect of hypoxia and acidification on fish growth and survival documented in many studies.   We further quantified the production of ionocytes and gene expression of enzymes that help regulate acid-base balance in embryos and larvae as the fish developed.  Again, temperature was the main determinant of ionocyte production and gene expression, but these results were dependent on the developmental stage of the fish.  Overall, this estuarine fish, which serves as a model species for other estuarine dependent species, appears relatively insensitive to changes in pCO2 because of an acid-base regulation system that develops within a few days after hatch.
