<AbstractNarration>Principal Investigator: Yan&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No:  1500903&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium award will provide support for the Symposium on Thin-Film Compound Semiconductor Photovoltaics, to be held at the 2015 Materials Research Society Spring Annual Meeting.  The specific goals of the symposium are to present and disseminate significant recent advances in the understanding of new materials for solar cells, and to help develop a diverse and active community of early career scientists to further technical progress in the future.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium award will provide support for the Symposium on Thin-Film Compound Semiconductor Photovoltaics (Symposium B), to be held at the 2015 Materials Research Society Spring Annual Meeting, April 6-10, 2015, San Francisco, CA.  Compound thin-film photovoltaics have demonstrated high light-to electricity conversion efficiencies, and are leading candidates to provide low-cost sustainable solar energy conversion, due to potential advantages in lowering costs for manufacturing and materials. Recent progress has improved the record efficiencies of laboratory CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin film solar cells considerably, reaching 21%. The topic has great importance for the materials research community to further its contribution to develop alternative energy sources.  The symposium brings together a wide range of experts in research on thin-film photovoltaics, including 12 internationally recognized invited speakers, along with students and other early career scientists. There will be sessions on many different aspects of the technology, and the materials needed for production. Synergies among different materials, processing approaches, and characterization methods will be highlighted. The technical presentations on these diverse topics are designed to foster open discussion needed to advance scientific progress.  The symposium will also organize a Young Scientist Tutorial to train and educate graduate and undergraduate students on the latest advances in thin-film photovoltaics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Symposium B, Thin-Film Compound Semiconductor Photovoltaics*, was held at the 2015 Materials Research Society (MRS) Spring Meeting in San Francisco, CA.   The NSF grant was used to support travel awards for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career researchers to attend the meeting and Symposium.  It was allocated for (1) graduate student oral presentation award; (2) support for earlier career young scientists with registration and travel funds; (3) support for the Young Scientist Tutorial; and (4) support for best poster presentation awards.   Compound thin-film photovoltaics have demonstrated high light-to electricity conversion efficiencies and are leading candidates to provide lower-cost energy due to potential advantages in manufacturing and materials costs.  This topic has great importance for the materials research community to further its contribution to the increased urgency in the U.S. and globally for developing alternative energy sources.  The specific goals of the Symposium were to present and disseminate significant recent advances in the understanding of these materials and devices and to help develop a diverse and active community including established researchers and young scientists to further technical progress in the future.  The Symposium received over 300 abstracts, and focused on the science of materials, defects, interfaces and devices, development of characterization methods, and advancement of manufacturing processes.   The Symposium provided opportunities for students, postdocs and early career researchers to share with experts in the field.  Documentation provided by assembled proceedings papers and recorded talks as provided by MRS OnDemand could be a useful tool to design an education strategy around the Materials Genome Initiative.  More importantly, the Symposium had a panel discussion to discuss the roadmap of thin-film photovoltaics which has attracted attendees from both academia and industries. Furthermore, the Symposium has promoted the participation of women scientists and junior scientists.  The community has highly recommended to continue this Symposium in the 2017 MRS Spring Meeting in Phoenix, AZ.  *A solar cell, or photovoltaic cell, is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect (the creation of voltage or electric current in a material upon exposure to light) which is a physical and chemical phenomenon.
