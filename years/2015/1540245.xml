<AbstractNarration>The Asian Technology Information Program (ATIP) proposes to hold a Workshop at SC'15 in Austin, TX, that will provide a balanced picture of key Chinese HPC R&amp;D. Over the past 5 to 10 years, China has emerged as a significant HPC player. Although a few US experts are following Chinese research, for others there is no coherent way to fully understand what is occurring. This is specifically true for younger US researchers who are not familiar with where to access the best Chinese research. Broader impacts will include potential US-China collaborative efforts in computational research. More importantly, it enables US researchers to keep abreast of developments in China and to incorporate the best ideas in their research in the US. It will also enable funding agencies in the US to keep abreast of the priorities of Chinese funding agencies in HPC. &lt;br/&gt;The Workshop will include presentations, posters, and discussions by Chinese researchers from universities, government institutes, and industry in sessions addressing systems, centers, and government plans, progress in components, system software, and applications, and human resource and eco-system development. This balanced program will enable the US research community to gain a more holistic understanding of the current situation and better evaluate potential opportunities for collaboration. As part of this proposal, ATIP will support at least eight young US researchers identified as having a high potential for research interests that overlap with their Chinese counterparts and who would normally be unable to attend SC. Members of the Chinese research community have agreed to support attendance by similar students in China who are anxious to share their ideas and engage in collaborative work. The key aspect of the proposed Workshop will be the unique opportunity for members of the US and international HPC research community to interact and have direct discussions with the top Chinese scientists and leading graduate students in both China and the US.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On Monday, November 16, 2015, the Asian Technology Information Program (ATIP) held a workshop titled "Chinese HPC Research Toward New Platforms and Real Applications" at the Hilton Austin Convention Center in Austin, TX (US) as part of the SC15 Conference.  Approximately 108 participants attended the workshop throughout the day.  Major Goals / Specific Objectives  1) Introduce the US HPC research community to new research from China, focusing on next-generation computing, hardware, and applications.2) Enable US and Chinese researchers to meet and share ideas concerning these topics. As an official SC15 Workshop, researchers who are already attending the conference from other countries are expected to participate based on an interest in Chinese research. ATIP will make particular efforts to promote the workshop and encourage participation from conference attendees.3) Motivate the preparation of joint research proposals with researchers and companies from both US and Asia.  Major Activities:  NSF?s grant was used to support the travel costs for eight US graduate students recommended by the Advisory Committee to attend the conference and present their work in a poster format, as well as assist with the travel costs for speakers and students from China to attend the conference and discuss their research.   Key Outcomes / AchievementsIntellectual Merit:  China?s visibility in the world of HPC is largely a result of the Tianhe systems on the Top500 lists, but more sustained and less well known research efforts may ultimately be of greater significance.  Numerous challenges remain unaddressed as society moves into an age of extreme computing. These challenges are of sufficient difficulty that it will take concerted efforts by many scientists to address them, which will inevitably require international engagement and collaboration. ATIP?s workshop has contributed intellectually to the global field of HPC by opening Chinese research to broader scrutiny and examination. It aimed to generate discussion between various parties such as government agencies, HPC scientists, and vendors at an international level with the ultimate goal of stimulating new directions of research and practical use as well as enabling solutions to be developed more quickly than previously.  Broader Impact:  Since ATIP?s workshop brought together top scientists and graduate students from both the US and China, ATIP believes these individuals will form connections that could lead to future research collaborations, particularly in the area of future extreme-scale computing systems and applications.
