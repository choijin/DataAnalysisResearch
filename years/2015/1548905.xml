<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has three outcomes.  Commercially, the introduction of the developed technology will capture a significant fraction of the $12.6B billboard and sign manufacturing market, contributing to its expansion and that of related markets such as indoor signage and architectural aesthetics.  Environmentally, significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions Â will be realized as the technology will consume up to 100x less energy relative to existing LED array-based digital signage.  Additional reductions in physical waste will be considerable for locations switching from conventional printed materials to digital.  Scientifically, advancing dielectric elastomer processing and fabrication with a commercial focus will contribute to overcoming technological hurdles preventing their commercial adoption in other fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project evaluates the feasibility of constructing prototype dielectric elastomer-based display modules on a commercially relevant scale. Processing and fabrication constraints currently inhibit rapid commercial growth of dielectric elastomer technology in the marketplace at a time when it is beginning to prove itself in niche markets such as audio-related haptics and laser speckle reduction. Through studying the feasibility of constructing a redesigned pixel, its ability to scale to array sizes acceptable for large-area digital signage, and its performance, a clearer determination of customer acceptance will be obtained.  Successful completion of these objectives will result in a scalable, full-color, reflective display module, and de-risk the fabrication processes involved in manipulating hydrostatically-coupled dielectric elastomers on scales relevant for large-area applications.</AbstractNarration>
