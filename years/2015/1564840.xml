<AbstractNarration>Proteins perform many cellular functions, made possible by complex networks of interactions; knowing the location of the interaction sites on the proteins is key for understanding exactly how they work.  Important applications include designing drugs and therapeutic agents.  Experimental techniques for determining the interfaces between proteins are expensive and time consuming, so computational structural biologists seek to predict these mathematically. Current prediction methods use a limited number of features hand-crafted by an expert.  An alternate approach is to learn the important features directly from all of the data, using a method called deep neural networks.  This proposal explores a combined approach: use expert intuition for some features but add the power of unsupervised learning with deep neural networks to learn additional, novel features. The results will enrich the way protein structural features are understood in terms of their functional properties, whether those are catalytic sites, protein-binding sites or other sites important to the protein structure. Certainly in the prediction of protein structure itself machine learning scoring methods are showing great promise. Aspects of the research will be used in courses offered through a recently awarded NSF-NRT training grant, The training grant establishes an interdisciplinary program at the interfaces of biology, engineering, math/statistics and computer science.  The program prepares students for a variety of career paths.  Research and education experiences will provide students with valuable expertise in a computational area that is highly valued by top technology firms, such as Google and Facebook, which have research teams exploring the possibilities of deep neural networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work proposes a paradigm shift in the field of protein interface prediction and scoring: from hand-crafted features and standard off-the-shelf classifiers to an approach that augments existing features with automatic learning of the features that characterize the 3-d structures of proteins, combined with the use of learning algorithms that are specifically designed for the characteristics of the problem.  The proposed approach has multiple novel aspects: the proposed learning approach leverages information contained in the entire protein data bank (PDB) to learn features that characterize protein structures at multiple scales and levels of abstraction. It introduces a novel neural network architecture and regularization terms that constrain the solution towards biologically relevant results.  The primary alternative to this machine learning-based interface prediction uses docking simulations; however, current docking energy functions are not accurate enough, so that a near-native solution is often not ranked high enough on the list of outcomes to be useful.  Extensions of the proposed architectures for interface prediction will be employed for re-scoring docking solutions to improve their predictive success. A workflow that integrates docking and machine learning-based interface prediction and scoring is proposed to explore the synergism between these tasks.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Proteins function by interacting with other proteins.  Determining the interfaces by which proteins interact is important for understanding how proteins function, and is a crucial component in the process of drug design.  Determining the interfaces by which protein interactions occur can be performed experimentally, but is expensive and time consuming.  Therefore predicting protein interface computationally has emerged as an important problem in computational biology.  Although it has been extensively studied, this is a very difficult that remains in need of new advances.   Deep learning is an important machine learning methodology that has revolutionized the field of computer vision, and has made inroads in computational biology, assisting in the interpretation of complex, noisy biological datasets.  The goal of this project was to design,implement and evaluate accurate machine learning methods for predicting protein interfaces from protein 3-d structures using deep learning methods.  Supported by this award, PI Ben-Hur's lab pioneered the use of graph convolutional networks, which extend methods developed in computer vision for representing protein 3-d structures.  Our 2017 NeurIPS publication describing this methodology for the purpose of predicting interacting residues is highly cited, and has already garnered 184 citations.   The impact of this project has been the following:  1.  A novel machine learning framework for representing protein 3-dstructures using graph convolutional networks.  This framework can be applied to many problems that analyze protein structures from interface prediction to protein  protein function prediction.  We demonstrated its effectiveness for protein interface prediction and are currently extending it to address protein quality assessment and assessment of docked protein interfaces.  2.  As part of this award we provided interdisciplinary training toseven students who have become proficient in deep learning and its applications to molecular data.
