<AbstractNarration>Engineers in many industries use the finite element method to divide structures into small elements so that the equations governing each can be found and solved by computers.   This allows one to compute the stresses and deformation of structures with complicated shapes such as airplanes, machines, biomedical implants, etc. and to predict whether the structure can survive the loads it will experience in operation.  While this method has proven very effective in many scenarios, even modern computers are not powerful enough to model the interfaces between parts accurately.  As a result, billions of dollars are spent annually testing structures to determine the stiffness of interfaces, such as bolted connections, in order to adjust the simulation models so that they better capture the real behavior of the structure.  This makes new machines much more expensive and often leads to designs that break prematurely, potentially endangering lives.  Prediction is particularly difficult when a structure, such as an aircraft, experiences dynamic loads due to turbulence in the air passing over the wings.  This work will explore a new means of simulating the motion of structures with bolted interfaces and will perform experiments to seek to understand how to model friction and microscopic slip in the joints and its effect on vibration damping. The methodology can be easily integrated in existing finite element software, to facilitate its transition and broad adoption. The research will be complemented by outreach activities at the PIs institutions and a short course exposing students and researchers to the technique formulated as part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The physics that are responsible for energy dissipation in mechanical joints are complicated and span the full range of length scales.  While much has been learned in recent years about the nature of nano- and meso-scale contact interfaces, friction is exceedingly complicated and may be influenced by local elasticity, chemistry, plasticity, surface roughness and lubrication provided by oxides or thin layers of wear particles.  This work posits a new reduced order modeling framework that allows one to connect the physics of small scale contacts to the global motion of the assembly.  An extension to modal analysis that can then be used to obtain a wealth of insight into the response of the structure under a variety of loading conditions.  The methodology will be validated through simulations on various structures and through experiments on assemblies with bolted interfaces, providing new insights into the role of interfaces on a structure's response.  Simulations will be performed to understand how the features/parameters of various friction laws manifest themselves in the damping and nonlinearity of the global dynamic response.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Vibration of Jointed Structures  The vibration of structures built of components attached to each other by bolts, rivets, or other frictional connect are of significant importance in mechanical, civil, and aerospace structures. However, they cannot be understood without a better understanding of the mechanics taking place in the vicinities of those attachments. There are at least three core difficulties in analyses:    1. Obtaining an algorithm for evolving the distribution of tractions and displacements consistent with all relevant equations and constraints as the applied load history is applied.   2. Adequately representing the elasticity of the contacting bodies without employing so many mathematical degrees of freedom that the corresponding system of equations becomes unsolvable.  3. Representing interface physics (friction) with equations that correctly capture the slip processes and the tractions involved.       The work performed under this research grant focused on the first two of these issues and used those results to begin to address the third.    A. Conventional contact mechanics algorithms are often incapable of providing solutions that satisfy all equality and inequality constraints throughout the loading process. Whether those solutions are at all meaningful is unclear.       A new contact algorithm was developed that assures that all relevant equations and constraints are satisfied throughout the loading process. This algorithm ? called the Method of First Violation ? is devised so that load increments are selected to change status of only one node at a time (such as going into contact or coming out of contract) and that transition occurs at the end of the timestep. With this strategy, all relevant equations and constraints are satisfied throughout the loading process. The resulting numerical predations are more stable and more physically plausible than those of conventional algorithms. The Method of First Violation also appears to be more numerically efficient than conventional algorithms.       B. The usual methods of representing the elasticity of bodies are through the finite element method, where in the volume of each body is represented by a collection of small, simpler elastic elements connected by nodes shared by adjacent elements. The quality of mathematical representation increases as the sizes of the elements shrink, but the number of mathematical degrees of freedom increases proportionately, as does the computational difficulty. An alternative approach is the method of boundary elements, and the computational difficulties are similar, though less severe.       To understand in detail the mechanics of contacting surfaces, it is necessary to have extraordinarily finely distributed computational nodes on each side of the interface and in general such fine meshes in the contact region involve solving equations that correspond not just the nodes in the contact region but to the myriad other nodes distributed throughout each body.     This problem can be made manageable for the case of two-dimensional contact of rigid indenters pushed against an elastic half-plane because for that special geometry, it is possible to pose the elasticity problem using small compliance matrices involving only forces and displacements in the vicinity of the region of contact. Though this compliance formulation can be very helpful in understanding the details of contact in this specific geometry, it is not representative of most contact (even 2-dimensional contact), which generally involves contact of two round elastic bodies.   A new discretization technique has been developed for elastic disks by combining two classical analytical methods (the Michell solution for elastic disks and Fourier series analysis), permitting the detailed analysis of contact of surfaces of rounded bodies.       C. Most analytic and numerical calculations for interface mechanics assume a point-wise Coulomb friction applies in the interface. However, when fine-meshed finite element predictions are compared to experimental data taken from laboratory tests, there are qualitative differences that must be ascribed to the inadequacy of the point-wise Coulomb friction model to address joint mechanics. The combination of the Method of First Violation algorithm and the compliance matrix formulation for elastic contact provide a testbed for exploring the ramifications of using other constitutive equations for interface friction, and so far, that testbed has been used to examine contact involving two-parameter friction (static and dynamic coefficients of friction) and a slightly more complicated Dahl model for friction.    Broader Impacts  Broader impacts are wide ranging, from designing aircraft to avoid aeroelastic instability, to designing structures to be more earthquake resistant, to designing more quiet passenger compartments in transportation, to designing satellites to be more likely to survive the ride up into space.  All of these issues are influenced by the complex structural responses due to jointed interfaces.         Last Modified: 11/26/2020       Submitted by: Daniel Segalman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
