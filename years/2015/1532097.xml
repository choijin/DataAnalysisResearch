<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the acquisition of a new generation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS).  This instrumentation would replace the aging MC-ICP-MS currently used by the Jackson School of Geosciences, University of Texas, Austin.  Acquisition of a new MC-ICP-MS will expand the research directions and capabilities offered by the Jackson School of Geosciences and enrich educational opportunities for students.  JSG faculty are engaged in a variety of outreach activities, and research involving the new instrument will be integrated into an ongoing REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) program, GK-12 outreach program partnering K-12 teachers and STEM graduate students, and GeoFORCE (a successful college preparatory outreach program targeting Texas minority high school students).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Numerous scientists at UT-Austin have both current and planned research projects requiring a new generation MC-ICP-MS analyses.  These analytical needs include the development of new techniques in addition to applying existing methodologies to answer new and innovative research questions.  These include U-series measurements to determine ages on carbonates.  This will be applied to a variety of research topics including studies of cave, pedogenic and lacustrine carbonate deposits and dating of ostrich egg shells to investigate the timing of human evolution.  A modern MC-ICP-MS would also facilitate the concurrent measurement of Hf and Pb isotopes and allow us to identify both the isotopic fingerprint and age within a single growth zone in zircons, crucial to investigations of magma chamber evolution and sediment provenance.  Additional research applications include high spatial resolution in situ Sr isotope measurements in a) biogenic carbonates in fishes to reconstruct migration histories, b) speleothems in karst hydrologic systems to reconstruct drip-water evolution and climate, and c) feldspar phenocrysts to track magma mixing and crustal assimilation.  The new instrument will also be used to measure a variety of isotopes including Li, Os, and Pb for isotopic fingerprinting of mineral phases and bulk rocks and Fe and Zn isotopes to investigate metal uptake in cells.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The MC-ICP-MS was installed and operating by the end of January 2018 at the University of Texas-Austin (UT).  Since the installation we have pushed to develop new capabilities, and thus increase the research potential for faculty, staff and students at UT-Austin.  Very quickly after installation, the instrument was set up to analyze Li isotopes. We were able to analyze samples for a PhD student, provide data for his thesis and he was able to graduate on time.  Following that success for Li, two more current PhD students got involved in further developing methods for Li isotopes where data for their theses are currently being collected.  Measuring Li isotopes was not possible at UT-Austin before the installation of this new instrument, and since developing this technique in-house, four different research groups at UT now have active projects involving Li isotopes.  Pb isotopes have also been measured in mantle rock mineral separates as part of an undergraduate research project, where the undergraduate student was educated in the use of the MC-ICP-MS and data collection.  Pb isotopes have also been analyzed as part of a Master?s degree project on mineral phases leached out of large diamonds.  Measuring Pb and Li isotopes as a tracer of Earth processes is consistent with aspects of the intellectual merit outlined in the proposal.  Using the intellectual merit discussed is the proposal as a guide, current methods in the early stages of development involve measuring small amounts of U-Th and Pb isotopes for U-series and laser ablation, respectively.  Other methods (e.g., Fe isotopes and in situ Sr and Hf isotopes) will be developed in the future as needed by researchers.          Student involvement in method development (described above) as an educational opportunity is consistent with aspects of the broader impacts outlined in the original proposal. To date, the lab has produced data for six different student research projects.  The instrument will also be integrated into the department?s graduate level Analytical Techniques course (offered in the spring of 2019), also consistent with aspects of the broader impacts outlined in the proposal.
