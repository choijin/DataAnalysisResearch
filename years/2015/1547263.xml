<AbstractNarration>The geomagnetic field has been dropping rapidly over the past century (8%)leaving some worried that it could collapse into what is known as a 'transitional state' with a strength of ~10% of the present field.  Such an event would pose severe danger to the planet's electrical grid and satellites requiring some advanced planning.  The likelihood of this happening is presently unknown as human measurements of the magnetic field strength span only the last ~150 years and fundamental questions  regarding the average field strength of the geomagnetic field and its variation through time remain despite decades of effort.    This project will serve to support the  research of several students (both undergraduate and graduate), one of whom is an under-represented minority female.  In addition, it will provide funding for a female computer programmer to continue efforts on improving the software supporting online materials including a textbook and a complete software package (PmagPy) that integrates smoothly with the MagIC database, (http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials and http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook respectively).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The signal of an axial geomagnetic dipole, whereby the field strength doubles from the equator to the poles, is readily apparent in the present field but no such clear dipolar signal exists in the paleointensity database from the last five million years. There are several possible explanations for this troubling failure: 1) combining data from different ages with possibly different average intensities leads to an inappropriate comparison of field states, 2) there is a depression of field strength at high latitude, perhaps reflecting the role of the 'tangent cylinder' or 3) there is noise and/or bias introduced by poor selection criteria or poor experimental design. The latter is a likely explanation as published data from the 1960 flow on Hawaii display the entire range of intensity values observed on the Earth's surface today, yet they should all have one distinct value. The PI has developed new experimental methods, better field strategies and a new approach to data selection that will allow the team to obtain accurate estimates of the ancient field strength to improve our understanding of the intensity behavior in Earth's past. The PI plans a comprehensive field campaign to collect samples targeting the most promising material for paleointensity study. These will be analyzed using the most robust experimental protocol and subjected to rigorous selection criteria proven to reject inaccurate results, leading to both accurate and precise paleointensity estimates. The PI will also complete a long term aging experiment of thermal remanence to investigate the contribution of bias (and&lt;br/&gt;noise) of non-single domain material in the database, with an eye toward improving the experiment and data selection procedures leading to higher accuracy in paleointensity estimates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         Studies of the Earth's deep interior use paleomagnetic data for testing geodynamo models and for providing information about the nature of the core (e.g., when the inner core might have formed). Intensity information is a vital part of that and assessing the accuracy and precision of the results key. Also, archaeologists have long used archaeomagnetic data for providing age constraints that have relied on unpublished data.Yet, persistent questions remain about the  behavior of the Earth's ancient magnetic field.  Resolving these require a three-fold effort: 1) We need to improve our understanding of how rocks get and stay magnetized and which rocks in particular are suited for paleointensity analysis, 2) we need to bring this new understanding to develop an improved paleointensity experiment, and 3) we need to apply the improved approach to sample collection and analysis from globally distributed  sampling sites.          This grant enabled us to make significant progress on all three goals.  We now have a much better idea of which geological and archaeological materials perform best for constraining past field behavior and how to anallyze the data to achieve the highest accuracy and precision estimates possible.  We also were able to contribute a huge amount of measurement level data to an open, interoperable database so that previously published data can be re-interpreted with the new technique.    This grant also allowed us to complete publication of new data from archaeological and geological contexts with significant advances in the understanding of the ancient geomagnetic field during the Cretaceous to new archaeological records.
