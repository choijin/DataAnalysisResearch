<AbstractNarration>This proposal is aimed at understanding the structural, tectonic, and exhumation of a part of the Himalayan orogen in central and western Nepal. The principal investigators are investigating how fault magnitude, geometry and rate are related to uplift and exhumation in convergent margin plate tectonic systems where two continents are colliding. This research will allow the principal investigators to constrain both magnitude and age of faulting and gain insight into the geometry of these faults along a fundamental plate boundary between India and Asia in the Nepalese Himalaya, which will provide fundamental insights into how convergent plate margins evolve through time.  This region is the site of large, destructive earthquakes that are a function of both geometry of the faults and the rates at which these faults move; thus, the research has the potential to further understanding in a region of active seismicity. This proposal combines thermochronometry (the age at which minerals cool) with numerical modeling to determine fault magnitude, geometry and rate. Geologic mapping and associated cross sections provide an estimate of fault geometry.  This geometry provides a testable path along which rocks were displaced and cooled from the subsurface to the Earth's surface. The principal investigators will test the hypothesis that the geometry of faults controls the first-order pattern of cooling ages that are recorded in rocks, which can then be tested by comparing measured cooling ages to modeled cooling ages using different fault geometries. This approach will provide workflows, methodologies, and examples of how fault geometries, as determined from geologic cross sections, and rates impact predicted cooling ages.  In addition to the scientific objectives of the study, the project is contributing to the national well-being and other socially relevant outcomes by providing for training of graduate and undergraduate students in an important STEM discipline, as well a contributing to the broadening of underrepresented groups in the earth sciences. The project it is contributing to the development of research infrastructure at two U.S. university systems, and is promoting international collaboration between U.S., German, and Nepalese scientists. Results from this research will be incorporated into classroom curricula. As part of this project, the principal investigators are developing a series of research and teaching modules that will provide interested graduate students and researchers from other institutions the skills needed to use this research approach for their own field areas and datasets, and allow educators to assign advanced undergraduates and graduate students assignments that teach the systematics of how compressional fault systems form and the relationships between deformation, erosion and deposition. The results of the research will be disseminated through peer-reviewed scientific publications literature and by presentations at professional society meetings; data obtained from the project will be archived in appropriate community supported data repositories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining thermochronometry with numerical modeling has an enormous potential to quantify the rates, magnitudes, and timing of deformation and erosion in active, contractional plate tectonic settings. However, the interpretations of thermochronometric data are critically dependent on determining the correct thermal, kinematic, and erosion models. Understanding how fault magnitude, geometry and rate are related to exhumation in compressional systems requires quantitatively linking the geometry and magnitude of fault slip to the distribution and amount of erosion. In this project, the principal investigators suggest that the geometry of fold-thrust belts is best delineated through balanced geologic cross-sections, and they hypothesize that the geometry of a fold-thrust belt, particularly the location and magnitude of ramps in the decollement, control the first-order pattern of cooling ages. To address this hypothesis they will apply a 2 dimensional thermo-kinematic and erosion model to forward modeled balanced cross sections to quantify the cooling history in a thrust belt setting. Balanced cross-sections provide the kinematic sequence of rocks and structures necessary to reproduce the mapped surface geology. The principal investigators will test the validity of this kinematic sequence by assigning ages over which displacement occurs, and use the range of potential velocity vectors to calculate heat transport, erosion, and rock cooling. Matching the measured cooling histories recorded by a suite of thermochronometers to that predicted by the kinematics of a balanced cross-section is an additional support for the validation of the cross section. This work will examine proposed structural geometries, the cooling ages of rocks and their interdependence in central Nepal and far western Nepal. In central Nepal, there is an abundance of geochronologic/thermochronologic data and recent maps and cross section interpretations. In far western Nepal, there are detailed maps and cross section interpretations with a growing body of geochronologic/thermochronologic data. The researchers will capitalize on these established and growing datasets to test our hypothesis by 1) evaluating a range of permissible geometries for balanced-sections (both prior to and following field work), 2) collecting critical field observations (bedding, foliation, cleavage) and necessary thermochronologic samples, 3) establishing the cooling history of duplexes and thrust sheets via a suite of thermochronometers, and 4) modeling the dependence of chronometers on structural geometries, displacement paths and rates. The intellectual merit of this project involves investigating the sensitivity and utility of thermochronometer and kinematic data for calculating the age and rate of thrust motion and associated exhumation. Using this approach in Nepal, the principal investigators can evaluate the range of shortening rates in space and time and determine if long-term shortening rates though the Himalaya are constant or variable. These methods/processes will be transportable to other contractional systems worldwide and will lead to a reevaluation of the kinematics, geometry and rates in orogenic systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The interaction of geologic plates, at plate boundaries, generates large (magnitude 6-9) earthquakes that have recurrence intervals at any given location of 50 years to 500,000 years depending on the width of the deforming boundary and the rate of plate motion. These earthquakes and their variations in magnitude and location emphasize the importance in understanding how plates are currently deforming as well as how plate boundaries have evolved through time.  Earthquake magnitudes are directly proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures during an earthquake; the bigger the area, the bigger the earthquake.  An important part of assessing seismic risk is determining how much of a fault, will rupture.  One of the features that limit earthquake rupture is a bend in the fault plane. Major mountain ranges like the Andes or the Himalayas have faults that are almost entirely in the subsurface with only the frontal most part of the fault reaching the surface.  Because of this, any bends in the fault that can limit the size of an earthquake are not visible.  The research from this proposal has linked bends or ramps in major faults ? like the Main Himalayan Fault to the ages of minerals (thermochronometers) that record how fast rocks cool during their path from 10-20 km underground to the surface where we can collect them.  The relationship between fast rates to the surface (10-20 km in 2-5 million years) and the location of ramps that uplift rocks allow us to use these thermochronometers to map where ramps are, how they are oriented and determine the area available to rupture in an earthquake.     We identify the location of ramps by matching measured thermochronometers to mineral cooling ages that are predicted through numerical modeling.  To create these numerical models we started with collecting field observations of rock type and identifying faults that reach the surface.  We used these data to create 8 different cross sections that illustrate various models of what a vertical slice though the Himalayan Mountains may look like and how the location of the faults and their geometry changes from east to west.   For each of these cross sections we sequentially moved each predicted fault in 10 km increments to create displacement fields that are used as input into the numerical (thermal and kinematic) models. A match between measured and modeled mineral cooling ages provide confidence in the cross section geometry and identifies the location and magnitude of the active ramps.  A valid model must match all available geologic map data, geophysical data and measured cooling ages.  Using this approach we tested three different fault geometries that were proposed following the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake.  These fault geometries all proposed a different location for a major ramp in the Main Himalayan thrust (the fault that ruptured during the earthquake).  We were able to show that only one of these geometries was correct.  Part of the confusion regarding the location of this ramp is because its position changes from east to west.  We combined new mapping data with compiled cooling age data to identify a major step in the location of the main ramp and proposed that this step (a lateral ramp) may have controlled the Gorkha Earthquake nucleation and propagation.  This lateral ramp shifts surface exposures of the Greater Himalayan rocks towards the south immediately west of the earthquake, strongly suggesting that the mid-crustal ramp is farther south in this location as well. The offset mid-crustal ramps and the lateral ramp between them are co-located with 40Ar-39Ar cooling ages that required the rocks to rapidly cool from 350 degrees C to surface temperatures in the last 5-7 million years.    Important outcomes from our research show that published cooling ages can be used to show that a proposed cross section geometry is not correct and that the geometry needs to be altered. By altering the cross section geometry to match the measured cooling ages we can identify major bends in the active fault and evaluate if these bends are significant enough to inhibit earthquake propagation.  When sequentially restored balanced cross sections match the measured cooling ages, the model also predict the rate of fault motion and how these faults rates have evolved through time.
