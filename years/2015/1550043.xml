<AbstractNarration>This project will conduct research about teacher preparation in the context of hosting two annual convenings (2016 and 2017): Southeastern Regional Robert Noyce Connections: Convening a Community of Learners Focused on STEM Pre-Service Teacher Education. The Southeastern region includes 9 target states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee). Each convening will involve 200 participants, including presenters and discussion leaders. The emphasis of this project is to strengthen connections among the Noyce projects and others interested and engaged in teacher preparation, in order to expand the impact from the local areas influenced by the individual projects to the larger region. To continue to strengthen the connections beyond the convenings, the project team will use a well-established electronic system to create the Southeast Regional Noyce Network (SRN^2), which will allow for discussion forums and a place to post articles, learning and teaching ideas, and other resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research agenda will investigate cultural, racial, and educational variables in the community of Noyce investigators and pre-service and in-service teachers. Research questions include: (1) How do Noyce Programs address cultural competence? (2) What racial, cultural, and educational attitudes and experiences predict desire to teach STEM in a high-need school? (3) How do Noyce Scholars perceive students? STEM abilities from majority and non-majority groups? (4) Which factors are related to job satisfaction and wellbeing for Noyce Scholars? In addition, the convenings will provide opportunities for researchers and other investigators interested in the Noyce Program, as well as Noyce scholarship and fellowship recipients, to build and strengthen collaborations toward moving teaching and research about teacher education forward as fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the course of the years of the Southeast Regional Robert Noyce Connections project, the team developed and carried out a number of tasks to prepare the Southeast Regional Noyce Network, and to continue to build a foundation for advancing STEM learning and preservice teacher education through a lens of equity for high needs students and schools.    During the course of the first conference grant, the project planned and carried out conferences that brought together scholars from Noyce projects across the Southeast, in Mobile, Alabama during June. All conferences featured well known keynote speakers who provided insights and professional development for the scholars and program personnel.  Cultural competence, culturally relevant pedagogy, and relationship building, etc. was at the center of the conference as these topics are important in training future educators who will become science and math teachers in minority, urban, rural, or low income environments.  The conference provided an opportunity to educate science and math teachers across the southeast about cultural competence and culturally relevant pedagogy as it relates to their beliefs and teaching.  Since a goal of the project was to carry out research that surrounds some of the issues that were identified during the initial needs assessment topics for breakout sessions and workshops each year included, teacher belief systems, quality of life and work-life stress among teachers, and issues related to teaching diverse students, as well as issues about ways to teach mathematics and science in relevant contexts with limited resources.  During the extension phase of the initial conference grant and into the first year of the second conference grant, the team was able to expand the conference to include more activity among the scholars and early career teachers.
