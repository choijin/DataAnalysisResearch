<AbstractNarration>1552444 (Horsburgh)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To overcome challenges in using smart water metering as an effective tool for sustainably managing urban water supplies, an integrated research and education plan called Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply (CIWS) is being implemented. CIWS will investigate novel cyberinfrastructure and analytics to advance smart metering technology, enable detailed characterization of residential water use behavior, and build the scientific data and knowledge base for sustainably managing urban water supplies. CIWS will enable transitioning of existing conventional "dumb" water meters (the vast majority of water meters in use today) into low-cost (~$100) "smart" and computationally-capable devices that can collect high frequency data, use onboard processing capability to "shrink" the collected data by extracting the timing and volume of individual water end uses, and then transmit actionable data products to water managers for analysis - all without replacing or affecting the functionality of the meter. CIWS will be capable of closing critical gaps in understanding of and ability to quantify water use behavior at the household and water system level. It will also enable identification of alternative water management strategies and opportunities for water conservation and increased efficiency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CIWS and associated residential water use studies offer a way to characterize residential water use and generate new knowledge about: 1) how water use behavior varies across socio-demographic groups and neighborhood types; 2) the timing of water demand and how this information can be used by water providers to ensure water availability and efficiency, plan for related energy demand, and improve customer satisfaction; and 3) how water consumers change their behavior given detailed information about their water use. This information is critical in identifying opportunities for conservation, forecasting demand, and determining how water use patterns may change over time in response to population growth, demographic shifts, and technology improvements. CIWS will advance understanding of water use behavior, the cyberinfrastructure for smart metering, and the pool of "cyber-savvy" professionals and students capable of implementing smart metering, all of which are critical for realizing the promises of smart metering. Mentorship will be provided for a new generation of engineers and scientists who will receive training and engage in research that prepares them to leverage new cyberinfrastructure. Water users will be directly engaged in data collection and information transfer. Hundreds of USU students will engage in a campus "Water Wars" competition aimed at water conservation and sustainability using cyberinfrastructure developed by this project. Logan City and USU Facilities will be integral partners in data collection. Finally, graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged in a visualization challenge using continuous flow data from residential water meters. These efforts will involve participants from underrepresented groups in undergraduate research through targeted recruiting using existing programs at USU.</AbstractNarration>
