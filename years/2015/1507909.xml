<AbstractNarration>These awards by the Macromolecular/Supramolecular/Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to Christine Aikens (Kansas State University), Ken Knappenberger (Florida State University), and Chris Ackerson (Colorado State University) develop the ability to predict how metal particles with dimensions on the order of one-billionth of a meter (i.e., nanoparticles) interact with light. Such metal nanoparticles may, in the long term, become functional components in solar-to-electric energy conversion devices, optical sensors, and medical diagnostics and therapeutics, among others. Currently, the lack of understanding how light provokes energy flow through these materials limits their applications. The collaborative team combines cutting-edge theoretical and experimental spectroscopy along with precision nanoparticle synthesis and characterization. They facilitate their multi-disciplinary research project by developing graduate student training courses focused on modeling, measurement, and preparation of structurally precise photonic nanoparticles. The team is also strongly engaged in outreach to K-12 students and educators; is actively involved in incorporating research into the undergraduate curricula at each of their respective universitie;, and is committed to the involvement of underrepresented students in scientific research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary thrusts of this effort are to determine how electronic energy relaxation affects the nanophotonic properties of structurally precise metal nanoparticles in the 1-2 nm size domain. The research features an emergent class of nanophotonic materials: monolayer-protected clusters (MPCs), which can be synthesized and isolated with atomic precision. These materials represent an intermediate class of materials between bulk metallic materials and smaller photo-excited molecules.  The program of study provides nanoparticle-specific descriptions for fundamental processes involved such as electron-phonon coupling, which are critical for determining the functional properties of nanophotonic materials. The research investigates the interplay between MPC structural parameters and electronic relaxation. The specific objectives are: 1) to determine the mechanisms of electron-phonon and electron-vibrational coupling and their influence on the electronic relaxation dynamics of Au25(SR)18 MPCs, where SR is an alkanethiol; 2) to understand the effects of metal doping on MPC dynamics; 3) to describe how electron-phonon coupling changes with increasing MPC dimensions; and 4) to investigate the influence of MPC ligand band structure on electron dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this work is to understand how the properties of gold and silver nanoclusters can be controlled by changing the ligands that stabilize these systems or by changing the elements included in the core of the nanoparticle (i.e. doping or alloying the nanoparticle).  In particular, the properties of interest in this work include the electronic structure, optical absorption, luminescence, and excited state electron-nuclear dynamics in the nanoclusters.  These properties are of significant utility because of their use in applications such as biosensors and as solar energy photosensitizers.  The nanoclusters of interest have precise stoichiometries and known structures, which enables precise theory-experiment agreement.  In our work, we examined the doping of noble metals and/or transition metals into silver and gold nanoclusters, and determined how this doping affects the relative energy levels of the orbitals in the nanocluster and the dynamics of the electrons that fill the orbitals.  We ascertained that most nanoclusters larger than Au25 have orbitals near the HOMO-LUMO gap that are primarily localized in the nanocluster core, so the photoexcitation and electron dynamics in these systems primarily involves transitions within the core and does not involve charge transfer to the ligands.  Nonetheless, we determined that the nuclear relaxation which occurs after photoexcitation depends on the ligand that stabilizes the nanocluster; minor effects were observed when an organic group on a thiolate ligand was changed, but greater effects were determined for systems when different head groups were used such as when phosphine ligands are used to replace thiolate ligands.  This work was disseminated at international, national, and regional conferences and to Ph.D.-granting and primarily undergraduate institutions.  Junior researchers (postdoctoral research assistants, graduate students, and undergraduate students) including many female students were actively involved in the research and learned how to collaborate with experimental groups, run calculations, and write and present research.
