<AbstractNarration>Over the past two decades, technological developments have made huge leaps in the speed, scale, and diversity of human communications. However, changes in human behavior occur at a much slower pace. In some cases, this has created a disconnection between how someone might think about communications media and the potential implications of utilizing those media.  There is perhaps no better example of communication technologies that have created an array of misconceptions about usage than online social networking sites (SNS) such as Facebook and Twitter. The confusion surrounding potential or real risks to privacy, the intended audience receiving communication through these sites, and the extent to which ?online? relationships are bleeding into relationships ?offline? have created a perfect storm where individuals are confused about how to portray themselves on these sites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this study is to evaluate how conceptions of privacy and social media audiences affect portrayals of identity on social media platforms.  In this study I will test a series of hypotheses related to conceptions of privacy, intended audience, and the potential overlap of offline/online contexts using survey data collected directly from two of the largest social networking sites, Facebook and Twitter. Paid advertisements will be used to disseminate links to the survey, giving all active users an opportunity to respond to the survey.  This method avoids the shortcomings of existing studies of this topic, which tend to use convenience-sampling methods. The broader impact of this study lies in providing a better understanding of how individuals are navigating relationships between offline and online contexts. Further, this study can provide new insight to organizations such as Facebook and Twitter to motivate changes that would be beneficial to social media users.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Jonathan Stringfield has completed research for his dissertation, titled "Identity and Audience in Social Media," supported by this NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant. In doing so he conducted a complex online survey on both Facebook and Twitter, and completed an exhaustive analysis of the data collected. The outcome of this study provides important insights into how users think about their own identity, audience, and the potential of privacy between them, and how social networking sites (SNS) yield new challenges for scholarly data collection that require special consideration.  Intellectual Merit  The ways that humans communicate are increasingly being altered by the proliferation of SNS. As much as these technologies have become woven into the fabric of society, how they impact the ways in which individuals interact remains not well understood. In particular, how complex sociological concepts such as identity performance, concerns about privacy, and assessing audiences have been studied with varying degrees of intensity, but largely as individual and isolated concepts. By considering the interaction of these concepts, a much more complex picture of how individuals use and think about SNS becomes clear. In doing so, this project makes an important contribution to the sociological study of online communities as well as how individuals communicate more generally in modern times.  Based upon separate surveys of Facebook and Twitter users, different motivators were evident in terms of whether or not the respondent displayed their true identity (where Twitter users were much more concerned with overall risks of using SNS, including having SNS interactions bleed into the respondent's "offline" life). This has important ramifications for future studies of SNS, including the fact that any given SNS platform represents only a single way in which individuals perform identity online, and that studies of multiple platforms must be conducted understanding that respondents may enact their identities differently between them.   The surveys showed that users of SNS report saying things on these platforms similarly to how they might say them face-to-face.
