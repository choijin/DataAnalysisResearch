<AbstractNarration>Speaker responses about language use in interview settings are often skewed towards formal and prescriptively sanctioned norms.    By collecting and analyzing video and audio recordings of everyday conversations, narratives, and routinized speech events including ancestor rituals, Alison Broach under the direction of Eve Danziger of the University of Virginia will create a corpus naturalistic Garifuna [cab] speech.  The data samples in the resulting corpus will have been only minimally affected by the data collection process.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Garifuna is an Arawakan language spoken in several Central American countries and on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent.  Broach will document the Guatemalan variety about which little has been written.  Garifuna is of interest because of its unique historical origins through which it has acquired both Carib and West African features.  Documenting Garifuna using both state-of-the-art ethnographic and language documentation methods, Broach will study in depth the morphological and lexical borrowings into Garifuna from Spanish and French, languages with which Garifuna is in close contact.  This data will then lead to an analysis of how Garifuna has changed over time, especially as Spanish and English replace Garifuna as the language of choice for member of the speech community.  Results will also inform ongoing Garifuna language revitalization efforts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Garifuna data will be archived at the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America and at LIBRA, an online open access repository for University of Virginia scholars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Garifuna is a Native American language spoken by members of the African diaspora in Eastern Central America. Like many minority languages around the world, the Garifuna language is under threat, and members of the Garifuna community have responded by creating educational and other programs to encourage younger people to return to their linguistic roots. The present  project examined the cultural models underlying both declining language  use and local revitalization efforts in the case of the Garifuna  language as spoken on the Atlantic Coast of Guatemala.   By combining the methods of language documentation and of anthropological ethnography, the project aimed to learn how Garifuna culture and language are being transmitted (or not), and to understand the factors that contribute to or are blocking that transmission.    Over  the course of 12 months of fieldwork in a Guatemalan town, the Co-PI for the project made observations, including video and  audio recordings, which document Garifuna ideas about life,  spirituality, and self, and which reveal the ways in which the Garifuna  language is important to Garifuna family construction and ethnic  identity.  In particular, the project identified several key cultural factors that contribute to the current situation of Garifuna language loss. For example, the importance of relationships with elders (including deceased ancestors, who reveal themselves to descendants during religious ceremonies involving spirit posssession), changing religious and spiritual practices, new patterns of economic out-migration and return to the community, an influx of non-Garifuna Guatemalans, and culturally specific ideas about the nature of learning all factor into the shift currently underway from Garifuna to Spanish.    Data and analyses from the project can be used by Garifuna language activists, who may choose to use our results to enhance existing language education programs -- perhaps by creating new programs that step outside of schoolroom formats and make the most of the unique relationship between language and culture in the Garifuna context. In the longer run, and with appropriate ethnographic investigation in each case, the combined linguistic and ethnographic approach adopted in this project constitutes a model for language revitalization efforts in many other communities.
