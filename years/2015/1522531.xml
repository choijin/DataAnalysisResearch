<AbstractNarration>This collaboration between Drs. Judith Habicht-Mauche at University of California, Santa Cruz and Andrew Duff at Washington State University examines ceramic technological practices and resources used to explore how emergent social networks enhanced the flow of information, material and people in the late precontact Southwest, transforming communities and identities in ways that continue to have relevance today. The Pueblo IV period (A.D. 1275-1400) was marked by a series of demographic upheavals that resulted in the formation of radically reconfigured social landscapes. The depopulation of long-occupied and densely settled regions instigated migrations that led to the displacement and reorganization of local communities and regional social networks. In areas that received a significant influx of new population, people from diverse ethnic, linguistic and cultural backgrounds came together to remake their social worlds. On the one hand, the Pueblo IV period appears to be a unique event in Pueblo history that led to many of the social formations and cultural identities that characterized the Southwest at European contact and that have largely endured to the present day. On the other hand, it is only one moment in a cycle of demographic reorganization and social negotiation that has characterized Pueblo societies from the beginnings of agricultural village life. The nature of Pueblo IV period reorganization,both what made it historically and structurally unique and what linked it to cycles of movement and culture change in the Southwest,remains a topic of central importance and anthropological inquiry. Archaeologists investigating this time period are interested in tracing migrant populations, in understanding how migrants merged with local groups to form multi-ethnic communities, in modeling how new social identities were negotiated and sustained, in documenting the emergence of novel social institutions and ritual practices and in understanding emergent systems of leadership and power. Data collected during this project will identify intra- and inter-regional trajectories of ceramic technological innovation and transfers of knowledge that illuminate subtle and complex interconnections among past and present populations. These connections trace both contact and movement of people, which have implications for contemporary Native American groups and public policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Habicht-Mauche and Duff will mobilize a variety of analytical techniques to characterize local "recipes" and sources of raw materials used to prepare glaze paints on pottery manufactured at Pueblo IV period sites in east-central Arizona and west-central New Mexico. The project will chemically characterize glaze-paint composition using LA-ICP-MS and isotopically source lead in glaze paint using dissolution ICP-MS. These data will be integrated with other extant regional glaze-paint databases. Relationships among composition and source will be evaluated using Social Network Analysis. Thus, data from this project will contribute to emerging macroregional models of how late precontact social networks facilitated the exchange of technical information and materials, created and sustained migration corridors, and served as arenas of social reproduction that transformed Pueblo society. This project will enhance understanding of the cultural history of the Native peoples of the Southwest, while also making broader intellectual contributions to anthropological studies of migration and the anthropology of technology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This collaborative project between archaeologists at Washington State University and the University of California, Santa Cruz, used chemical element and isotope analysis to chemically characterize &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; and the source of lead ores used to prepare glaze paints applied to pottery manufactured at late Prehispanic (ca. A.D. 1275-1400) sites in east-central Arizona (between modern St. Johns and Springerville, AZ). The resulting data helped fill in gaps in our Southwest region-wide understanding of this technology by providing information from what was a gap in spatial coverage. Through this work, we were able to demonstrate that recipes for the manufacture of lead-based paints were shared among groups occupying several different regions within the mountain areas of eastern Arizona, and these crosscut material culture traditions, suggesting that individuals with this technological knowledge&mdash;most likely Pueblo women, migrated between villages and shared knowledge related to pottery manufacture and decoration during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Additionally, isotope analysis suggests that the most likely sources of lead were from mines at Cerrillos (northeast of Albuquerque) and Hansonburg (east of Socorro, NM), which are approximately 150-170 miles east of the locations where the pottery was made. This research documented connections across large areas by residents of different communities in the preHispanic Southwest. At this time, we are uncertain if this represents material that was traded across these distances (more plausible) or if people made long-distance trips to acquire this ore, possibly while also visiting kin and colleagues resident in distant settlements (also plausible), or perhaps it was a combination of both processes. The project was able to involve a number of undergraduate and graduate students, who assisted with many of the laboratory analysis tasks, providing them hands-on experience working with research collections and with specialists from different disciplines. We have shared our results with our professional colleagues at conferences and are preparing reports of this research for publication, while also sharing it with students at our respective institutions when we teach. We will also share this information with Pueblo colleagues.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;I&nbsp;Duff</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
