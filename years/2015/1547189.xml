<AbstractNarration>A key element of cloud-based design and manufacturing is the notion of virtualization of software and hardware resources, which allows automated composition and delivery of manufacturing services to diverse communities of makers and supports a variety of manufacturing industries.  This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will investigate new architectures for such composable services in manufacturing  that seek to replace problematic and error-prone data translation by open communication and interoperability protocols.  If successful, the research will empower standardized open communication between variety of  software tools and manufacturing applications. This in turn should enable the virtualization of manufacturing services, leading to significant gains in efficiency, further fueling democratization of manufacturing, and empowering the culture of making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to demonstrate feasibility of the new approach by focusing on four specific tasks: (1) identifying key abstractions for modular representation of manufacturing knowledge, including shape, material, and physical information; (2) formalizing these abstractions in terms of computable functions (constructions and queries); (3) developing open protocols for interoperability and composition of services using the identified abstractions and functions; (4) investigating effectiveness of the architecture on selected use-case scenarios.  If successful, the results of the research will be used to develop a comprehensive research agenda on abstractions and architectures for open composable services in cyber-manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This EAGER project investigated a fundamentally new approach to  designing  cybermanufacturing systems that require seamless and automated interoperability between modeling, design, simulation, and manufacturing planning applications.   Exchanging files and converting formats in such applications does not provide adequate levels of interoperability,  due to syntactic and semantic differences of representations used in such systems.   As an alternative,  this project identified mathematical abstractions that are common across the full range of cybermanufacturing activities and developed a theory that would support exchanging, preserving, and maintaining such abstractions using computational functions called "queries".    The abstractions take on a concrete form in terms of various mathematical properties associated with physical artifacts, systems, and manufacturing processes.   In particular, such properties have been classifed for broad classes of geometric representations used in most computer-aided design systems today.   Theoretical results also established sufficient conditions for comparison and verification of the relevant properties and described an implementable algorithmic approach for enforcing them.  The  developed theory was successfully applied in several areas,  including CAD system interoperability,  verification of data exchange,   design-analysis interoperability, and multi-scale shape material modeling.    The project also identified a number of new promising research directions and supported development of research agenda in the new areas,  including interoperability in distributed cybermanufacturing ecosystem,  automated validation and configuration of system components,  and fully integrated multi-scale shape-material  systems with automated analysis.
