<AbstractNarration>The ECR program of fundamental research in STEM education provides funding in critical research areas that are essential, broad and enduring. EHR seeks proposals that will help synthesize, build and/or expand research foundations in the following focal areas: STEM learning, STEM learning environments, STEM workforce development, and broadening participation in STEM. The ECR program is distinguished by its emphasis on the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to (a) understand, (b) build theory to explain, and (c) suggest interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation. The motivational context for this project is that nearly all definitions of 21st century skills include some aspects of collaborative problem solving. Often the skills associated with such collaborations are treated separately. In this study the researchers will investigate these collaborative problem solving skills interactively. The research team will draw on process data automatically generated as students work in the virtual environments that support the learning of circuit design and electronics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical aspects of this research will use data mining techniques and expert judgment to validate the inferences of the PI team. In addition the project will engage two critically related components: (1) the development of  a generalizable schema that will measure student content and collaborative problem solving (CPS) skills in computerized educational environments, and (2) the construction and validation of diagnostic student profiles generated by the schema.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Collaborative problem solving (CPS) has been identified as one of the most important skills for the 21st century workforce; however, only recently has research begun to focus to a greater extent on measuring CPS skills.
