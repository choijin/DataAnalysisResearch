<AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project focuses on the development of a utility-driven energy service platform. Since buildings consume a large fraction of society's total energy usage, even modest improvements in building energy efficiency have the potential to yield significant benefits.  In recent years, utilities have deployed tens of millions of smart electric meters that record building energy usage over short intervals (e.g., every few minutes).  While the original purpose of smart meters was to support basic utility operations (e.g., automated meter reading), this project uses them as the foundation for developing a new class of smart energy service systems.  Specifically, the project focuses on analyzing the vast amount of data available from utility smart meters and other networked sensors to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and the electric grid.  The research is utility-driven, since utilities have i) access to massive amounts of customer energy data, ii) a way to deliver the results of analytics to customers, and iii) strong incentives to improve customer energy efficiency (e.g., by reducing peak demand to reduce their own operational costs).  The approach is scalable, since it leverages already available building smart meter data, rather than requiring the installation of new smart devices and control systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop utility-driven smart energy services to improve grid energy efficiency, encourage energy conservation, and promote the local renewable energy sources, such as rooftop solar. The research methodology includes developing new energy analytic techniques for smart meter data, combining these in novel ways to create specific applications that improve energy efficiency, packaging those applications as cloud-based web services that are accessible to end users, and evaluating their impact on user behavior and energy efficiency.  In particular, the project will develop three specific smart energy service systems:  i) iProgram to determine optimal thermostat schedules by analyzing smart meter data, ii) Green Demand Response (Green-DR) to opportunistically schedule elastic loads to align with renewable energy generation, and iii) PowerTrip to provide real-time energy event notifications and suggested conservation actions to users.  The project will implement a prototype of each system and evaluate them on real-world data (rendered anonymous) from 18,000 smart meters.  The research follows a human-in-the-loop model that integrates technical and user behavioral research in the design and implementation of smart energy services. Thus, the project includes user studies to assess each service's behavioral impact on users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts stem from the project's industrial partnerships with a local utility, a premier research lab (Microsoft Research), a small startup company (Budderfly), and an environmentally-conscious non-profit (WattTime.org).  These partnerships will expose students to industry perspectives on addressing real-world energy-efficiency problems, and interdisciplinary research that spans technical and behavioral disciplines.  The project will enable sustainability-aware curriculum, undergraduate REU projects, and sustainability-focused outreach efforts to local K-12 students through the newly established Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lead institution is the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  The primary industry partner is Holyoke Gas and Electric (HG&amp;E)) (Holyoke, MA), a municipal utility.  Primary academic partners are the University of Maryland-Baltimore County (Baltimore, MD) and Williams College (Williamstown, MA).  Broader context partners are Microsoft (Redmond, WA), a large business, WattTime.org (Berkeley, CA), a non-profit, and Budderfly (Shelton, CT), a small business.</AbstractNarration>
