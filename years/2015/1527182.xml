<AbstractNarration>This project will create a solid science base for computer-based conversational decision systems, by integrating psychological decision theories with an experiential understanding of human decision-making, having the potential to impact many domains.  People make mundane and critical consumption decisions daily, ranging from what air conditioning filters to buy to which health insurance plan to enroll. Rational choice theory predicts that consumers can make choices to maximize their desired attributes. However, human cognitive limitations coupled with decision complexities often require people to develop preferences quickly and employ multiple decision strategies to arrive at a choice. Sub-optimal consumption decisions hurt the individual, the family, the economy, and the nation. This project will enhance people's abilities to make informed decisions on-the-go, when they lack domain knowledge, time and cognitive resources for optimal decision-making. These benefits are particularly relevant to aging users, those with cognitive, perceptual and motor impairments, and those functioning in multitask environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past research on decision aids has focused on single-decision strategies using invariant algorithms, falling short of solving real decision problems, which are inherently contingent on the decision-maker and task. Further, benefits of a mobile, conversational setting have been under-employed in developing decision aids. The goal of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate conversational, mobile decision-aids (MODA) for consumption decisions based on adaptive, intelligent information retrieval and decision strategy use.  The three main scientific objectives and methods are: 1. Capture rich spoken dialog between consumers and service associates as they go through different types of decision-making strategies in a physical store, using observational studies.  2. Develop a decision inference and dialog management model that (a) uses inputs from spoken consumer interactions, (b) applies decision inference rules to predict the consumer's decision strategy, (c) tailors MODA's subsequent dialog to their decision strategy, and (d) informs the consumer's decision-making process with data retrieved from product specifications and reviews.  3. Conduct field experiments to assess MODA effectiveness with respect to cognitive, social, and decision outcomes among varied decision-contexts and user characteristics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>People make consumption decisions every day. Rational choice theory predicts that consumers can make choices that maximize their desired attributes, weighted by importance. However, human cognitive limitations coupled with decision complexities often distract consumers from relying solely on a rational decision strategy. Rather, consumers use constructive choice processes, where they form <em>decision preferences</em> (e.g., what attributes are desired and how important they are) on the spot and switch among multiple <em>decision strategies</em> to arrive at a choice. Existing research on intelligent decision-aids has focused on single decision strategies using invariant algorithms. Further, the benefits of a conversational, mobile setting have been under-employed in developing intelligent decision-aids. Addressing these knowledge gaps, the goal of this project was to design, develop, and evaluate conversational, mobile decision-aids (MODA) for consumption decisions, with the capability for intelligent information retrieval and decision strategy use, which is adaptive to the <em>decision-maker </em>and the <em>decision object</em>.</p> <p>This project was a collaboration among consumer and computer scientists. We developed the Human-Elaboration-Object-Construal (HEOC) Contingency Model (see Fig. 1), which predicts four common decision strategies based on the contingencies of a) the decision-maker's <em>elaboration </em>level (i.e., whether or not they are able and motivated to think elaborately about the decision) and b) the mental <em>construal</em> of the decision object (i.e., whether the decision is framed with a focus on abstract attributes [e.g., durability of an air filter] or concrete alternatives [e.g., Honeywell air filter models A vs. B]). The project was executed in an air filter purchase decision context. Rich spoken dialog between consumers and human agents was captured while consumers went through different types of decision strategies to select air filters in a simulated physical store environment with a human agent's assistance. Through a comparison of this dialog with consumers' product review language obtained from retail websites, rules were generated for classifying the elaboration and construal levels from a consumer's dialog input to model MODA's intelligence to understand the decision strategy employed by the consumer, based on the HEOC Contingency framework. We designed and developed a MODA system, implemented as a conversational mobile app (see Fig. 2), which 1) applied the HEOC-based rules to infer consumers' decision strategy from their spoken input, 2) retrieved strategy-relevant product intelligence (e.g., product specifications, reviews, ranks), and 3) tailored MODA response dialog to the inferred decision strategy and the retrieved product intelligence. In doing so, MODA informed and supported the consumer's decision-making process. MODA's high accuracy in predicting decision strategies was confirmed through a series of system evaluation tests. Results from user evaluation tests (see Fig. 3) with 125 consumers revealed that MODA enhanced consumers' enjoyment of the decision-making process to the same extent that a human agent did. MODA was particularly effective as a cognitive aid for older consumers (65+ years old) and consumers with low product knowledge; older consumers' perceived ability to process complex product information was elevated by MODA to an equal or superior level to that of younger consumers, while the information load felt by consumers with low product knowledge was significantly reduced by MODA's assistance.&nbsp;</p> <p>This project integrates psychological decision theories with an experiential understanding of human decision-making to create a solid science base for conversational decision systems that has the potential to impact many domains. A critical intellectual merit of this project lies in moving from an <em>Outcome- to a Process-Centric Approach</em> in decision-aids. Significant previous work has focused on accuracy of recommendations generated by decision-aids and the user's acceptance of these recommendations, representing an outcome-centric approach. This project differs critically from previous work in that our goal was to inform and extend human decision-making 'processes' through intelligent and adaptive information retrieval to augment the user's <em>natural</em> decision strategy, representing a process-centric approach. This project made advances to conversational artificial intelligence (AI) systems by moving beyond the <em>Technology to a Context-Focused Approach</em> in development by building critical contextual knowledge that expands the natural language understanding capability of a conversational AI system.</p> <p>Sub-optimal consumption decisions hurt the individual, the family, the economy, and the nation. Findings of this project will enhance people's abilities to make informed decisions on-the-go, when they lack domain knowledge or time and cognitive resources for optimal decision-making. These benefits are particularly relevant to aging users, those in unfamiliar decision environments, and those functioning in multitask environments. The research team's ongoing collaborations with both aging constituents and those with knowledge or cognitive constraints will help inform the project and disseminate its finding to benefit these constituents directly. Beyond consumption, the project will also have wide-ranging applicability to other decision-making contexts such as healthcare, education, finance, business, and defense. The mobile platform will also allow for ease in adapting the decision-aids to other wearable or IoT devices, expanding the potential for application in a wide range of decision-making environments.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/22/2019<br>      Modified by: Wi-Suk&nbsp;Kwon</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1527182/1527182_10391132_1574291424572_Fig.2MODAappinterface--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1527182/1527182_10391132_1574291424572_Fig.2MODAappinterface--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 2.
