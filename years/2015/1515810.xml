<AbstractNarration>Modern approaches to data analysis often involve network structures. For example, the spread of an epidemic in a specific population can be described using a contact network representing the nature and strength of interpersonal interactions among individuals. Historically, these models were intractable due to the complexity of individual behavior and, therefore, many early disease models utilized simplified representations involving population averages and statistics. By differentiating individuals, network models carry a large amount of additional information that has become more accessible thanks to increasingly powerful computer processors and the advent of fast computational algorithms. This project develops new mathematical theories and computational algorithms to capture the essential features of networks and applies them to models in epidemiology. Results from this project will allow researchers to identify a number of valuable patterns in the data, including the subpopulations at highest risk, vulnerable transmission pathways, and effective mitigation strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his colleagues study the mathematical concept of p-modulus on networks, focusing on the analysis of theoretical properties, the development of numerical algorithms, and the study of applications to the spread of diseases in contact networks. This is an interdisciplinary project intended to enhance both the theoretical understanding of the ways in which diseases spread in an interconnected network of individuals or sub-populations, and the computational tools available to researchers interested in modeling, simulating, and predicting the behavior of epidemics. The theory of p-modulus was originally developed in the field of complex analysis and has a connection to the concept of effective resistance in the context of electrical networks. The p-modulus provides a method for quantifying the richness of a family of walks: families of many short walks have a larger modulus than families of few long ones. Therefore, the flexibility of p-modulus provides a means for extracting fine structure characteristics of linked data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this project was the development of  mathematical theory and computational tools that can provide a better  understanding of disease spreading in complex populations.  Rather than  using more simplified models wherein the probability of an individual  becoming infected is related solely to the infectiousness of the disease  and the percentage of the population already infected, the PIs  considered more detailed models based on contact networks.  In  this approach, one seeks to more accurately model disease spreading by  incorporating individual connections into the model; the disease can  only spread between two individuals if they come into contact with one  another.  In other words, the population is not treated as a homogeneous  mixture of identical individuals.  Instead, some individuals may be  more influential than others in spreading the disease.  In this context, the PIs had three objectives.    1. To  develop the mathematical theory of p-modulus (a general tool for  studying the structure of networks) in order to better understand what  it can say about contact networks. 2. To develop efficient computer algorithms, based on p-modulus, for studying contact networks. 3. To study the implications of p-modulus applied to disease spreading and epidemics.  The  project has direct impact on the field of applied mathematics,  specifically on the subfields of applied graph theory, optimization  theory, and numerical methods.  More broadly it also has implications  for the study and mitigation of disease spreading.  Specific outcomes of  the project include the following.    1. A systematic  theoretical treatment of the mathematical concept of p-modulus applied  to networks.  This led to a number of mathematical tools for uncovering  hidden structure within complicated networks.  Since network structures  are ubiquitous in applied mathematics, these tools are relevant to a  wide range of applications beyond disease spreading. 2. A  collection of numerical algorithms for efficiently computing p-modulus  and related quantities.  A large portion of this code has been released  to the public through GitHub, with more to be released over time as it  is collated and standardized. 3. A collection of computational  studies describing ways in which p-modulus can be used to describe,  predict, and mitigate the spread of diseases in a contact network.   Although application to real-world epidemic spreading was outside the  scope of this project, computer-simulated diseases did provide evidence  of the efficacy of the p-modulus approach.  Additionally, the  project had significant impact in training future researchers.  Ten PhD  students, three Masters students, and ten undergraduate students have  completed or will soon complete research projects related to this  award.  Results of this research have been published in fifteen journal  articles and reported at many conferences.       Last Modified: 12/02/2019       Submitted by: Nathan Albin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
