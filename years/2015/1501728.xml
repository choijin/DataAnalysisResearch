<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Laura Starkston is "Symplectic structures on smooth manifolds." The host institution for the fellowship is Stanford University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Yakov Eliashberg.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main scientific goal of this project was to advance the study of symplectic manifolds. These are geometric spaces that encode Hamiltonian mechanics.  The project successfully advanced knowledge of how surfaces can be entangled in 4-dimensional symplectic spaces, and showed that certain entanglings are impossible to achieve. The PI showed that some surfaces can be symplectically entangled in ways that cannot be described by polynomials, thus proving that symplectic geometry offers a greater flexibility than algebraic geometry.  In this project, the PI also introduced a new method of studying a longstanding open question about the classification of surfaces in the most fundamental symplectic space (the complex projective plane). The PI showed that this question can be answered using the study of Lagrangians and their Floer theory which have been a strong focus on research development in the last three decades.  The project also developed a new method of studying these complicated spaces, by breaking them up into simple pieces that resemble building blocks joined together along their edges and corners. The PI successfully showed that every 4-dimensional symplectic space with the Weinstein property can be broken down into these simple building blocks, and developed machinery to show how this decomposition can be performed.  Throughout this project, the PI has helped students in their discoveries and investigations of mathematics from the high school to doctoral levels, through outreach talks, workshops, mini-courses, and career advice. The PI remains committed to supporting a diverse group of mathematicians with a goal of closing the gender gap and promoting equal representation of minority groups.
