<AbstractNarration>This project is to organize and execute the annual principal investigator (PI) meeting for the National Robotics Initiative (NRI). The workshop will bring together all the PIs engaged in the NRI for a two day workshop to discuss research, educational initiatives, and methods for transition of results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop includes oral presentations by involved program managers, the PIs, a poster session with presentation of all sponsored projects, tutorials, and several keynote speeches. An important aspect of the workshop is program-wide networking and exploration of mechanisms to optimize the results of the overall initiative with respect to research, training, and societal impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NRI has been launched to pursue the scientific vision of co-robots --  systems that assist people in their daily lives at work, at home, and during leisure. The challenge of designing systems for these applications involves a broad set of disciplines from materials to artificial intelligence and cognitive science. Most projects cannot cover all of these disciplines. Consequently, it is of interest to leverage the annual PI meeting to facilitate cross-dissemination of results across projects and to illustrate examples of best-practices.  This year's PI meeting featured three poster sessions with over 160 posters presented in total.  Many of the posters are available online on the meeting's web site (http://nri2015.ri.cmu.edu/posters).  This year, we instituted a policy that required positive confirmation prior to posting the posters online, so only those who responded to our request for posting permission are available online.    The meeting also featured rapid fire presentations by all of the current NRI grantees -- 115 presentations total.  Each grantee was given a two minute slot to  share an overview of the goals and recent results of their project. Together with the coordinating poster sessions and social time during meals and breaks, these presentations facilitated the meeting's goal of sharing NRI research achievements among the grantees and participating government agencies.  These presentations were also shared with the NSF and the other NRI agencies.  In addition, some groups took advantage of the convergence of PIs to hold separate strategic meetings for specific agencies, such as the USDA.
