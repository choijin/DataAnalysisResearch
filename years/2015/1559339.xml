<AbstractNarration>The PIs will partner with the U.S. Department of Energy to hold two workshops focused on illuminating gaps and opportunities for regulatory and planning harmonization across North America.  The initial focus will be on how harmonize regulations and planning for electricity production and transmission across the US borders with Mexico and Canada.  One workshop will focus on US - Canadian issues, and will be held in Boise, Idaho on the campus of Boise State University.  The second workshop will consider US - Mexico issues, and will be held at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.  The PIs will also prepare background materials to summarize the current state of regulation and planning in Canada, Mexico, and the US in electricity production and transmission.  The workshops will provide a forum for developing the broader impacts for policy of economics and environmental science. The overall goal is to reduce cost, environmental damage, and risks to electric reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The background papers will cover three to five specific areas where the US may consider harmonizing regulation and planning across borders.  This includes three specific chosen topics: (a) the effects of air pollution and carbon dioxide regulations; (b) technical regulations and planning processes; (c) whether and how data sharing across borders will improve modeling and planning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award supported a number of research projects&mdash;led by researchers from Resources for the Future (RFF) and other institutions&mdash;designed to meet the goals and needs of the US Department of Energy and to expand the knowledge base around a range of important energy topics. Highlights of the work supported under this award include:  1)       North American Energy Workshops: RFF held two invitation-only workshops focused on illuminating gaps and opportunities for regulatory and planning harmonization on electricity production and transmission in North America (October 2015), and a subsequent workshop (October 2016) examining similar issues in the oil and gas sector.

The project team made substantial progress in improving the North American Natural Gas Model and in building relationships with Mexican government agencies in order to enhance the E4ST (electricity sector)-Mexico model.  3)       Systems Analysis in the Electricity Sector: The goal of this collaborative project between RFF and the Electric Power Research Institute was to provide insight into the benefits of a "systems analysis" approach for addressing electricity sector capacity planning decisions&mdash;with a broader goal of supporting more prudent and systematic consideration of model simplifications and tradeoffs between appropriate levels of temporal, spatial, and technical resolution. The project report offers insights to modelers assessing these tradeoffs and to consumers of model results as they evaluate outputs.  4)       Electricity Resource Adequacy Literature Review: This analysis examined the current resource adequacy structure in power markets, discussing the cumulative impact of emerging issues and illuminating potential adjustments required to ensure that regional power markets can continue to provide affordable and resilient power while accommodating the need for low-carbon generation sources.  5)       The Implications of Electric Generating Unit Decommissioning Options: Hundreds of large power plants have been decommissioned in recent years, with hundreds more to come over the next decade. The goal of this project was to identify the key issues faced by power plant owners when they decide to decommission facilities, as well as how those issues may differ across fuel type. A project report outlines the key decisions, costs, challenges, and opportunities associated with decommissioning.  6)       Energy Security Implications of Premature Coal Mine Closure: Coal mine closures and the resulting employment loss in rural areas have become salient issues for all levels of government. The project team analyzed data on coal mine and power plant operation to estimate the impact of market and regulatory factors on coal mine profitability and closure.  7)       Temperature Impacts on Electricity Demand for Cooling (aka Climate Resilience System Analysis): The goal of this project was to develop intermediate modeling inputs to better assess the vulnerability of the electric system to a different climate regime, specifically focused on the effect of higher air temperatures. This research resulted in technical inputs that are designed to be broadly applicable to the community of energy system model tools. These inputs will enable models to more realistically simulate how future temperature change creates operational constraints or penalties on generation technologies as well as changes in demand, in order to then better assess climate resiliency.  8)       Energy Security Valuation in the United States: RFF researchers and other authors contributed significant expertise and writing to a US government report designed to evaluate and define United States energy security to reflect modern domestic and global energy markets and the collective needs of the United States and its allies and partners.  9)       Oil Security Premium Modeling: Through this project, a multi-institution research team generated and presented new estimates for the US oil security premium, an important figure used in federal rule-making, with a focus on the macroeconomic disruption effect.
