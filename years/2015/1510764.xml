<AbstractNarration>1510764(Vidic)/1509086(Flora)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent breakthroughs in directional well drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and reservoir stimulation have enabled economical production of oil and natural gas from low-permeability shale formations. Combined with favorable oil and gas prices, these technological developments encouraged a vigorous pursuit of energy independence by the US. It is expected that the extraction of natural gas will increase by more than 100% in the next 15 years. One of the key environmental concerns is the accumulation of naturally occurring radioactive material during wastewater reuse and the lack of ultimate solutions that would address this problem once the wastewater reuse is no longer feasible. This study is designed to provide comprehensive understanding of the fate of naturally occurring radioactive material brought to the surface from deep geologic formations during storage and recycling of produced water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study focuses on fundamental experimental and modeling research necessary to advance understanding of the fate of naturally occurring radioactive material in deep geologic formations while maintaining its relevance to transformative engineering solutions in the control of naturally occurring radioactive material for successful water management strategy in oil and gas industry. Fundamental understanding of rock-water interaction that will be developed in this study will facilitate development of technical solutions to enable control of naturally occurring radioactive material in produced water. The combined experimental and modeling expertise of this research group will ensure deep understanding of key factors governing the fate of naturally occurring radioactive material in water treatment processes that use chemical precipitation and will have far-reaching consequences for oil and gas industry by facilitating science based solutions to address key environmental concerns that have led to significant public opposition in many parts of the world. The proposed study will attain fundamental scientific understanding of the phenomena that are relevant to other industries besides oil and gas (e.g., mining, nuclear) and will ensure more sustainable water management strategies by those industries. Water management solutions developed in this study will also provide impetus for the development of new solutions in other industries that are facing challenges with the control of radioactive elements. Educational impact will be accomplished through training students in rich, multidisciplinary environment to develop problem-solving skills that are transferable to any field. This project will be showcased at regional high schools though exciting and interactive hand-on experience that sparks interest in advancements in S.T.E.M. disciplines. Findings of this study have implications for world energy supply, while better understanding of fundamental processes will spur development of new technologies for water treatment.</AbstractNarration>
