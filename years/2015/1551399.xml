<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. John Marston, Anna Goldfield will undertake research to study how Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans (AMH) butchered prey carcasses to extract bone marrow and bone grease during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic (~300-12 thousand years ago) in southwest France. There is currently little academic consensus regarding the biological, cognitive, and cultural nature of Neanderthals and their replacement by AMH in Europe approximately 40,000-35,000 years ago. Differences in diet, hunting behavior, and resource use are among the major factors discussed as components of AMH success in Europe. Human diet is a crucial element of archaeological research into human prehistory and evolution, because it is a representation of cognition and behavior for which there is the most physical evidence, including the skeletal remains of animals hunted as prey. Animal bones are an excellent source of data for subsistence strategies in the Paleolithic because they are abundant and well preserved in many Middle and Upper Paleolithic archaeological sites. The research has contemporary significance because through comparison with the Neanderthals, human's nearest relatives, it is possible to gain insight into fundamental behaviorial aspects of our species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study addresses Neanderthal and AMH exploitation of bone marrow and bone fat, crucial nutritional resources during glacial periods in Paleolithic Europe. Goldfield will analyze animal bones from two Middle Paleolithic Neanderthal faunal assemblages (c. 70,000-50,000 years ago), two early Upper Paleolithic AMH assemblages (c. 35,000-40,000 years ago), and one later Upper Paleolithic AMH assemblage (c. 18,000-12,000 years ago). She will address questions of how Neanderthals and AMH prioritized and obtained important food resources such as meat, bone marrow, and bone grease from the carcasses of their prey. This study will combine traditional zooarchaeological analysis with a new coding system to characterize and quantify bone processing within each assemblage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research is the Perigord region of southwest France, which has a rich and well-documented Middle and Upper Paleolithic archaeological record, with abundant and well-preserved animal bone assemblages. The types of animal body parts in each assemblage included in the study and the fragmentation of these bones will highlight differences and patterning in the ways in which Neanderthals and AMH processed their prey. These differences will indicate whether AMH spent more time and effort extracting bone fats from individual carcasses than Neanderthals, a behavior which may have provided AMH with an evolutionary advantage. The study's use of consistent coding methods will allow important inter-site comparisons that will expand the applicability of this research into other geographical regions where Neanderthals and AMH are known to have overlapped. This will provide the opportunity to explore whether differences in Neanderthal and AMH resource use are universal, or are driven by other factors such as climate or geography. All primary data obtained during analysis will be stored permanently and made publicly accessible. Results will be disseminated through peer-review journals, conference papers, and field reports. Finally, Goldfield will incorporate the framework of this study into an illustrated handbook of archaeological field methods, with the aim of engaging students aged 12-18.</AbstractNarration>
