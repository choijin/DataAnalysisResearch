<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for REU Site: Research Challenges of Identifying Integer Sequences Using the OEIS, at Muhlenberg College.  Projects make an effective use the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as a resource tool, and provide glimpses into future.  The research impact of the OEIS across disciplines continues to grow. Applications of the  to the life sciences, physical sciences, and earth sciences abound. The OEIS has also impacted research in scientific and engineering fields beyond the mathematical sciences. There are currently more than 3,000 papers and books in many areas of mathematics, computer science, and many other branches of science that reference and/or acknowledge the OEIS. The large number of citations and links to OEIS attests to its impact on advancing many areas of active research and its appeal to a broad multidisciplinary community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual focus of this research concentrates on the important role sequences play in mathematics, as well as their contributions to other fields. The program will contribute to the OEIS knowledge base through projects that are influenced by recent developments and tackle challenges of mathematical and scientific discovery inspired by integer sequences. These challenges include experimentation by developing computational algorithms and meta-algorithms through the use of computers. The methodologies applied to these challenges have come to be loosely defined as "rigorous experimental mathematics" and have proven effective in developing conjectures in areas that include number theory, algorithmic and enumerative combinatorics, combinatorial number theory, and many other mathematical fields. Our program aims to prepare students to become the next generation of mathematical scientists efficient in researching sequences and their applications through the OEIS database, the most successful of whom will have the capacity to look to the OEIS for inspiration. We will nurture this capacity by highlighting the contributions to the mathematical sciences of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. A particular emphasis of our program will be to discuss the important role the OEIS has played in developing conjectures in areas that include number theory, algorithmic and enumerative combinatorics, combinatorial number theory, and many other mathematical and scientific fields, as well as the tools necessary for identifying such conjectures.</AbstractNarration>

Our program nurtures this capacity by introducing undergraduates to the research impact of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The program aims to ?publicize the OEIS among a cadre of students and early-career researchers to help establish it as a tool in their ?research arsenal.?? Establishing the OEIS as a ?tool in the research arsenal? of undergraduate students will encourage continuing their education into graduate school and help train the next generation of OEIS database users. We achieve this goal by involving mentors from different areas of the mathematical sciences, by integrating activities with nearby related industries, and by leveraging Muhlenberg College?s position within the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges (LVAIC). In addition to students funded by this NSF grant, the Muhlenberg College REU program includes independently funded students that enhances the cultural diversity and educational impact of the program.</p> <p>The broader impacts of our Research Experiences for Undergraduates program come from informing students about their future education and career choices.
