<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Carl Gottlieb and Dr. Michael McCarthy will isolate and identify oxygen-bearing species that play key roles in chemical reactions which are ubiquitous on Earth, occurring both in the atmosphere and in hydrocarbon combustion. To meet this challenge, new diagnostic tools will be developed to simultaneously analyze mixtures of gases that contain many chemical compounds rapidly. The work will allow chemical models with greater predictive power to be developed for our atmosphere and combustion. The project will also lead to improved analytical gas sampling techniques, which has practical implications to human health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the characterization of elusive reactive intermediates that are produced in many reactions involving oxygen, ozone, and the OH radical. These studies will establish the existence of the key intermediates by using sensitive high-resolution rotational spectroscopy, and provide insights into their formation and molecular structure. Synergistic collaborations with leading experimental and theoretical groups here and abroad will enhance many of the proposed investigations. Technological innovation is an integral component of the work, and efforts to develop automated, "library-free" approaches to identify entirely new chemical compounds will be developed. Activities of potential societal benefit include an extensive education and outreach program with partners that entails an interactive traveling exhibit to three New England venues; the introduction of students to new experiences in science, engineering and mathematics; and a student visitor program. These programs will reach public audiences and underrepresented groups, and serve as an excellent vehicle for teaching, training, and learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project led to the identification, structurally characterization, and quantification of key intermediates and products in hydrocarbon oxidation.  Hydrocarbons are central to combustion and are emitted in large quantities by vegetation into the atmosphere were they processed further and influence air quality and the Earth's energy balance.  As such, the studies pursued here have improved our understanding of chemical pathways and reaction mechanisms which in turn allow theoretical models with greater predictive power to be developed.       A parallel program of instrumental refinement and technical innovation has been undertaken during this project. For example, a buffer gas cell cooled within a few degrees of absolute zero was shown to be a promising general purpose analytical tool.  In one application, product branching ratios of a simple but highly exothermic reaction were determined in near real-time by a simple and direct measurement. In another application, liquid and solid samples were analyzed.  Taken together, these experiments illustrate the generality of this new tool, and its potential utility in assessing sample purity and reaction efficiency.     New analysis tools were also developed which allowed entirely new chemical compounds that have never been the subject of prior experimental or theoretical study to be rapidly identified in a complex mixture.  In one study more than 160 different compounds were detected, many for the first time,  The simulatenous detection of such a large number of compounds rivals and arguably surpasses the sophistication of mass spectrometry, the most widely used analytical tool today.  Detection of multiple isomers, that is compounds with the same number of atoms of each element but distinctly different arrangements of atoms in space, along with the abundance of each highlights the sensitivity and degree of sophistication of rotational spectroscopy when combined with new analysis tools.     Because this work is interdisciplinary and collaborative,  it has served as an excellent vehicle for training and learning with frequent participation by undergraduate students. Exposure to a wide range of experiences provides these early career scientists with both the expertise and problem-solving skills to successfully transition to the next stage in their careers.
