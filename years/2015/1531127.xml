<AbstractNarration>By the end of the decade, the US Department of Transportation (DOT) will likely require all new vehicles to be Connected Vehicles (CV), capable of communicating with other vehicles and roadside infrastructure through wireless communications in order to reduce the number of crashes and save lives. The crash avoidance applications supported by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity exchange safety critical information such as speed, location and direction of movement to assess the crash risk based on the proximity of vehicles.  While standards such as Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) will play a key role, other technologies such as WiFi, LTE (cellular), or other emerging technologies, can lower overall systems cost as well as supplement the availability, coverage, and peak data rate requirements of DSRC-based systems.  The South Carolina Connected Vehicle Testbed (SC-CVT) is located along a 10-mile segment of Interstate I-85 near Clemson's International Center for Automotive Research (ICAR) campus in Greenville South Carolina.  Two specific example CV applications that will be developed are traffic incident detection and queue warning. These two applications provide a convenient starting point for illustrating how CV applications can benefit from advanced network technology that integrates multiple wireless technologies in a CV system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) are networks that integrate and exploit multiple concurrently available networking technologies. For critical applications requiring resource allocation optimization in order to meet safety-driven performance requirements. This project is using a combination of Software Defined Networking, local computing provided by GENI racks, and control based on statistical learning theory to demonstrate optimized HetNet operation on the SC-CVT.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Leveraging ongoing NSF-funded wireless infrastructure research projects at Clemson University, and partnering with the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SC DOT), we developed, deployed, and operated a testbed on Clemson’s main campus to facilitate connected vehicle research.  We refer to the testbed as the South Carolina Connected Vehicle Testbed or SC-CVT.  The testbed includes a 1.3 mile stretch of road that circles the main campus providing community research infrastructure to support faculty and student research in systems research or domain research such as Connected and Autonomous Vehicles and IoT.   SC-CVT is an edge computing system consisting of edge nodes, vehicular nodes, and system nodes.   Four edge nodes are deployed along a road that circles Clemson’s main campus (called Perimeter Road).  Edge nodes are packaged in ruggedized outdoor containers and use power over ethernet to provide power and backhaul connectivity. An edge node consist of  a general purpose embedded Linux computer (an Intel NUC),  a standards-based DSRC/WAVE Road Side Unit (RSU),  an internal ethernet switch for interconnecting components.    Three of the four edge nodes have fiber dropped to the light pole which supplies power and  backhaul connectivity. The fourth uses a dedicated WiFi channel operating in the 5 GHz band.   Edge nodes consist of multiple radios including a standards-based road side unit (RSU)  and multiple 802.11agn wireless radios.  For specific tests, we added 3GPP connectivity to several edge and vehicular nodes.  We have used two LTE systems.   We have used UE (USB dongles) from T-Mobile, Sprint, and Verizon.  We also extended our GENI wireless infrastructure deployment with additional 3GPP capability.  The starting point was 3 Airspan LTE base stations (BSs) with a  number of UE devices managed by the shared GENI EPC core software.  As a part of this ded purchasing a license for Airspan’s EPC core software, an Airspan  picocell LTE BS, and several UE devices that operate on the LTE system.      Project goals:  The major goals of the project included:  Infrastructure: Design, deploy, and validate an infrastructure that supports standards-based WAVE/DSRC applications on commercial equipment. Extend the wireless system with advanced technology such as a heterogeneous wireless system by adding WiFi and LTE.  Design, deploy, and validate several illustrative Connected Vehicular applications. Middleware:  Design, develop, and validate software that operates on all nodes in the system collectively forming an ad-hoc cloud.  The middleware represents a framework we have developed that supports emerging application systems.  Similar research efforts published in the literature might refer to this as a framework to support edge computing or Internet of Things (IoT).   Project outcomes:  Over 15 publications were directly or indirectly disseminated by this project. Published contributions focused on techniques that allow  compute/wireless systems along with critical applications to better perform in operating environments that involve impaired communications or unreliable sensing components. Community infrastructure was developed and made available to students/faculty at Clemson and collaborators from multiple Universities including Benedict College and the University of South Carolina.  The infrastructure was designed to enable research in connected and autonomous vehicular systems as well as in emerging areas including cooperative, highly mobile machines and cyber-physical IoT  systems.  We have shared our middleware system with peers and we will continue to make the system available to all that ask. We documented our project and results on our web site that is available to the public:   https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~jmarty/research/ConnectedVehicle/CAVResearch.html              Last Modified: 12/30/2020       Submitted by: James J Martin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
