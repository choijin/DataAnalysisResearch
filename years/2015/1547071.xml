<AbstractNarration>Improved estimates of seismic hazard are necessary to reduce the major human and financial losses suffered in earthquakes every year. The stress released during an earthquake (called the stress drop) controls the ground accelerations produced by the earthquake waves, and hence the damage potential. The stress drop is also fundamental to understanding and modeling the physics of the earthquake source, because it defines the energy budget. It is important to know whether stress drop varies from region to region, and with earthquake magnitude. This is because earthquake parameters and ground shaking measurements in regions of high seismicity are often used to estimate hazard in other regions that may have lower historic seismicity rate, for example regions with induced seismicity. However it is currently unknown how much stress drop really varies between earthquakes. The observed variability ranges over a factor of 100 to 1000, which poses significant challenges in interpreting stress drop results. It is often not clear how much of the variability comes from measurement uncertainties, and how much represents real regional variations in fault properties. The investigators will focus on the section of the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield, in central California, where there is a high rate of earthquakes, including distinct sequences of small repeating earthquakes, and the fault also creeps slowly. It is one of the best-instrumented sections of fault in the world. The award will aid the development of a new geophysics group at the University of Oklahoma by supporting a beginning-career female PI, and a graduate student. The student will have the opportunity to be an active participant in the research communities in both Boston and Oklahoma. The research activities will help to establish earthquake research in Oklahoma, a state with increased awareness of earthquake hazard due to dramatic increase in seismicity, and will be integrated into classroom activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large number of earthquakes and the long-term dense networks of seismometers make this region a natural laboratory for understanding earthquake source physics. The multiple-scale dense observational networks provide on-scale recordings for a wide magnitude range; the existing detailed research provides a well-defined context in which to interpret the results. The Investigators propose to apply multi-scale (both large- and small-scale) analysis methods to the dense dataset of earthquake waveforms aimed at resolving the continuing controversy regarding earthquake scaling and variability. The investigators will calculate the stress release for a large number of earthquakes in multiple ways, using different subsets of the data. The work will focus on three distinct questions: (1) Is the apparent scaling of stress drop an artifact of poor data with limited bandwidth, limited magnitude range, and inadequate correction for site and propagation effects? (2) Do the stress drops of repeating earthquakes at Parkfield change with time as a result of the change in strain rate from the 2004 M6 Parkfield earthquake? (3) What data quality and analysis requirements are needed to confirm that spatial and temporal variations observed here and in future studies are real? The proposed research will increase understanding of the earthquake source process, both at Parkfield, and beyond. The methods developed, and the greater understanding of their limitations and constraints should enable a higher resolution of earthquake source parameters, and hence seismic hazard maps, worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

The stress released during an earthquake (called the stress drop) controls the ground accelerations produced by the earthquake waves, and hence the damage potential. The stress drop is also fundamental to understanding and modeling the physics of the earthquake source, because it defines the energy budget. It is important to know whether stress drop varies from region to region, and with earthquake magnitude. This is because earthquake parameters and ground shaking measurements in regions of high seismicity are often used to estimate hazard in other regions that may have lower historic seismicity rate, for example regions with induced seismicity. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly clear in recent years that stress drop measurements contain large random and systematic uncertainties, making them hard to interpret, and limiting their usefulness. The goals of this award were to investigate how to better understand the effects of limited data, and resolution limit of inverted parameters. We focused on exceptionally well-recorded earthquakes, on a well-studied part of the San Andreas Fault, near Parkfield, California. We measured the source parameters in a variety of different ways, comparing surface and borehole recordings, and investigating the effects of using different frequency and magnitude ranges.</p> <p>We found that many earthquake source parameters are not as well resolved as is often hoped, and absolute values of stress drop are very hard to quantify. The relative values are much more reliable, and we were able to determine limits within which we observed consistent spatial and temporal stress drop variation using multiple methods.</p> <p>We were able to show how limited data and incorrect assumptions about depth-dependent attenuation can produce artificial apparent depth and magnitude dependence in stress drop measurements, and suggest tests to help future researchers better assess the resolution of their results. &nbsp;</p> <p>We were also able to resolve some real spatial and temporal variation in earthquake source processes, and show that spatial patterns are stable to local moderate earthquakes. We also found that repeating earthquakes are remarkably similar, rupturing in the same direction every time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The award supported an early-career female PI in establishing her new geophysics group at the University of Oklahoma, and assisted in funding 2 graduate students and one post-doctoral fellow.
