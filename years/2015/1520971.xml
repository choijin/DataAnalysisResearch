<AbstractNarration>The dynamics of central nuclear collisions involves simultaneous and nontrivial interactions of many nuclear constituents. Such interactions are a challenge for nuclear theory and are important for studies of the physics of the early Universe. Unfortunately, current descriptions of nuclear collisions rely on the semiclassical limit of the dynamics. Overcoming previous technical difficulties in the numerical implementation of the quantal theory of nuclear reactions, in this project the investigator and his collaborators will develop new strategies for the numerical implementation of this many-body theory in one and two dimensions, before attacking the realistic three-dimensional case. The resulting upgrade in software infrastructure for nuclear collisions will support the experimental program at the future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams currently under construction on the Michigan State University campus. The computational methods developed in this project are likely to benefit research in other fields, such as studies of electron transport across nanoscale electronic devices in electrical engineering, and will train the postdoc and student involved in cutting-edge computational techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop the computational framework for a quantal description of central nuclear collisions based on a nonequilibrium Green functions approach that is expected to open up the path towards a first-principles description of nuclear reactions. By following the quantal rather than the semiclassical evolution of many-body systems, the PI and his collaborators will reduce the level of uncertainty in the analysis of energetic collisions for the study of bulk nuclear properties, including the symmetry energy and the transport properties of matter. The successful completion of this project will provide useful tools for studies of head-on nuclear collisions and excitations of collective resonances, and will prepare the ground for future studies of collisions at finite impact parameter.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Central collisions of heavy nuclei are a testing ground for bulk nuclear properties, including the nuclear equation of state.  The mesoscopic character of these collisions leads to the formation of transient structures with unusual geometry.  At the same time, the mesoscopic scale competition in the collisions, such as between the de Broglie wavelength for nucleons and the nucleon mean free path, creates challenges for theoretical descriptions and calls for application of quantum transport.  While the required quantal transport is beyond the current computational means, in needing to incorporate the short-range correlations to account for equilibration observed in the collisions, we progress with that transport by first focusing on one dimension.  We develop there strategies and approximations that could be carried over to two and three dimensions.   Operating with the framework of nonequilibrium Green's functions under this project, we have developed a computational infrastructure for studying dynamics of correlated nonuniform systems in one dimension.  Inherent in this framework are effective interactions that we developed to make the properties of one dimensional systems mimic the properties of the nuclear systems in three dimensions.  Within the framework we arrive at correlated slabs in their ground states.  Without correlations a few lowest orbitals are occupied for the ground-state slabs and these have well defined single-particle energies.  With correlations, we find that all orbitals which are there in our calculations get some occupation.  We examine spectral functions for the slabs, that inform on the relation between momentum and energy for nucleons.  In the currently employed semiclassical transport in the literature, a firm relation is assumed between the momentum and energy.  In the mean-field theory a relatively narrow correlations is found.

We study oscillations for slabs, of neutrons against protons, when the species are given opposite jolts.  With mean field only, the oscillations of the species against each other persist with little damping.  When correlations are switched on, the oscillations diminish at a rapid pace.  We also started exploring collisions of the correlated slabs and observed an increased dissipation with inclusion of the correlations.  These different lines of exploration provide a semiquantitative assessment of the role of correlations under different circumstances.    Efforts to advance quantum transport using nonequilibrium Green's functions are pursued in many fields, including in electrical engineering in design of ever smaller transistors, in chemistry to understand conduction across molecular junctions and in the physics of early Universe.  We hope that our advances will benefit these other fields too.          Last Modified: 10/25/2019       Submitted by: Pawel D Danielewicz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
