<AbstractNarration>Engineering faces persistent challenges in recruiting and retaining students, particularly from underrepresented groups. The field is often perceived as an arcane, highly technical domain, an image that studies show does not resonate with all potential students and does not do justice to the potential contribution that this profession could make to solve 21st century problems. In addressing these connected challenges, engineering educators and professional bodies have invested considerable efforts towards changing perceptions of the field through research and public information campaigns. This project is examining where these perceptions, or narratives, about engineering come from, and in what ways do they exert an influence on the culture and educational practices of the field. The project draws on theory from complex systems sciences and the field of media studies to empirically investigate how collective, self-definitional narratives implicitly and pervasively shape the shared beliefs, explanations, and values that underpin the culture of engineering. By identifying and describing such exclusionary narratives, the project lays the empirical foundation for future work aimed at empowering engineering administrators, educators, and students to reach beyond the confines of narrow and limiting narratives about engineering and broaden the conversation about what engineering is, could be, and who participates in the important societal role of the profession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite ongoing efforts to diversify engineering, undergraduate programs continue to be characterized by a predominately white, male, and privileged population with a preference for objective, convergent, and quantitative ways of thinking. Drawing on complex systems theory, this project explores this apparent systemic resistance to change as rooted in mechanisms of social autopoiesis; that is, the tendency for complex social systems to reproduce themselves through self-definitional, persistent cultural patterns. According to systems theorists, these patterns are created and maintained through communication flows that are told, retold, and enacted in the system. Leveraging prior work on perceptions and public messages of engineering, this project combines a systems thinking theoretical framework with a narrative methodology to empirically examine how engineering narratives autopoietically shape, demarcate, and otherwise influence interactions at an institutional level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research design comprises the collection and narrative analysis of publicly available news articles and engineering education and practice reports published by key professional bodies, and the exploratory ethnographic observation and narrative analysis of information exchanges about engineering in an institutional context. The project will generate an empirically grounded, theoretically coherent understanding of the engineering education system as it is embedded in larger communication networks. More specifically, the goal is to develop a systemic understanding of the communication patterns that function to privilege certain understandings of engineering over others. By empirically identifying and explicitly naming these patterns, the transformative potential of this work lies in empowering engineering educators and other stakeholders to critically examine and consequently change the dominant narratives that shape the culture of our engineering programs, in their individual interactions and ultimately at the collective national level.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>According to policy analyst Emery Roe (1994), "the best way to find out the real problems in a complicated issue of many unknowns is not by asking directly 'What's the problem?' but rather 'What's the story?' behind the issue" (p. 9). In this project, we applied this thinking to the perceived problem of a lack of interest in studying engineering and the very real problem of a lack of diversity in the field. We asked two questions: How can stories help us to understand the persistent challenge of underrepresentation in engineering? And, can we leverage the power of stories to change the culture of engineering education to make it more welcoming to a broader cross-section of students?</p> <p>We investigated these questions in three steps. First, we used Roe's <em>Narrative Policy Analysis</em> approach to examine how engineering is portrayed in the public discourse - we qualitatively analyzed online news articles over a 1-year period. We identified five dominant ways that engineering and underrepresentation in engineering are discussed in the news media. We also mapped how these stories point to particular solution strategies, like the need to improve math and science education in K-12 (see model in Figure 1).</p> <p>What is perhaps most interesting about this model is what we didn't find. The absence of stories that speak to, for example, engineering for the common good, points to new opportunities for attracting a different kind of student to engineering. For instance, in contrast to the dominant stories illustrated in Figure 1, there were few calls in the news articles for engineers to tackle global challenges like carbon emissions, plastic in the oceans, or access to clean water. Other studies suggest that focusing on these challenges might attract more women and other underrepresented minorities to STEM fields.</p> <p>In the second step of our project, we used a novel research approach, autoethnography, to explore the impact, if any, these stories have on students' experiences of studying engineering in college. This part of the project was led by a first-generation college student. Autoethnography is an approach that involves self-reflection (auto) on a particular culture (ethno). This study confirmed that the dominant stories, which all share a common premise of the need for economic competitiveness, do not resonate with all students and may even, in some cases, discourage students from participating in engineering. This step of the study also emphasized to the research team the importance and potential transformative power of putting students in charge of telling their own stories about what it's like to study engineering. This insight informed the design of the third and final step in this project.</p> <p>In the last step, the two principle investigators and a team of five undergraduate student researchers used a cutting edge, mixed methods approach called SenseMaker to investigate how students experience studying engineering in undergraduate programs. SenseMaker is an online data collection and analysis platform that can be used to collect hundreds to thousands of micro-narratives - day-to-day stories that students might tell their friends or parents about what it's like to be an engineer. What's novel about this approach is that instead of researchers analyzing these stories, participants themselves, in this case students, analyze their own stories. The results from a SenseMaker study are visualizations of the data, like the "triad" presented in Figure 2.</p> <p>Here we can see students' answers to the question: "This story was about... Opportunity, Struggle, Conflict" - each student places their dot on the triangle according to how they view their story. Using the SenseMaker software, it's then possible to select individual dots and read the original stories these dots represent. Working with students, the research team examined the results to identify opportunities to, as the creators of SenseMaker put it, "create more stories like this and fewer stories like that." For example, we looked at the stories near the "opportunity" corner of the triad to see what they had in common and how we could create more experiences that students view as opportunities and fewer stories that students view as struggle. This is just one of six triads that were in the survey and shown here as an example of the transformative potential of this approach. Looking at the data in this way, teams of students made recommendations to engineering faculty and administrators to improve the undergraduate experience at their institution.</p> <p>In summary, this project explored how using stories as a way to understand the culture of engineering education can be a powerful way to find new solutions to the problem of underrepresentation in engineering. In future work, we will continue to explore how stories can be used to change systems of engineering education, with a particular focus on how students can tell and have control over their own stories.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/20/2020<br>      Modified by: Nicola&nbsp;W&nbsp;Sochacka</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531947/1531947_10391089_1582040078980_Dominantstories--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531947/1531947_10391089_1582040078980_Dominantstories--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Qualitative model of how engineering is portrayed in the news media"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531947/1531947_10391089_1582040078980_Dominantstories--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Qualitative model of how engineering is portrayed in the news media"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Qualitative model of how engineering is portrayed in the news media</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nicola Sochacka</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nicola&nbsp;W&nbsp;Sochacka</div> <div class="imageTitle">Qualitative model of how engineering is portrayed in the news media</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531947/1531947_10391089_1582040118952_SenseMakerexample--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531947/1531947_10391089_1582040118952_SenseMakerexample--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Example result from the SenseMaker� study"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531947/1531947_10391089_1582040118952_SenseMakerexample--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Example result from the SenseMaker� study"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Example result from the SenseMaker� study</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nicola Sochacka</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nicola&nbsp;W&nbsp;Sochacka</div> <div class="imageTitle">Example result from the SenseMaker� study</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
