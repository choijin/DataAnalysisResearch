<AbstractNarration>Handheld devices such as cell phones, tablets and wearables, are gaining&lt;br/&gt;rapid adoption in a ubiquitous world. Correspondingly, there is an&lt;br/&gt;explosion of very demanding and interactive applications such as media&lt;br/&gt;streaming, interactive games, video conferencing and social networking,&lt;br/&gt;that users are deploying on such devices. Despite tremendous&lt;br/&gt;improvements in the energy efficiencies of individual components found&lt;br/&gt;in these devices, piece-meal optimizations of hardware components are&lt;br/&gt;inadequate to accommodate the demanding needs of these applications that&lt;br/&gt;employ multiple CPU cores, accelerators, memory systems, system&lt;br/&gt;peripherals and sensors, concurrently in very sophisticated ways.  Lack&lt;br/&gt;of coordination among system resources leads to low resource utilization&lt;br/&gt;and poor system-level energy efficiencies when running such&lt;br/&gt;applications. Rather than throw more hardware at this problem, this&lt;br/&gt;project proposes VIADUCT, which allocates and orchestrates system-level&lt;br/&gt;resources to boost parallelism and resource utilization for these&lt;br/&gt;platforms in a more energy-efficient fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recognizing that many of these applications periodically process frames&lt;br/&gt;of data that need to flow in a pipelined manner through several hardware&lt;br/&gt;components within soft real-time bounds, VIADUCT creates a virtual&lt;br/&gt;channel per flow of such frames in an application. The channel holds&lt;br/&gt;resources allocated across all the hardware components, with runtime&lt;br/&gt;coordination to ensure seamless frame movements without the conventional&lt;br/&gt;interface inefficiencies across the components. Fine-grain scheduling&lt;br/&gt;and resource management leverages knowledge of high level semantics to&lt;br/&gt;provide Quality-of-Service (QoS) for each flow in the most&lt;br/&gt;energy-efficient fashion. The specific research contributions are in&lt;br/&gt;hardware interfaces, mechanisms and policies to chain the hardware&lt;br/&gt;components for creating a virtual channel for a flow, architecting the&lt;br/&gt;memory system as an efficient conduit to sustain this flow, and&lt;br/&gt;designing the system to sustain several concurrent flows. The project&lt;br/&gt;aims to provide a holistic evaluation testbed for such platforms amongst&lt;br/&gt;the broader research community, and also aims to involve&lt;br/&gt;under-represented groups in the research and enhance Penn State?s&lt;br/&gt;curriculum in related topics.</AbstractNarration>
