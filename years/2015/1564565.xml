<AbstractNarration>Wind energy has been growing steadily in the U.S. and worldwide in the past decades and it is projected to continue its growth in the near future. Wind energy has countless benefits: it is renewable and abundant, does not produce any harmful pollutant or greenhouse gas emissions, and is so technologically advanced that it is often economically competitive with other traditional energy sources. However, concerns are rising about possible undesirable effects of wind turbines in the lower boundary layer, especially on near-surface temperature. The literature is highly divided about what these effects could be. Numerical simulations have shown: warming during day and night; warming at night and cooling during the day; warming or cooling depending on atmospheric stability; cooling; and no significant effects. These contradictory findings highlight the inherent complexity of the feedbacks between wind turbines and atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only one mechanism, however, has been widely accepted (but never tested) to explain how wind turbines affect the lower boundary layer, namely that turbulence generated in wind turbine wakes enhances vertical mixing. Wakes are plume-like volumes downwind of wind turbines that are characterized by lower wind speeds and higher turbulence than the undisturbed upwind flow.  Enhanced vertical mixing would manifest as increased vertical momentum fluxes (thus increased wind shear) and increased turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) near the ground. The few observational campaigns that have measured changes in near-surface properties by wind turbines have been flawed or inconclusive and have not measured directly vertical momentum flux changes.  Therefore, no direct evidence of the enhanced vertical mixing mechanism is available today. In addition, enhanced vertical mixing does not explain all the observed effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The research hypothesis put forward in this project is that vertical mixing is generally not enhanced, but, more likely, reduced near the surface downwind of wind turbines.  The vertical wind profile is greatly altered due to the extraction of kinetic energy by wind turbines in the region around the rotor disk of diameter D spanned by the turbine blades, but the resulting wind shear near the ground is generally unaltered or reduced, not enhanced, below the rotor. Near-surface heat, moisture, and momentum fluxes, and eventually temperature, are therefore generally not directly affected by wake turbulence, but rather by a combination of the reduced, not enhanced, wind shear, atmospheric stability, and undisturbed flow properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To test this hypothesis, a combined observational and numerical approach will be carried out. The measurement campaign, named VERTEX for VERTical Enhanced MiXing, will be conducted near the University of Delaware Gamesa 2-MW wind turbine in Lewes, using 12-15 surface flux towers, a 60-m meteorological towers, and 2 scanning lidars. VERTEX will quantify changes in momentum and heat fluxes, air temperature, and TKE near the ground due to the wind turbine.  The interactions between the wind turbine and the atmospheric flow will be simulated with at least two state-of-the-art numerical codes that can resolve the details of the turbulent wake down to a few meter resolution. Data from VERTEX will be used to validate the simulations. The sensitivity to a variety of inflow and atmospheric stability conditions will also be assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide an understanding if and how wind turbines can alter near-surface properties in any significant way. This understanding is important because it will either enhance wind energy deployment or slow it if such changes are considered too dramatic.  Research findings will be communicated to: 1) the scientific community via participation to conferences and peer-reviewed papers; 2) the general public via targeted outreach efforts, including an exhibit at the annual University of Delaware's Coast Day and press releases; and 3) university students via a newly developed graduate and undergraduate course on "Energy in the atmosphere".</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>The motivation for the VERTEX (VERTical Enhanced miXing) field campaign, conducted in August-October 2016 in Lewes, Delaware, around a 2 MW wind turbine, was to understand the surface response, in terms of temperature, wind speed, turbulence, and fluxes, to the wind turbine wake. Wakes are characterized by reduced wind speed (i.e., wind speed deficit) and high turbulence. Fifteen surface flux stations were placed downwind of the turbine to measure wind speed, temperature, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), heat and momentum fluxes. A 49-m meteorological tower was equipped with meteorological instruments at 5 levels. Lidar scans captured horizontal and vertical cross sections of wind speed and were used to identify the wakes (see Figure 1). Current understanding is that, as wakes evolve downstream, both wind speed deficit and turbulence expand vertically and eventually reach the ground, thus causing enhanced vertical mixing near the ground. However, in the literature, papers have shown no evidence of enhanced vertical mixing near the ground and inconsistent temperature responses. VERTEX goals were to prove that vertical mixing near the ground is not enhanced, but rather reduced or not changed, and to identify the true physical mechanisms responsible for temperature changes.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Science outcomes</strong></p> <p>1) We confirmed that vertical mixing near the ground is not enhanced by wind turbine wakes. We analyzed numerous wake events and compared turbulence measurements at the site that was under the wake versus those at a companion site that was not under the wake. In no case, regardless of atmospheric stability, vertical mixing was enhanced and in most cases it was reduced (see Figure 2 for u* at sites S2 and S1).&nbsp;In particular, heat fluxes were unchanged under the wake. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>2) The lack of enhanced mixing and turbulence near the ground suggests that the high turbulence in the wakes does not reach the ground but tends to remain elevated. This confirms past LES studies showing that the highest TKE in the wake is in the upper part of the rotor area, due to the high shear caused by the wind speed deficit, and generally remains there. The wind speed deficit, by contrast, reaches the ground, as confirmed by the reduced wind speed under the wake (Figure 3). Thus, the wake of a turbine is characterized by a vertically and horizontally expanding wind speed deficit, which reaches the ground after about 6-7D, but with turbulence that does not reach the ground.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>3) Temperature changes were small but statistically significant (up to 0.18 C in magnitude). The sign of the temperature change depends on the entire temperature profile from the ground to the lower rotor, represented via the lower-rotor lapse rate (temperature at 49 m minus at 10 m). Warming, slight warming, and slight cooling were observed for stable, neutral, and unstable lower-rotor stability conditions, respectively (Figure 4).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>4) In the absence of changes in the heat fluxes near the ground, we hypothesize that the changes in temperature are caused by divergence/convergence of the heat flux below the rotor. As illustrated in Figure 5, the exact details depend on lower-rotor stability. In brief, high TKE in the rotor region enhances heat flux there, thus causing convergence or divergence for stable or unstable conditions, respectively. In neutral conditions, no changes are expected unless the rotor layer is actually slightly stable. This hypothesis was confirmed both via observations of heat flux divergence/convergence changes at the meteorological tower during VERTEX and via simulations with the WRF-LES model (Figure 6).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader impact outcomes</strong></p> <p>1) A new course "Energy on Earth" (ENSC 370)&nbsp;was developed as part of this project and taught by PI Archer in Fall 2019, with a total enrollment of 7. The course reviews all energy types available on Earth (coal, petroleum, natural gas, nuclear, geothermal, hydro, wind, solar, etc.), energy uses, energy conversions, energy system impacts on the environment, and future energy scenarios. Module 3 covers wind energy and the importance of wind turbine wakes is introduced in it. The course will be taught by the PI every other Fall.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>2) Four, data-based lesson plans were developed (one for elementary, one for middle, and two for high schools).
