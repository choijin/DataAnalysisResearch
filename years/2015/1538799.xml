<AbstractNarration>The pharmaceutical industry provides a crucial role in improving human health. Over the past 20 years established firms have faced declining efficiency and effectiveness of their R&amp;D efforts. In response, dozens of industry-supported R&amp;D consortia have been formed to create and share knowledge between private and public participants, which include large and small firms, universities and other research institutes. This project will study these consortia and how firms reconcile the open nature of consortia with their traditional IP-based business models. The project offers theoretical insights for understanding consortia-style R&amp;D collaboration and also for assessing new R&amp;D approaches in the pharmaceutical industry.  The project will have direct relevance for leaders of consortia and other public-private partnerships.  Finally, disseminating best practice for these consortia will help maximize the benefits that biomedical firms gain from such collaborations, accelerating the availability of improvements in human health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will offer the first large-scale study of the open R&amp;D consortia as a new form of cooperation in the pharmaceutical industry. The project will create a public use database and typology of R&amp;D consortium based on archival data.  Interviews will be used to provide detailed case studies that will examine intellectual property issues, knowledge appropriation and strategic alliances in the implementation and operation of R&amp;D consortium. A deeper understanding of how firms manage the flow of information in open innovation contexts has the potential to make a significant contribution for managers and policy makers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ R&amp;D consortia have been a popular form of intra-industry collaboration in the U.S. since the passage of the 1984 National Cooperative Research Act. Many examples of such consortia were studied in the late 20th century, such as SEMATECH and the Microelectronics and Computer Consortium in the U.S., ESPRIT in Europe, or the Fifth-Generation Computer Project in Japan. The consortial form has also been used for ad hoc industry standardization, such as the ?Unix Wars? and digital cellular rivalries of the late 1990s or the Blu-ray vs. HD DVD contest of the early 21stcentury.  However, such traditional consortium models are organized around the idea of a ?club good? as defined in information economics. While participants share in accessing the results (and controlling the direction) of the consortium?s R&amp;D efforts, preferential access is given to club members (i.e., consortium sponsors) over the general public.  This study documented the phenomenon, organization and economic drivers of a different model, the open R&amp;D consortium.  We examined consortia in the pharmaceutical industry where they apply principles of open innovation to facilitate cooperation.  These consortia encourage open spillovers by allowing the results to benefit members and nonmembers alike, whether in the discovery of basic scientific knowledge, developing metrics for measuring the clinical progression of a chronic disease, or establishing regulatory standards for the approval of a new therapy.  Using archival and other secondary data, we identified more than 450 such consortia worldwide, established since the early 1990s. We document the corporate, academic, nonprofit and government membership of each consortium, and (where possible) their mission, governance and outputs.  We then gathered additional data on those 141 consortia that involved cooperation by two or more of the top 30 pharmaceutical companies, including interviews and in some cases internal presentations and reports. We classified these 141 consortia into eight categories of intended outcomes: disease-specific, disease family-specific, technology-specific, safety/toxicity, data standards, clinical trials, manufacturing, best practices and other.  From this, we showed how the openness of these consortia was directly tied to the stable profitability of the pharmaceutical industry structure. On the one hand, the success of these consortia benefited incumbents, did not change industry structure, and potentially provided reputational benefits to these firms. On the other hand, the science-based business of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology were tightly linked to the norms of open science, and in practice it was hard to block certain spillovers (such as those published in the scientific literature).  We continue to pursue additional research using this data within the research ecosystems of specific major diseases. In the meantime, we are making available the databases and descriptive data for each of these consortia to facilitate research by other researchers.
