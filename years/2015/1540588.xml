<AbstractNarration>Front Range Community College (FRCC) and UNAVCO, a non-profit research facility that operates the NSF-supported Geodesy Advancing Geosciences and EarthScope (GAGE) Facility, are collaborating on a holistic project to engage and retain community college students throughtout the state of Colorado in geoscience education and career pathways. The American Geosciences Institute 2014 Workforce Report predicts a workforce shortage of ~135,000 geoscientists by 2022. Increasingly, students begin their undergraduate careers in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines at community colleges, making the transition between two-year and four-year undergraduate institutions a critical juncture for ensuring student retention and success.  Providing students with authentic experiences in STEM through research experiences and internships, as well as helping students to understand the career opportunities available to them in the geosciences, to develop the academic and professional skills needed to succeed in those careers, and to identify the mentors and networks that can support them along the way, are proven best practices for retaining students in STEM pathways. Given the very diverse demographic make-up of students attending community colleges, successful transfer of these students into four-year degree programs helps to broaden participation of traditionally underrepresented students in STEM and the geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FRCC and UNAVCO are collaborating to implement a tiered, student-focused program that provides community college students in Colorado with experiential learning opportunities in the geosciences.  The Geo-Launchpad program is creating an entry point into geo-focused careers for students through a structured experience, starting with introductory workshops and webinars to engage students, develop career awareness and initiate mentoring and networking.  Motivated students move into a semester-long special topics course in geoscience designed to build student capacity, and reinvorce engagement.  For a select group of students, the program culminates in an 8-week paid summer internship experience at UNAVCO, which provides continuity of the community college geoscience pathway with the industry and advanced education programs at Colorado's research institutions. Students work in teams on projects focused on solid earth, cryosphere, environmental science, hydrogeodesy, and ocean/atmosphere applications of global postitioning system (GPS) technologies. Each intern is supported by 3 mentors, one of which is located at their home institution. In addition to increasing geoscience content knowledge, the Geo-Launchpad program activities help students build basic skills in critical thinking, data analysis, communication, and organization.  An annual mini-symposium at UNAVCO provides faculty and students from around the state of Colorado with information regarding the Geo-Launchpad programs, as well as professional development related to mentoring and advising. After the initial phases of implementating the program at FRCC, the project will recruit and make available online many of the resources to other community college students throughout the state.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Geo-Launchpad was founded by FRCC and UNAVCO in 2015 as a way to help students from Front Range Community College and other community colleges learn about geoscience as an academic path and career choice. The program is designed to increase the number and diversity of students in STEM fields by introducing community college students to internships, research experiences, and careers in the geosciences. The program used a three-tiered approach to increase student pathways into geoscience careers: (1) seminars at community colleges in Colorado, (2) curriculum development, and (3) an internship. A unique aspect of the program was a continual improvement process where the programming for each year was informed and improved by evaluation of the previous year. Substantial changes that resulted from this continual improvement process included expanding the internship opportunity to students from New Mexico community colleges and formalizing a faculty mentoring workshop. Geo-Launchpad engaged over 50 students from 11 2YC. Over 75% who participated in Geo-Launchpad went on to four-year programs, graduate school, and/or are working in geo-focused careers. Evaluation data show the Geo-Launchpad experience provided students with the knowledge and confidence to pursue geoscience careers.</p> <p>Seminars were held at five college campuses introducing students and faculty to geosciences careers and the Geo-Launchpad internships. We expanded the seminars to promote other research experiences and internships. UNAVCO staff and FRCC faculty met with students both in classrooms and at special information events to promote career opportunities.</p> <p>We developed a state-wide course (GEO210: Careers &amp; Research in the Geosciences) that provides students with exposure to geoscience summer internships and career opportunities including helping students identify and apply to various programs. The course was approved by the State Faculty Curriculum Committee for inclusion in the Colorado Community College Common Course Numbering System as GEO 210 (originally GEO 275 while under development as a special topics course). The seminar style course is designed to introduce students to careers, research, and internship/undergraduate research opportunities in the geosciences, while including an introduction to practical skills such as resume/CV writing and interpreting scientific writings. Over the grant period, 20 students completed the course, with many students (6) subsequently receiving offers for an internship in the summer immediately following the course. Several other students are known to have acquired practical experience in related fields in the semesters following the course. The course continues to be offered at Front Range Community College, Larimer Campus.</p> <p>We also developed a summer internship at UNAVCO specifically for Colorado 2YC students. Students participated in one or both elements (course and internship). A total of 26 students completed internships though UNAVCO over the life of the grant, with many of the internships taking place at the United States Geological Survey and two internships taking place at a local private company. Aside from the experience interns gained working to support science projects, the program has served to expand self-awareness, independence, and self-confidence through activities designed to support team building, develop professional skills such as resume writing and scientific poster creation, develop soft-skills such as networking, and encourage near-peer mentoring across internship programs at UNAVCO. Interns were required to have a faculty mentor from their home institution to support the student before, during and after the internship. Project managers also served as mentors to the interns. Interns presented their work at a student research poster symposium for Boulder, Colorado area internship programs and at the Geological Society of America Annual Meeting in 2018-2020.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/16/2021<br>      Modified by: Patrick&nbsp;Shabram</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1540588/1540588_10404837_1613502371153_InternsLastWeek08012019_Bartel-102-X2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1540588/1540588_10404837_1613502371153_InternsLastWeek08012019_Bartel-102-X2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2019 Geo-Launchpad Interns"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1540588/1540588_10404837_1613502371153_InternsLastWeek08012019_Bartel-102-X2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2019 Geo-Launchpad Interns"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2019 Geo-Launchpad Interns at the Student Summer Research Symposium</div> <div class="imageCredit">Photo/Kelsey Russo-Nixon</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Patrick&nbsp;Shabram</div> <div class="imageTitle">2019 Geo-Launchpad Interns</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1540588/1540588_10404837_1613502534043_FRCCstudenttour1-L--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1540588/1540588_10404837_1613502534043_FRCCstudenttour1-L--rgov-800width.jpg" title="GEO 210 Field Trip"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1540588/1540588_10404837_1613502534043_FRCCstudenttour1-L--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="GEO 210 Field Trip"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Community college students from Front Range Community College Larimer Campus receive a tour from UNAVCO GDS Director Chuck Meertens.
