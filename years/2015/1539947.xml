<AbstractNarration>This award will assist in the planning activities for the proposed I/UCRC for Necrobiome Research and Its Application in Decomposition Ecology and Forensics. &lt;br/&gt;The Center will develop standard operating procedures that will be validated, assessed for accuracy and precision, and subsequently integrated into current crime laboratories and crime scene investigation units through training centers currently in existence at the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, and Texas A&amp;M. This Center will create a network for researchers to partner with forensic practitioners that will result in timely and effective transfer of science-based discoveries and technology to forensic scientists in the government and private sectors.Training programs currently in place through Texas A&amp;M are accredited through the International Association for Identification thus allowing for such training being accepted globally. An undergraduate programs in the forensic sciences accredited by the Forensic Programs Accreditation Commission is also available for training future practitioners by integrating new techniques developed through the center into their curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed Center represents a combination of practitioner expertise and research capacity that positions the center to serve as a global platform for: 1) Conducting multidisciplinary discovery and translational research in the field and laboratory that establishes a science-based foundation associated with the forensically important phenomena of decomposition and ecological recycling of vertebrate carrion; 2) Integrating the decomposition and ecological recycling research with new discoveries in basic and applied forensic chemistry and biology to improve forensic methodology and technology; and 3) Enhancing the forensics workforce development programs already associated with each of the partner institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Texas A&amp;M University Forensic Science Site, with the future Center for Advanced Research in Forensic Science, is comprised of 10 faculty to date committed to this concept, would serve as a platform for identifying and dissecting out the ecological underpinnings governing decomposition of human and other animal remains with specific applications in the forensic sciences. The center would be tightly linked with the Forensic &amp; Investigative Sciences Program at Texas A&amp;M University and Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research.  One promising area that has arisen in the age of "omics" is microbial forensics, which is defined as the discipline of applying scientific methods to analyzing microbial evidence in criminal and civil cases for investigative purposes.  Microbes are nearly ubiquitous in nature and advancing applications in this field will require detailed knowledge of microbial ecology.  Just as has been experienced with human identification, forensic technologies and the requirement for robustness can be leveraged to support other important areas of research.  Our proposed site would address each of these issues in an integrated, interdisciplinary approach employing experts in diverse fields, and serve as a catalyst for cooperation, research, and development in this burgeoning field. The Center would act as both a clearinghouse and conduit for multiple industrial partners to develop much needed basic research protocols, facilitate streamlined integration and standards, provide validation testing of new approaches and instrumentation, and provide subject matter experts to address scientific challenges as they arise in forensics as well as their applications in broader areas of human importance (e.g., food safety, engineering, structural integrity, agriculture).   We held our planning grant meeting during July 2016. Eight corporations attended, with presentations on five topics ranging from (but not limited to) necrobiome and decomposition assessments for determining forensically relevant information; to human identification through microbiology; to a DNA to go- a mobile PCR Lab. Through these efforts, two companies committed to membership in CARFS.        Last Modified: 01/30/2017       Submitted by: Jeffery K Tomberlin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
