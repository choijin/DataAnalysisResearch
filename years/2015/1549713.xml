<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project promotes a promising new approach to improve employee wellness with the potential for wider application beyond the workplace. This improved approach combines both innovative clinical diagnostics with computer assisted learning to guide recommendations. It offers the potential to curb epidemic chronic disease through the use of efficient as well as scalable operating models. Adopting this data-driven approach is expected to improve not only participating employees? health but also reduce health care costs. Increased productivity which follows from improved employee health can also be expected. Accordingly, better health and economic savings to both corporate America and working Americans are realistic objectives of this project. Employers and the general public therefore are expected to benefit from this initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project combines novel as well as economic use of clinical diagnostics, strengthened by computer learning, to effectively improve workplace wellness. Conventional wellness strategies are presently both inefficient as well as ineffective in addressing the growing epidemic of chronic diseases. These chronic diseases include but are not limited to: diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. The principal objective of this project is the integration of various clinical findings in prevention of chronic disease enhanced by machine learning. This unique approach aids in the development of scalable, workplace wellness programs which are effective and affordable. The novel platform continuously learns from all participants? interventional results and intelligently discovers the best preventive intervention plan for each participant. The platform innovatively adopts low cost quantitative diagnostic imagery to track key health parameters clinically correlated to wellness. Computer aided modeling includes dynamic physiological models (i.e. current symptoms, lifestyle measurements, past medical history, MRI scans and laboratory tests) to clinically evaluate the course of chronic disease along with various prevention strategies for intervention. Measures of clinical outcome enhanced by machine learning identify important biomarkers to develop intervention recommendations for participating individuals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The US spends more on healthcare as a percentage of GDP than any other developed nation in the world. The unwell workforce costs American employers $153 billion annually.  More than one-third of Americans are obese, while half of adults suffer from at least on chronic and preventable condition.  Left unaddressed, this crisis will continue to decrease domestic productivity while simultaneously increasing healthcare costs.  As a result, American companies are turning toward workplace wellness programs to mitigate healthcare spending on chronic and preventable diseases.  This research project focused on developing an industry-strength machine learning platform that can intelligently support a large-scale workplace wellness program to address the growing concern over the chronic disease epidemic.   A small scale wellness program was implemented early on in the project period with local career firefighter groups.  Early results were promising and participation was high.  Although feedback from both firefighters and their fire chiefs were positive, we were forced to pivot to private sector companies due to lengthy city budgeting cycles and limited funding for new health and wellness initiatives.  Since pivoting, we have worked with executives and employees from numerous local mid-size companies as well as two insurance agents specializing in workplace wellness programs.  We have also began working with leaders at the Minnesota Army National Guard and the Minnesota State Patrol who are interested in implementing the wellness program for their respective members.  Our research used physiologically-based modelling based on clinical findings to investigate the underlying mechanisms of chronic disease, created simulated data sets for machine learning, and designed feasible intervention strategies.  Our research showed that the developed computational methods are capable of providing intelligent decisions for interventions of chronic disease conditions by coupling reinforcement learning, statistical learning and physiological simulation modeling. Our prototype has explored fitting physiological-based models, and validated treatment protocols for certain short time scale chronic diseases (e.g. impaired fasting blood glucose).    By improving our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of different chronic diseases, we hope that the outcomes from this project and continued research will fundamentally change conventional healthcare strategies for treating chronic disease.  A data-driven and computationally-intelligent wellness program not only offers a scalable solution to employers across the country, but also promises the possibility of cost-effective personalized interventions for employees.  When fully implemented, we would expect not only improved overall health of participating employees, but also an economic benefit both in the form of reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity and decreased absenteeism and presenteeism.
