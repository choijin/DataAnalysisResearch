<AbstractNarration>PI:  Ling Zang&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1502433&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrogen gas is a clean and zero-carbon fuel which can be converted to electrical power using a device called a fuel cell for electric vehicle or industrial applications.  Most of the hydrogen gas produced today comes from processing of natural gas, primarily from fossil fuel resources.  However, future sources of hydrogen will need to come from renewable resources if they are to become part of our sustainable energy future. The goal of this project is to develop inexpensive, polymer-based materials that will convert water into hydrogen gas using sunlight to drive the reaction.  In the proposed research, electrically conductive organic polymers will be extruded into nanometer diameter fibrils designed to capture the suns photons.  Catalyst materials imbedded in the polymer help to split apart the water molecule to hydrogen and oxygen gas using these absorbed photons through a process called photocatalysis.  The research will make and test the performance of these materials for generation of hydrogen from water. Students involved in this project will be trained at the interface of renewable energy and nanotechnology.  The project will also develop hydrogen production demonstration for Natural History Museum of Utah to illustrate renewable energy research to public audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to synthesize and characterize the performance of new organic polymer nanofibril based photocatalytic materials for the splitting of water into hydrogen gas.  These nanofibers, which contain both polymer and metal co-catalyst nanoparticles, are multifunctional, combining the properties of tunable band structure, visible spectral response, and large surface area.  In the research plan, the organic polymer nanofibers will be synthesized from building-block molecules containing donor-acceptor moieties responsive to wide range of visible light. The donor-acceptor material interface will also be engineered for increased charge separation upon illumination, as well as for the efficient transport of the photo-generated electrons to the co-catalyst sites that convert protons to hydrogen. This interface will also be engineered to maximize the intake of the photogenerated electrons while preventing their recombination with cationic radicals.  Time-resolved electron spin resonance measurements will characterize how interfacial electron-scavenging depends on particle size and energy level alignment in the polymer and co-catalyst.  Hydrogen production activity of the synthesized nanofibril photocatalysts will be correlated to quantum efficiency, turnover numbers, and dependence on irradiation wavelength.    As part of the educational activities, workshops based on solar fuels and solar photovoltaics topics will be offered through Utah Science Center and the NSF-sponsored Nanodays at Nano Institute of Utah.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to develop organic nanofibers into photocatalysts to enable hydrogen production from water under visible light irradiation, and explore the fundamental mechanism of photocatalysis and charge separation in correlation with the molecular structure and self-assembly engineering.  The three years of research has produced ten papers published in the peer-reviewed journals of chemistry, energy, catalysis and materials science.  These publications have already brought significant impact to the scientific community as indicated by the fast-increasing citations, e.g., one paper published in 2016 is now cited 56 times, another one published in 2017 cited 27 times. One US patent (pending) was also generated from the research results, and has now been licensed to an industry for product development. The research program allowed for training of four graduate students and five undergraduate students with broad range of lab skills and knowledge in nanomaterials fabrication and related nanotechnology.  Such training is crucial for producing capable workforce for the future renewable energy and increasing nanotech industry.     The project outcomes regarding Intellectual Merit cover mostly the novel molecular design and synthesis, exquisite supramolecular assembly, advanced spectroscopic and microscopic characterization of nanomaterials, interfacial chemical modification of nanostructures, fundamental study of the optoelectronic properties of size and dimension confined nanomaterials, and investigation of the nanomaterials in photocatalysis that demands both structural and morphology control of the materials at nanoscale.  The major scientific achievements include 1) synthesis of building block molecules with appropriate structure modifications and charge transfer functionality, while are suited for one-dimensional self-assembly; 2) development of self-assembly methodology to fabricate shape defined nanofiber structures that are dominated by the cofacial molecular stacking along the long axis (the ideal arrangement for efficient charge transport); 3) systematic structural characterization of the nanostructures by a combination of spectroscopic, optical, electrical, microscopy and diffraction methods; 4) understanding of the structure-property relationship through both experimental investigation and theoretical calculation and modeling; 5) photoelectrocatalysis with organic nanofiber materials for hydrogen production from water, for which 30% of Faradaic efficiency was obtained.     As for Broader Impacts, the project outcomes provide the scientific foundation with new technology in photocatalysis that may find application in solar energy conversion.  Research advancement in photocatalysis will also help strengthen the American Competitiveness in the development of clean, renewable energy. The research discoveries from this project have been widely disseminated to the public through presentations in varying national and international conferences (e.g., the 2017 Chemical and Biological Defense Science &amp; Technology Conference, 2016 MRS Spring Meeting, SciX 2015 International Conference, and Pacifichem 2015 International Conference), in addition to publication in peer reviewed journals.  To promote the students training and education in nanoscience and nanotechnology, some exciting results from this project (particularly the molecular self-assembly, nanofiber structures and conversion of solar energy) have been integrated into three graduate and undergraduate courses developed by the PI, "Nanoscale Probing and Imaging", "Nanoscience" and "Engineering Materials".   The PI and his group also remain committed to local outreach activities, through the annual NanoUtah conference, the annual confluence organized by the Utah Science Technology and Research (USTAR) initiative and the faculty mentorship of Nano Institute of Utah, as well as delivering emerging science lectures to the local K-12 schools (e.g., lectured "New Materials for Better World" to the 7 and 8 grade students of Hillside Middle School, Salt Lake City).
