<AbstractNarration>This project will demonstrate a new class of continuum robots capable of multi-scale manipulation, that is, the ability to achieve large motion with millimetric precision and to achieve small motion with micrometer-scale precision. Existing robots are typically designed to function properly only at a single operational length scale. The envisioned class of robots will provide micro-precision while traversing macroscale sinuous pathways to access the operational site, thus enabling new technologies for micro-surgery, such as image-based biopsy (high resolution tissue inspection), and micro-surgery in deep surgical fields. Potential benefits include precise tissue reconstruction and complete surgical eradication of tumors. Such robots will also enable new abilities for micro-manufacturing, leading to greatly improved quality-control inspection methods for micro-fluidic and microelectromechanical devices mass-manufactured on large substrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to provide modeling and control frameworks for new types of parallel continuum robots for multi-scale manipulation, based on the concept of  equilibrium modulation. These robots will use direct actuation of their links to achieve large workspace with macro (millimetric scale) precision and indirect-actuation to perturb the equilibrium pose of the continuum robot to achieve minute (micrometer scale) motions. This concept differs from existing approaches for multi-scale manipulation by offering one robotic architecture capable of both micro and macro manipulation. The modeling approach will provide a formulation supporting calibration, system identification and control. This project will use a direct variational approach for modeling the statics and kinematics of these robots, and a framework for micro-motion modeling and parameter identification using support vector regressors to overcome friction and parameter uncertainties. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a means for micro-inspection, and control feedback approaches using mixed joint-space and OCT feedback will be used to enable semi-automated scans of the target inspection site.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Existing robots are typically designed to function properly only at a single functional length scale and, whenever multi-scale motion is needed, the problem is solved by serially stacking a micro-scale robot (a robot that has a very small workspace, but can move at or less than micron-scale precision) at the distal end of a macro-scale robot (a robot that provides a large workspace and moves with mm scale precision).
