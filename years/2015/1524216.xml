<AbstractNarration>This award is providing partial support for the 19th annual meeting of Partners and Working Groups involved with the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program, being held in Los Angeles, CA between July 19 and July 24, 2015.  The GLOBE program is a worldwide community of students, teachers, scientists and citizens working to understand, sustain, and improve Earth's environment at local, regional and global scales.  The mission of GLOBE is to promote the teaching and learning of science through authentic, hands-on student research, enhance environmental literacy and stewardship, and promote scientific discovery.  GLOBE strives to expand the number and diversity of students engaged in STEM and pursuing scientific careers.  Since its inception, GLOBE has trained more than 20,000 teachers representing ~27,000 schools around the world.  The more than 12 million students who have participated in GLOBE have contributed over 126 million data measurements to the GLOBE database for use in student- and scientist-led research projects.  The GLOBE annual meeting provides an essential venue to bring together the 134 U.S. Partners and 114 Partner Country Coordinators for strategic planning, program coordination, sharing of best practices, and piloting of new resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 19th annual GLOBE meeting, being organized by an international committee of scientists, GLOBE Partners, and educators, will focus on the following activities: 1) train participants on the use of selected GLOBE protocols for short- and long-term research projects; 2) train participants in the use of new data entry, data analysis, visualization and communication tools recently augmented on the GLOBE web site; 3) highlight new opportunities to engage larger communities in GLOBE through citizen science projects; 4) introduce Partners to new tools that enable GLOBE students to engage in environmental research and peer review; 5) assess the success after its first year of operation of a new governance structure for GLOBE (including new Working Groups and a U.S. Partner Forum); 6) identify and model best practices for using GLOBE resources to implement new standards for STEM, language arts, and math; 7) model best practices for engaging students in the end-to-end research process using the suite of GLOBE tools; and 8) introduce a pilot program to integrate technology that connects in real-time remote research sites through live interactive collaborations between teachers, students, and scientists.  Keynote presentations will be given by scientists and 7 master teachers.  In addition to the 130-150 Partners and Country Coordinators attending the meeting, a group of 40 students, 3 teachers, and 7 additional chaperones will engage in a 2-day intensive research study on Catalina Island, modeling GLOBE program research resources.  Pre- and post-meeting evaluation of participants will document the near- and longer-term impacts of the annual meeting activities, as well as the extent to which the resources modeled duirng the meeting are disseminated back to the GLOBE communities being served by the Partners.</AbstractNarration>
