<AbstractNarration>This research will identify if seed dispersal at New Zealand alpine treelines is limited and a cause of their abrupt and striking form. The abrupt alpine treeline in New Zealand is a system that has experienced warming over the last 50 years without a corresponding change in alpine treeline position. In a closely linked vegetation-climate system, we would expect that the treeline should track climate relatively closely over periods as short as a decade. Unlike animals that can respond quickly to changing environmental conditions, plants are fixed in space and must respond inter-generationally through seed dispersal. This research will address the issue by 1) characterizing gene flow at mountain beech treelines and 2) assessing the degree to which the treeline is dispersal limited resulting in their abrupt form. The research will analyze genomic data allowing the researchers to dissect genetic similarity between treeline forming individuals and forest individuals below, teasing apart the ecological factors influencing dispersal and the potential for treelines to track future climate variation. This research will be conducted in collaboration with New Zealand researchers Dr. Brad Case at Lincoln University and Dr. Ellen Cieraad at Landcare Research, both experts on New Zealand treeline dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, a genotyping by sequencing approach, double digest restriction site associated DNA discovery, will be used to simultaneously sequence and identify highly informative molecular markers, single nucleotide polymorphisms, across the mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides (Hook.f.) Poole.) genome. Genome wide datasets are rare in forest species but next generation sequencing is allowing large genomic regions to be analyzed efficiently. The genomic variation will be assessed along three elevational transects to identify if seed dispersal limitation is a cause of abrupt alpine treelines. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Royal Society of New Zealand.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Alpine treelines are commonly thought to be controlled by temperature at global scales. These treelines have widely been considered good global indicators of climate change and are expected to rise in elevation with increasing growing season temperature. Despite the global control of temperature on treeline position, a great deal of variability exists in their position due to microsite controls. For example, site scale temperature may be less important in controlling treeline position than variables associated with regeneration. A growing body of research has shown that a myriad of factors influence the position of the ecotone such as geomorphology, competitive interactions, and regeneration limitation. Current research on mountain beech (Fuscospora cliffortioides) treelines in New Zealand have found that treeline is likely limited by recruitment and the availability of safe microsites for establishment and growth in addition to stress and disturbance related variables. Identifying the physical and ecological factors that contribute to recruitment suppression is important to our understanding of how this spatially explicit ecotone will respond to rapid global change.  The regeneration limitation hypothesis suggests that dispersal, per se, is not the primary factor limiting elevational advance of abrupt mountain beech treelines in response to global climate change, but the result of unsuitable microsites, stress, disturbance, and biotic interactions. Advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) allow us to address how landscape features, for example elevational clines, affect demographic process such as dispersal and range dynamics identifiable by assessing geographically structured genomic variation. Pairwise spatial genetic variation between two or more individuals can operate as a proxy for functional connectivity. This allows us to identify dispersal limitation and to test the hypothesis that mountain beech treelines in New Zealand are not dispersal limited. If we can rule out dispersal limitation we are one step closer to understanding why these treelines have such a unique form compared to many treelines globally.  We used high throughput genome sequencing to identify approximately 100 polymorphic molecular markers spread throughout the mountain beech genome. These markers were then used as a way to assess spatial genetic structure at both local and landscape scale within the Southern Alps of New Zealand. We addressed the broad research objective: To what degree is mountain beech treeline dispersal limited versus regeneration limited. First, we assessed gene flow and dispersal along three elevational gradiants. And secondly, we assessed population genomic structure between three study sites to assess landscape level gene flow.  At the local scale we found no dispersal limitation at low elevation mountain beech sites (Fst = 0.0 P = 0.4). However, there was a significant reduction in gene flow between treeline and lower slope positions (Fst = 0.01, P = 0.008). Genomic diversity increased with elevation. Treeline beech had higher mean genomic diversity (He = 0.22) compared to trees 50 m below treeline (He =0.21) and 150 m below treeline (He = 0.20). Though these findings were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) the higher genomic diversity is curious, and may indicate that treeline forming beech have a selective fitness advantage compared to trees from lower elevations.  At the landscape scale we found significant evidence of spatial population genetic structure (pairwise Fst 0.016-0.025, global Fst = 0.1, P &lt; 0.01). An Analysis of Molecular Variance identified 9% of genomic variation between populations, suggesting a small degree of gene flow limitation (P &lt; 0.01) along the Southern Alps.  Broadly, our results show that mountain beech treelines are experiencing some level of dispersal limitation. The significant population genetic structure between treeline sites and lower positions supports this conclusion. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
