<AbstractNarration>This award provides three years of funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Wabash Seminar and Miniconference." The three seminar meetings in the first year of the award will be held on October 24, 2015, February 27, 2016, and April 9, 2016, on the campus of Wabash College, while the 2015 miniconference will be held September 12-13, 2015, on the campus of the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). Additional information is available on the seminar web site  http://www.math.purdue.edu/~mdd/Wabash/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wabash seminar and miniconference series, which is organized by a consortium of Midwestern mathematics departments, has for over forty years provided a catalyst for the stimulation and dissemination of significant contributions to a wide range of areas of modern analysis, with a primary focus on functional and harmonic analysis. The format for Wabash events provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
