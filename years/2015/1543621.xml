<AbstractNarration>This request is for partial support of a workshop that be held in Phoenix, Arizona, during May 17-19, 2015. The workshop will bring together an international group of about 50 isotope geochemists and biomedical researchers to explore the use of high precision isotope analysis, particularly of the heavy metals or metallomics, as disease biomarkers.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It is known that disruptions in the metabolism of inorganic elements can be the cause or result from some diseases, such as Alzheimer, osteoporosis, and cancer.  The aim of the workshop is to identify medical questions where sophisticated technologies, methodologies, and concepts that have been used in the geological and environmental sciences can be applied to combat disease. Results of the workshop will be published in a report that will serve as the founding document of the new field of isotope metallomic biomarkers and will be available to researchers and the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    In one of the more remarkable developments in transdisciplinary research, a number of research groups around the world have begun to explore how the principles of isotope geoscience can have powerful potential in biomedicine. Initial findings are encouraging, both for improved understanding of basic bioinorganic processes, and for direct practical application to the development of quantitative biomarkers.   To galvanize this community and develop common strategies for the future, a workshop was held in May, 2015, in Scottsdale, AZ, USA, under the auspices of the National Biomarker Development Alliance, Arizona State University, and the Mayo Clinic. This was the second such workshop, following a meeting of isotope geochemists held in August, 2013, in Gargonza, Italy. The workshop was designed to foster dialog between isotope geoscientists and biomedical researchers. The gathering included approximately 30 scientists from each community. The workshop was supported by grants from the NSF, NASA, Arizona State University, and the Mayo Clinic.   Intellectual Merit:  Workshop participants learned about pioneering work that has yielded some promising proof-of-concept studies related to bone metabolism, cancer, oxidative stress, and other disorders.  Barriers to progress were discussed at length. A need for high-throughput and low-cost approaches for isotopic analysis was identified as critical for widespread clinical research and application.        A suite of future research studies were outlined, as a roadmap for future research, as well as training activities to foster cross-fertilization between the relevant disciplines.  The particpants agreed to work on a white paper and peer reviewed works that would summarize and review the state of the field.  Broader Impacts:      The workshop fostered a unique dialog between geochemists and biomedical researchers and identified fruitful avenues for research and clinical development. As such, it portends the emergence of a new field that will offer powerful new approaches to disease diagnose, monitoring, and pharmaceutical development, improving human health.
