<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for a 2-day workshop to be held at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography in the Fall/Winter 2015-2016. This workshop will bring together science community stakeholders, video recording experts, and data managers and metadata specialists to develop consensus and best practices for video and complementary metadata to help move the community toward the common goal of broad public access to distributed video content for scientific research and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Video imagery is an integral part of underwater operations conducted with ROVs, HOVs, and AUVs. These data are critical for sampling, exploration, and observation activities during seafloor operations and are key records for immediate post-dive and post-cruise research by the shipboard participants. Video archives have the potential to provide broad significant scientific benefits long after data acquisition and have tremendous potential for engaging the public in exciting ocean science research. To achieve this potential, significant challenges must be addressed that will allow video archives to become accessible and include sufficient metadata to allow users to access the content relevant to their needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Video imagery is an integral part of underwater operations conducted with submersibles throughout the global ocean. Live video streams allow us to see and work in hard to reach environments while revealing exciting deep-sea phenomena.  Recorded video can be used to better understand dynamic ocean environments, and can be used for education and public interest.  Growing volumes of video data, and the diversity of platforms that can now acquire such content, presents the research community with several challenges with respect to acquisition, archiving and long term public access. In an era where streaming videos on hand-held devices is commonplace, scientific video access unfortunately lags behind.  The ultimate goal of this project is to facilitate broad public access to distributed video content that is accessible and useful to scientists and the public alike. To achieve this we convened a workshop which brought a diverse community of scientists, technologists, data managers, and outreach specialists together with professionals from the TV, video and film industry to discuss these challenges and develop community consensus for standards and best practices.   Fundamental to this task is to understand the diversity of practices across the community, and to consider both successful strategies used within and beyond our community, as well as ongoing challenges that can be addressed efficiently and cost-effectively through coordination and cooperation.   The community workshop was held in 2016 and resulted in a publicly available report summarizing findings and recommendations, many of which have been put into practice by several groups.  In addition, a small sample of video archived on aging offline media formats was digitized and made publicly available in order to better understand the quality of older video and to inform the development of potential solutions and strategies for making legacy content publicly available online.
