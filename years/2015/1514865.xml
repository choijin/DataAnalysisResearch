<AbstractNarration>Continental hydrothermal systems have immense scientific and practical significance and are critically important to the Earth?s thermal budget and geochemical cycles. Continental hydrothermal systems are a primary source of economically important metal deposits, provide geothermal resources, support exotic ecosystems that are just beginning to be explored, and in some settings pose a significant geologic hazard via hydrothermal explosions. The subsurface conditions and processes that control these systems are poorly understood because they entail the flow of multi-phase and multi-component fluids through rocks with heterogeneous permeability fields that are perturbed by a multitude of geological and environmental processes. Carefully designed multidisciplinary field experiments and modeling efforts are &lt;br/&gt;required to understand the coupled processes that drive these dynamic systems and control their response to geological and environmental forcing. This project is focused on quantifying the response of continental hydrothermal systems to tectonic, magmatic, and climatic processes operating on time-scales from seconds to thousands of years. The PIs address important and timely scientific questions, such as: How do multi-phase fluids and dissolved constituents flux through hydrothermal systems? How do these systems redistribute elements to produce mineral deposits and microbial habitats? How do earthquakes and magmatic activity perturb hydrothermal systems? What triggers hydrothermal explosions? How do environmental processes and climate affect continental hydrothermal systems? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will involve a combination of fieldwork, data analysis, and modeling. The field program uses a combination of innovative instrument networks and sediment coring activities that will be integrated through modeling activities to study the response of the Yellowstone Lake hydrothermal system to tectonic, magmatic, and climatic forcing. Yellowstone Lake is an ideal site for this research because it hosts an active hydrothermal system located in a region with high levels of tectonic and magmatic activity that has been influenced by a broad range of climate conditions in postglacial times. Research activities will include components of geochemistry, seismology, geology, geodesy, heat flow, micropaleontology, limnology, paleoclimatology, statistics, analytical modeling, and numerical modeling, all of which are essential for unraveling the coupled processes that drive system behavior. Working on a lake-floor system provides an exceptional opportunity to study forcing-response relationships on an expanded range of time-scales spanning more than 11 orders of magnitude.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The HD-YLAKE project focused on using cutting edge submarine exploration technology to explore and investigate the active hydrothermal system present on the floor of Yellowstone Lake, part of the broader active volcano whose caldera covers much of Yellowstone National Park and also causes the many geysers, hot springs, and other surface hydrothermal features for which the Yellowstone area is known.  During three summer field seasons spanning two years, we used a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with many cameras and sensors to explore the floor of Yellowstone lake, catalog the active vents observed, and acquire samples of rocks, vent fluids, and microbiological organisms for further study.  We also deployed a suite of instruments that stayed on the lake floor year-round between field seasons to measure the physical and chemical properties of the lake and specific vents, including high-precision measurements of water temperature and lake level.   Our fieldwork objectives were met in full, and in most cases were exceeded, either by doing more work than originally proposed, or by undertaking additional field surveys beyond those originally proposed. This represents a significant body of information that is revolutionizing our understanding of continental hydrothermal systems in general, and the Yellowstone hydrothermal system in particular.  We have discovered that lake hydrothermal systems are much more diverse than expected, identified novel biological materials that function in unexpected ways, and made the first known observations of a broad hydrothermal plume of warm water rising through a volcanic lake.  Our specific observations focus on understanding the physical characteristics of the lake in which the hydrothermal vents operate, so that we can understand the dynamic relationship between these neighboring systems.  Crucially, we were able to leave instruments recording on the lake floor year-round, collecting data throughout the winter and spring when the lake surface is frozen solid.  By measuring and modeling the dynamics of how, when, and where the lake water moves within the basin, we can understand how the physical pressures on the hydrothermal vents evolve, and compare that to observed changes in vent activity measured with other instruments.  This is a key part of addressing the broader interdisciplinary questions about the ways continental hydrothermal systems evolve and interact with the environment around them.  Additionally, we can use the year-round observations of lake level as an additional way to monitor subtle uplift and subsidence of the lake floor locally, in a key area that is not observable by existing land- or space-based instruments.  This project has provided vital teaching and training for 4 undergraduate students and 1 graduate student, including several from backgrounds traditionally under-represented in STEM fields.  They gained both broad disciplinary knowledge and key transferrable skills as they actively conducted scientific research.  They all completed their degree programs successfully and have gone on to successful careers in academic research or industry.  We have also worked with the National Park Service, making our technological resources available to make key observations that help wildlife scientists make better-informed decisions on how to manage populations of invasive species present in Yellowstone Lake.  As part of our collaboration?s extensive Education and Outreach component, we have developed a website (hdylake.org) highlighting the background and aims of the project as well as the ongoing field activities.  We have also incorporated records and observations of these activities into materials being prepared for a museum exhibition at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Cody, Wyoming throughout 2021.  We expect these materials will be viewed by many thousands of visitors in the coming years, creating wide exposure to the cutting edge technologies and inspirational science stories generated by the HD-YLAKE project as a whole.
