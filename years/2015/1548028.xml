<AbstractNarration>The commercialization of academic research begins with the invention report made to the university Technology Licensing Office (TLO).  Not all reported inventions are commercialized, raising questions about the reasons behind the decision and the potential impact on science.  This research exploits the information provided in invention disclosure forms (IDFs) submitted by faculty members to university technology transfer offices (TTOs). These are rich and under exploited data that provide a means to study commercialization in advance of patenting.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To estimate the potential impact of orphaned inventions the project creates two matched samples. The first compares orphaned IDFs to similar inventions that were chosen for commercialization at the same university as the orphaned project.  This intra-university comparison allows a control for TTO organizational capacity and budget constraints. The second matches the sample IDFs to similar inventions commercialized at other universities or outside the university system. These comparisons permit an estimate of the potential impacts in terms of licensing revenues and firm creation of the orphaned inventions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Universities are increasingly tasked not only with knowledge discovery and dissemination, but also with technology commercialization and the promotion of innovation and economic growth. This project aims to better understand how research universities decide which academic inventions to pursue for commercialization and how to measure the success of these efforts. Past studies have used output measures such as the number of patents granted to universities, the amount of licensing revenue generated by those patents, and the number of new firms formed to exploit academic research. However, these approaches do not account for the variety and quantity of inputs available to different universities, nor do they account for errors that might occur due to the uncertainty inherent in the decision process. Two types of errors are of interest here &ndash; inventions that could have been commercialized but were not pursued, and inventions that were pursued but generated little commercial interest.  We provide a new framework for thinking about the effectiveness of university technology transfer programs, show that universities can make "mistakes" in deciding which inventions to pursue, and describe the factors that can lead to these "mistakes." Our framework examines both the incentives of academic inventors to disclose inventions to the university and the ability of universities to judge which disclosures should be pursued. University technology transfer offices (TTOs) must make decisions about the commercial potential of disclosures in the face of significant uncertainty and must depend on observable characteristics of the research team and of the inventions (e.g. the type of product or technology and the likely industry applications) to make such decisions.  We analyze these processes empirically using a balanced sample of pursued and abandoned inventions, allowing us to estimate the potential impact of inventions that could have been commercialized but were not, as well as the costs of pursuing inventions that should not have been pursued. Such an exercise is inherently difficult because a) these types of "errors" often go unreported, and b) even when we know about such "errors", we do not directly observe the counterfactual, i.e., what would have happened had different decisions been made to pursue or abandon.  To address the first issue we exploit the information provided in invention disclosure forms (IDFs) submitted by faculty members to TTOs. This is the first study we know of focusing on abandoned inventions using IDFs not chosen for commercialization. We design and exploit a similarity algorithm that compares the project descriptions in IDFs to the narratives in the patent applications of more than 50,000 patents held by US research universities. Comparing abandoned IDFs to similar inventions that were chosen for commercialization at other universities allows us not only to identify orphaned inventions that could have been pursued, but also to estimate the potential value forgone by the (mistaken) decision to abandon. Similarly, we identify patented innovations that both experienced little commercial success and had few related patents from other institutions. In these cases the costs of the (mistaken) decision to pursue the patent are more explicit.  Besides making contributions to the academic literature on university innovation and entrepreneurship by mitigating the selection bias described above, we expect the results to be useful to public granting agencies promoting innovation, academic TTO personnel, and policymakers aspiring to boost economic growth via academic innovation and entrepreneurship.
