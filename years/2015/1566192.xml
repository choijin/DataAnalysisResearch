<AbstractNarration>David Sherrill of Georgia Tech University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to develop theoretical and computational approaches to study weak, non-bonded interactions between molecules.  Such interactions   determine how medicines bind to their targets in the body, how molecules pack into solids, and how liquids behave.  Hence, interactions between molecules are of fundamental importance for science and technology, and understanding these interactions better could aid in the design of better materials or more effective medicines.   Sherrill and his research group focus on new theoretical techniques based on quantum mechanics.  They implement their methods in user-friendly, open-source, widely-available and free computer software.  This allows other researchers to model and analyze interactions between molecules more accurately, in more situations, and with a higher level of detail. The project is contributing to the training of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates in quantum chemistry methods and software development. The project is cofounded by the Computational and Data-enabled Science and Engineering Program in the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) will be extended to compute interactions between different molecular fragments, even when those fragments are in the same molecule (this is not possible with current versions of SAPT).  The intramolecular SAPT allows investigations of how linker groups in molecular torsion balances affect the interactions they have been made to study.  These techniques are also being extended to molecules with unpaired electrons, allowing an investigation of how methionine-aromatic contacts contribute to protein stabilization, and how these contacts change their strength upon ionization of the methionine group.  The project is also investigating various many-body expansion approximations (including density embedding) for use in high-accuracy computations of extended systems.  The methods developed as part of this project are being implemented as open-source software, to be made available to the entire scientific community.  The enhanced ability to model interactions between molecules should benefit researchers in chemistry, materials science, biochemistry, and drug design.  At the same time, associated computational laboratory exercises are being developed that teach fundamental concepts of intermolecular interactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we developed new theoretical methods to study the interactions between molecules, we created computer programs that allow the new methods to be used, we tested the methods, and we used them to study especially interesting chemical systems.  The primary framework we use is called symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT).  This is a well-established theory, but we have worked to extend it and make it more widely usable and available.  Much of our work was focused on creating computer programs to allow (1) computations of intermolecular interactions between molecules with unpaired electrons, and (2) the use of density functional theory in intermolecular interaction computations.  The software to enable these computations is publicly available through the open-source Psi4 project (https://psicode.org).    We applied these methods and others to better understand intermolecular interactions in a wide variety of systems.  We have studied the effect of ionization on pi-pi interactions in benzene dimer and DNA/RNA base pair steps, the surprising importance of peptide bond interactions in drug-protein interactions, key non-covalent interactions in photosystem II, analysis of stabilizing non-covalent interactions in transition states for organocatalysis using our FSAPTand A-SAPT methods, comparisons of S-pi vs O-pi interactions in molecular torsion balances using our F-SAPT approach, the effect of non-covalent interactions in facilitating thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in organic emitters, and the morphology of organic semiconductors electrically doped from solution.  More recently, we have also begun examining how machine learning might provide very fast yet accurate computations for intermolecular interactions.  Standard machine learning methods do not work well for this application, but we found new ways to approach the problem.  In particular, our atom-pairwise neural network (AP-Net) seems to have big advantages over the standard approach to machine learning in chemistry, which is based on summing atomic contributions (our approach sums contributions from pairs of atoms).  Our results along these lines so far are very promising.  The PI has used the experience gained on this project to prepare new publicly available educational resources.  He has placed technical notes on his website, and he has recorded a series of YouTube lectures for students who are beginners at computational chemistry.
