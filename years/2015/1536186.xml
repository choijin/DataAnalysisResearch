<AbstractNarration>A better understanding of the linkages between geology, river processes, floodplain sediment, and river ecosystems that influence carbon storage in mountainous landscapes has implications for land use and environmental change.  This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate the natural ability of freshwater ecosystems in unmanaged rivers to effectively filter dissolved organic carbon content.  New insights into the natural ability of freshwater ecosystems in unmanaged rivers to effectively filter dissolved organic carbon content will be valuable to society and communities that source their drinking water from surface waters.  The doctoral student will provide new information regarding of how organic carbon is stored in upland fluvial versus lowland environments and how natural processes in mountainous rivers facilitate conditions for long-term storage and sequestration of organic carbon.  The sustainability of freshwater systems focus of this study has important implications for water resource managers globally as they develop regional plans for future water allocations.  The student will work closely with natural resource offices and government agencies to inform land resources and wildlife management.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on carbon storage in montane regions is critically important because these regions are globally impacted by environmental and land use modifications causing changes to river network systems and consequently affecting surface water quality and supply.  This project will address four core questions: (1) How long is carbon stored in floodplain reservoirs? (2) What is the role of episodic extreme disturbances in turnover time? (3) Does turnover time vary systematically above and below the hydroclimatic boundary of 2,300-m elevation? (4) How does carbon storage in valley bottoms change when biotic drivers are removed and multithread channels metamorphose to a single-thread planform?  The student will use in situ sampling, field survey, and existent map and elevation data coupled with laboratory analysis to longitudinally determine organic carbon at 24 study sites along the headwater streams in the Colorado Rocky Mountains.  The analyses will provide a quantitative assessment of the mechanisms of fluvial complexity of larger river networks that influence carbon retention and microbial processing.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We measured organic carbon storage along rivers in the form of downed, dead wood and floodplain soil. We focused on mountain streams in the Southern Rockies of Colorado and found that a relatively small proportion of the total length of streams is disproportionately important in storing organic carbon. Relatively wide, low gradient portions of these mountain streams constitute about 25% of the total river length, but store about 75% of the organic carbon. Wet valley bottoms with ponds and marshes are particularly important sites of carbon storage. Valley bottoms tend to be wet as a result of groundwater seepage from adjacent valley side, or as a result of obstructions within the channel in the form of beaver dams or channel-spanning logjams. Our research indicates that these wet valley segments, which are commonly a target of river management designed to drain floodplain wetlands and clear obstructions from channels, are actually a vitally important aspect of river health. We also found that the portions of the river network at higher elevations, where stream flow results primarily from snowmelt runoff, store more carbon and for longer periods of time than portions of the river network at lower elevations, where episodic flash floods caused by convective rainfall can result in substantial erosion of floodplain sediments.
