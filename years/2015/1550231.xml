<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be on the Real Estate Industry, specifically targeted at the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry, to help them increase revenue potential by digitizing their apartments through Smart Home Automation. It is estimated that the Smart Home Automation industry will reach $71B by 2018. The MFH industry will participate through additional charges to the residents for smart home automation support. However, the bigger increase in revenue will most likely come from better data and insights on their buildings which leads to opportunities to monetize that data and sell software targeted at MFH buildings. In addition to increased revenue, there is potential to save costs through more efficient use of labor and materials and through better management of energy. The MFH industry can also get insights on their entire building portfolio versus a single building and more efficiently manage their entire portfolio.  The MFH industry implementing Smart Home Automation technology has huge societal benefits by integrating with smart grids and utility demand response programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable the deployment of a scalable and maintainable infrastructure through the use of mechanisms including automatic pairing, tiered authentication, and network isolation in low cost, resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The problem with existing IoT pairing methods is that they are targeted at Single-Family-Home deployments and the number of nodes that needs to be paired are relatively minimal. However, this is not a scalable model when trying to address the needs of the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry.  In the multi-family dwelling, the sheer density of nodes creates new problems. The issue is that all the devices could easily be paired but to differentiate the nodes so that they authenticate and provision to the right apartment is the challenge. Developing a cost effective, scalable solution for this high-density scenario is a key component to fulfilling the value proposition of mass deployment in the Multi-Family-Home industry. The anticipated result of this project is that a proof of concept will be developed that gives directional guidance on the best way to solve the issue of pairing large quantities of end nodes and authenticating them appropriately to the correct apartment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Current Home Automation systems are designed for residential use in single-family dwellings.  While it is beyond the scope of this document to discuss all aspects of Home Automation operations, the area of investigation by IOTAS under this proposal is for the automation of the pairing and provisioning process, which represents the technical obstruction to volume deployment. For the sake of discussion, in a single-family home there is a limited need for automated system management because of the self-managed nature of the system, and the low likelihood of conflict with an adjacent installation, therefore we will focus on the Multi-Family Dwelling market. Automated Pairing (establishing communications to a network) and Provisioning (logical assignment within a network) is a necessary technical component to the notion of high volume, scalable deployments for Internet of Thing (IoT) systems.  Traditional implementations of IoT systems are loosely coordinated and individually maintained by a single operator.  IOTAS has chosen to apply an Automated Pairing and Provisioning concept to the Home Automation industry in the context of the Multifamily Dwelling Unit (MDU) rental market.   IOTAS has performed a thorough investigation of legacy, current, and speculative Home Automation protocols in an effort to leverage a suitable array of devices for maximum benefit. Of particular interest are the following: Insteon, ZigBee, Z-Wave, 802.15.4, Bluetooth 4.x, IP Based devices (WiFi/Ethernet). IOTAS invested a significant effort into researching the viability of each protocol as well as their immediate impact on the Home Automation market.    For the purposes of the Automated Pairing and Provisioning algorithm, the Endpoint must satisfy two requirements: 1) Default or Programmatic Discovery Mode &amp; 2)  Observable Test Load  While most Home Automation systems focus on point-of-use devices (ie, lights, outlets, appliances), a whole-home energy monitoring system has many benefits including continuous consumption monitoring and historical records of usage.  IOTAS is also using a Panel Energy Meter as a means of detection and identification of devices.  Several commercial implementations exist under various Home Automation Protocols, which allow per-watt monitoring accuracy.  SmartenIT ZBMSKT1 (Zigbee) &ndash; 15 amp load control &amp; monitoring outlet.  Suitable for lab use only.  Itron CENTRON Home Energy Meter (Zigbee) &ndash; Up to 300 amp load monitor (industrial/utility use only) Aeotech Home Energy Meter (Z-Wave) &ndash; Inductive meter up to 200 amps, suitable for residential installation   In the absence of physical dwelling units and field-installable devices, IOTAS has created custom test fixtures for dense installation within a single laboratory site.  These fixtures are electrically isolated to mimic the characteristics of electrical panels in an MDU setting.  They also support dense installation of endpoints in convenient fashion.  Note that while the total load on the test fixture is limited, all logical interactions and communications are representative of real world environments. A core aspect to the IOTAS Home Automation Platform is the Home Automation Abstraction Layer. The diverse set of Home Automation Protocols has led IOTAS to develop an abstraction mechanism to generalize the functionality of the Home Automation Platform from the specific implementation.  That is, the IOTAS ecosystem is designed to be Protocol Agnostic; any supported Endpoint will be accessible by any other Endpoint in the system via the Hub.  This is made possible by the custom IOTAS Hub which tightly couples hardware, firmware, and application functions resulting in a highly reliable, flexible, and controllable Home Automation Platform.  The IOTAS Home Automation Platform ideally would consist of commercial components (Hub and Endpoints) with a tightly integrated software application layer written by IOTAS.  However, in practical development the deficiencies exposed specifically in commercial Hub implementations has led IOTAS to pursue a Custom Hub as the central component of the Custom Home Automation Platform.   While it is sufficient to show the Automatic Pairing and Provisioning mechanism in a single electrical circuit as a proof of concept of the core algorithm, in practice the system is designed to demonstrate Network Isolation in adjacent dwellings.  IOTAS will continue to extend the basic Hub to Hub communications mechanism to increase the robustness and efficiency of the process.  This also will lead directly to coordinated building control of all dwelling units.  The body of work assumed by IOTAS during Phase 1 development has validated the technical hypotheses surrounding Automatic Pairing and Provisioning in the context of immediately available commercial technology specifically for MDU.  The deficiencies in consumer-grade Home Automation platforms for MDU has reinforced the need for IOTAS to assume a leadership role in standards development for hardware manufacturing and software integration.
