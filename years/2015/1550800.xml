<AbstractNarration>A new age of technology is dawning on the field of speech recognition and analysis. This has begun to become publicly visible through the increasing availability of impressive tools such as Siri and Google Translate, but these consumer-ready tools only scratch the surface of the potential that research-quality speech engineering applications unlock. However, these capabilities remain practically unrecognized by the education research community. This one-year Capacity-Building Project (CAP) will build partnerships among top researchers and develop expertise from both education and speech engineering backgrounds through a series of workshops to bring together four leading spoken language technology and education research groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will unite the extensive education research and educational technology backgrounds at the Concord Consortium and SRI International's Center for Technology in Learning and bring them together with two of the strongest groups in spoken language technology research, the Speech Technology and Research Laboratory at SRI International and the Center for Robust Speech Systems at the University of Texas at Dallas.  This will provide the foundations for educational research areas as diverse as collaboration, argumentation, discourse analysis, teacher questioning, emotion, and engagement. Spoken language technologies will provide efficiencies, insight, and entire new methodologies for approaching these research areas, and they will do so while students and teachers assume more natural modes - those of the naturalistic language-based interactions that have formed the basis of educational interchange for millennia. This project will gather and summarize applicable knowledge about the current state of these fields and generate central papers and momentum suitable for bringing together and helping launch a new interdisciplinary field of study, spoken language technology for education. The work of this CAP proposal will generate the initial necessary connections and create the first definitions required to move toward proposals, actions, and research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  A new age of technology has begun to dawn on the field of speech recognition and analysis. Consumer applications have begun to blossom, and research-quality speech engineering applications are significantly more powerful. Since learning, especially in classroom environments, is dominated by speech in all forms, such technologies hold great promise for transforming education research. However, they remain practically unrecognized by the education research community.   This project represents a collaboration that unites the Concord Consortium and SRI International in capacity-building work toward these ends. Our goal is to outline and help launch a new interdisciplinary field that would sit squarely at the intersection of speech technology and educational research.   The work of this project, has fostered conversations, created resources, and generated an overall call to arms to help this important new field coalesce. We convened a series of focus groups among both the education research and the speech technology communities to help understand the field?s exciting possibilities and important needs.   As a key aspect of the project, we have disseminated the project?s findings widely via a variety of venues. These included a public webinar and a primer on the topic on the website of the Cyberlearning resource center, CIRCL. Additionally, we have submitted a publication to the journal Education Researcher under the Essay/Review category. The publication of this paper would disseminate information about the potential synergy that exists between these two fields broadly among the education research community and outline the important first steps we believe stand ready for uniting them.   We have also launched discussions within the speech technology communities about the development of a "shared task." Such technology tasks, which challenge outside groups to apply different approaches and algorithms to analyze a common publicized dataset, are an established convention in the speech technology community. Developing a standing shared task involving a dataset of speech audio from an education-related setting would establish further awareness of education-related concerns within the diverse groups of current speech technology researchers and make additional headway toward solving important problems in children?s speech recognition and analysis.
