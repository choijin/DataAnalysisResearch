<AbstractNarration>Muons are very much like the familiar electron, with many of the same characteristics (e.g. intrinsic spin and electric charge) but approximately 200 times more mass. Those similarities and that difference make muons a sensitive tool for exploring new physics and will be exploited in two experiments supported by this award: the MuSun experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institut (Villigen, Switzerland) and on the muon g-2 experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL,, near Chicago).  Proton-proton fusion is the initial nuclear reaction in a chain of reactions which are the source of the energy produced by our sun. The rate of this fusion reaction cannot be measured in the laboratory nor has it been calculated from first principles. In the MuSun experiment, muons will be used to study something like proton-proton fusion in reverse.   When a muon is captured by a deuterium nucleus, consisting of a neutron and a proton, the deuterium breaks apart into a pair of neutrons and a muon neutrino. The measurement of muon capture by deuterium will provide the necessary information to make possible a first principles calculation. That calculation will also provide a more solid theoretical foundation for the results concerning neutrino characteristics.  The new muon g-2 experiment at FNAL aims to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with unprecedented precision. Because the muon has intrinsic angular momentum (spin) and an electric charge, it also possesses a magnetic moment, that is, it behaves like a tiny magnet. The relationship between the angular momentum and magnetic moment is described by the gyromagnetic ratio or g factor. For the electron and the muon, g is very slightly greater than 2. This difference from 2 is the so-called anomaly. The anomaly, for both electrons and muons, can be measured and calculated with great precision. Any significant disagreement between the two is a hint of new physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technique for measuring the capture rate is simple. Negative muons are stopped in a detector filled with ultra-pure deuterium gas. The experiment will measure the disappearance rate of the muons, similar to any radioactive decay experiment. Because of the capture process, the disappearance rate will be slightly larger than that of free muon decay to electrons plus neutrinos (of both electron and muon types) - the difference is the capture rate.   The sensitivity goal of 1.5 percent on the capture rate will require the collection of approximately 20 billion muon disappearance events. To measure the anomaly, muons are injected into a storage ring, a doughnut shaped device, roughly 44 m in circumference, which guides them in roughly circular orbits. As the muons circle the storage ring, their spin vectors, which act like gyroscopes, turn faster than their momentum vectors.  The rate of the precession, which is extracted from the time distribution of muon decay electrons, is directly proportional to the anomaly. The experimental goal, a fractional error on the anomaly of approximately one part in ten million, should provide a stringent test of possible new physics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The grant has supported a broad array of activities in high energy physics. The MuSun Experiment at PSI (in Villigen Switzerland0 is measuring the rate of muon capture on deuterium, which can be used to determine the rate of proton-proton fusion, the process responsible for energy production in the sun and other Main Sequence stars. Graduate student Xiao Luo produced the best-ever measurement of the capture rate in her 2016 dissertation. Luo's result will remain blinded until the results of analyses at other institutions are made final. Luo is the first female graduate student to defend a dissertation in the 40 year history of the Intermediate Energy Group at Boston University. Following the defense of her thesis, she became a postdoctoral fellow at Yale, working in neutrino physics, and has recently accepted a faculty offer at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<br /><br />The goal of the Muon g-2 experiment at FNAL is to make the best-ever measurement of the ratio of the muon's magnetic moment to its intrinsic angular momentum - the results of the last measurement (at Brookhaven National Laboratory) hinted at signs of new physics. The experiment started data production in Feburary 2018 - this most recent data set should produce a result comparable in statistical precision to the last BNL result. Undergraduates Deepak Sathyan and Nathaniel Avish, assembled and tested electronics for the wire chambers, fixed a simulation package used to model the wire chamber signals, and worked on simulation and data analysis. Avish worked on the fast rotation analysis, determing the radii of muons stored inside the donut-shaped magnet. Sathyan worked on track reconstruction using the wire chamber data, increasing its speed by a factor of 20. Avish is starting a PhD program in physics this fall at SUNY Albany. Sathyan, a 2018 graduate, is starting a PhD program at the University of Maryland. Sathyan's work will be continued by rising junior Ryan McCarthy, who started working with the group in late 2017.<br /><br />The goal of Fermilab's LArIAT experiment (Liquid Argon in a Test Beam) is to perform calibrations, measure cross sections and serve as a general test platform for the next generation of liquid argon detectors. Because of their precise 3D tracking and detailed calorimetry, liquid argon detectors are being used in a number of current and upcoming neutrino experiments. Carey worked with Boston University undergraduate Dan Smith on beam line measurements that determine the identity of particles entering LArIAT's liquid argon TPC. Shiyu Zhou, a recent Boston University graduate (she is now enrolled in the graduate physics program at BU) worked on an analysis of data from the light collection system. Carey has also taken on the job of chief editor for LArIAT's instrumentation paper, which should be completed by the end of 2018. <br /><br />During the final year of the grant, Carey hosted student groups from nine different high schools, public and private, in the physics department's teaching labs. The groups performed the famous charge to mass ration of the electron experiment. Between 9 am and noon, the students took data, calculated e/m ratios, reviewed the results with Carey (who did not avoid the subject of systematic errors) and then celebrated with pizza. Also, while students were eating their pizza, Carey delivered a talk on particle physics in general and the muon g-2 experiment in particular. Neither the students nor their teachers complained that the particle physics lecture meant that they had to stay at Boston University for an extra 45 minutes or so. In addition, both Sathyan and Avish (and other undergraduates) served as teaching fellows/laboratory assistants. The physics teachers were delighted to give their students the opportunity to do a very interesting and important experiment and all groups plan to return next year.
