<AbstractNarration>Many modern data analysis techniques and applications in machine &lt;br/&gt;learning try to learn what input data has the largest effects on the &lt;br/&gt;outputs. Rayleigh Quotients (RQ), or, more generally, RQ-type &lt;br/&gt;objective functions, are the basis of a mathematical technique that &lt;br/&gt;captures this information. This project conducts in-depth theoretical &lt;br/&gt;and algorithmic studies of three RQ-type optimizations: robust RQ &lt;br/&gt;optimizations that can handle data uncertainty, constrained RQ-type &lt;br/&gt;optimizations that can incorporate prior information from image &lt;br/&gt;segmentation or data clustering, and trace ratio optimizations that &lt;br/&gt;can perform multi-view spectral clustering. This project improves &lt;br/&gt;understanding of this practically important and user-oriented &lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory, creating computational methods that are embodied &lt;br/&gt;in open-source software. It not only advances mathematical theory &lt;br/&gt;and optimization algorithms in data science, but trains computer &lt;br/&gt;science and computational mathematics graduate students in &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary knowledge and tools necessary to undertake the &lt;br/&gt;project successfully. The PIs also involve undergraduate students &lt;br/&gt;in all aspects of this research project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs expect to produce a unified view of RQ-type optimizations, &lt;br/&gt;reformulating them into linear and nonlinear eigenvalue problems for &lt;br/&gt;which new variational principles can characterize the optimal &lt;br/&gt;solutions. These new principles should expose the numerical linear &lt;br/&gt;algebra characteristics of the underlying problems, supporting the &lt;br/&gt;development of fast algorithms that exploint the mathematical &lt;br/&gt;properties and sparse data structure.</AbstractNarration>
