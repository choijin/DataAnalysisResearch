<AbstractNarration>Over the past three years, the SaTC program has funded about 50 research projects bringing together social scientists and computer scientists in new collaborations, where the two scientists had not previously performed research together.  These projects were invited through a series of NSF Dear Colleague Letters. This workshop brings together researchers from these projects, for a 1.5 day workshop (to be scheduled in early calendar 2016 in the Washington DC area) that will include a mixture of individual presentations and group discussions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop participants will explores measures of success and challenges in doing these projects like institutional barriers for interdisciplinary collaboration, barriers for publication, and difficulty in attracting and retaining students. The participants will also identify areas where further collaborations would be worthwhile, and barriers to submitting and being funded via traditional proposals/solicitations. The outcomes will be documented in a public written report that defines lessons learned from mixing the disciplines, and suggestions for future efforts to encourage such cross-disciplinary collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This workshop brought together social scientists, computer scientists, and others funded under a "new collaborations" program.  It examined lessons learned from mixing the disciplines, and suggested future efforts to improve cross-disciplinary collaboration.   This workshop was designed to identify:  measures of success and challenges in working on interdisciplinary projects (e.g., institutional barriers for interdisciplinary collaboration, ease/barriers to publication, ease/difficulty of attracting/retaining students); barriers to submitting proposals  in response to (and being funded by) traditional solicitations; emerging concerns associated with interdisciplinary research partnerships; and areas where further collaborations would be worthwhile.   While many topics were discussed, two main themes emerged:   Signals of quality in interdisciplinary research Facilitating and incentivizing interdisciplinary interaction in cybersecurity and privacy research   In-depth further discussion revealed that "Signals of quality in interdisciplinary research" revolved around two concerns: lack of a common language and the reward structure for research scientists.     Lack of a common language.      A barrier exists when one community is expecting language that means something specific to their discipline but may mean something different, or lack meaning, to others.  This can create challenges, especially when research in the different disciplines is just as rigorous but the perception of rigor varies depending on the terminology used.     Reward structure.      One persistent theme was recognition by peers, especially as it relates to journal reviewing and to university tenure and promotion decisions.  Not having a common interdisciplinary language in cybersecurity and privacy can lead to misunderstandings, even ignorance of certain elements that one discipline may see as basic.  These misunderstandings can then lead to invalid assessments of the quality of both research and researchers.     Differing proxies for measuring high quality research exist.  Some disciplines (most social sciences) use acceptance of articles submitted to journals or published books as a proxy for high quality research, while other disciplines (especially computer science) use acceptance of articles submitted to peer-reviewed conferences or workshops.      Funding as a proxy for quality was also discussed.   In some institutions, funding tends to be viewed as a signal of quality research, but in other institutions or departments, funding is not viewed as particularly indicative of the value of the research endeavor.     By its very nature, interdisciplinary research requires stepping out of one?s field of research and therefore also requires some extra effort, compared to traditional disciplinary research, in order to obtain recognition of quality.  Participants provided a useful list of possible indicators that could be used to assess the quality of interdisciplinary research across fields.  This list is provided in the detailed project report available at the project?s website, https://cspri.seas.gwu.edu/lasting-relationships-between-computer-scientists-social-scientists,  which also includes pointers to a large numbers of individual papers submitted before the workshop.     Interdisciplinary work in cybersecurity has important implications for society at large.  Business and government need more and better interdisciplinary work on a number of  Issues such as blockchain transactions, social media control and attribution, and cryptography policy.  These all have direct implications for democratic systems.                   Last Modified: 10/23/2017       Submitted by: Lance J Hoffman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
