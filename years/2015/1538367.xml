<AbstractNarration>This interdisciplinary project will create a topology optimization-driven framework for the design and manufacture of 3D woven materials with tunable vibration damping capabilities. 3D weaving is a highly efficient manufacturing process where yarns or wires are arranged in a sequence of orthogonal patterns. Topology optimization is a computational, systematic approach for designing the micro-scale architecture of materials.  This project will integrate these two approaches to design, manufacture, and experimentally test 3D woven metallic materials whose micro-architecture is optimized to achieve targeted damping properties at elevated temperatures. Such materials would find a broad range of applications in transportation, manufacturing, power generation and most structural applications that are susceptible to fatigue and elevated temperature exposure.  It would also create a new avenue of applications for textile manufacturers. In addition to the development of this new class of materials, the project will develop Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related activities that will train and engage graduate, undergraduate and elementary school students at a variety of levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will couple topology optimization with 3D weaving to design and efficiently manufacture micro-architected lattice materials with optimized damping properties.  Although typical 3D woven fabrics serve as preforms that are infiltrated with resin to create composite materials, this project will focus on the 3D weaving of micro-scale metallic wires that are then bonded to create porous, lightweight lattices.  These wires will be 3D woven into patterns that are dictated by the topology optimization design engine with the goal of enhancing and controlling observed damping mechanisms, including inertial damping and Coulomb damping.  Design optimization algorithms will be developed that integrate the manufacturing constraints of 3D weaving into the topology optimization methodology. Material processing in the form of wire joining and surface treatments will be developed to further exploit these damping mechanisms. Optical characterization of material architecture, including measurement of wire orientations and flaws, and experimental property measurements at temperature will inform and validate the computational design methodology and manufacturing processes, much in the theme of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Three dimensional (3D) weaving is a scalable manufacturing process where sets of yarns or wires are oriented in alternating orthogonal directions, known as warp and fill, and are bound together with yarns or wires running through the thickness, known as the Z direction.  Although typically used as preforms that are then infiltrated with resin to create a solid composite material, unique combinations of properties can be obtained by weaving metallic wires into prescribed patterns (architectures) to create porous micro-lattices (without resin infiltration).  The multidisciplinary team at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) aimed to improve understanding of the behavior of these micro-lattice material systems and create design methods capable of optimizing lattice architecture, wire material, and wire bonding in order to customize the mechanical properties of the resulting lightweight material system.    Topology optimization, a computational tool that automates the design of high performance components and products, was the centerpiece of the micro-lattice design methodology.  Several new topology optimization algorithms were created, highlighted by new methods for optimizing the design of lattices with 3D weaving constraints (ensuring that optimized designs were readily manufacturable), lattices with topologically-dependent bonding for tailored load transfer, and lattices and structures subjected to dynamic loads that are either pulsing in a predictable manner, or that are random, such as ambient vibrations.  Optimized designs were manufactured by the JHU team using a 3D weaving loom adapted for this project, and were modified in post-processing to achieve bonding between selected wires. Manufactured lattices were then characterized using microscopy to improve understanding of how manufacturing and processing parameters influence the resulting lattice geometry and bond distribution, and were experimentally tested to measure mechanical properties, including quasi-static stiffness and damping loss coefficient under low frequency (less than 100 Hz) and high frequency (up to 5 kHz) excitations.  High fidelity finite element modeling was used together with the characterization and experimental testing results to improve understanding of these woven lattices.   In addition to the creation of new automated design optimization methods, the project identified several key mechanisms that influence the ability of the micro-lattices to damp motion, including friction between sliding wires and wire collisions.  Measured damping loss coefficients of the metallic lattices were order(s) of magnitude larger than a solid plate of the base metal material, and were similar in magnitude to many polymers, while offering significantly larger stiffness and maximum service temperature than polymers, providing property combinations that do not exist in bulk materials. Additionally, optimizing the architecture, wire material, and bonding locations allowed the team to create metallic lattices providing a broad range of stiffness and damping capabilities, clearly demonstrating the ability to customize the properties of the material system.    Results of the project were disseminated broadly through peer-reviewed publications and through presentations at scientific conferences, workshops, and seminars, including seminars delivered to industry, academia, and government laboratories.  The team also created hands-on activities for delivery at science fairs of a local elementary school, participated in other STEM outreach activities, created new course content on topics of architected materials, textile manufacturing, and design optimization for undergraduate and graduate students, and provided research opportunities for multiple doctoral, masters and undergraduate students, thus providing a direct impact on future workforce development at multiple levels of education.   The integrated design-manufacture framework leverages the automated and highly efficient process of 3D weaving, a highly scalable manufacturing process with minimal material waste. The use of metallic wires with high service temperatures enables the creation high-temperature materials with tunable stiffness and damping properties.  Such materials would find a broad range of&#8232;applications in transportation, manufacturing, power generation and most structural applications&#8232;that are susceptible to fatigue and elevated temperature exposure.  The ability to tailor stiffness of the porous micro-lattices through design of material architecture, as well as create coatings in post-processing, leads also to potential applications in biomedical devices.  These applications also create new potential markets for textile manufacturers.        Last Modified: 08/09/2020       Submitted by: James K Guest]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
