<AbstractNarration>1511761(Erath)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to investigate experimentally and numerically the fluid structure interaction when fluid passes around a flexible beam. This is a representative model of air flow past the vocal cords. The study will focus not only on conditions representing healthy vocal cords, but mainly on cases where the vocal cords are not healthy. Results from the proposed research can, thus, impact speech rehabilitation and could be felt by many people among the roughly 30% of the population of the US, who are estimated to suffer voice pathology at some point in their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the proposed research is to identify the mechanisms by which a train of vortices advecting over a flexible beam incite motion in the structure, and parametrically explore this fundamental fluid- structure interaction problem.  It is proposed to  quantify how vortices produced during speech impact vocal fold dynamics in both normal, as well as  pathological speech. Currently, there is incomplete understanding of the interplay between the aerodynamic loading as air comes to the vocal cords and the structural response of the tissue. This deficiency will be addressed by experimentally and theoretically/numerically investigating vortex-beam interactions that arise from coherent structures passing over a flexible beam. The hypothesis is that the coherent vortical structures are formed from the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the shear layer of the flow. The excitation of the beam will be investigated over a range of nondimensional beam, fluid, and geometrical parameters. The experimental results will validate the theoretical flow model of vortex-beam interactions, which will then be used to extend and explore the parameter space beyond the limitations of the experimental facility. The theoretical model will ultimately be applied to a numerical model of voiced speech to quantify the role of vortex-tissue interactions on vocal outcomes. The fundamental problem of vortices interacting with a deformable surface also has specific relevance to the topic of using deformable electroactive devices to harvest energy from fluids. In addition to graduate and undergraduate student education, a plan for K-12 outreach is proposed, where the PI will partner with high school choir directors to provide classroom demonstrations relating voice and singing to science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has determined how a vortex ring advecting over the surface of a plate transfers energy to the plate. The physics of this interaction have been investigated as a function of the plate properties, the vortex ring properties, the spacing between the vortex ring and the plate, and the frequency with which successive vortex rings are produced. This problem is directly applicable to energy harvesting in fluidic environments, but also finds application to the study of voiced speech production, where vortical structures are believed to assist in driving the motion of the viscoelastic vocal folds.  The following key findings were elucidated. 1) Energy transfer to the plate is maximized when the vortex ring is positioned such that the outer radius of the vortex core is positioned exactly tangent to the surface of the plate.  Although this positioning leads to more complex vortex dynamics due to vortex-plate interactions, the decreased pressure in the core of the vortex acting on the tip of the plate maximizes the total energy transfer to the plate (see Figure 1 for a plot of the vorticity field as the vortex ring advects over the plate at two different spacings between the vortex ring and the plate). 2) Energy transfer from the fluid to the plate is maximized when periodic vortices are produced at the same frequency as the fundamental frequency of the plate. 3) Energy transfer from the fluid to the plate is also maximized when the vortices advect over the length of the plate within a period of time that is equal to one-half of the period of the fundamental frequency of the plate. 4) Based on the above findings, if the vortex properties in a fluidic environment are known, or can be measured, the properties of a plate that will optimize the energy extraction from the fluid can be determined.
