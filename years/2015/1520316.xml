<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to combine solar electricity generation and solar water heating into a single system, in a way that increases efficiency and reduces the total cost of both solar heat and solar electricity.   This has the potential to make solar water heating financially viable in much of the United States for the first time since the 1980's, while simultaneously improving the financial viability of solar electricity.  In addition, solar heat energy is cost-effectively stored in on-site hot water tanks, providing a means of using solar energy without impacting the nation's electric grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance knowledge of solar concentration optics by introducing a novel optical system that uses non-imaging optics and opto-mechanics to highly concentrate sunlight.  The photovoltaics (PV) industry has put tremendous downward pressure on the cost of installing stationary flat panels on commercial rooftops, but existing solar concentration optics systems do not take the form of stationary flat panels and cannot leverage these cost reductions.  This project will develop an optical system that fits inside a stationary flat panel of the same size and weight as a traditional PV panel, and thereby benefiting from the falling cost of PV installation.  The project is a cross-functional integration of several cutting-edge fields, including non-imaging optics, advanced optical materials, precision opto-mechanics, embedded controls, and rapid prototyping.  Its objective is to determine the technology's real-world efficiency.   It is anticipated to demonstrate peak sunlight-to-electricity efficiency of 25% and water heating efficiency of 45%, for a combined efficiency of 70%.  This represents a technological leap forward over the 15%-21% efficiency of today's solar panels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  As a result of the NSF SBIR Phase I project, Skyven has successfully demonstrated both technical and commercial feasibility of its commercial-building-scale concentrating solar thermal (CST) collectors.  The Skyven team built several generations of prototypes.  On the latest generation, the team has demonstrated measured solar thermal efficiencies greater than 70%, which is directly in-line with the team?s modeling and expectation.  The team has also established manufacturability of the product with a manufacturer-validated cost model.  The team has established techno-economic feasibility through the use of techno-economic modeling.  Finally, the team has used accelerated life testing to establish feasibility that the proposed collector can achieve a lifetime of 50 years without failure. Early in the Phase I project, Skyven pivoted from solar cogeneration to pure solar thermal applications due to product, supply chain and market related considerations that resulted in a solar thermal focus having the highest probability for commercial viability. More specifically, the main reasons were that the components needed to withstand the high temperature within the receiver are cost prohibitive for competitive commercial economics and also the suppliers of concentrated photovoltaics have struggled as the solar electric industry has favored traditional photovoltaics. During Phase I and IB, Skyven designed, built and tested the proposed solar concentrating collections system. 3D modeling was used for each component. Components were then prototyped and physically verified and then fabricated or 3D printed for injection molding. The control system for tracking the sun was designed and programmed. Multiple prototypes of the collector and received were designed and fabricated. A basic racking system was designed and built. The testing program was designed and implemented along with costing bill of materials and performing techno-economic modeling. Results of the testing show opto-mechanical pointing accuracy of better than 1&deg;, greater than 70% total efficiency of sunlight-to-useable-energy, and full system characterization with measured data within 20% of expected/modeled values.
