<AbstractNarration>We interact with online shopping and banking websites on a daily basis. Many of these websites are powered by data-driven applications. Such application often consists of two parts: an application hosted on an application server, and a database management system (DBMS) hosted on a separate server from the application server that maintains persistent data. Unfortunately, many data-driven applications suffer from performance problems, such as taking a long time to load a page or inability to scale up to serve large number of clients simultaneously. The state of the art in discovering and fixing performance problems in data-driven applications is to examine the two parts of the application separately, and doing so misses many opportunities in discovering and fixing such problems. Unlike prior approaches, in this project we will treat the DBMS and the application in tandem. In particular, we will devise new techniques and tools to help identify performance problems, understand the cause of such problems, and fix them automatically. This project will open up new opportunities in cross-layer program compilation and optimization, with the practical goal of improving the performance of data-driven applications that will have a significant impact in many aspects of our daily lives. The findings from this project will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate software engineering, introduction to data management, and compiler classes to be offered at the University of Chicago and the University of Washington. The outreach activities of this project will include engaging and advising students through special programs geared toward under-represented groups such as the Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates (DREU) organized by CRA-W (Computing Research Association -- Women) and Diversity Workshops organized by CRA-W.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the proposed research consists of three thrusts: (1) a new cross-layer program analysis framework that produces an end-to-end profile of data-driven applications by understanding the application code, the queries that the application sends to the DBMS, and how the DBMS processes such queries; (2) a program analysis and testing framework that identify performance problems in data-driven applications by leveraging the end-to-end profile created from (1); and (3) new means to optimize data-driven applications by transforming both the application code and the queries that are issued. These three thrusts will work together to improve the performance of data-driven applications and help programmers detect performance problems during development. Software developed by this project, benchmarks used for evaluation, and performance comparison with existing techniques will be released to public domain through the project website. Further information will be available at the project website (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~akcheung/coopt.html).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Improving the performance and efficiency of database backed software systems is crucial in the big data era. Unfortunately, performance problems exist widely in these systems, due to the semantic gaps between the interface design, the application logic, and the back-end database engine. In practice, these performance problems have caused many slow web pages, poor user experiences, and many unnecessary economic losses.   This project focuses on understanding, detecting and fixing inefficiencies in database-backed web applications and has made significant contributions to the efficiency of real-world database-backed web applications. - It conducts one of the first comprehensive empirical studies about performance anti-patterns in popular open-source database-backed web applications, offering in-depth understanding of several major types of inefficiency problems at the web-page design level, application level, and the database level. - It provides a variety of cross-stack database-aware program analysis tools that can automatically detect inefficiencies at different layers of database-backed web applications. Thousands of severe inefficiencies in the latest versions of widely used open-source web applications have been discovered by our tools.  - It provides tools to automatically synthesize more efficient web-page designs and fix inefficient use of database APIs in web applications. - It provides new techniques to synthesize better database designs based on semantic information automatically extracted from applications. - It opens a new direction of view-driven performance understanding, optimization, and synthesis of big-data applications.    The above techniques can help software developers to improve the efficiency and performance of database-backed web applications, greatly improving the user experience, saving resources in web servers and database servers, and reducing the development and maintenance cost of web applications.   The research results of this project have been disseminated through conference proceedings (9 research papers on top-tier computer science conferences so far), research talks, benchmark dissemination, and both PIs’ collaboration with industry partners. Particularly, open-source software development tools released from this project have been downloaded for hundreds of times; research conducted for this project has led to SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award, SIGPLAN John Vlissides Award, multiple featurings on widely-read industrial blogs and forums, such as "the morning paper", "Hacker News", and so on.    Multiple students have gone through research training in this project. Multiple of them have already finished or are close to finishing their Ph.D. thesis on the topic of this project. Out-reach activities and teaching development based on this project have also been conducted, with multiple undergraduate and high-school students, including those from under-represented groups.
