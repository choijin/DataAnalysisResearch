<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Kettering University will acquire an isothermal scanning calorimeter (ITC). Isothermal titration calorimetry has become a powerful technique for obtaining quantitative thermodynamic information about molecular interactions. It does so by sensitively measuring heat generated or absorbed by a compound upon titration using another compound. This leads to understanding the strength and structure of the interaction between the compounds. Binding between proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, small molecules, metals, nanoparticles, and polymers dissolved or suspended in aqueous or select non-aqueous solvents are accessible, making ITC extremely versatile. At Kettering University, the instrument will also be used by undergraduate students in their research projects. It will be incorporated into laboratory courses to provide training to students in several disciplines. It will be used in demonstrations and in hands on usage in outreach programs for middle and high school students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research especially in areas such as (a) investigating protein-small molecule binding to explain the molecular evolution of the Yersina phosphatase YopH; (b) elucidating potential cytochrome c-dependent cardiovascular disease protection mechanisms for catechins, protein-metal complex binding; (c) determining the affinity of blood serum proteins for anti-cancer Ru(II)-mono-arene complexes; (d) determining protein-RNA binding for RNA sequence specificity of a T. brucei protein known to regulate gene expression and (e) studying small molecule-nanoparticle binding to understand the thermal properties of sodium acetate trihydrates for their use in non-electric incubating blankets.</AbstractNarration>
