<AbstractNarration>This award will provide participant support for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in one of the world's leading annual conferences on plasma science and engineering, the 42nd IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS), to be held in Belek, Antalya, Turkey on May 24-28, 2015. This conference expects about 500 participants from around the world, including many of the leaders in plasma science and engineering research.  There will be many presentations in most of the major topics in plasma science and engineering, including: basic plasma science, computational plasma physics, geospace, radiation sources, inertial and magnetic confinement fusion, pulsed power, plasma aided bio-medical and environmental research, and materials processing. In addition the conference will have sessions on plasma applications applicable to a wide field of industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will be used to provide partial travel support for students to attend the conference. The students will be making presentations and participating in minicourses to be held at the conference.  The recipients of the student travel stipends will be selected using a merit-based selection process lead by the Student Travel Award Committee.  This program will be an excellent opportunity for young scientists to gain information and to interact with more experienced researchers.</AbstractNarration>
