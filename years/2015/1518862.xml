<AbstractNarration>This dissertation uses qualitative methods to investigate how inequalities based on race, class, gender and age are constituted in long-term recovery from tornadoes that occurred in Joplin, Missouri and Tuscaloosa, Alabama in 2011. This research has implications for disaster mitigation, making cities more resilient after disaster, and the creation of better social policies. First, since disasters are increasing globally this research will provide disaster practitioners with information about long-term recovery and how recovery varies by social groups. Second, because Joplin and Tuscaloosa responded to their tornadoes in different ways, this dissertation compares how varying local governmental responses influences long-term recovery. Third, based on our findings, the investigators will recommend future policy directions for disaster mitigation, prevention and resilience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dissertation project is a multi-sited qualitative study utilizing participant observation, interviews and archival work. The investigators ask the following research questions: 1) How have spaces inside Joplin and Tuscaloosa been constructed in classed, gendered, and racialized ways, creating particular privileges and vulnerabilities in processes of long-term recovery? 2a) What resources were available to people in Joplin and Tuscaloosa after the tornadoes? 2b) How does this vary by location and what factors contribute to this variation? Findings from this research can assist governmental and non-profit disaster organizations providing aid and resources in long-term recovery in ways that are sensitive to inequalities and cultural and geographic difference</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Though disaster studies are well-established across many disciplines, little comparative research has focused on long-term recovery and the complexity of inequality.  This project compares recovery form disaster in Joplin, Missouri and Tuscaloosa, Alabama. In this research, I find that inequities in access to housing in disaster recovery are based on already existing historic trends of segregation, white flight, and reverse redlining.  I also find that collective trauma, the tendency of trauma to accumulate to the community or collective level, seems to be more pronounced in Tuscaloosa than in Joplin, and I argue this is based on the perceived inadequacy of local, state and federal governments in their response to the tornado.  Additionally, I argue that this finding has to do with longstanding separation and historical patterns of inequality in Tuscaloosa.  Finally, I find that the use of colorblind racism varies based on geographic and social locations.   Broader Impacts:  This dissertation has implications for disaster mitigation, making cities more resilient after disaster, and the creation of better social policies.  First, since disasters are increasing globally this research can provide disaster practitioners with information about long-term recovery, and how recovery varies by social groups. Second, because Joplin and Tuscaloosa responded to the tornadoes in different ways, I contribute to the on-going dialogue about making cities more sustainable while also trying to ensure that in the process of sustainable reconstruction all residents' needs are met. Third, based on my findings, I recommend public policies for disaster mitigation, prevention and resilience.  Although the relationship between disasters and climate change is not causally straightforward, scholars from a range of disciplinary backgrounds warn that as the earth warms and sea levels rise, natural disasters will both occur more frequently and with more severity. Given the greater frequency of disasters (such as Hurricane Sandy and the drought of 2012) examining current policies and making them better equipped to deal with future disasters is timely and necessary.  Outcomes:  In addition to the findings of this research, there are two additional outcomes.  First, this award assisted me in finishing my dissertation.  Second, I was able to use some of the findings to formulate two journal articles.            Last Modified: 05/03/2017       Submitted by: Ashleigh Mckinzie]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
