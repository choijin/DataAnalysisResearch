<AbstractNarration>The El Niño-Southern Oscillation, which originates in the tropical Pacific, can cause significant changes in climate and weather patterns across the globe, such as droughts and floods. How the El Niño-Southern Oscillation will respond to anthropogenic climate change remains unanswered in the scientific literature. Through a collaboration with Dr. Andrew Lorrey of the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New Zealand, this research  will improve the scientific understanding of El Niño and La Nina events by collecting chemical measurements from coral reef samples to reconstruct changes in climate over intervals of the last millennium. Dr. Lorrey is an expert climatologist and curator of a south Pacific coral archive. This study will extend climate observations over a longer period of time allowing scientists to put current climate change into a longer paleoclimate context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the southwestern tropical Pacific, the dominant climate feature is a band of low-level moisture, known as the South Pacific Convergence Zone. During an El Niño event, this zone shifts towards the equator, resulting in unusually dry conditions in the south Pacific and unusually wet conditions in the central equatorial Pacific. Over 100 coral samples have been collected from the southern Cook Islands and will be used to reconstruct hydrological changes associated with movements of the South Pacific Convergence Zone and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Well preserved coral samples will be radiometrically-dated and age-modeled using x-ray computed tomography techniques. Stable isotopes in the coral skeleton vary with temperature and hydrological changes. Therefore, corals can be used to model changes in climate. To reconstruct climate over the past millennium, I will sample pristine, well-dated coral samples with Dr. Andrew Lorrey and use instrumentation at NIWA in Auckland, New Zealand to prepare the coral samples for future isotopic analyses at the Paleoclimate Co-Laboratory at the University of Maryland. This award is funded in collaboration with the Royal Society of New Zealand.</AbstractNarration>

During an El Ni&ntilde;o event, this zone shifts towards the equator, resulting in unusually dry conditions in the south Pacific and unusually wet conditions in the central equatorial Pacific.     Three well preserved coral samples, which were already radiometrically-dated, were scanned with via x-ray computed tomography. With this data, the corals were age-modeled and their annual density banding was identified. Additional material was used to develop a protocol for creating thin sections of the coral skeleton, which can then be analyzed with a petrographic microscope for quality control of sample materials. This work was written into an internal NIWA report and will form part of future manuscripts. The three coral samples were cleaned using an ultrasonic probe and then sampled using a computer-guided micromill. Over 2,000 carbonate powders were generated and will being analyzed for their stable carbon and oxygen isotopes at the University of Maryland. Output from simulations of coupled general circulation models were acquired and processed for future data/model comparisons using NIWA computing resources.     I have presented this research to the Department of Geology at the University of Maryland as well as the general public at Maryland Day 2016. The data and manuscripts generated from this project will be used to develop articles for submission to the peer-reviewed literature.
