<AbstractNarration>BIGDATA: Deep Learning in Higher Education Big Data to Explore Latent Student Archetypes and Knowledge Profiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data science techniques have revolutionized many academic fields and led to terrific gains in the commercial sector. They have to date been underutilized in solving critical problems in the US educational system, particularly in understanding Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and increasing retention for students traditionally underserved in STEM. The goals of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), through the EHR Core Research program, for the Critical Techniques and Technologies for Advancing Foundations and Applications of Big Data Science &amp; Engineering (BIGDATA) program are to advance fundamental research aimed at understanding and solving these critical problems, and to catalyze the use of data science in Education Research. Deep learning is a relatively novel method in machine learning (ML) that has shown great improvements over prior ML approaches in successful classification with very little a priori definitions applied to the data. For example, in image classification, these techniques have a high rate of success at distinguishing species and particular animals. This exploratory proposal will investigate the possibilities of using this approach with educational data from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Learning Management Systems (LMSs). Research has shown that it is often difficult to use traditional study designs with MOOC data as enrollment is open and many different types of people enroll in MOOCs. This factor has made it difficult to make these MOOCs adaptive to individual learners, an optimal approach to improving learning. The Principal Investigators will group people in MOOCs who are similar to each other to understand the different types of people taking the MOOCs so that learning activities can be tailored to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators will examine a variety of data, from the micro-level of backend data on timing to complete an exercise, or pauses between activities, to macro-level data such as course history and grades. They will use deep learning techniques to identify groups of learners with similar characteristics, the first step in making a learning environment more adaptive. The proposed research is ambitious and risky. Deep learning techniques show great promise and the Principal Investigators demonstrate that they could be extremely helpful in solving key educational challenges. The Principal Investigators have the technical and learning science expertise to carry out this ambitious endeavor. As more and larger educational datasets are developed, the field needs to expand its methodologies to learn from them. This proposal is unique in its potential for catalyzing this effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program.  The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Research funded by this grant brought AI methodologies to bear on problems and institutional data in higher education to make the domain a first-class beneficiary of nascent approaches using neural computation to uncover previously latent student behaviors and patterns. The work led to 13 peer-reviewed publications disseminated across a wide range of venues, including PLoS ONE, ACM Recommender Systems, and the International Conference of the Learning Sciences. Broader impacts of the grant included the use of course enrollment modeling research into a production academic planning and course exploration system, inclusion of several published articles into university course syllabi, and community building contributions to a growing multidisciplinary field of education data science.</p> <p>The most significant methodological contribution of the research was to draw a parallel between language and sequences of learner behaviors. In doing so, nascent neural modeling approaches from computational linguistics could be brought to bear on these data from a variety of educational contexts.</p> <p>Early research from the grant focused on data from large, free online courses, using Recurrent Neural Networks to find predictive signal in the clickstream behavior of learners in these courses [1]. Work quickly shifted focus to the higher-stakes context of a university campus, with a predictive analysis using similar approaches forecasting on-time graduation from enrollment histories [2].</p> <p>In [3], the parallel between student sequences and language was made more salient. It was found that neural embedding methods could be applied to enrollment histories to learn fine-grained features of courses (i.e., &ldquo;course2vec&rdquo;) and lexical relationships between them (Fig. 1). For example, the enrollment learned vector of &ldquo;Advanced Econometrics&rdquo; minus the learned vector of &ldquo;Econometrics&rdquo; equaled a vector whose nearest neighbor was &ldquo;Linear Algebra.&rdquo; Experiments further showed that elective choice played a large role in informing these latent semantics. Over 400% greater lexical validation and 63% greater course similarity validation accuracy was observed using student enrollment data over simulated enrollment data produced from degree structure and prerequisite rules. Semantic validation of neural embeddings had previously only been conducted on word embeddings.</p> <p>The findings of strong course semantics from big institutional data opened the possibility for this capability to democratize latent information about courses and enrollment cultures. A recommender system was developed to pilot the utility of these inferences to students. In [4], it was found that such a system scored highly in use intention and uniqueness of information compared to other student information systems. The study also represented the first university-wide predictive analysis of enrollment patterns and a novel visualization of all student majors at the University one semester before graduation. This first-of-its-kind visualization depicted the proximity of degree programs to one another in terms of their curricular subject matter (Fig. 2). Follow-up algorithmic work endeavored to allow students to specify their achievement goal (e.g., a difficult course) and receive a personalized recommendation to help prepare for that goal.
