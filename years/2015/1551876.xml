<AbstractNarration>This project will carry out new analyses of existing geophysical data with the complementary goals of advancing scientific understanding and improving upon future earthquake hazard forecasts. Subduction zones are where two tectonic plates collide and one sinks below the other.  Subduction zones produce the largest earthquakes in the world, such as the magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake of 2011 that caused widespread destruction in northern Japan.  This project will focus on two subduction zone regions: Cascadia in the U.S. and Hikurangi in New Zealand. Onshore and offshore GPS data will be modeled to determine the amount of slip released as slow slip events, as steady creep, or where regions are locked and not slipping. Slow slip events refer to slip on a fault that is similar to what occurs during an earthquake, but occurs much more slowly and does not emit damaging seismic waves. Locked regions refer to areas of a fault in which friction prevents slip, allowing energy to build up for future release in an earthquake. In contrast to previous modeling work, this project will use realistic, three-dimensional elastic properties of the earth constrained by prior seismic studies. The products of this project will directly inform earthquake hazard forecasts for both the Cascadia and Hikurangi subduction zones, which have major cities nearby (Portland and Seattle in Cascadia; Wellington in Hikurangi). Important additional information will be obtained for an International Ocean Discovery Program project scheduled for the northern Hikurangi margin in 2018 that is targeting the slow slip region. The project will support and train an early career female scientist who will be mentored by a more established female scientist.  The project also features public outreach through public talks in New Zealand and the U.S. and the incorporation of the results into lecture materials at two universities in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will generate new and improved catalogs of slow slip events and plate locking models for the Cascadia and Hikurangi (New Zealand) subduction zones. A Network Inversion Filter (NIF) technique will be used to process all available GPS data to identify slow slip events, and produce models of slip and slip-rate evolution over time.  The NIF technique is based on a Kalman filter approach, which balances a physically reasonable but inaccurate model of steady slip with noisy data.  Additionally, these NIF inversions will incorporate offshore ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data from the Hikurangi Ocean Bottom Investigation of Tremor and Slow Slip deployment during the mid-2014 to mid-2015 time period for the Hikurangi subduction zone.  These OBP instruments recorded a large offshore slow slip event in late 2014. These models include, for the first time, realistic, three-dimensional earth structure and the effects topography and bathymetry.  Long-term velocities of GPS stations will be modeled to obtain improved constraints on the plate interface locking region for each subduction zone. Plate locking indicates how much of the expected motion between tectonic plates is not occurring continuously at the boundary, and could therefore be released in earthquakes or slow slip events. GPS station velocities will be averaged in two ways: first only over times between slow slip events and second by averaging through slow slip events which will provide two locking models for each subduction zone.  Products will include new realistic 3D locking models for the two regions, slow-slip event catalogs for both subduction zones and a full-slip budget with uncertainties for each subduction zone as a function of location over the time period of study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project addressed the question of how motion between the tectonic plates is currently accommodated across subduction plate boundaries, where one tectonic plate dives beneath another.  Some of the issues we addressed include how this plate movement evolves in space and time (weeks to years) by imaging fault slip (episodic, slow earthquakes and locking of the plates between earthquakes) over time, using the best available data and techniques. Subduction zones are home to Earth?s largest earthquakes as well as ?slow slip events? (SSEs), which are slow motion earthquakes occurring over days to years. SSEs produce no ground shaking but produce movement of the Earth?s surface that we can detect with methods such as GPS.  The project focused on the Hikurangi subduction zone in New Zealand, and the Cascadia subduction zone in the Pacific Northwest of North America.  These subduction zones pose major hazards to the Pacific Northwest, and to New Zealand, so our results are of great societal relevance.  The project focused on four main aims: (1) addressing the impact of the Kaikoura earthquake on triggering of SSEs in New Zealand; (2) using both offshore and onshore measurements of land movement during slow motion earthquakes to resolve a full spatiotemporal picture of slow slip events in New Zealand for the 2008-2016 period; (3) Application of a new method to the Cascadia subduction zone that allows us to extract slow slip events from onshore geodetic data in great detail; (4) Incorporating realistic properties of the Earth's crust into models of slow slip and interseismic coupling at the Hikurangi subduction zone.   Our project serendipitously began just before the M7.8 Kaikoura earthquake, which struck central New Zealand in November 2016. Although the earthquake largely occurred on faults within the Earth's crust (rather than the subduction zone), it triggered the clearest example yet documented (globally) of widespread, large-scale triggering of a slow slip events on the nearby Hikurangi subduction zone, including up to 600 km away from the Kaikoura earthquake.

Moreover, in the months following the earthquake, Global Positioning System and satellite radar data revealed a few to tens of centimeters of rapid northeastward motion of New Zealand's northern South Island. These data suggest up to half a meter of movement occurred on the Hikurangi subduction boundary where the Pacific Plate dives down (or subducts) beneath the northern South Island, over the year following the Kaikoura earthquake.  This was provided clear evidence that the Hikurangi subduction zone is active beneath the South Island of New Zealand, a topic which has been heavily debated by geoscientists.   Slow slip was also triggered by the Kaikoura earthquake over most of the Hikurangi subduction interface, which had some important implications for future seismic hazard in the New Zealand region.  This widespread slow slip caused major concern for the New Zealand government. Our project results provided key information to the New Zealand government to help inform how these slow slip events triggered by the Kaikoura earthquake changed the likelihood of a future major earthquake in the central New Zealand region.   By analyzing patterns of surface movement during an SSE we can determine the slip that occurred. Accurate estimates are important of where (and how much) movement is occurring, because slip occurring during an SSE might otherwise be released in a damaging earthquake. Models to determine SSE slip generally assume a flat upper surface and properties of the Earth's crust that do not vary. When we considered these effects for a SSE offshore the North Island of New Zealand we found that inclusion of realistic properties of the Earth's crust results in much larger amounts of slip than expected. This impacts evaluation of earthquake hazards, particularly in terms of how much plate motion is accommodated by SSEs versus the amount that is being stored for future subduction zone earthquakes.  We also incorporated these realistic properties into models based on GPS movements over the last two decades, to determine where and how the plates are locking together and building up stress to be relieved in future earthquakes.  Together, this project has produced a new catalog of slow slip events for both the Hikurangi and Cascadia subduction zones, as well as improved understanding of where the plates are locking together (in New Zealand), with implications for the likelihood of future earthquakes.
