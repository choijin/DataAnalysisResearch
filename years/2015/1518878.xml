<AbstractNarration>Pressing policy questions with respect to Internet chokepoint, such as questions about Internet balkanization or the effects that a specific policy might have, are difficult to answer for two reasons.  First, the data available are typically limited to a single country or small cross-section of the Internet for a short period of time.  Second, the data do not lend themselves well to simple analysis such as averages or direct comparisons.  Research is needed that bridges the gap between collecting long-term, wide-scale data and answering the ever-evolving high level questions that policy makers have.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops advanced capabilities for measuring Internet chokepoints and analyzing and modeling the data in a way that informs real policy questions.  This project is carrying out Internet chokepoint measurements longitudinally and on a global scale, in multiple layers of the network stack including both TCP/IP layer filtering and filtering in social media.  The project also studies the role of tunnels and network virtualization in how different countries and organizations implement chokepoints in order to have central locations for implementing policy.  In order to accomplish these goals, the project is developing advanced TCP/IP side channel techniques for measuring TCP/IP layer filtering and understanding network topology, novel inference algorithms and natural language processing techniques to discern subtle manipulations of social media, and robust modeling techniques based on Agent Based modeling to analyze the data in a meaningful way.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the project will provide new capabilities: (a) to inform policy makers about violations or threats to digital speech freedom, and (b) to advise democratic and anti-chokepoint efforts on how to circumvent chokepoints and limit retributions to citizens around the world.  All source code developed as part of this project will be released under a GNU Public License (GPL) license, and the datasets will be made publicly available.  A key part of the proposed project is mentorship of graduate and undergraduate researchers in all aspects of research, and recruitment and outreach to middle- and high-school students in New Mexico.  The University of New Mexico is both a Carnegie RU/VH Very High Research Activity University and a HACU Hispanic Serving Institution as well as an EPSCoR state.  This puts UNM in a unique position to involve groups that are underrepresented in computer science, and truly disadvantaged economically, in world-class Internet measurement research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broadly speaking, an Internet chokepoint is somewhere where someone can gain leverage over Internet traffic or users because there is, e.g., a confluence of Internet traffic through a single location, a shared resource that can be used to infer information about other Internet users, or a vulnerability that is common to many users.  One aspect of this project looked at chokepoints in the Internet's topology and how this phenomenon changed over time.  We found that the Internet is increasingly divided by national borders.  Our findings have generated discussion in organizations that are shaping the future of the Internet, including AFRINIC and the Internet Research Task Force, an organization that is parallel to the Internet Engineering Task Force.  Another aspect of this project looked at the protocols that form the foundation of the Internet: the Internet Protocol and the Transmission Control Protocol.  Although these protocols have had decades to mature, we found that when two users share a server these protocols leak information about one user to another in numerous ways that violate basic security and privacy assumptions.  This research helped challenge some basic assumptions in domain validation (a key piece of how web servers identify each other as the real website a user wants and not an impostor) and privacy tools such as Tor, leading to planned changes in a DNS flag day to protect the Internet and a patch to the Linux kernel.    A third aspect of the research asked what we can extract about attackers and trends in cybersecurity by looking at hacker and security forums.  This can be an important tool for understanding what threats are currently out there and how attackers operate.  The project also involved underrepresented groups in research (both undergraduate and graduate), outreach to high school students, and the building of a one-of-a-kind Internet measurement infrastructure at the University of New Mexico.
