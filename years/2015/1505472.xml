<AbstractNarration>One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe.  A primary area to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another, i.e. oscillate. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).  This particular project will focus on the study of the oscillations of the neutrinos between different types. The award will support the work of one post-doctoral researcher as well as graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports work, using the neutrino beam at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), on the neutrino experiments: MINERvA and MicroBooNE, both measuring neutrino oscillations: muon neutrino to electron neutrino transitions. These oscillations are of great interest to the scientific community since they could show indications of BSM physics.  To correctly measure these transitions, precise knowledge of neutrino interactions with nuclei is required. This award will be used to measure these interactions across a wide energy range available at FNAL, which will be beneficial for both neutrino and nuclear physics. This will improve our knowledge of the neutrino flux, useful for future Short Baseline (detector near the source at FNAL) and Long Baseline (detector hundreds of kilometers away).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project was initiated to support future studies of CP violation  in the DUNE long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment which will start data taking in 2026. One of the major gaps in our understanding of the universe is the dominance of matter over anti-matter.  CP violation in neutrino mixing may be the key to that mystery. However, the CP violating effects are only experimentally accessible via long-baseline interference experiments that require precision understanding of neutrino production and interactions.  In support of this long term  program, this project emphasized development of precision characterization of neutrino and anti-neutrino interaction signatures in the 0.3-10 GeV range and the development of large scale computing infrastructure for the MINERvA and DUNE experimental collaborations.       This project resulted in (among others) the publication of measurements of low-multiplicity anti-neutrino interactions on Carbon  in the 1.5-20 GeV energy range with the MINERvA experiment.  These measurements constrain a variety of nuclear effects that influence the energy and rate observables needed for CP violation studies. In particular, multi-nucleon and final state interactions were observed and characterized. Neutrino scattering provides insights on nuclear structure that are complimentary to the work begin done in a similar energy regime at JLAB and lead to very fruitful collaborations with the nuclear structure community.     In addition this project  has resulted in the development of extensive computing infrastructure for neutrino experiments.  Although event rates in neutrino experiments are low, fine grained detectors produce very large amounts of data per event, especially in the early phases when zero-suppression algorithms are still under development. As part of this project we have developed large scale data handling and processing systems in collaboration with Fermilab and other international collaborators.     Graduate students and undergraduates were involved extensively in this research, both on scientific projects such as the quasi-elastic scattering measurements and in the construction of computing infrastructure.  This work provides a strong grounding in modeling and data analysis that students can carry with them into a wealth of other fields.  OSU's student body has a significant number of students from lower income backgrounds  who may be the first in their family to go to college and have  not been exposed to modern computing techniques before.  Work in our group has prepared them for future careers in all STEM fields.       Last Modified: 10/26/2019       Submitted by: Heidi M Schellman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
