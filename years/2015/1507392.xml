<AbstractNarration>Underwater ambient sound contains quantifiable information about the sound source. In the frequency band from 500 Hz to 50 kHz, dominant geophysical sources of underwater sound include the sound of breaking waves and rainfall. Other sound sources in the marine environment include geophysical sources such as earthquakes and volcanoes, biological sources such as cetaceans, pinnipeds, fish and crustaceans, and anthropogenic noises such as shipping, industrial noise and sonar. Stakeholders benefitting from monitoring the background sound would include oil/gas companies, off-shore energy production companies, government institutions performing environmental monitoring and impact assessment studies, private marine instrumentation companies and marine science and technology institutions. This I-Corps team has developed a low-duty cycle passive aquatic listener (PAL) sensor to monitor the background sound field in marine environments. This sensor can also detect acoustic events such as rain storms, passing ships and marine animals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PAL sensor is used to process and classify underwater sound from both natural and man-mad events in real-time. This technology is needed for three main reasons: monitoring off-shore activities for environmental impact analysis, enabling the creation of underwater sound budgets for detecting potential noise pollution in marine protected areas, and classifying underwater sources for meteorological, biological and defense applications. The PAL sensor is a combined software and hardware system.  Underwater sound is captured using hydrophones (underwater microphones) and then multiple algorithms are run on the captured sound to determine the type of sound source and quantify the source if its rain or wind.  Sampling techniques to capture the underwater sound in a continuous long-term manner are also used inside the PAL sensor.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PAL sensor is used to process and classify underwater sound from both natural and man-mad events in real-time.  Potential sources of sound that can be detected are marine life, weather events, cracking of undersea ice, off-shore drilling operations and ships.  This technology is needed for three main reasons: (1) monitoring off-shore activities for environmental impact analysis, (2) enabling the creation of underwater sound budgets for detecting potential noise pollution in marine protected areas, and (3) classifying underwater sources for meteorological, biological and defense applications.  A wide range of stakeholders would benefit from this technology such as oil/gas companies, off-shore energy production companies, government institutions performing environmental monitoring and impact assessment studies, private marine instrumentation companies and marine science and technology institutions.&lt;br/&gt;The PAL sensor is a combined software and hardware system.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was to evaluate the commercial potential of the underwater passive aquatic listener (UPAL) through I-CORPS training and customer interviews and demo system activities.  We conducted 101 customer interviews to learn about the commercial impact of our technology.  70 of these customer interviews were conducted in person at trade shows or at on-site visits.  In addition to the interviews we participated in weekly I-CORPS meetings where each week we presented our customer interviews and findings, which were evaluated by the I-CORPS instructors.  Using the instructor feedback and insights from our customer interviews, we were able to develop a lessons learned and technology video to showcase the commercial impact of our technology. In addition, we developed a demo system that is currently deployed at an experimental buoy facility in the Ligurian Sea operated by CNR Italy.  The key outcome of this program was a "NO GO" for the formation of an entity to pursue commercialization of our technology at this time.  Using the information obtained from customer interviews we have decided the best path is to initially develop and demonstrate a demo system and subsequently pursue an SBIR/STTR grant.  We have developed the demo system, and we are currently working on the demonstration activity and the development of a proposal for an SBIR grant.
