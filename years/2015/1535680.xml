<AbstractNarration>Water is a critical resource and a lifeline service to communities worldwide; the generation, treatment, distribution and maintenance of water workflows is typically managed by local governments and water districts.  Recent events such as water supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the looming California drought crisis clearly indicate society's dependence on critical lifeline services such as water and the far-reaching impacts that its disruption can cause.  Over the years, these critical infrastructures have become more complex and often more vulnerable to failures. The ability to view water workflows as a community wide cyber-physical system (CPS) with multiple levels of observation/control and diverse players (suppliers, distributors, consumers) presents new possibilities.  Designing robust water systems involves a clear understanding of the structure, components and operation of this CPS system and how community infrastructure dynamics (e.g. varying demands, small/large disruptions) impact lifeline service availabilities and how service level decisions impact infrastructure control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal emphasizes a new approach to exploring engineering systems that will result in substantial advances in the understanding of lifeline systems and approaches to make them adaptive and resilient.  Building resilience into urban lifelines raises a number of monumental challenges including identifying the aspects of systems that can be observed/sensed and adapted and to developing general principles that can guide adaptation.  The key idea is to develop methodologies to understand operational performance and resilience issues for real-world community water infrastructures and explore solutions to problems in cyberspace before instantiating them into a physical infrastructure.  The effort includes: 1) Developing a flexible modeling framework that captures system needs at multiple levels of temporal and spatial abstraction; 2) Developing real-time algorithms supporting resilience; 3) Designing adaptations for water systems using a data-driven approach; and 4) Demonstrating the important broader impact of the research on critical water system infrastructure at the Global City Technology Challenge and the longer term impact on infrastructure for a resilient control framework.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of ImageCat?s participation in the UCI-led AquaSCALE &ndash; A Middleware for Exploring Resilience of Community Water Systems research study was to provide domain experience in three technical areas: a) use of simulation methods to identify and detect damage to underground water distribution pipelines, b) updating of simulation results on pipeline breaks with post-earthquake sensor information on changes in water flow and pressure gradients in order to (re)calibrate simulation results, and 3) review project results from the UCI team and participate in project review meetings to assess research progress towards overall program goals.  In addition, ImageCat brought experience data from several past southern California earthquakes &ndash; mainly damage to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) water conveyance system to the project for validation and calibration purposes.  These events included the 1971 San Fernando earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake.  ImageCat played a major role in arranging meetings with local water purveyors including the LADWP.  The project brought together researchers from several different disciplines to focus on a hazard that greatly affects the resilience of major urban water systems, i.e., earthquakes.  The techniques utilized in this research study allowed simulation modeling to be augmented by post-event sensor technologies to produce the best estimate of system damage in large earthquakes.  The research was novel in that the locations of multiple pipeline leaks or breaks were analyzed.  The outcomes of this study will help to educate water system purveyors on the benefits of sensor technologies during natural hazards or disasters.  This ultimately has the potential to adjust capital improvement investments that could enhance the reslience of these systems.
