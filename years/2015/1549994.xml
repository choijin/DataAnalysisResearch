<AbstractNarration>This award will support a satellite workshop on Archival Preparation to be held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) in January, 2016. Under NSF Policy, investigators are expected to make available to other researchers the primary data and physical collections created or gathered under NSF grants. However, the metadata associated with archived data are often inadequate to permit data, e.g. sound files, from related studies to be compared; without an agreed-upon coding protocol, there can be no sharing and comparison across speech corpora. Invited participants will be asked to suggest specific coding conventions for such factors as socioeconomic and educational speaker demographics, and for language choice, stance and footing. Using appropriate metadata for these factors will facilitate sharing of corpora and research to determine how each factor impacts on language use.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A previous NSF grant enabled a workshop in which leading scholars discussed data protocols, obtaining ethics board approval for human subject research, and ensuring that the information gathered about human subject demographics, attitudes and the situations in which they were recorded provide enough scope and detail to permit meaningful comparison across studies, and thus encourage data sharing. Following that model, this workshop will extend the topics covered, and provide a training forum in which to develop protocols for sharable data that conform to NSF policy. This award will also support the participation of students in the training and discussions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientists of language have known for more than 60 years that pronunciation, word choice, grammar and other language features vary according to the age and sex of the speaker, the region where they were raised, their attitude toward their community and their conversation partner(s) and the situation in which they are observed, among a myriad of other features. These differences language may affect one?s ability to communicate and one?s evaluation, for example, of the speaker?s intelligence, education and trustworthiness. In addition, there is a relationship between the way a language varies at any point in time and the way it changes over time. Because of their impact on communication and other social interaction, language variation and change are critical to our understanding of society and thought. Also, the emergence into the market of human language technologies such as voice control of smart phones makes it ever more important that such technologies work for all ages, ethnicities, for both men and women and for all regions of the country (also of other countries) despite variation.  Historically, such studies of ?linguistic variation? have tended to be contained within a single ?speech community?, which is defined in part by geography, or a ?community of practice?. With the advance of technology, it is increasingly possible to perform large scale comparisons across many community studies and look for overarching trends. Similarly, the availability of digital audio and fast networking makes now technically possible to share data and attempt to replicate previous studies as a way of confirming that their methods were solid and their result reliable.
