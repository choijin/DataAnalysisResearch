<AbstractNarration>This project addresses power and control questions central to achieving maneuverable, autonomous, untethered, insect-scale, flying robots. The amount of energy stored per unit mass in even the best small batteries is low enough that flight times would be limited to at most a few minutes. Furthermore, when the high rate at which the battery must supply energy is considered, it is questionable whether a winged microrobot could even lift its own weight. Instead, this project emulates flying insects in nature, which use animal fat as fuel, with an energy density about 100 times greater than state-of-the-art batteries. Accordingly, this project will demonstrate liquid-fuel catalytic combustion engines expected to be capable of over 90 minutes of powered flight. This result will be achieved through innovative integrated modeling, analysis, design, fabrication, and control of insect-scale aerodynamics, combustion, and flight. Broader impacts will arise from application of insect-scale flying robots to, for example, artificial pollination, search-and-rescue operations, and field biological research. Indirectly, this project will produce new methods for energy conversion, novel algorithms for control synthesis, and fabrication techniques, applicable to a wide gamut of wheeled, winged, and legged microrobots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish the project goals, the research advances knowledge in three specific areas: (i) biologically inspired design and fabrication of aerodynamically efficient flapping-wing microflyers, where principles from nature are translated into robotic designs, employing a systems-and-control conceptual framework. In this framework, the interaction between aerodynamics, power, design, and controls is analyzed using tools such as input-output modeling and system identification; (ii) mechanical actuation using fuel-powered shape-memory-alloys-based mechanisms, where flameless catalytic combustion generates the heat required to induce material phase transitions, necessary for the production of mechanical work; (iii) control, which emerges naturally from the first two areas as new aerodynamically efficient designs require the invention of novel control strategies for stable flight and new techniques for controller synthesis. Similarly, new actuation technologies require the invention of new low-level, physically implementable controllers. In this case, the dynamics of the combustion-driven actuators and flapping mechanisms are nonlinear and time-varying, reason for which a significant part of the research effort is dedicated to the development and real-time implementation of novel robustly stable nonlinear and adaptive controllers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research funded by this project was inspired by the simple observation that insects such as bees, flies, and butterflies can seemingly fly tirelessly for hours, while artificial flying insects to date remain tethered to electrical power sources via cables. Similarly, crawling insects such as beetles and ants exhibit astonishing agility and the ability to perform mechanical work for long periods of time, while most of their electrical robotic counterparts remain tethered to power sources, either through wires or electromagnetic fields, and the few that exhibit a certain level of autonomy from the power perspective carry bulky backpacks on their backs. The explanation for this gap in dynamic behavior is that the energy sources used by animals (mainly glucose and fat) are very dense, while the energy source most used by robots is batteries, which exhibit very low energy densities. This phenomenon becomes obvious when we look at the specific energies of state-of-the-art batteries and fat. For example, the best commercial lithium-ion batteries exhibit specific energies ranging from 0.36 to 0.9 MJ/kg and those of experimental lithium-metal batteries are on the order of 1.8 MJ/kg, whereas animal fat has a specific energy of approximately 38 MJ/kg.</p> <p>Through this project, at the <em>Autonomous Microrobotic Systems Laboratory</em> (AMSL), we have advanced the science and technology required to create a radically new actuation method to drive microrobots, according to which high-energy-density sources of power can be utilized for this purpose. Specifically, the RoBeetle shown in Fig. 1 is driven by an artificial muscle that can use as sources of energy methanol and hydrocarbon fuels such as butane or propane. The RoBeetle has many unique characteristics. The most remarkable of these are its small size and weight. In fact, at just 88 mg, the RoBeetle is the lightest autonomous crawling robot ever created. The artificial muscle that drives this robot has a shape-memory alloy (SMA) core and a platinum surface that acts as a catalyst for the combustion methanol and other fuels. Under electronics-free feedback control, the heat released by the combustion process excites the dynamics of the SMA material composing the core of the muscle, which undergoes thermally excited phase transitions and, therefore, deformations that are used as actuation outputs.&nbsp;</p> <p>After RoBeetle was developed, one challenged that remained was that of high-frequency operation of SMA-based catalytic muscles. To address this problem, we introduced a new type of electrically powered SMA-based microactuator that can operate at frequencies as high as 40 Hz. This actuator enabled the creation of progressively better microrobots. Among them we can mention: the SMALLBug in Fig. 2; the SMARTI in Fig. 3; and the Autonomous SMARTI in Fig. 4, which individually broke several technological records. For example, the SMALLBug is the fasted (in body-lengths per second) SMA-based robotic crawler at any scale ever developed and at 30 mg one of the lightest; at 60 mg, the SMARTI is the smallest and lightest steerable and controllable crawling robot ever developed; and the Autonomous SMARTI is the lightest and smallest fully autonomous (from the power perspective), steerable, and controllable crawling robot ever developed. Furthermore, by combining the actuation technologies of the RoBeetle and the SMALLBug, we developed the first fully functional SMA-based fast catalytic combustion engine, which weighs 7 mg only and can operate at frequencies as high as 8 Hz. We have used and will continue using this micro engine to develop new autonomous robotic insects that are capable of functioning using high-energy-density sources of power.</p> <p>Last, it is important to mention that as part of the project, we conducted extensive multidisciplinary research to create novel flapping-wing flying artificial insects (see Figs. 5 and 6). As a consequence, we produced numerous publishable results in areas such as aerial robotics, <em>computational fluid dynamics</em> (CFD), nonlinear and adaptive control, experimental aerodynamics, sensor and actuator design, and material science and engineering. In this context, from a broader educational perspective, the project positively and greatly impacted the robotics and control communities in multiple ways. The most significant is that six students that directly worked on the project and one additional student that indirectly participated in this research were awarded their Ph.D. degrees during the past 2 years. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/15/2021<br>      Modified by: Nestor&nbsp;Perez-Arancibia</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1528110/1528110_10382368_1629003288780_FIG_NSF_01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1528110/1528110_10382368_1629003288780_FIG_NSF_01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 1: The RoBeetle"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1528110/1528110_10382368_1629003288780_FIG_NSF_01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 1: The RoBeetle"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The RoBeetle is the first microrobot of its kind.
