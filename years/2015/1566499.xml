<AbstractNarration>Understanding the computational hardness of securely realizing cryptographic primitives is a fundamental problem in cryptography. One such vital cryptographic primitive is oblivious transfer and understanding the essence of implementing it has significant consequences to cryptography, like bringing secure multi-party computation closer to reality. This research develops a new theory to explore this broad concept, namely the theory of computational correlations. This project defines an appropriate notion of computational correlations, leverages security guarantees to argue computational hardness results, and introduces the concept of computational channels in design and analysis of practical obvious transfer protocols.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of computational correlations is, among various other applications, useful to exhibit necessity of oblivious transfer to achieve certain notions of security and design rate optimal oblivious transfer protocols in the computational setting. Training the next generation of cryptography research and security professionals is a central goal of this project. This includes the design and development of new courses and course materials for undergraduate and graduate courses, development of active learning materials for the dissemination of knowledge, and engagement of minority and women students in research.</AbstractNarration>
