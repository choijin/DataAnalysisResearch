<AbstractNarration>This project is aiming at effective course engagement in and out of a class room through a Tailored Instruction and Engineered Delivery approach Using PROTOCOLs (TIED UP). A team of STEM faculty is restructuring three engineering courses into an integrated modular concept format using a model titled Re-structuring Engineering Courses for E-Learning and Integrated Virtual Education (RECEIVE) where complex engineering concepts are presented as networked sub concepts in a webpage, creating a virtual neural space. Each of these inter connected sub concepts is further linked to several learning tools, such as short video lectures, animations, mandatory activities and quizzes whose designs are based on a number of PROTOCOLs that leverage the latest insights from established theories of neuro and cognitive science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROTOCOLs are systematic procedures to be followed in a concept delivery using cognitive learning principles. The goal of a PROTOCOL is to enhance students' capacity to elicit patterns of meaning. Instructional PROTOCOLs for each concept are searching for optimum strategies that possibly create neural networks and synapses that essentially constitute the learning process. Modular breakdown of a challenging engineering concept is providing a better learning experience to students who learn at different paces. The TIED UP is systematically informing students about what to learn in a course as well as how to learn each concept using PROTOCOLs. The broader impact of this project is that it replaces traditional instructional methods with an outcome oriented student centered learning approach using engineered instructional strategies based on neuro-cognitive leaning principles..</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Pepperdine University served a facilitating role in this project, led by the Department of Engineering at Tuskegee University.  The role emerged from a project related to two areas deemed essential to the grant.  One was the use of pen-based tablet computers networked together in a way that enabled the classroom instructor to see work by the students, and enabled the students to see work by the teacher, in real-time.  This enablement permits rapid feedback between the teacher and the students, and aligns tightly with the Vygotskian theory of proximal development zones.  The second area involve the use of videos to enhance learning by engineering students.  The original conceptualization shared in a faculty development seminar at Tuskegee involved students creating videos to help peers learn academic content.  Outcomes of the overall project are impressive, and are summarized in Tuskegee University?s outcomes report.  The Pepperdine role was considerably limited, to collegial advising on the overall project and to the two areas above.  The screen-sharing model?s results were mixed.  A sizable majority of students found the approach to be positive, but it was not shown to associate with a statistically significant higher achievement by students.  The use of the overall model in which the screen-sharing was embedded did have sizable and statistically significant increases in student achievement.  This could reasonably be attributed to the intensive application of video-based instruction to accompany the overall approach.  The video work, though, was exclusively managed at Tuskegee and was based on a model whereby the instructor produced the videos, rather than students producing the videos for each other.  This was how the project was planned in the original proposal, and it worked well, though was exceedingly time-consuming on the faculty members involved.  One Tuskegee graduate student did participate in an international project to engage school age learners to teach one another through videos.  That was a direct outcome of the project.   The project yielded several ASEE-published papers, including one now in review that covers the full body of results from the complete project.
