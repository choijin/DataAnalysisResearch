<AbstractNarration>The subject of symplectic topology was developed in order to answer qualitative questions concerning classical mechanics, such as the existence and number of periodic orbits in conservative dynamical systems. Since the inception of the subject, results on rigidity, asserting various constraints on the dynamics, have coexisted with results on flexibility, yielding constructions that at first glance were counter-intuitive. While the most important developments of the last three decades concern rigidity, several new instances of symplectic flexibility have been discovered more recently. The goal of the current research project is to further develop both flexible and rigid methods in a search of precise description of the boundary between the two parts of symplectic topology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of the project are: &lt;br/&gt;-- development of effective methods of construction of symplectic structures; &lt;br/&gt;-- development of symplectic and contact pseudoisotopy theories, as necessary steps in understanding topology of groups of symplectic and contact transformations; &lt;br/&gt;-- systematic development of a piecewise linear version of symplectic topology as a necessary step in the development of topological Hamiltonian dynamics; and &lt;br/&gt;-- further development of symplectic field theory. &lt;br/&gt;The work on the project is expected to provide new methods for construction of symplectic structures on closed manifolds and to develop new effective techniques for computing symplectic and contact invariants of symplectic field theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rigidity and flexibility parts coexist in every mathematical subject.The rigidity part concerns with finding new constraints, bounds and invariants, i. e. quantities  which remain unchanged under the allowable transformations. The goal of the flexibility part is to develop constructions testing the limits of rigidity. In symplectic topology the interplay between its rigid and flexible parts shaped the development of the subject from its inception in 1980s.  The goal  of the current project was to advance both, the rigid and flexible sides towards each other, in a search of the ultimate border. A significant progress was achieved  towards this goal.  While it is still a wide  open problem which closed manifolds admit symplectic structure, the answer was found for contact structures. There were also developed a new method for construction of symplectic manifolds which yielded an existence result for a large class of symplectic cobordisms between contact manifolds. It was known since M. Gromov's seminal work that any exact  closed Lagrangian in a symplectic vector space must have some intersection points, and there were a long-standing conjecture about a  lower bound for the number of self-intersection points, in the spirit of V.I. Arnold's Lagrangian intersection conjectures. It turned  out that  in the general case no non-trivial lower bounds exist. In particular, any orientable 3-manifold admits a Lagrangian immersion with exactly 1 transverse self-intersection point into the 6-dimensional symplectic space.  An unexpected flexibility result was also found for the problem of simplification of singularities of Lagrangian projections, called caustics. Caustic can be observed in the real life studying  the  light reflection patters  in the glass or water. Caustics appear as loci of  the highest brightness. It was known since the work of V.I. Arnold and others that the local structure  of caustics can be arbitrarily complicated,  and moreover,  there are obstructions for removing higher singularities of caustics. The work under the current projecte  implied the so-called h-principle for Lagrangian caustics: one can get rid of all singularities but the simplest one, provided that certain necessary homotopical conditions are met.  A significant progress was achieved also on the rigid side, e.g. in the theory of contact orderability and  the development of  foundations of symplectic field theory (SFT) and computation of the SFT-invariants.  The work on the project had a broader impact. 5 PhD students defended their dissertations while working on this project. 5 more students and postdocs, including 2 women continue their successful work  further developing the results achieved in the work on the current project.   The results of the work on the project were published in several papers   appeared in some of the top mathematical journals, including Inventiones Mathematicae.
