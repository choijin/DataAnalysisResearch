<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The most common plastic polymers, polyethylene and polypropylene, are made from simple molecules obtained from refining and natural gas feed stocks.  These polymers are inexpensive, lightweight, versatile, and ubiquitous - and yet, given their molecular structures, their material properties are still far from optimal.  One reason there is room for improvement is that our understanding of the molecular origin of plastic properties is very incomplete.  A key property of plastics is that when you pull on them, they "give", rather than snapping in two.  To the hand and eye, that is what makes a plastic plastic.  But how does a solid material manage to "give" rather than snap? To find out, the PI's group will use computer simulations to look inside the crystals that make up common plastics, in which the long polymer molecules pack together like pencils in a box.  There can be defects in the crystal packing - trapped twists, called "twist solitons", that can move along the length of the molecule, like a bump under a rug.  Understanding how polymer crystals change shape in response to stress without snapping may give insight into how to tailor inexpensive, weight-saving polymer materials for a wider range of uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designing new polymer molecules is expensive.  Molecular simulations can be used to predict key material properties of molecular structures, to guide which new molecules to try.  A key property of polymers is how they flow when molten, because polymers are often made into finished products by melt processing.  Modern theory does a good job of predicting polymer flow behavior, if one knows two key parameters:  how "entangled" a polymer is, and how "slippery" it is.  To predict these parameters for a given molecular structure, the PI's group will model a dense melt consisting of a single long self-entangled ring molecule.  With these parameters, flow behavior of real polymers can be predicted, and used to guide design of new molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Confinement of polymer chains by the repulsive potentials of neighboring molecules plays an essential role in the physics of semicrystalline polymers and entangled melts.  The elementary excitations that remain active in the constrained geometry are a key common element in these disparate systems.  In entangled melts, these excitations are motions within the "tube".  In the crystalline lamellae of semicrystalline polymers, the excitations are twist solitons.  Chain stiffness intensifies the effects of confinement, narrowing the tube and increasing the soliton energy.  This proposal exploits molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations combined with topological methods to characterize the most important motions in these highly constrained systems.  These results will enable predictions for key material properties, including nucleation barriers, entanglement length and friction factor for melts, and the amorphous rubberlike modulus in semicrystalline polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of this proposal builds on success of using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to characterize twist solitons in polyethylene.  Twist solitons permit chain motion in lamellar crystallites, enabling the deformations that make plastics plastic.  Solitons proliferate in disordered "rotator" phases, which play a key role in nucleation of semicrystalline polyethylene.  Polypropylene is the second most common polymer worldwide after polyethylene.  It crystallizes in a packing of single-chain helices instead of all-trans ribbons.  Are twist solitons and rotator phases in polyethylene a fluke, or a paradigm?  Simulations will be used to discover if twist solitons and rotator phases also play a key role in polypropylene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part exploits PI?s group expertise in entangled polymer melts. New methods will be applied to problems of fundamental importance:  dynamical regimes for long entangled chains, structure of "hairpins" formed as branched polymer arms relax, and the rubberlike modulus of the amorphous region in semicrystalline polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding crystallization in polyolefins could lead to advanced products in a competitive global marketplace.  Trapped entanglements in the amorphous region are little understood, yet critical for large-strain plastic deformation without failure.  This key material attributes enables environmentally friendly "downgauging" of plastic films, doing the same job with much less material.  Efficient methods to determine fundamental materials parameters from small scale simulations could unleash a new era in computer-aided materials design.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How hard will those polymers be to mix?  Blending polymers is a convenient way to make new materials -- when it works.  But polymers tend to demix; small repulsive interactions, added up over a long polymer chain, can overcome the entropy gain from mixing.  Even when polymers do not mix, physically blending them as a fine dispersion can make useful materials, if the two kinds of chain intermingle enough at the interfaces of the droplets.  The width of the interface for demixed polymers is also governed by local repulsive interactions between different polymers; the stronger the repulsion, the narrower the interface.  The strength of these repulsive interactions is called chi.  Chi depends on the chemical structure of polymer chains, and also how they pack together in a melt, so it would seem all-atom molecular dynamics simulations would be a good way to measure chi.  But it's tricky, because measuring the work to demix polymer chains involves not only energy (counting up repulsive interactions) but entropy (whether chains pack well together, or have trouble finding comfortable arrangements).     Under this proposal, we developed an amazingly precise method for measuring chi in simulations.  Our method measures the work required to slowly transform or "morph" chains in a melt from one species into another.  By morphing half the chains in a pure melt of type A into type B, we reach an A-B blend.  If we compare the work to make such a blend, with the work to turn pure A into pure B, we can infer the work to mix A with B.  We have validated this approach on model systems, and extended it to predict chi parameters for real polymers, by transforming atomistic chains from one chemical structure to another -- finally providing a way to predict miscibility of chemically realistic polymers.  "Plunger" method for interfacial tensions.  Polymers crystallize very slowly, unless they are cooled well below freezing.  They have a large barrier to nucleate crystals, because the driving force to form the crystal is relatively small, while the interfacial tension between crystal and melt is substantial.  To predict nucleation barriers, these interfacial tensions are key ingredients.  Unfortunately, they cannot easily be measured experimentally.  We have developed a simple way to measure the tension between polymer crystal and melt using simulations.  We measure the force on a simulated "plunger", which restrains a melt from flowing into the gap between two crystals. This gives the difference between the crystal&minus;vacuum and crystal&minus;melt interfacial tensions. Separately, the crystal&minus;vacuum interfacial tension is obtained by integrating the force to slowly pull two crystals apart.  In this way, we can get the parameters we need to predict nucleation barriers for real polymers, and test nucleation theory against classic experiments that measure nucleation rates.    One way polymer scientists encourage polymers to crystallize, is to add nucleating agents -- a little pinch of "magic powder" that encourages polymer crystals to form in the cooled melt.  We believe these nucleating agents work by providing a substrate that interacts more favorably with the crystal than the melt.  Our new simulation technique can be used to screen candidate nucleating agents, by measuring the interfacial tensions between substrate and crystal, and substrate and melt.   Undergraduate research.  Computer simulations are a great way for undergraduates to begin to do research into the molecular origins of material properties.  These tools couple to visual insight -- you can "see" what happens, which stimulates new questions, in a rapid cycle of discovery.  And undergraduate research is a proven effective way to encourage bright students to pursue advanced work in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields.  Three recent research undergraduates are now pursuing PhDs at leading U.S. chemical engineering departments.  I am currently working with four research undergraduates -- one senior who just completed his honor's thesis (which will be submitted as a first-author paper), and three freshmen who joined the group last fall.
