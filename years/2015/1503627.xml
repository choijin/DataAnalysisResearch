<AbstractNarration>Non-technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to develop the necessary experimental and educational tools for the study, understanding and dissemination of the quantum dynamics of nanometer sized molecular magnets under a broad range of experimental conditions. The control of quantum properties of nanoscale materials has led to the appearance of new emerging technologies, such as quantum information and computation processes. Nanoscale molecular systems have great potential for ultra-high density integration and quantum information processing, which are technologies that base on the fundamental properties studied in this project. The proposed research is strongly integrated with a series of educational activities. Several graduate and undergraduate students will be trained at the interface between inorganic chemistry and fundamental and applied physics, and exposed to a large, interdisciplinary and international net of collaborations that the principal investigator has established over many years. In addition, the research supports an initiative led by the principal investigator to create new Minor and B.A. degrees in Nanoscale Science and Technology at UCF, which are built around three new nano-courses where the project's research will be showcased. The courses are offered as Service-Learning courses and designed to promote the early involvement in science of K-12 students in participating middle schools in the Orlando metropolitan area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to consolidate an integrated experimental and educational framework for the study, understanding, and dissemination of knowledge that details the magnetic properties of single-molecule magnets under a broad range of experimental conditions. The specific scientific goals are: a) to understand the role played by internal degrees of freedom in the quantum tunneling of magnetization in molecular nanomagnets, and, b) to study the nature of the light-matter interaction in SMMs in the weak and strong coupling regimes, with the goal of achieving quantum coherent control over the molecular spin in view of application in quantum information, molecular spintronics and related emerging technologies. The project goals base on an expansion of pulse EPR spectroscopy extending down to low temperatures (~100mK), achieved with the use of high-sensitivity microstrip resonators (including high quality factor superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators), is expected to enable measurements of decoherence rates with a sensitivity two orders of magnitude smaller than those attained in previous studies. Indeed, the experimental setup resulting from this project allows the investigation of the three primary sources of decoherence, e.g., dipolar, nuclear and vibronic. Diminishing and controlling sources of decoherence in molecular nanomagnets may enable the large number of gate operations demanded by quantum algorithms and quantum error correction protocols. In addition, their intrinsic magnetic molecular anisotropy makes molecular nanomagnets natural systems of interest for the emerging field of molecular spintronics. &lt;br/&gt;The research project is strongly integrated with a series of educational activities designed to train graduate and undergraduate students at the interface between inorganic chemistry and fundamental and applied physics, and exposed to a large, interdisciplinary and international net of collaborations that the PI has established over many years. The proposal strategizes plans to continue an involvement of underrepresented groups in research at all levels, as illustrated in a strong record of activities undertaken by the PI that promote diversity in the laboratory. In addition, the research supports an initiative led by the principal investigator to create new Minor and B.A. degrees in Nanoscale Science and Technology at UCF, which are built around three new nano-courses where the project?s research will be showcased. The courses are offered as Service-Learning courses and designed to promote the early involvement in science of K-12 students in participating middle schools in the Orlando metropolitan area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research outcomes of this project rely on an advancing of the understanding of the magnetic properties of single-molecule magnets under a broad range of experimental conditions.  The most relevant fundamental outcome of this project is the study of a single-ion quantum molecular magnet composed of Fe-doped Li3N that has allowed the study of resonant quantum tunneling of the magnetization in a comparatively simple and clean system (a single Fe ion embeded into a solid state matrix). The marked monodispersity degree and the ability to tune the concentration of spins places this system as an ideal candidate to study the quantum dynamics of anisotropic spins. This, together with the strong field dependence of the spin reversal allows us to create stable but switchable spin states that could act as a "quantum bit" at elevated temperatures.  The most relevant applied outcome of the project is the development of a time-resolved spectroscopic technique directed specifically to address the decoherence inherent to low dimensional spin systems, such as condensed crystalline samples of single-molecule magnets, with the ability to study thin films and molecules deposited on the surface of the microstrip resonators employed in our setup. Here we have demonstrated our ability to perform pulsed EPR experiments successfully and without heating of the sample at temperatures down to 100 mK on a planar microstrip resonator. This opens an avenue to quantum information operations involving highly mixed superposition spin states, as well as to exploring the interaction between such sophisticated quantum states and their intrinsic sources of decoherence (such as nuclear spins and phonon couplings), even in magnetically condensed samples and as a result of a full polarization of the spin bath.
