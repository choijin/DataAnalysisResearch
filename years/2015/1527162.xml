<AbstractNarration>As communication systems embrace ever wider bandwidths, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) struggle to meet rate, resolution, and power requirements. The problem is exacerbated by the massive antenna arrays under consideration for next-generation wireless, which imply tens or even hundreds of receive channels. In response, this project develops new communication systems that operate with very low-resolution (e.g., 1-3 bit) ADCs. In particular, the investigators derive fundamental limits on quantized many-antenna communication and design advanced communications strategies to approach those limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of low-resolution ADCs radically changes both the theory and practice of communication, motivating a thorough re-examination of capacity bounds, modulation and coding designs, receiver processing algorithms, and limited-feedback strategies. The investigators address these topics in the context of multiple-input multiple-output systems with massive arrays. In particular, they derive theoretical capacity (or achievable rate) bounds that account for coarse ADC quantization, imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver, partial CSI at the transmitter, and multi-user interference. They also characterize the mean-squared error achievable for sparse-channel estimation and the symbol-error rate achievable via equalization, both in the large-system limit. In addition, they develop limited-feedback strategies to provide transmitter CSI to the transmitter, transmitter-precoding designs that exploit that CSI, and optimized training sequences. Furthermore, they develop channel-estimation algorithms that learn and exploit channel sparsity; equalization (and/or multi-user detection) algorithms that take channel-estimation error into account; and efficient strategies for joint channel-estimation, equalization, and decoding. Finally, they develop optimization and adaptation strategies for the ADC thresholds, and blind calibration strategies that account for ADC imperfections. The research methodology leverages recent results from wireless communication theory, one-bit compressed sensing, and approximate message passing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:   From the perspective of intellectual merit, the primary outcomes of this project were 1) the development of high-dimensional inference algorithms based on approximate message-passing (AMP) methods and 2) the application of these algorithms to problems faced in next-generation wireless communications systems.  Although the primary focus of this project was to address the challenges that result when the communications receiver uses analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with very low precision (e.g., 1-4 bits), the methods developed are applicable to a much wider range of signal recovery problems, such as those encountered in compressive sensing and phase retrieval.   Regarding the development of AMP-based inference based methods, the outcomes were as follows.  First, a so-called "Vector AMP" (VAMP) algorithm was proposed that generalizes the original AMP algorithm (of Donoho, Maleki, and Montanari) from the case of i.i.d. random matrices to right-rotationally invariant random matrices, yielding an algorithm that can be applied to a much wider range of problems.  For example, VAMP is much more robust to ill-conditioning in the measurement matrix than AMP.  A rigorous theoretical analysis of VAMP was performed in the large-system limit, establishing that VAMP is Bayes-optimal in a certain operating regime.  Next, an expectation-maximization (EM)-based extension of VAMP was proposed to handle the case where the distributions of the signal and noise contain unknown hyper-parameters.  A rigorous theoretical analysis of EM-VAMP in the large-system limit showed that it yields asymptotically consistent hyper-parameter estimates under certain identifiability conditions.  In addition, both VAMP and EM-VAMP were extended to handle generalized-linear models, such as those that arise under measurement quantization or loss of phase.  Along a different direction, the project established connections between the AMP and VAMP algorithms and deep neural networks through the "algorithmic unfolding" principle.  One particularly interesting outcome was that, by training the unfolded-VAMP network, one recovers the original VAMP algorithm itself.   Regarding the application of AMP-based inference methods to next-generation wireless communications systems, the outcomes were as follows.  First, unfolded-AMP and VAMP-based networks were applied to two problems faced in the Internet-of-Things (IOT), namely compressive random access and massive-MIMO channel-estimation.  Here, MIMO means "multiple-input/multiple-output".  Second, a new approach to joint channel-estimation/equalization/decoding of single-carrier communications over frequency-selective channels was developed based on the Parametric Bilinear Generalized AMP (PBiGAMP) algorithm previously developed by the PI.  The approach was shown to achieve state-of-the-art bit-error-rate with low computational complexity, as enabled by the use of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs).  The previous two method assume the use of high-precision ADCs, which is not practical in millimeter-wave (mmW) communication systems.  Thus, a third outcome of the project was the development of channel estimation algorithms for mmW systems with few-bit ADCs.  For this latter task, both AMP- and VAMP-based methods were designed, in conjunction with carefully designed pilot sequences, to achieve state-of-the-art estimation performance.  A fourth outcome of the project was the development of joint channel-estimation/equalization/decoding schemes for mmW systems with few-bit ADCs.  Here, the use of PBiGAMP and FFT-based processing enabled the design of receivers compatible with the IEEE 802.11ad standard but using only 3 bits per ADC.   Broader Outcomes:   The broader outcomes of the project were as follows.  First, the project significantly contributed to the PhD education of 7 Ph.D. students in the STEM disciplines, which is important contribution to the national work-force.  Second, the methods developed in this project are applicable to a wide range of high-dimensional inference problems beyond those in wireless communications.  As one example, a relatively small change in the algorithm formulation allowed the application of the VAMP and EM-VAMP algorithms to the phase-retrieval problem encountered in optics.
