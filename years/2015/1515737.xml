<AbstractNarration>The control of hormone signaling before, during, and after cell maturation requires an intricate program of coordinated activities.  During growth and development, tissues undergo expansion and specialization to adapt to the physiological needs of the animal.  Variations in cell-to-cell responsiveness within a tissue depends on the portfolio of proteins available for signaling cellular change.  Cell sub-compartments, or microenvironments, may enhance or desensitize signals according to environmental cues.  This project tests the hypothesis that melanin-concentrating hormone, or MCH, signals changes as a fat cell matures, and that MCH also participates in the fat cell maturation process.  Results will enhance our understanding of the interplay between appetite signaling and fat storage.  Hands-on student learning is emphasized through independent research experiences, and by providing an interdisciplinary framework that engages undergraduate and Masters students in the scientific method and technological advances in receptor biology, within the context of human obesity. Basic research on the development of adipose tissue is relevant to biology, medicine and food science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To gain a more complete understanding of how cells respond to G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-derived signals, the role of membrane microenvironments must be considered; that individual sub-populations of proteins may vary across different regions of the cell, and that differentiation alters those microenvironments.  The differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes and the GPCR signaling pathway were chosen as a signaling microenvironment.  It is targeted by melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), which signals appetite in many mammals.  This project specifically addresses the following Aims to increase understanding of the function of the MCH receptor (MCHR)1 in different cellular contexts: 1) Determine the importance of MCHR1 localization to primary cilia in differentiating pre-adipocytes; 2) Analyze MCHR1 signals that could promote expansion and proliferation in of adipose tissue; and 3) Analyze localization and trafficking of MCHR1 in 3T3-L1 cells in different states of cellular differentiation.  Biochemical isolation methods, RNA Seq, mass spectrometry, immunodetection and confocal microscopy will be used to accomplish these aims.  Experiments are designed to enable the participation and success of undergraduate and Master's research students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Whether a cell responds to an external stimulus depends on the presence of plasma membrane-localized receptors, and the capacity of those receptors to respond.  Our NSF-funded research explored the sensitivity of developing adipocytes, or fat cells, to an external hormone known to positively trigger appetite sensation, melanin-concentrating hormone, or MCH.  We sought to understand MCH receptor behavior and signaling during development of fat tissue in an effort to connect eating behaviors to changes in body fat metabolism.  Adipocytes are cultured in the lab as preadipocytes and can be triggered to become adipocytes with the addition of differentiation factors.  We compared gene expression data of cells treated with or without MCH to that of developing preadipocytes that had a single, transient primary cilium present on the plasma membrane, a distinct feature of differentiation.  We found that cultured preadipocytes were not very responsive to MCH, however when MCH receptors moved to primary cilia during differentiation, dozens of genes showed significant responses to the hormone, and that MCH signaling at this developmental time-point tips the balance towards inhibition of adipose tissue development.  Since the primary cilium is transient in developing adipose tissue, MCH signaling to inhibit differentiation is not likely to persist long, and the question remains as to whether MCH signaling has a significant effect on gene expression in the adipocyte past this point in tissue development.  Through further biochemical studies on mature adipocytes, we discovered that MCH signaling inhibits lipolysis and promotes expansion of lipid droplets in size and number, suggesting MCH at this developmental time-point acts to enhance adipogenesis.  Overall, this study reinforces the potential for changed signaling response networks as receptors move into different plasma membrane microdomains during cell maturation.  This research grant provided an integrated, mentored research program at a primarily undergraduate institution.  Undergraduate and masters students, including those from underrepresented groups in STEM, participated in the experimental design, methods, as well as analysis and communication of results to the greater scientific community.
