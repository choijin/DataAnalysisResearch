<AbstractNarration>PI:  Hahn, Juergen  &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1505094&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the 41st Northeast Bioengineering Conference (NEBEC) which will be held at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY, from April 17-19. NSF funds will be used to subsidize the cost of undergraduate and graduate student registration.  Rapid advances in engineering are facilitating an enhanced understanding of biology and providing novel transformative solutions to biomedical problems. The NEBEC will provide a multidisciplinary forum for dissemination of these advances in biomedical engineering at all levels, and facilitate the sharing of knowledge across interdisciplinary barriers. The conference serves as an open forum for discussion of new directions, ideas and approaches in research and education.  The knowledge presented at the conference will be captured electronically and broadly disseminated via abstract books, CD ROMS, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers website.  Women are extensively involved in the organizing committee and conference program; students and investigators from underrepresented minorities and women will be encouraged to attend.  This proposal is co-funded by the Biomedical Engineering Program in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems Division in the Engineering Directorate, and by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 41th Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference will highlight emerging areas of bioengineering research, including advances in Biomedical Imaging,  Stem Cells &amp; Regenerative Medicine, Biocatalysis and Metabolic Engineering, BioMEMS and On-Chip Devices, Biomechanics, Biomaterials, Systems Biology &amp; Synthetic Biology, Tissue Engineering, and Modeling and Control of Biomedical Systems.  In addition, workshops at the conference will focus on industry participation and public advocacy to satisfy an important initiative to help translate basic research into clinical treatments.  Entrepreneurship is also an exciting area for students, who more than ever are aware of the commercial potential of biomedical developments.  As a conference rich in tradition for educating the next generation of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students in bioengineering, the 41st Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will bring together a number of respected researchers to inform and inspire students about progress and research opportunities in the biomedical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
