<AbstractNarration>This award funds some of the research activities of Professor Ken D. Olum at Tufts University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic strings are microscopically thin or even fundamental objects of cosmological length, which may or may not exist in our universe. Detection of cosmic strings would provide a window onto fundamental physics at energies beyond the reach of any accelerator.  Observation of a cosmic superstring network could provide a confirmation of the correctness of string theory.  Professor Olum's research will advance our knowledge of the cosmic string network as it would exist today and would have existed in the past under any specific cosmic string theory.  In particular, it will lead to accurate information about the spectrum of gravitational waves emitted by cosmic strings.  This information will allow us to determine the properties of the cosmic string network if such gravitational waves are detected in the future. If they are not detected, it will enable us to set limits on the possibilities for cosmic strings, and thus on underlying theories of high-energy physics. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of the universe.  Professor Olum will also involve graduate students in the work and thus train future generations of research physicists. The work will further connect studies of the universe with studies of the fundamental laws of nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, Professor Olum will study the shape of cosmic string loops to determine how many cusps they have and to calibrate the signals that they might produce for comparison with observational limits on gravitational waves from pulsar timing.  He will also study networks that might arise from cosmic strings with a low probability of reconnection when they intersect each other, as might be found in cosmic superstring theories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our universe may contain a network of cosmic strings, microscopically thin but astronomically long objects resulting from physics at very high energies.  If so, loops of cosmic string will oscillate and emit gravitational waves that we may be may be able to detect.  The gravitational waves from large numbers of loops will combine together to form a stochastic background, a kind of gravitational noise coming from everywhere in the sky.  We calculated the spectrum of these gravitational waves.  It depends on the unknown energy scale &mu; at which the cosmic strings form.  The image shows our predictions for this spectrum and compares them with the detection capabilities of various current and proposed gravitational wave observatories.  Pulsar timing arrays (PTA in the image) currently give the strongest bound on the possible energy scale of cosmic strings, limiting G&mu;/c2 (G is the gravitational constant, c the speed of light) to be no more than about 10-11.  Also shown is the highest possible contribution to the gravitational wave background that might come from supermassive black holes orbiting each other at the centers of galaxies.  If a gravitational wave background is discovered soon, it may be difficult to tell whether it comes from strings or from black holes.  Future gravitational wave observatories, in particular the space interferometer LISA, scheduled for 2035, will have much greater power to discover or constrain a network of cosmic strings.  The spectrum of the gravitational waves depends on the shape of cosmic string loops.  The work above was done with a simplified model of how these shapes evolve.  We also studied the detailed evolution of loop shapes, both on paper and by computer simulation.  Future work will use this more-accurate calculation of the loop shape evolution to improve the accuracy of our predictions of the gravitational wave background.
