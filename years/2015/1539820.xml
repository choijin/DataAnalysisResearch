<AbstractNarration>This research project will reconstruct historical fires over the past several thousand years in mixed-conifer forests on tribal lands in the northern Rockies.  Similar forests are widespread in the interior of western North America, but little is known about their historical fire dynamics, and even less is known about how humans may have influenced those fires.  Recent large fires and projections of increased fire activity in the decades ahead have prompted land-management agencies in the U.S. to initiate widespread restoration efforts aimed at reducing fire risk and hazard.  At the same time, wildfire suppression costs in the western U.S. have risen to more than $1 billion annually and now consume nearly one-half of the U.S. Forest Service budget.  There is a critical need to better understand the historical context for applying fuel treatments intended to reduce fire risk in mixed-severity forest types across the western U.S.  The need to better understand the historical context for forest management is particularly compelling on tribal lands, where tribal members and forest managers have a strong interest in preserving historical continuity and incorporating culturally important practices into their management strategies.  The project will clarify the role of ancient and recent human influence on fire regimes and mixed-conifer forests.  Project results will provide a mechanistic understanding of factors shaping current forest stand characteristics.  The project will contribute to scientific debates concerning the influence of both ancient and recent human activities on temperate forests.  The project will enhance basic understanding of ecological resilience in the face of changing climatic conditions and land use, and it will facilitate the development of science-based management for ecosystems experiencing multiple natural and human-caused stressors.  This project will help educate and train a new generation of fire and forest managers and researchers by employing more than ten undergraduates and two graduate students, including Native American students and students from tribal colleges.  The project also will help build research capacity at a tribal college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address the following questions related to past and future controls on fire and forest ecosystems:  How variable were fire regimes in mixed-conifer forests of the northern Rockies?  Are drier mixed-conifer forests inherently more resilient than mesic ones to recent increases in fire activity, insect outbreaks, and land-use change?  Are treatments aimed at restoring baseline ecosystem dynamics in mixed-conifer forests representative of historical natural and human disturbance processes?  How can lessons from past fire-human-climate interactions help land managers support forest resilience with future forest management in ways that ultimately reduce fire suppression costs?  The investigators will answer these questions by combining fire and vegetation histories reconstructed from lake sediments and tree rings sampled from a network of paired sites in which early human activity was intensive versus paired sites that were largely isolated from early human activity.  They will compare these histories of fire to multi-century reconstructions of climate.  This project will clarify interactions between natural and human factors that influence ecosystem change in order to inform restoration and management strategies that support forest resiliency in ways that ultimately reduce the cost of wildfire risk and hazard.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In collaboration with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes, Salish Kootenai College and agency scientists from the US Geological Survey and the US Forest Service our research provides new information on long-term fire history and ecosystem change in the Mission Valley of northwestern Montana. Results from our research detail how changing climatic conditions and human activity influenced fire regimes and forest ecosystems for thousands of years.</p> <p>First, organic biomarkers associated with direct human presence provide new evidence documenting nearly continuous human presence for over 7000 years at sites throughout the Mission Valley. Analysis of chemical biomarkers in lake sediments provides some of the first direct evidence of continuous human occupation at specific watersheds within the Mission Valley, complimenting what is known from the sparse record of cultural materials found within the Mission Valley.</p> <p>Second, comparisons of pollen and charcoal records from several watersheds in the Mission Valley highlight the role of frequent fire in maintaining diverse mixed-conifer forests for over ten thousand years. Our records indicate open mixed-conifer forests that dominated during the warmer and drier conditions of the mid-Holocene (5-8 thousand years ago) became more dense when climatic conditions trended cooler and wetter during the last 3-4 thousand years. Fire activity peaked during the mid-Holocene but remained high despite the cooler and wetter conditions of the last several thousand years, suggesting a possible increasing role of human influence in maintaining frequent fires, especially during the last 1-2 thousand years.</p> <p>Third, an evaluation of the physiological characteristics of whitebark and lodgepole pine trees that survived recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks compared to trees that died provide new insights into the strategies trees use to survive disturbances. Our results show that fast growing trees were more vulnerable to mountain pine beetle attacks than trees that grew more slowly but invested more resources into strategies for defending against beetle attacks such as resin ducts and resins that expel beetles during attacks. This research provides some of the first evidence documenting how whitebark and lodgepole pine trees exhibit differing strategies in the allocation of resources towards growth and defense under different climate, biophysical conditions and disturbance legacies. These results highlight how variability in the character, presence and abundance chemical and physiological defenses in forest ecosystems enable forests to withstand rapidly changing climate and disturbance conditions. We also found that whitebark and lodgepole pine trees exhibit distinct differences in the composition of chemical defenses (e.g., secondary metabolites including terpenoids, alkaloids and phenols) they produce in response to different patterns of insect outbreaks, fire activity and droughts.</p> <p>Fourth, analysis of recent fire activity and forest change from tree-ring and fire-scarred trees key shows that land-use activities in the late 1800s and early 1900s led to a period of widespread fire activity throughout the Mission Valley followed by a relative absence of fire until recent decades. Watersheds across the Mission Valley at different elevations recorded large fires in the 1890s and during the 1910 fire that affected over three million acres of Northern Rocky mountain forests. Today, forest ecosystems in the Mission Valley are strongly shaped by the past 200 years of land and fire management - a legacy that has important implications for the vulnerability of communities and ecosystems of the Mission Valley to future wildfire activity. An evaluation of the interactions between changes in climate, land-use and fire activity and changes in forest structure and composition from these records suggests careful reintroduction and application of fire to specific forest types (especially drier, lower elevation mixed-conifer forests) in the Mission Valley would likely help sustain diverse mixed-conifer forests, reduce woody fuel loads and minimize fire risk and hazard to communities that live throughout the Mission Valley.</p> <p>This research effort was carried out by a suite of talented tribal and university undergraduate and graduate students. Field and laboratory analyses involved one PhD and three MSc graduate students at Montana State University, 18 tribal undergraduate students from Salish Kootenai College and six undergraduate students at Montana State University. Along with contributions from undergraduate field and laboratory technicians, graduate students contributed to key research findings reported on in several peer-reviewed publications summarized above. The project had broader impacts by advancing women and Indigenous students in STEM: two female graduate students and three Indigenous undergraduate women from Salish-Kootenai College led field and data analyses for multiple field seasons; and a Salish-Kootenai College graduate led research data collection, analysis, and interpretation for a masters project.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/20/2020<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;B&nbsp;Mcwethy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539820/1539820_10385824_1589995335036_MissionValleyMTNSF1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539820/1539820_10385824_1589995335036_MissionValleyMTNSF1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mission Valley Montana"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539820/1539820_10385824_1589995335036_MissionValleyMTNSF1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mission Valley Montana"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dendroecological fieldwork, Mission Valley, Montana</div> <div class="imageCredit">David McWethy</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;B&nbsp;Mcwethy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Mission Valley Montana</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539820/1539820_10385824_1589995417794_MissionValleyMTNSF2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539820/1539820_10385824_1589995417794_MissionValleyMTNSF2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mission Valley, Montana"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539820/1539820_10385824_1589995417794_MissionValleyMTNSF2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mission Valley, Montana"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dendroecological fieldwork, Mission Valley, Montana</div> <div class="imageCredit">David McWethy</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;B&nbsp;Mcwethy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Mission Valley, Montana</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539820/1539820_10385824_1589995482997_MissionValleyMTNSF3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539820/1539820_10385824_1589995482997_MissionValleyMTNSF3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mission Valley, Montana"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539820/1539820_10385824_1589995482997_MissionValleyMTNSF3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mission Valley, Montana"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Lake sediment fieldwork, Mission Valley, Montana</div> <div class="imageCredit">David McWethy</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;B&nbsp;Mcwethy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Mission Valley, Montana</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539820/1539820_10385824_1589995614840_MissionValleyMTNSF4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539820/1539820_10385824_1589995614840_MissionValleyMTNSF4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mission Valley, Montana"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539820/1539820_10385824_1589995614840_MissionValleyMTNSF4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mission Valley, Montana"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Lake sediment fieldwork, Mission Valley, Montana</div> <div class="imageCredit">David McWethy</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;B&nbsp;Mcwethy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Mission Valley, Montana</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
