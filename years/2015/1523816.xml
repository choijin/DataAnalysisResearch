<AbstractNarration>Maintaining user privacy in a computerized world is a difficult challenge. Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes allow a user to retrieve a piece of information replicated among several servers without disclosing the precise nature of that information to each individual server.  The aim of this project is to develop new techniques for constructing such protocols with improved efficiency. In a recent breakthrough, the PI introduced a new technique that dramatically reduced the cost of the best PIR protocols. The main goals of the projects are to develop this technique further and to understand better the underlying mathematics that make it work. Pursuing the research goals of the project will require integration of research and education and training of gradate and undergraduate students. The PI will also contribute to education of high school students, including those from under-represented groups, by participating in a computer science summer school program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIR protocols guarantee information theoretic privacy in the setting where the same database is replicated among several non-communicating servers. The most interesting case is that of two servers (the smallest possible). The current state of the art (obtained in a recent work by the PI) gives sub-polynomial communication cost, improving the two-decades long record requiring  communication proportional to the cube root of the database size. The improvement comes from leveraging the connection between PIR and Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs) which are error correcting codes that allow for quick correction of a single codeword position by querying the code in only a few places.  The main goals of this project are to further study these two objects (PIR and LDCs) and to improve their known constructions. On the other hand, the project will aim to understand the limitation of PIR and LDCs in the form of provable lower bounds on their efficiency.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of the project were to study Locally-Decodable Codes (LDCs): error correcting codes with ultra-fast error recovery and the related problem of constructing  Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes: communication schemes for querying a database privately (without revealing the identity of  the date you queried). While motivated by practical applications, these problems present significant mathematical challenges and, as such, their study requires investing heavily in theory-building in the hope that this will lead to new (and eventually practical) constructions.  The project resulted in a multitude of publications, appearing in top-rated peer-reviewed journals and conferences.  These publications contributed to our understanding of LDCs and PIRs by laying the foundations for their mathematical study. Highlights of the results include the definition of a new family of abstract objects called `Spanoids'. These generalize the well-studied mathematical notion of a Matroid (which is highly useful in algorithm design) in a way that capture some of the most difficult problems on bounding the parameters of LDCs. Another highlight is a work on `Outlaw distributions' which formulates the LDC/PIR questions in the language of  high dimensional geometry, showing that good LDCs can only exist if  there are distributions that defy the law of large numbers (that is, are hard to approximate with a small number of samples).     Other outcomes include new constructions/lower bounds on Maximally-Recoverable-Codes (MRCs) which are variants of LDCs used in practical big-data storage applications, new constructions of Locally testable and Locally correctable Codes Approaching the Gilbert-Varshamov Bound and new lower bounds on LCCs that are invariant under linear group actions.     From a broader impact perspective, the project resulted in a series of freely available set of  online lecture notes covering the basic notions of LDCs and PIR and are aimed at graduate level students (or advanced undergraduate). The project had a significant educational component as with both graduate and undergraduate students involved in all phases of the research.
