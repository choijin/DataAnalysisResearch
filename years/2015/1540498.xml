<AbstractNarration>In vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics perform the diagnostic, surgical and biological procedures necessary for in vitro fertilization cycles, as well as egg freezing procedures and egg and embryo banking. IVF clinics are highly competitive with one another because their success rates are published, and patients are willing to travel to clinics with higher success rates. Especially at high volume clinics, they are interested in innovations that will increase their profitability by driving patient volume through increased success rates.  This team aims to create a commercial device that unearths new sources of information of egg/embryo quality that can be incorporated into an algorithm to predict the chance of IVF success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team is proposing the creation of an algorithm that can assess the quality of an egg or embryo by looking at metabolic and subcellular features of that egg or embryo and correlating those features to ultimate potential to lead to a live birth. The embryologist can use this algorithm to choose the embryo for implantation that is most likely to lead to birth, which should increase success. Clinicians can also use the algorithm on a patient?s eggs, to give the patient a more accurate assessment of her individual fertility potential. Quantifying metabolism is the core piece that will be used to create the algorithm.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we explored the extent that technology (previously developed by NSF sponsored research), might have the potential for commercial impact.  This technology is an advanced, non-invasive imaging technique that may help to determine the viability of eggs and embryos.   After extensive interviews with clinicians, embryologists, patients, technical and business hospital personnel, cattle and horse breeders, and others, we discovered that there are great unmet needs that this technology can address.  We believe that this effort will greatly facilitate the transition of the original NSF funded basic research into a commercial application.  We concluded that while this technology might theoretically help cattle and horse breeders, the cost of the equipment would likely be prohibitive for those markets and thus would not be able to aid them in practice.  However, the cost of the equipment is well within in the range that hospitals are willing to accept.  Thus, this technology has the potential to greatly benefit patients suffering from infertility and it seems likely that it will be possible for it to become an economically viable and sustainable option.  More broadly, this project helped the participants better understand the challenges associated with transitioning basic science to the applied, commercial world, and it helped them acquire the skills to determine when this may be worthwhile, and how to practically proceed.
