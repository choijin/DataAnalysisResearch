<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key hurdle in regenerating tissues is the production of complex network of artificial blood vessels within the damaged areas, and the ability to cause host tissue to connect to these vessel networks.  This process is necessary to ensure constant supply of oxygen and nutrient to growing cells and tissues in the areas.  The PIs propose to develop an implantable scaffold containing artificial blood vessels, as well as appropriate biochemicals that can induce connections between the host tissue blood vessels and the engineered blood vessels.  The success of this project will provide critical insights into how to influence and optimize this necessary integration between scaffold implants and host tissue, thereby accelerating regeneration of large tissues with severely damaged vessel networks. While conducting this project, research and education will be integrated through activities aligned with the efforts of the School for Science and Math at Vanderbilt U. The team will develop 1) grade-appropriate curriculum components that introduce high school students to engineering through a module on angiogenesis in biomaterial implants for tissue engineering and 2) a new graduate/upper level undergraduate course co-taught by the PI and CoPI on Tissue Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most natural tissues, blood capillaries lie within ~200 micrometers from each other to ensure a sufficient level of transport for oxygen, nutrients and waste products. Without this essential transport process through perfused vasculature, cells will die from ischemia, leading to necrotic regions.  Thus, to engineer a successful tissue construct thicker than this diffusion-imposed limit, an artificial vascular network capable of supporting perfusion is required. Although continuous progress has been made, to date no research has demonstrated the integration of cell-laden microfluidic hydrogels with host vasculature in vivo.  This critical step is necessary to fully exploit prevascularized constructs and enable the use of thick implantable cell-laden engineered tissues. Therefore, the PIs propose to engineer an immediately perfusable, implantable tissue construct that supports rapid angiogenesis and dramatically enhances anastomosis with host vasculature and host ingrowth by assembling hydrogels containing a high density capillary-like 3D microfluidic network; (ii) stem cells to promote vascularization and channel endothelialization; and (iii) short synthetic peptides to expedite host angiogenic response to further ensure timely vascularization/perfusion of the constructsThe results of this work will dramatically accelerate the application and translation of tissue engineering in the clinics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work supported by this grant focused on developing patterning processes, novel biomaterials, and 3D cell culture strategies to improve tissue engineered construct microvascularization and thereby enhance the viability of cells embedded in thick constructs.  Additionally, we developed several new techniques to controllably direct stem cell differentiation in 3D culture environments.  To better mimic the architecture of capillaries (which support critical soluble compound exchange necessary for cell viability), we demonstrated a technique employing sacrificial microfibrous meshes formed from thermoresponsive polymers that enables the production of capillary-like channel networks throughout large volumes of cell-laden gels.  Our data showed that perfusion of such channels leads to dramatically enhanced cell viability throughout the scaffold volume, while lack of perfusion or channels leads to cell death near the core of the hydrogel scaffold.  By quantitatively characterizing barrier permeability using diffusion assays under various conditions, we have also shown the importance of flow for stabilizing the endothelium in patterned vasculature lined with iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells, establishing a new blood-brain-barrier model that could, in future studies, incorporate a variety of neurovascular cell types and expose them to well-defined healthy or pathophysiological conditions in order to develop novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative disease.  Throughout this project, we developed a range of novel materials and culture platforms to provide bio-instructive cues to influence stem cell differentiation.  We showed that surface properties of tissue culture substrates may be tuned to regulate cell-cell adhesion and thereby modulate or maintain the stemness of mesenchymal stem cells growing on such surfaces.  We developed an approach employing photo-degradable polymeric nanoparticles to provide user-defined release profiles of retinoic acid, a morphogen crucial for many aspects of developmental processes, and showed that this strategy was capable of producing a desired gradient of cardiac differentiation in mouse embryoid bodies.  Subsequently, to enable greater levels of control and flexibility in delivering morphogens, we explored a novel platform wherein channels patterned within thick slabs of hydrogels are used to establish spatiotemporally-varying gradients of soluble morphogens throughout the scaffold volume.  Using this platform, we showed that we could form a spectrum of cell fate of embedded stem cells, and, by changing the formulation of the media in the channels, spatially shift this differentiation gradient.  Importantly, this platform is capable of establishing the desired morphogen gradients throughout large volumes, thereby enabling studies of more heterogeneous cell architectures.  Finally, we developed a novel gelatin-based hydrogel functionalized with an N-cadherin extracellular peptide epitope that supports dramatically enhanced viability, maturation, and functional connectivity of iPSC-derived neurons embedded within.  Moreover, this material exhibits mechanical properties robust enough to support the formation of embedded perfusable channels. This material shows great promise for in vitro studies of neural circuitry in health and disease in a 3D biomimetic environment.
