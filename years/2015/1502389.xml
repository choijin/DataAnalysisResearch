<AbstractNarration>The term Smart Grid represents a complex set of technologies with potential to enhance the efficiency and reduce costs of electricity production, storage, transmission, distribution and use. Advances in nanotechnologies and new nanomaterials will play crucial roles throughout Smart Grid systems, changing electricity transmission, reliability, resilience, and energy storage, and shaping electricity use and demand management in novel ways. Although Smart Grid systems are critical to developing a sustainable U.S. energy system, significant variation is apparent in visions of what these systems are and how they are developing.  By exploring the values and contexts that shape Smart Grid development and implementation, this project contributes to ongoing efforts to accelerate the transition of our aging electricity system to increase future energy security, reduce the threats of climate change, and contribute to sustainable development.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research, funded by the CISE directorate, the SBE Nano Initiative, and the STS program, is guided by four questions: (1) What are the parameters of the political and policy debates surrounding Smart Grid?  (2) How do stakeholders in different regions articulate their visions of Smart Grid development and deployment?  (3) What are the major deployment challenges for Smart Grid technologies?  (4) How can theory on science, technology and society, socio-technical transitions, and energy technology deployment be refined and expanded to more effectively integrate empirical components of emerging energy technology systems? To answer these research questions, the investigators will analyze Smart Grids in three electricity transmission systems of North America: the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO), the New England Independent System Operator (ISO-New England) and the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT); both MISO and ISO-New England include Canadian interconnections. The principal investigators will conduct policy review and analysis, focus groups, interviews, and media analysis to examine the values that inform Smart Grid development and use as well as barriers to implementation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project contributes to a growing body of social scientific research on nanomaterials and scientific innovation. In addition to increasing understanding of national, regional and state-level influences on Smart Grid technology deployment, the researchers' results will enable energy professionals, state and regional planners, policy analysts, non-profits, and businesses to develop more effective strategies for involving the public in Smart Grid technology design, technology implementation, and policy formation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Acknowledging the rapid rate of change in energy systems, this social science research project focused on understanding innovations associated with the term Smart Grid, and how socio-political context shapes, facilitates and thwarts technological development in electricity systems. The goals of the project were to highlight the diversity of perspectives on social versus technical change in smart grid, perceptions of promises and pitfalls of smart grid, and to articulate the context-specific social and political influences of energy system change in different states and regions of the United States. This research involved conducting over 40 focus groups and interviews with energy stakeholders in seven different states (CA, IL, MA, MN, MT, TX, and VT) who worked for a range of different kinds of organizations engaged in energy system change. This research also involved media analysis of how smart grid was portrayed in the media.  The complexity of Smart Grid innovation provides a timely opportunity for analyzing how socio-political context shapes, facilitates and thwarts technological development.   The major goals of this project are:  (1)    To apply and adapt the SPEED framework to assess in a systematic way the socio-political influences on energy system change.  (2)    To contribute to the transitions literature by offering new insights on how socio-political factors enhance and/or constrain the evolution of energy systems.  (3)    To provide empirical comparative regional analysis of different visions of Smart Grid articulated by public officials, energy professionals and other stakeholders engaged with energy policy and technology     Our results demonstrate a breadth of perspectives on promises, pitfalls and priorities of smart grid innovation. Key tensions emerged related to varying perspectives on prioritizing centralized versus decentralized electricity systems and radical versus incremental change. This research contributed to the transitions literature by offering new insights on how socio-political factors enhance and constrain the evolution of energy systems. This research also provided empirical comparative regional analysis of different visions of Smart Grid articulated by public officials, energy professionals and other stakeholders engaged with energy policy and technology  This research culminated in the publication of a book "Smart Grid (R)Evolution: Electric Power Struggles" published by  Cambridge University Press in February 2015.  The research was also disseminated widely through multiple other publications (both peer-reviewed and popular press) as well as dozens of presentations in multiple venues.
