<AbstractNarration>A major issue in future smart grid is how intelligent devices and independent producers can respectively change their power consumption/production to achieve near maximum efficiency for the power network.  Limited communications between devices and producers necessitates a transformative approach where the elements of the network can act in an autonomous manner with limited information or communications, yet achieve near optimal performance. This is the main topic of the proposed project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By combining the two-way power flow with the two-way information flow, demand response can be applied to reduce the peak demand, shift load for economic benefits, reduce operating reserves and improve the grid stability. An important obstacle has been the lack of supporting information, communication and computation infrastructures that can ensure quality of service (QoS) for various demand response applications and devices. This project goal is to develop transformative and applicable distributed algorithms and architectures with provable performance for demand control subject to communication constraints in power networks. Results from this project will be applied to achieve high-performance and high-confidence management of the smart buildings and cities, and further contributes to the goal of improving urban sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Methods were invented/proposed in order to use the electric power distribution infrastructure in an efficient manner.   In this setting the power network broadcasts "the same" small amount of  information bits over the powerline to all consuming devices. This is a one-way communications system (only from the power network to the consuming devices) and requires only a very small bandwidth. We note that the reverse communications (from the consuming decives to the power network) is not practical, as there are billions of consuming devices, and the powerline channel cannnot support high data transmission bandwidths.  Each consumer device treats the very same information received from the power network differently,  and based on its needs and the received information makes changes to its own consuming habits (if necessary).  In other words, each consuming device "responds" in its own individual manner to the received information from the power network.  We have designed/invented transmission schemes for the power network, and individual response methods for consuming devices that guarantee efficient use of the power network resources--while satisfying the personal needs of each individual power consuming device.  The efficient use of power network (as proposed here) may help improving the future energy distribution infrastructure, and may have a large impact on the efficient use of energy, increasing the number of subscribers, keeping the environment greener, etc.       Last Modified: 02/28/2018       Submitted by: Vahid Tarokh]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
