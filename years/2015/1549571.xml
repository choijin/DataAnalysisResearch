<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides support to undertake an institutional self-analysis in preparation for a Broadening Participation Research Center.  Broadening Participation Research Centers are expected to serve as national hubs for the rigorous study and broad dissemination of the critical pedagogies and culturally sensitive interventions that contribute to the success of HBCUs in educating African American STEM undergraduates. This project is a collaborative effort between the initial members of an education research consortium: Tennessee State University, Prairie View A&amp;M University, Morgan State University, North Carolina A&amp;T State University, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The consortium of schools and team of researchers will work to plan research activities that will lead to the formation of a research center that delineates which individual factors, environmental factors, institutional practices, procedures, and policies are most effective in ensuring that students successfully complete STEM degrees at HBCUs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities of this project include: implementating a strategic planning framework built upon the broadening participation education research expertise of the collaborating institutions involved in the development of an expanded education research consortium of HBCUs; using evidence-based strategies to generate a high-quality plan for the research thrusts and research methodologies of the resulting center; and addressing the gap in the literature regarding STEM education research results, practices and policies pertinent to student persistence and graduation at HBCUs. The project will be guided by an on-going evaluation and an external advisory committee.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Growing a strong, talented, competitive STEM workforce is criticalto ensuring the nation's advancement.  National statistics and prior experience demonstrate that, of those students wh ochose to pursue STEM degrees, there are many factors that enhance or inhibit their successful matriculation through undergraduate and graduate programs.  Qualitiative and quantitative evidence has shown that individual factors, as well as institutional practices, procedures, and policies may adverseley affect eh persistence of STEM students. Thus aggressive efforts are needed to conduct research on STEM education within majority and minority serving institutions, with a special focus on investigating pathways for broadening participation with STEM disciplines. This one year planning grant enabled our consortium to work together in developing the necessary strategy for a education research center focused on fulfilling this need.   Through the strategy meetings and sub-projects enabled through this planning grant, our consortium of Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities (HBCUs) were able to  determine the most effective focus for the future Research Center proposal.  The grant was essential for enabling the team to work together  in identifying and exploring those factors affecting student success at our institutions. It also enabled us to filter the mission of the future center to arenas that will serve a significant national need.
