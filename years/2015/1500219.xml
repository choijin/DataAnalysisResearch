<AbstractNarration>In this project, the PI aims to study very large networks using algebraic and analytic tools. Large networks like the Internet, molecular lattices and social networks (such as Facebook) naturally arise in many different areas of real life. The PI aims to look at these from a new perspective: we consider them as approximations of an infinite object. For molecular lattices this is a very natural approach, but via a recently developed theory of sparse graph convergence we can tackle a much broader class of problems, creating new links between mathematics, statistical physics and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate two essentially different, but still related topics. The first one is the study of extremal values of algebraic invariants of graphs with a special emphasis on those problems where the conjectured extremal graphs are not finite. Despite the lack of finite extremal solutions, using the recently emerging language of Benjamini--Schramm convergence, one can find and analyze the extremal solutions. This then leads to new asymptotic results on finite graphs. The second topic is the study of certain special infinite graphs and lattices via graph limit theory and analytic and algebraic combinatorics. The general theme is to consider a graph invariant of algebraic nature and analyze its limiting behaviour using analytic tools. Often the invariants come from graph polynomials like the matching, chromatic and independence polynomials and have various ties to statistical mechanics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Combinatorics is the area of mathematics dedicated to the study of discrete structures such as graphs and diagrams.  It studies their structural, extremal, and enumerative properties.  It tries to answer questions like "What does a typical graph look like?" or "What is the number of diagrams of certain kind?"  Such problems are interesting and important not only because of their intrinsic mathematical beauty, but also because combinatorial structures often appear in other sciences such as theoretical physics, biology, etc.  For example, celebrated Feynman diagrams, which describe interactions between elementary partciles, are certain graphs.  In the last decade, new developments in fundamental theoretical physics led to introduction of new combinatorial structures and motivated new interesting combinatorial problems.   The project was concerned with the study of some of these new combinatorial structures.  They are certain graphs and polytopes, which are higher dimensional generalizations of polygons (such as triangles and quadrilaterals).    The results of the project are quite non-trivial and have important applications in physics.  A unique feature of combinatorics (compared to some other area of mathematics) is that combinatorial structures are quite visual and easy to explain to younger students.   A person, who may not have a lot of mathematical background, can still draw diagrams and immedately start playing and combining them.   One can present a non-trivial combinatorial problem to students in form of a game or a puzzle.    This is why combinatorial problems are very popular in various mathematical olympiads and student competitions.  Some problems from the project (or their special cases) were suitable for undergraduate and even high-school research projects.   The PI supported undergraduate research projects in MIT PRIMES (Program for Research in Mathematics, Engineering and Science for High School Students) and UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportinities Program).  The PI provided research problems for these programs, and the RA mentored the students.  This motivated talented young students to study and do serious research in mathematics.  The project resulted in solutions of several important and non-trivial problems concerning graphs and related combinatorial structures with applications to fundamental physics.   It provided an opportunity for professional training of the RA.   It motivated younger students to do research.   The project promoted general public knowledge of combinatorics.
