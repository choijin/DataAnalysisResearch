<AbstractNarration>Tropical landscapes account for about one-fifth of the global land mass, produce most of the Earth's streamflows and influence global as well as regional climates.  Additionally, tropical landscapes are undergoing rapid changes due to both climate change and deforestation. The effects of these changes on water and biogeochemical processes, at a range of scales, are large but poorly understood.  This Chapman Conference will examine current understanding of tropical ecohydrology and identify critical research needs in tropical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Chapman Conference on "Emerging Issues in Tropical Ecohydrology" meeting will be held in Ceunca, Ecuador with three days of meetings and one day of field work.  Themes will include (1) the influence of ecosystem degradation and recovery; (2) ecohydrological approaches and techniques for linking plant ecophysiological responses with watershed hydrology; (3) new concepts related to mechanistic assessment of the water balance across scales and across biomes (e.g., distributed modeling); (4) new techniques for measuring plant- and stream-water fluxes (e.g., stable isotopes, dendrochronology, sapflow, remote sensing, eddy covariance, distributed modeling); and (5) methods for building explicit linkages between ecophysiologists and ecohydrologists.  The conference will result in a set of synthesis papers that lay out critical questions for ecohydrological research in the tropics and a cohesive strategy for addressing the most urgent ecohydrology research needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tropical landscapes are of enormous importance. Accounting for about one-fifth of the global land mass, they produce most of the Earth?s streamflows and influence global as well as regional climates. Tropical ecosystems are distinguished from non-tropics by stronger gradients, faster processes, and higher variability &ndash; these characteristics pose unique challenges to ecohydrology in the tropics  In addition, because of the dual processes of climate change and deforestation, tropical landscapes are undergoing rapid changes. The effects of these changes on water and biogeochemical processes, at a range of scales, are enormous&mdash;but poorly understood. We do know, for example, that deforestation will lead to changes in evapotranspiration, streamflow, and precipitation from local to regional scales and may even influence global climates.   Similarly, climate change will likely lead to large-scale and important changes in cloud and precipitation dynamics, atmospheric&ndash;vegetation feedbacks, and/or hydrologic cycles in the tropics. Given the accelerated pace of change, the importance of tropical landscapes, and our relatively poor understanding of tropical ecohydrology, an AGU Chapman Conference Emerging Issues in Tropical Ecohydrology was convened in Cuenca Ecuador on June 5 -9.  The meeting was extremely well attended with over 115 academics, research scientists, and early career professionals from across the globe attending the meeting.  Thank to support from the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and the University of Cuenca nearly 40 early career scientists were able to attend the meeting.  The meeting was successful in fulfilling two of its main goals which were to (1) examine our current understanding of tropical ecohydrology and identifying critical research needs and (2) to foster greater interdisciplinary collaboration across the spectrum of ecological and hydrological sciences, in particular the disciplinary ties between ecophysiologists and catchment hydrologists.   The meeting was organized around three main themes with (usually) four invited speakers per theme and day, the main themes being (i) the coupling of plant physiology and watershed hydrological functioning, (ii) scaling issues, and (iii) impacts of land degradation and rehabilitation / recovery. The lectures were followed by afternoon break-out sessions to discuss the generation of potential synthesis papers amongst those interested plus late afternoon to early evening poster sessions. A field excursion to view the University of Cuenca?s research efforts in the paramo zone constituted an integral part.  The posters were arguably where it was at in this meeting. Many of these were highly interesting and presented by early career scientists, mostly from Latin America.  Discussions during this part of the meeting were especially lively and stimulating.  Some key outcomes from the meeting are as follows.  There is tremendous opportunity to better link ecohydrology with ecophysiology in the tropics especially in regard to collecting empirical data from the field.  Simply put&mdash;we need more empirical ecohydrological data from the tropics! Currently the two fields are still "worlds apart" with ecophysiology using rudimentary hydrological approaches and hydrology using rudimentary ecophysiological approaches.  Given the limited information in the tropics a recommended strategy would be to balance longterm data collection with strategically targeted experiments particularly in regard to the use of stable isotopes.  In addition, inter-comparision watershed studies could be of great value.  Researchers in the tropics need to be especially sensitive to the need for collecting information that is of broad relevance and that can be used to aid in decision making.  During break out meetings, participants were challenged to develop joint papers synthesizing important and emerging areas in tropical ecohydrology.  Several potential themes were identified to be further developed and published in a subsequent special issue.  Reflecting the diversity of the attendees the themes were quite diverse and included issues related to disturbance, plant invasions, soil fauna, optimal data collection strategies, influence of microtopography , and watershed market strategies.  Probably the most important outcome of the conference was beyond the science in that it brought together so many scientists, especially young scientists, from across the globe who have forged what will be long-lived and productive relationships.   As one attendee remarked "I believe the social value of this meeting will endure as one of its greatest accomplishments.
