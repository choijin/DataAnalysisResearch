<AbstractNarration>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a clinically important diagnostic procedure, with about half of MRI scans using contrast agents in order to better image differences in tissue.  This project will involve the development and initial steps towards commercialization of contrast agents based on iron and cobalt as inexpensive and earth abundant elements.  These new contrast agents are unique in that they are designed to switch on in tissue which has characteristics of a disease state.  The responsive properties of these contrast agents could be extremely useful for improved diagnostics and treatment. This project will explore the potential of these agents for use in different diseases including cancer and brain injury.  The team of three (academic PI, entrepreneurial lead and business mentor) will interview radiologists, medical doctors, insurance company representatives, MRI scanner manufacturers and MRI technicians to determine the factors that go into the development and marketing of new contrast agents.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the I-CORPS program, a team has been assembled to investigate the potential commercialization of magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents based on iron(II)/iron(III) and cobalt(II).  The contrast agents are paramagnetic metal ion complexes that produce signal through chemical exchange saturation transfer (paraCEST).  The proposed paraCEST agents are coordination complexes that can be tuned for redox potential and spin state.  Furthermore, paraCEST agents generally produce contrast which is pH and temperature responsive.  The proposed project will explore the possibility of commercializing these new contrast agents for 1) diagnosis of extent of tumor hypoxia as well as extracellular pH and 2) mapping traumatic brain injury which is thought to involve the production of reactive oxygen species and to affect redox status of tissue.  The team will study the factors that go into making decisions on the commercialization of contrast agents and new diagnostic procedures by interviewing medical doctors, radiologists, MRI company representatives, and insurance company representatives.  Potential outcomes include a refined focus on the development of contrast agents for new diagnostic procedures, a business plan for proceeding with the commercialization of the agents, as well as new collaborations and networks.  Commercialization of these contrast agents may create new jobs towards meeting the long term goal of substituting current technologies that use rare earth elements of limited supply.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The major goal of this project was to determine whether there was sufficient interest in the development of iron or cobalt magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents to pursue the eventual commercialization of products.  One key question was whether there would be interest in replacing gadolinium agents in certain patient populations or clinical applications.  A second question was whether there was interest in the development of MRI contrast agents that respond to changes in pH or redox status of tissue.  We sought to interview a range of people in the biomedical and imaging fields to answer these questions.  A team of three including an entrepreneurial lead (Dr. Tsitovich), a principal investigator (Dr. Morrow) and an I-CORPS mentor, Mr. La Salle, attended two I-CORPS workshops, participated in online presentations and business lessons and also interviewed nearly 100 people to get their thoughts on the invention.  These results were put into presentation form including a video for discussion with the other I-CORPS instructors and teams.  The intellectual merit was based on the development of two different types of contrast agents.  The first type of agent is an alternative to gadolinium MRI contrast agents used in standard clinical applications. Doctors, radiologists and MRI technicians were interviewed to comment on the patients who might benefit from the availability of new contrast agents.  A second focus was on a type of MRI contrast agent which is responsive to pH or redox changes for characterization of tumors.  Oncologists and radiologists were interviewed to determine interest in this type of "smart" contrast agent.  Technical advice from representatives from Bruker, a manufacturer of MRI instruments, was also obtained to better understand the limitations of clinical scanners.   There was clear agreement that a non-gadolinium based contrast agent would be marketable if we were to develop a non-toxic version based on iron. Radiologists avoid giving contrast agents to approximately 30% of patients who might need them.  Another possible market for contrast agents was animal MRI centers.  The team discovered that certain animal MRI scans including dog joints and backs had increased in popularity over the past decade as an emerging market.  Currently, these centers use gadolinium agents that were developed for humans.  In contrast, there was no clear agreement as to whether a smart contrast agent that lights up tumors based on extracellular pH or redox status would be marketable.  Further research in animals will be required to study these applications prior to any commercialization efforts.   Substantial broader impacts of this technology may result given the large patient populations that need new contrast agents.  This population would include patients with kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, children and pregnant women. The PI plans to submit a small business innovation research (SBIR) proposal with the goal of starting a company to develop new MRI contrast agents based on iron complexes.
