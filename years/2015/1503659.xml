<AbstractNarration>This project will capture and disseminate data on the geographic distribution, species diversity, and life history for two important indicator groups of animals: the darkling beetles and ground beetles. These data will be acquired from collections made over the past 70 years from Texas to southern California by faculty and staff of the Ohio State University. Information will be transcribed from the individual labels on 80 thousand specimens and uploaded into publicly accessible databases. The project is a partnership with an existing project, the Southwestern Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN), and will more than double the available data for these targeted groups of beetles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dramatic changes in the American Southwest over the past century has resulted in greater pressure for resources, particularly water. Past and future changes will be visible as alterations in the community of plants and animals of the region. This project seeks to add data that fills critical gaps in the SCAN TCN project for two families, Tenebrionidae and Carabidae, of beetles. These data will be a major contribution to monitoring and assessing environmental changes in the region and their effects on biological diversity. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The 20<sup>th</sup> Century was a period of dramatic shifts in land-use patterns and population growth in the American Southwest. The impact of these changes on the region?s plants and animals is documented in specimens collected and stored in natural history collections. Ground beetles and darkling beetles are two groups of common insects that are particularly diverse in the habitats of the Southwest. The specimens in the Triplehorn Insect Collection at The Ohio State University are unique in two respects: regular collections of beetles were made over 5 decades, from the 1930s to the 1970s, by Josef N. Knull, and the darkling beetle specialist Charles Triplehorn provided expert identifications of the extensive holdings of that group. The goal of this project was to capture in digital format the information on geographic distribution, collecting dates, and identifications for these two groups of beetles and make those data openly accessible on the Internet. Information from a total of 139,539 specimens was transcribed and stored in a database, and these data can be retrieved for further analysis from data portals on the Web from the Triplehorn Collection or from iDigBio. In addition, over 1200 photographs of 448 species of ground beetles and darkling beetles of the Southwest are also available online to make identifications easier and more accurate. This work provided training and experience for students, the next generation of biodiversity advocates, in the importance of collections and curation.&nbsp;</p> <p>This project also sought to promote the study of insects, insect collections, and associated data among the younger generation. Two week-long summer camps were held targeting students of middle-school age. Campers learned how to collect and preserve insects, and to understand the importance of collections for knowledge of the natural world. Instructors included scientists from the University, college students, volunteers, and local artists who provided a unique perspective on the aesthetic value of insects. An additional major outreach event for the general public, the annual Open House of the Museum of Biological Diversity, provided a venue for sharing the goals and accomplishments of the project. This event engages over 3000 visitors in a single day, providing an opportunity to communicate how science is conducted, to personally interact with the students, staff, and faculty doing the research, and together to revel in the beauty of the insect world. The results, successes, and experiences of the project have also been shared via social media outlets including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/23/2019<br>      Modified by: Norman&nbsp;F&nbsp;Johnson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268256994_OSUC603508dorsal--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268256994_OSUC603508dorsal--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Darkling Beetle"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268256994_OSUC603508dorsal--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Darkling Beetle"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Darkling beetle, Eleodes longicollis, set up for digitization.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Luciana Musetti</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Norman&nbsp;F&nbsp;Johnson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Darkling Beetle</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268142409_DEA2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268142409_DEA2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Data Input"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268142409_DEA2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Data Input"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Undergraduate assistant entering specimen data via DEA application into Triplehorn Collection database.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Luciana Musetti</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Norman&nbsp;F&nbsp;Johnson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Data Input</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268020670_Cicindela-obsoleta-sml(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268020670_Cicindela-obsoleta-sml(1)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tiger Beetles"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268020670_Cicindela-obsoleta-sml(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tiger Beetles"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Digitized and curated specimens of the tiger beetle Cicindela obsoleta santaclarae from Arizona.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Photo by Luciana Musetti</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Norman&nbsp;F&nbsp;Johnson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Tiger Beetles</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268389206_Eleodes-Tenebs(10)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268389206_Eleodes-Tenebs(10)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Eleodes Beetles"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268389206_Eleodes-Tenebs(10)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Eleodes Beetles"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Specimens of curated and digitized darkling beetles, Eleodes longicollis punctigerus.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Luciana Musetti</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Norman&nbsp;F&nbsp;Johnson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Eleodes Beetles</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268488559_InsectCamp--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268488559_InsectCamp--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Insect Summer Camp"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1503659/1503659_10361381_1569268488559_InsectCamp--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Insect Summer Camp"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Engaging with Insects Summer Camp outreach event, 2017.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Luciana Musetti</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Norman&nbsp;F&nbsp;Johnson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Insect Summer Camp</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
