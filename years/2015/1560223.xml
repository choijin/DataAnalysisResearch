<AbstractNarration>Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) will host a summer REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) program in astronomy.  Students will complete individual research projects with a faculty mentor.  They will also benefit from interaction with summer students in 14 other TAMU REU programs, such as the REU Summer Scholars Program (weekly informal lunch discussions focusing on ethnic minority issues) and the university-wide summer REU Poster Session.  This program will benefit society by enhancing the education of undergraduates through research and professional development programs, by involving them in the development of advanced astronomical instrumentation, and by extending these opportunities to students from institutions otherwise unable to offer such experiences, which will be a primary focus of the recruitment efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer will begin with a 3-day workshop that will give them a hands-on introduction to data visualization and computational data analysis.  Students will also have the opportunity to design, construct, test, and deploy a variety of instruments to be used at astronomical observatories around the world.  TAMU astronomy faculty are involved in most of the current and future large-scale observational astronomy collaborations.  All of the REU students have the opportunity to spend one week observing at McDonald Observatory in west Texas, and they will be invited to participate in public outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Mitchell Institute for Fundamental Physics and Astronomy at Texas A&amp;M University was pleased to host the "REU Site: Astronomical Research and Instrumentation at Texas A&amp;M University" from 2014-2020.  In each year of the program, eight undergraduate students were selected from a pool of hundreds of applicants to travel to College Station, Texas and conduct research for 10 weeks over the summer with Texas A&amp;M faculty and research staff.  The student researchers worked in a wide range of observational and theoretical astronomical fields including the study of black holes, supernovae, cosmology, the high-redshift Universe, Dark Energy, the cosmic distance scale, the Milky Way galaxy, and extrasolar planets. Students working on instrumentation projects also participated in a wide range of projects, including developing a novel instrument to study extrasolar planetary atmospheres, advancing calibration techniques for next-generation astronomical surveys, and designing subsystems for Giant Magellan Telescope and Dark Energy Survey instruments.  The program consisted of many activities in addition to the primary research activities.  REU students attended weekly meetings led by astronomy faculty focused on exploring career development opportunities; they attended weekly research group meetings with their research advisor and larger research group of faculty, postdocs, and graduate students; and they were able to participate in University-wide summer programs designed to engage with under-represented students to enhance their summer experience.  Each summer began with a graduate student-led crash course in astronomical research in which the REU students worked together to execute a small research project and learn the basics of Python programming.  The REU program also included a yearly trip to McDonald observatory, in which some of the students executed an observing run while the instrumentation students observed with the instrument they had developed over the summer at one of the McDonald telescopes.  Each summer ended with student presentations at the campus-wide end-of-summer poster session, attended by hundreds of summer undergraduate students as well as by hundreds of faculty and other visitors.  Many of our REU students also presented their work at American Astronomical Society or SPIE meetings in the following year.  A key goal of the REU program was to increase access to and knowledge about graduate research opportunities in the STEM fields for undergraduates who may have otherwise been less likely to attend graduate school in the sciences or engineering.  To that end, active recruitment resulted in a highly diverse applicant pool, and the participants in the program were 60% women and 30% from backgrounds under-represented in STEM.  Furthermore, most of our students were selected from undergraduate institutions with limited access to research opportunities; in most cases this REU program was the student's first research opportunity.  Active assessment of the program, focused on student learning outcomes, contributed greatly to its success. Assessment activities included survey instruments and focus group interviews focused on individual cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes. A primary goal of the assessment activities was to create empirical evidence that examined the relationship between the proposed activities and student learning outcomes.  In each year of the program, improvements were made based on the results of the assessment, resulting in improved outcomes as well as increased participant satisfaction.
