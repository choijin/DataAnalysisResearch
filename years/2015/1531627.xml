<AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program and the EPSCoR program supports the development of a state-of-the-art time- and angle-resolved hemispherical elastic light scattering (TARHELS) instrument to observe light scattering with femtosecond resolution at cryogenic temperatures. The apparatus will be the first optical system of this kind, and provides unique capabilities beyond current limitations and will advance the standards for state-of-the-art instrumentation in a field at the forefront of condensed matter research. Multi-user access to the instrument will significantly increase and advance the research activity of the Physics Department at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez. Beyond its scientific impact, the project provides an excellent education and training opportunity for graduate students at the University of Puerto Rico, a higher education institution that serves and graduates the largest number of Hispanic STEM students in the United States. Students will receive extensive training in working with the modern ultrafast diffraction techniques that are frequently utilized in National Labs and the US industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This TARHELS instrument will provide unique possibilities for the ultrafast pump-probe surface spectroscopy of condensed matter, while enabling high-quality recording and spectral analysis of hemispherical scattering indicatrix with femtosecond resolution using large-scale aspherical reflective optics. The setup is designed as a computer-controlled apparatus that operates with external ultrafast laser pulse sources. The use of several geometries will enable monitoring of the light scattering of homogenous and surface waves. The project will also develop the user interface and algorithms for fast analysis of the scattering field. Collecting the time- and angle-resolved scattering over a hemisphere, the TARHELS instrument will provide the real-time reconstruction and visualization of transient autocorrelation function and power spectral density of the surface, enabling insight into the nonsteady state of multi-scale structural irregularities. Operating at low temperatures, the TARHELS system will yield substantially new information about nonequilibrium disorder of stochastic surfaces on the mesoscale, information about grain-size-dependent electron-lattice interactions, the role of electronic correlations in nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter, and multi-scale quantum condensed matter dynamics, including insulator-to-metal phase transition in different functional materials, correlated oxides, topological insulators and superconductors under strong laser excitation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The outcomes of this MRI project are the design and construction of a state-of-the-art light scatterometer for time- and angle-resolved hemispherical elastic light scattering (<em>tr</em>-ARHELS) measurements at cryogenic temperatures, the development of new original metrological methods and software for multiprocessor scattering data analysis, and advanced-level training of STEM students. The <em>tr</em>-ARHELS apparatus is a unique, first-ever built instrument of this kind, which provides exceptional capabilities surpassing limitations of existing ones. It allows high-resolution angular measurements of far-field light scattering within a full hemisphere, with femtosecond temporal resolution and for sample temperatures dawn to a few kelvins. It yields substantially new information, inaccessible before, about the dynamics of stochastic surfaces on the mesoscale at low temperatures. The scatterometer uses large-scale aspherical reflective optics and modern data acquisition electronics for statistical photometric imaging of multi-scale nonequilibrium processes in materials and supports several switchable geometries, advancing the standards for state-of-the-art instrumentation in a field at the forefront of condensed matter research.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A large set of technical drawings, diagrams, and protocols were developed for the full assembly of the <em>tr</em>-ARHELS system, which included specially adapted cryogenic refrigerator and cryostat, custom vacuum chamber, motorized manipulators of the cryostat, and custom elliptical aluminum mirror with 500 mm aperture.&nbsp; Numerous electrical and optical components were designed or adapted, assembled, and integrated into the <em>tr</em>-ARHELS instrument. It is fully computer-controlled and operates with external ultrafast or continuous wave laser sources. It was built with the possibility to apply polarization and spectral analysis of scattered light, to realize cross-polarization ultrafast diffraction conoscopy measurements, and other experimental geometries to monitor 3D light scattering.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our achievements in technical design can provide a significant impact on the construction of similar apparatus useful for portions of the spectrum where refractive optics cannot be used, such as far UV or XUV, since the &nbsp;<em>tr</em>-ARHELS setup uses reflective metallic optics and an all-vacuum design. Explicit knowledge was obtained and numerous technical problems were solved in the design and development of key components for the <em>tr</em>-ARHELS apparatus. Three major technical problems in the construction and operations of the diffraction apparatus were solved:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>(1) To reach cryogenic temperatures and be able to record diffracted signal within the hemisphere without significant obstruction, especially at large polar angles. None of the cryogenic systems available in the market allow observing diffracted signal from the sample at polar angles above ~30<sup>o</sup>-40<span><sup>o</sup></span>. In order to solve this problem, all focusing optics was installed inside the vacuum chamber equipped with a specially designed cryostat with precise computer-controlled positioning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>(2) To record scattered field within the full hemisphere over the sample surface during one single laser shot. Only some diffractometers allow single-shot measurement of 3D field, however within small (several degrees) angular range. We provided a rigorous design that utilizes reflective metallic optics, particularly a 500-mm-diameter aluminum elliptical mirror. Using a large elliptical mirror we can collect all scattered light within the hemisphere and project it onto CCD camera. The advantage of this design is that it can be used not only for light diffraction, but also to build state-of-the-art XUV scatterometers to record scattered field within the full hemisphere (i.e. within almost all angular range over the sample surface). Currently, such scatterometers do not exist owing to technical complexity.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>(3) New algorithms and software were developed for the instrument operation and for real-time and posterior diffraction data analysis. These algorithms solve the inverse scattering problem and reconstruct and allow visualization of the transient autocorrelation function and power spectral density function of the surface optical inhomogeneities. One of the new features discovered and experimentally confirmed in this project is the possibility to achieve super-resolution in diffraction imaging using phase retrieval algorithms. Different methods of High-Performance Computing were developed using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) technology for the "NVIDIA Tesla K80" card. These achievements are enabling insight into the nonsteady state of multi-scale structural irregularities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project provided an excellent education and training opportunity for numerous STEM students at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, and also stimulated the foundation of the first <em>OSA Student Chapter</em> in Puerto Rico. Students acquired unique skills in physical optics, nonlinear optics, ultrafast optics and diffraction, and in the operation of optical vacuum systems. This experience allows them to continue their career in universities or National Laboratories, where optical and diffraction techniques are deeply integrated into condensed matter research. Beyond optical diffraction, these skills are directly related to different emerging ultrafast diffraction techniques, including free electron laser and synchrotron X-ray and XUV diffraction.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Sergiy&nbsp;Lysenko</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531627/1531627_10394681_1606699468030_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531627/1531627_10394681_1606699468030_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="tr-ARHELS instrument"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531627/1531627_10394681_1606699468030_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="tr-ARHELS instrument"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">tr-ARHELS instrument</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sergiy Lysenko</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sergiy&nbsp;Lysenko</div> <div class="imageTitle">tr-ARHELS instrument</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531627/1531627_10394681_1606700833483_Fig_0A_13--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531627/1531627_10394681_1606700833483_Fig_0A_13--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Low-T V2O3 scattering"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531627/1531627_10394681_1606700833483_Fig_0A_13--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Low-T V2O3 scattering"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(a) 3D light scattering indicatrices for V2O3/Al2O3 (A-cut) at T=296 K, T=160 K, T=120 K, and T=6.2 K.
