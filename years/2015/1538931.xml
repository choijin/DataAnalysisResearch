<AbstractNarration>Irises originated in the Northern Hemisphere and consist of about 260 species that have colorful multidimensional flowers. This proposal focuses on understanding the evolution of a large group within Irises, a group that is morphologically diverse with plants ranging from tall to dwarf species.  The evolution of this group will be studied by sampling the morphological and biogeographical diversity within the focal group. In addition, relationships among Iris species will be assessed using genetic data. The evolution of important vegetative and floral characters will be examined as a result of clarifying the evolutionary relationships among Iris species. In addition, this project will conduct developmental studies to decipher the pattern of formation of the elaborate, tri-dimensional, flowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This group of plants are of economic importance and are commonly used in public and private gardens. In many regions of the world Iris species are rare in nature leading several nations to protect all species. This project will train graduate and undergraduate students; in addition an international student will be trained in molecular genetic techniques. Seminars on this research will be given to the general public and horticultural groups.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With about 300 species, <em>Iris</em> comprise a diverse Northern Hemisphere genus that provides significant food resources including nectar, pollen, arils, and underground storage organs rich in carbohydrates and oils. In open steppe and grassland communities, <em>Iris </em>is often the dominant showy plant present in the landscape. With funds from this study DNA sequence data was produced that resulted in statistically supported estimates of evolutionary relationships. It was determined that our current understanding of <em>Iris</em> as having six major groups (subgenera) is an oversimplification and that at least 12 major groups are present. Subgenus <em>Iris</em> (bearded irises), the focus of this study, is one of the few historical subgenera that are supported with only a few reassignments of species from other groups. Species in the subgenus have beards on their sepals and are closely related to species that have sepals with crests, a finding not suggested previously. This study resulted in recognition of six well-differentiated groups (sections) in bearded irises that can be recognized by characters such as position of beards, rhizome morphology, seed morphology, and geography. One of the two relatively large sections originated in the Caucasus and dispersed to the eastern Mediterranean Basin where it underwent considerable diversification while the other large section is Eurasian. Small sections are from either eastern or central Asia. Surprising diversity in floral morphology was revealed including flowers with sepals that are bee-like in form and are pollinated by male bees who move pollen while attempting to mate with what they consider female bees but are actually narrow, hairy sepals with patterns resembling bee markings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Subgenus <em>Iris</em> (bearded irises) are culturally significant, particularly in European, Mediterranean and Central Asian countries, are important in gardening and horticulture across the globe, and have a long history of medicinal and cosmetic uses. Activities of this project resulted in impacts to science and society beyond the direct findings of the research conducted. Undergraduate and graduate students including two international graduate students were trained in DNA sequencing, comparative morphology, and bio-informatics and contributed to papers presented and/or articles published. Several collaborations with national and international researchers, botanic gardens and herbaria were developed that are continuing beyond the end of these research funds. Important physical resources such as voucher specimens, datasets, and images resulted as well as significant genomic resources, such as the entire plastid genome of <em>Iris gatesii</em> (the first for Iridaceae), DNA sequence data from more than 200 species, and a set of probes that can be used to target more than 600 nuclear genes. Outreach to increase science literature was an important goal of this project and included talks given to the general public and horticultural groups, publications in gardening and horticulture journals, and a webpage on <em>Iris</em> research.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/17/2017<br>      Modified by: Carol&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wilson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1538931/1538931_10039333_1484640820558_paradoxa-nsf--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1538931/1538931_10039333_1484640820558_paradoxa-nsf--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Iris paradoxa"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1538931/1538931_10039333_1484640820558_paradoxa-nsf--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Iris paradoxa"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Image of Iris paradox and close-up of sepal that has a bee-like form with markings.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Carol A.
