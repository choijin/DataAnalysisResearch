<AbstractNarration>Supplying electricity to small-scale microelectronics is a growing issue. Conventional power sources are both expensive and environmentally toxic. Additionally, many rely on rare-earth elements, whose future production is difficult to ensure. This award supports research aimed at developing a fully sustainable, biological battery. This unit will use living cells to generate electricity. This project will be conducted under the supervision Professor Chao-Min Cheng of National Tsing Hua University. These batteries will be designed to live within a paper-based reactor. Dr. Cheng is a leading expert of paper-based microtechnology, and the project will leverage his extensive knowledge in developing small scale paper diagnostic reactors for this battery project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing a low cost paper-based microfluidic biological battery will synthesizing work microbiology, microfluidics, materials science, chemistry, and electronics. First, a paper-based microfluidic channel will be designed that limits the abnormalities caused by lateral wax diffusion during the manufacturing process. This requires knowledge of the fluidic design of liquid max and how it interacts with the mechanical contours of the paper. For this the project will use microscopy to determine boundary conditions and combine this insight with first-principal based analytical fluid models. These models will inform how the wax layers are spread and designed. Second, a paper-based microfluidic channel that immobilizes bacteria through the use of fluid regimes abnormalities in the chromatography paper will be modeled, designed and manufactured. The genetically engineered Geobacter sulfurreducens and Shewanella oneidensis will be used for their redox capabilities. Employing the above work with additive manufacturing, paper-based biological batteries capable of supplying power to low draw microelectronics will be assembled. This final step will rely on layering our paper-based microfluidic chamber vertically and connecting the anode and cathode terminals with a small AU filament. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>
