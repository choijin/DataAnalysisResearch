<AbstractNarration>The Antarctic subglacial environment remains one of the least explored regions on Earth.  This project will examine the physical and biological characteristics of Subglacial Lake Mercer, a lake that lies 1200m beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.  This study will address key questions relating to the stability of the ice sheet, the subglacial hydrological system, and the deep-cold subglacial biosphere.  The education and outreach component aims to widely disseminate results to the scientific community and to the general public through short films, a blog, and a website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subglacial Lake Mercer is one of the larger hydrologically active lakes in the southern basin of the Whillans Ice Plain, West Antarctica.  It receives about 25 percent of its water from East Antarctica with the remainder originating from West Antarctica, is influenced by drain/fill cycles in a lake immediately upstream (Subglacial Lake Conway), and lies about 100 km upstream of the present grounding line of the Ross Ice Shelf.  This site will yield information on the history of the Whillans and Mercer Ice Streams, and on grounding line migration.  The integrated study will include direct sampling of basal ice, water, and sediment from the lake in concert with surface geophysical surveys over a three-year period to define the hydrological connectivity among lakes on the Whillans Ice Plain and their flow paths to the sea. The geophysical surveys will furnish information on subglacial hydrology, aid the site selection for hot-water drilling, and provide spatial context for interpreting findings. The hot-water-drilled boreholes will be used to collect basal ice samples, provide access for direct measurement of subglacial physical, chemical, and biological conditions in the water column and sediments, and to explore the subglacial water cavities using a remotely operated vehicle equipped with sensors, cameras, and sampling equipment. Data collected from this study will address the overarching hypothesis "Contemporary biodiversity and carbon cycling in hydrologically-active subglacial environments associated with the Mercer and Whillans ice streams are regulated by the mineralization and cycling of relict marine organic matter and through interactions among ice, rock, water, and sediments". The project will be undertaken by a collaborative team of scientists, with expertise in microbiology, biogeochemistry, hydrology, geophysics, glaciology, marine geology, paleoceanography, and science communication.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Summary:</strong>&nbsp;Subglacial Antarctic Lakes Scientific Access (SALSA) was an interdisciplinary NSF-funded 5-year project to investigate the dynamics, history of an active subglacial lake in West Antarctica (Mercer Subglacial Lake under Mercer Ice Stream) through geophysical data collection (ground-based and satellite) and drilling (allowing for direct access). The drilling season involved a 30+ person team for 3 weeks in 2018/2019, using clean hot-water drilling through 1090&nbsp;m of ice. A large interdisciplinary team came together and studied an integrated system, examining interactions among ice, water, sediment, rock, microbes, and carbon reservoirs within the lake water column and underlying sediments. The Scripps team was responsible for the geophysical data collection.</p> <p><strong>Background:</strong>&nbsp; Antarctica&rsquo;s ice sheet is 2.2&nbsp;km and rests on top of bedrock; the insulation, high pressure, and geothermal heat flux at the ice-bed interface leads to melting of the basal ice layers on the order of mm/year. Averaged over the entire ice sheet, this produces high volumes of subglacial water (estimated is ~65&nbsp;Gt/yr), much of which is stored in subglacial lakes and aquifers. The Antarctic water system is largely hidden from observations and difficult to access.</p> <p>In 2006, PI Helen Fricker discovered active subglacial water systems under the fast-flowing ice streams of West Antarctica using ICESat data. Observations of large height changes (up to 10&nbsp;m in some places) in repeat-track ICESat laser altimeter data, were shown to correspond to draining and filling of subglacial lakes beneath 1-2&nbsp;km of ice. Satellite measurements since 2003 have showed us that ice-surface height changes on the order of several meters correspond to draining and filling of &gt;130 &ldquo;active&rdquo; subglacial lakes across the whole ice sheet; water moves from one reservoir to another, forming an interconnected subglacial water system, and many of these systems extend under fast-flowing ice streams, potentially affecting ice flow rates. Satellite measurements have been limited by how often they collect data and their coverage.</p> <p><strong>Contribution of SALSA:</strong>&nbsp;In the 15 years since the discovery of active Antarctic subglacial water systems, much progress has been made in our understanding of these dynamic systems, and two of the lakes have now been drilled, one during this project (SALSA) and one during the project that preceded it (WISSARD), both funded by the National Science Foundation. which had its main field season in 2018/2019.</p> <p>The SIO team took part in three field seasons.

We were loaned two phase-sensitive radar (ApRES) instruments from the Australian Antarctic Division to deploy on the lake; these will help us unravel the effects of surface height changes due to water movement vs the ice dynamic effect afterwards, which has been a subject of debate in glaciology for some time.
