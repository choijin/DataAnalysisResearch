<AbstractNarration>This research project explores the mathematical properties of a class of equations known as nonlinear dispersive equations.  Equations of this type arise in models of several physical phenomena, including propagation of light in optical fibers, Bose-Einstein condensates, small-amplitude water waves, and waves in plasmas.  Despite their common occurrence, understanding of the behavior of solutions to such equations is limited by their mathematical complexity.  This project aims to extend current theoretical understanding of this important class of equations.  Training of junior researchers and students in this area of research is also an integrated part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems to be investigated are nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations with broken symmetries and/or non-constant coefficients. While some of these equations are very physical, such as the cubic-quintic nonlinear Schrodinger equation with non-zero boundary conditions, others have been carefully selected by the investigator to highlight certain deficiencies in our mathematical understanding of the underlying linear propagator. A major thrust of this project is therefore to resolve questions in harmonic analysis related to the linear propagator in various geometries. These range from proving Strichartz estimates powerful enough to resolve the small data energy-critical problem on high-dimensional tori to shepherding recent progress on the restriction conjecture into the realm of non-constant coefficients, which is a key step toward resolving mass-critical problems outside the translation-invariant setting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intelectual Merits:  The Korteweg-de Vries equation was derived more than 200 years ago to explain the experimental observation of solitary waves --- isolated humps of water that travel large distances without changing shape. While this phenomenon was first observed in water, such waves occur in many media. For example, their tight shape makes them useful in fiber optics communication. Remarkably, it was later discovered by physicists at the Physics Plasma Laboratory in Princeton that this equation admits infinitely many symmetries. As the simplest equation satisfying these extraordinary properties, it has been a subject of intense studies for a long time. The most significant outcome of this project was obtaining a definitive result on optimal existence and uniqueness of solutions to this equation. The method we developed has already shown great promised for future development. In works supported by this grant we have demonstrated its utility in studying white noise initial data, as well as other solitonic equations. This method has also proved useful for simplifying previous results. For example, a student of the PI used it to give a new proof of symplectic non-squeezing for the Korteweg-de Vries equation, which means that the flow cannot squeeze a ball of initial data into a cylinder of lesser cross-sectional area.   Broader Impacts:  In total, the project supported the scientific advancement of five graduate students and two postdoctoral researchers. The PI also delivered a mini-course at the Summer Northwestern Analysis Program organized at Northwestern University, 2017. The audience was mostly comprised of undergraduate and graduate students from universities both within the US and abroad. The PI both lectured to and had informal discussions with French high-school girls at the CIRM Science Camp, France, 2017. This was an event organized by the French Ministry of Education. The PI organized with H. Koch, P. Raphael, and D. Tataru a conference on Nonlinear Waves and Dispersive Equations in Oberwolfach, Germany, 2017. She also organized with R. Killip and S. Kwon a summer school "Harmonic Analysis and Dispersive PDE" for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, held in South Korea, 2015.
