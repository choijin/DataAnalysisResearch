<AbstractNarration>Electrical stimulation of the surface of the brain is used to map functions, such as hand movement. This stimulation is vital for both brain research and patient care.  Better methods are needed to precisely direct the electrical current on the brain surface. Precise stimulation will help research in restoring damage after neurological injury. Stimulation and recording from the brain surface have also been used to study memory and attention processes.  Research in the development of neuro-prosthetics and the study of how the brain interacts with brain-controlled devices may also benefit from more precise stimulation. This project uses advanced computer modeling to determine better ways of stimulating the brain.  One can predict where the stimulation will go based on these models. It will be tested whether using these models can precisely steer the stimulation to target specific brain functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This US-German collaborative project combines expertise from the University of Washington (PI: J. Ojemann, Neurosurgery), Northeastern University (D. Brooks, Electrical Engineering), the University of Utah (R. McLeod, Center for Integrative Biomedical Computing) and, in Germany, the University of Freiburg (T. Ball, Computational Neuroscience and Neurotechnology).  The optimization protocols developed at Northwestern and Utah can predict the distribution of current delivery, which will be validated in a sheep model and subsequently used to predict current delivery in human data.  For instance, complex geometries of brain surface (electrocorticography) electrodes may give varying patterns of current across the brain.  By using simultaneous stimulation and recording data from the cortical surface (in either sheep or human brain in vivo), the model and optimization algorithms can be assessed. Successful methods for "current steering" would be applicable across a broad range of research and patient care applications in neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A companion project is being funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This collaborative project, across the University of Washington, Northeastern University, University of Utah and University of Freiburg (Germany) worked on optimizing the design and pattern of stimulation through electrodes on the surface of the brain to direct electrical current to different cortical targets. The goals were to create optimization using detailed (and individualized to either human patients or sheep with indwelling electrodes) models, to validate these models, and to test these models' ability to predict measured current across different patterns of stimulation in humans. We have collected data in novel electrode configurations and shown agreement of our computational models with measured values.  Additionally, we have demonstrated that the animal (sheep) model can be used to monitor heat and current delivery. We have completed a successful pipeline from patient data acquisition to stimulation of a specific region of interest. In these subjects, a prior anatomical (T1- and T2-weighted) MRI was acquired and tissue segmented. The CT images acquired post-implantation allowed only 72h to produce optimized stimulation parameters. The CT was sent to the Utah team with an identified ROI or ROIs.

In parallel, studies in the sheep model have used higher resolution arrays and have shown that different fields can be created and measured. This will allow for specific resistivity measures and improved future modeling of current delivery. Intellectual Merit: This project developed a new integrated suite of tools for the construction and optimization of brain stimulation of identified regions of interest from cortical surface and depth electrodes while maintain desired safety constraints, all computable within a rigorous clinical timeframe. We tested these results on human subjects with positive initial results. We also in parallel developed a sheep model allowing the use of higher-resolution cortical arrays to guide future development.   Broader Impact:  This was the first attempt to ‘steer’ current for somatosensory stimulation. Similar to prior work in deep brain stimulation, this work has impacted the ability of the brain-computer interface field to consider feedback to deeper structures of the brain with surface stimulation. This project has informed other imaging and modeling disciplines in addressing the challenges of non-linear deformation from surgical implantation of electrodes.
