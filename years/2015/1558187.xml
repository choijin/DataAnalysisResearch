<AbstractNarration>This project integrates psychological and sociological theories of social influence into a single framework. Within psychology, the distribution of opinions in task groups is one of the dominant factors explaining social influence, with people being influenced by the majority in a group. Within sociology, status characteristics, such as educational attainment, general intelligence, and even gender, have been shown to be related to social influence, with higher status people being more influential over group decision making. This project examines how the distribution of opinions and relative status combine to affect social influence. As such, it contributes to research and theory in sociology and psychology, and also contributes to generalizable knowledge regarding how the structure of task groups may shape their outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two laboratory studies constitute the empirical component of this project. The first uses highly controlled protocols to isolate the joint effects of status and the distribution of opinions on social influence. The experimental procedures ensure other factors are not explaining variations in social influence. The second study applies the theory to groups of individuals that will be recruited from the broader community. Specifically, groups of three or six people will be invited to the laboratory to participate in an open interaction session. They will be asked to form an opinion about a task, to share that opinion with the group, and then asked for their final opinions. Changes in initial opinions constitutes social influence, and is expected to follow from status processes and the distribution of opinions in predictable ways. These groups will systematically vary in their composition by gender, age, occupation, and race. Statistical modeling will be employed to discern the effects of status and the distribution of opinions on social influence.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project examined how people are influenced by other group members in task groups, such as juries, committees or other work groups. Two longstanding traditions explain influence in such settings as a function of the number of people trying to influence a focal individual, or the relative status of others trying to influence a focal individual. While both of these traditions have come a long way towards understanding social influence, they have not previously incorporated each others strengths. The research supported by this award allowed for a systematic, experimental investigation of how relative status and the number of individuals trying to influence an individual combine to shape social influence. The theory argued that status would matter most when the distribution of opinions was evenly split. This is because the distribution of opinions fails to reduce uncertainty when it is evenly divided. As the distribution of opinions moves from an even split, the effect of status-based influence should become stronger. Results from a series of experiments on human subjects found support for this argument. What is more, the theory asserts that both status and the distribution of opinions shape patterns of social influence because they reduce uncertainty about the task on which the group is working. Results find partial support for this prediction. Perceptions of task certainty explain some of the effect of status and the distirbution of opinions on social influence. These results are robust across the sex of the focal individual, the size of the group, and the type of status differentiation. In more practical terms, this work sheds light on social influence processes that are observed on daily basis in schools, workplaces, and other places where individuals have to work together to solve problems.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/08/2017<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;Melamed</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
