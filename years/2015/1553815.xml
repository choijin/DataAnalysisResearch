<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will provide fundamental understanding of a novel technique to fabricate complex micro optics through generating surface textures on bulk metallic glasses. Micro optics with surface textures play a significant role in broad applications, such as automotive illumination systems, high-resolution display panels, diffraction gratings for laser systems, and reflective mirrors for traffic safety. Bulk metallic glasses have been increasingly used in fabricating micro optics due to high hardness, high corrosion resistance and no surface defects. However, micro optics produced with existing techniques using bulk metallic glasses usually have high fabrication cost, limited geometric accuracy and surface quality due to thermal deformations of the material. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research of a novel technique to fabricate complex micro optics through generating surface textures on bulk metallic glasses by diamond machining with applied vibrations. The new technique will significantly reduce production cost, and improve component quality (both geometric accuracy and surface roughness). The award also supports activities to integrate research results into education, expose the public to precision manufacturing and optics engineering, and prepare next-generation engineers in advanced manufacturing areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the new technique, the planar vibration of the workpiece causes intermittent tool-workpiece contact, resulting in high-frequency variations of temperature and stress in material removal region. The first research objective is to uncover the relationship between amorphous-crystalline transition of bulk metallic glasses and temperature variation. It will be achieved by finite element modeling of the texturing process to predict temperature and amorphous-crystalline transition. The simulation results will be verified by measuring spatial-temporal temperature using a novel system combining a pyrometer and an infrared camera, and characterizing crystallization of the original amorphous microstructure through X-ray diffraction. The second objective is to determine the influences of stress variation in texturing process on deformation mode (inhomogeneous and homogeneous) of bulk metallic glasses. To achieve this objective, stress variation will be simulated through finite element method, and material deformation mode will be measured in-situ using acoustic emission signals. The third objective is to determine the effects of process parameters (tool geometry, texturing conditions, and vibration assistance parameters) on geometric accuracy of surface textures. The process dynamics including forced vibrations of tool and assisted vibrations of workpiece will be analytically modeled, and the simulated texture geometry will be experimentally verified using surface profilometer. Modeling and experiments for the three objectives will be conducted under various process parameters.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project investigated the fundamental mechanism of material deformation and surface generation in producing surface textures on Zirconium - based bulk metallic glasses (Zr-BMG). The outcomes of the project are:</p> <p>1. A surface texturing technique was developed using inclined milling process with vibration assistance. Surface texturing experiments were conducted on a 5-axis machining center using a single-flute polycrystalline diamond milling tool, with the setup shown in Figure 1. The material deformation for three materials including OFHC copper, AISI 304 stainless steel, and Zr-BMG was investigated in the surface texturing process. It was found that the entry regions of the generated surface cavities involve shearing of workpiece material, while the exit regions mainly involve compression. Workpiece material property plays a significant role in the chip geometry and the surface topography. Texturing on OFHC copper generates a tetrahedron-shape chip due to the high ductility of copper, while texturing on AISI 304 stainless steel produces a flat chip shape with vein-type microstructure. In the texturing of Zr-BMG, the chips involve periodic lamellar structure, and each lamella contains several shear bands, which is due to inhomogeneous deformation of BMG material. The distance of the lamellae in the exit regions is smaller than that in the entry regions due to higher compressive stress. The comparison of the machined chip and surface is shown in Figure 2. Rapid tool wear in texturing Zr-BMG is observed due to the high hardness of the workpiece if vibration assistance is not applied. Furthermore, feed rate influences the spacing of the generated surface texture. Higher speed produces separate cavities on the surface, while leading to higher forces and tool wear rate.</p> <p>2. Vibration assistance in the surface texturing process reduces the cutting force and tool wear rate due to reduced chip load, therefore enabling the proposed texturing process on Zr-BMG with high hardness. Added vibration assistance produces additional waviness on each surface cavity in the texturing of copper and stainless steel, while it does not change the surface profile for Zr-BMG due to the high hardness of the workpiece material. The direction of vibration assistance changes the orientation of lamellae in texturing of Zr-BMG, and vibration assistance applied in two dimensions simultaneously provides better chip formability compared to the process without vibration assistance. The chip formation and surface generation in surface texturing of Zr-BMG with vibration assistance in various directions are shown in Figure 3.</p> <p>3. Milling of Zr-BMG causes light emission and material melting, depending on the cutting speed and the chip load. Amorphous microstructure is dominant when material melting does not occur. The short-range atomic distance decreases due to the cutting force load. Surface melting causes crystallization of the material on both chip and machined surface. However, the microstructure phase between the chip and the surface is different during oxidation. The surface microstructure property with material crystallization in milling of Zr-BMG is shown in Figure 4. Adhesive wear is the dominant mechanism in tool flank wear in the milling process. Tool wear suppresses the light emission due to ploughing effect with larger tool edge radius. Application of mist coolant is able to reduce tool wear rate by reducing the strength of light emission. However, when spindle speed reaches beyond 90,000 rpm, the coolant cannot take away enough heat produced by the machining process, which leads to fast tool wear.</p> <p>4. In order to understand the fundamental material deformation mechanism of Zr-BMG in the cutting process, orthogonal cutting experiments were conducted. Due to the amorphous structure of the BMG material, shear bands are generated and lamellar chips are formed in cutting process even when cutting speed is lower than 1.0 m/min. The lamellar chip formation cause stress and temperature oscillations in the material deformation zones, therefore affecting the machined surface quality and tool life. Cutting force and acoustic emission (AE) signals were measured during the cutting process, and the lamellae in the machined chip were examined using scanning electron microscopy. It was concluded the shear band frequency can be obtained based on the frequency spectra of the measured AE results.</p> <p>5. This project supported one Ph.D. student, three Master students, and one undergraduate student. The students performed surface texturing experiments on Zr-BMG, and examined the cutting force, acoustic emission signal, machined chip geometry and surface topography. The research improved the understanding on the material deformation mechanism of BMG due to its amorphous structure. One journal paper and three conference papers were published based on the research results. Furthermore, the design principal and the dynamic analysis on the two-dimensional vibration stage used in this project were introduced to the undergraduate students in the Mechanical Vibration (4th year undergraduate) course which was taught in 2016 Fall semester. The course content will enhance the students? understanding on the dynamics in manufacturing processes.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/05/2018<br>      Modified by: Xiaoliang&nbsp;Jin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1553815/1553815_10406686_1541431673320_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1553815/1553815_10406686_1541431673320_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1553815/1553815_10406686_1541431673320_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Experimental Setup of Surface Texturing of BMG with Vibration Assistance.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaoliang Jin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaoliang&nbsp;Jin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1553815/1553815_10406686_1541431764778_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1553815/1553815_10406686_1541431764778_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1553815/1553815_10406686_1541431764778_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Chip Formation in Surface Texturing of (a) OFHC Copper (b) AISI 304 Stainless Steel (c) Zr-BMG.
