<AbstractNarration>1510550 - Marchese&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate how the Diesel fuel droplet can be ignited under conditions representative of those inside the engine.  Because of the very lean combustion conditions, fuel costs and pollutant formation can be reduced from those of traditional diesel or spark ignited engines.  The research will involve graduate students, thus preparing them for a research or engineering career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental measurements and chemical kinetic studies are proposed on diesel droplet ignition/combustion in premixed methane-air mixture using a rapid compression machine (RCM) at conditions representative of those of engines, i.e., high pressures and high temperatures. The result will have implication for RCCI (reactivity controlled compression ignition) combustion in that fuel costs and pollutant formation can be reduced from those of traditional diesel or spark ignited engines.  The RCCI concept involves combustion of two fuels in each engine cycle, in which one fuel is more difficult to ignite than the other.  The true dual fuel combustion where the ambient is a lean mixture of fuel-air will be studied for the first time.  The proposed study simplifies several of the steps in RCCI combustion to focus attention on the vaporization and ignition of the more easily ignited component, n-heptane in this proposed study, and its subsequent ability to ignite the main fuel (natural gas, which is relatively cheap, and thus the potential to reduce fuel costs).  The investigation will yield much needed RCCI combustion data to help advance the industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The combustion of two fuels with disparate reactivity in an internal combustion engine has the potential to increase fuel efficiency, reduce fuel costs and reduce pollutant formation.  For example, due to recent decreases in the price of natural gas, the incentive exists to operate engines in dual-fuel mode, where some amount of diesel is substituted with natural gas.  Since natural gas is expected to remain less expensive on a per-unit-energy basis than diesel fuel for the foreseeable future, it will continue to be economically advantageous to maximize the substitution percentage of natural gas in dual-fuel engines.   However, at higher natural gas substitution percentages, uncontrolled fast combustion (i.e. engine knock) can occur, which limits the load of the engine and can shorten the lifetime of engine components.  Emission of unburned methane has also been shown to increase with increasing natural gas substitution percentage. Previous detailed computational engine modeling at CSU with reduced chemical kinetics and simplified spray models has captured these effects but little data are available to validate chemistry and spray models at engine-relevant conditions.  In this study, a rapid compression machine (RCM) was used as a platform to provide a high-temperature/high-pressure environment to better understand the thermodynamic, transport and chemical kinetic phenomena of dual-fuel combustion.   The RCM was modified to perform evaporation and combustion experiments on single n-alkane fuel droplets in gaseous inert, O2/inert and O2/CH4/inert environments.   Droplet evaporation experiments were performed on C5 to C12 n-alkane droplets in inert gas to measure droplet evaporation rates at near supercritical and supercritical conditions (18 bar &lt; P &lt; 35 bar;  450 K &lt; T &lt;  850 K).   The dual-fuel droplet evaporation and combustion experiments were studied using high speed pressure data and images collected a high speed schlieren optical system.  In the combustion experiments, ignition delay of heptane/O2/inert was quantified at elevated pressure and temperature (27 bar &lt; P &lt; 38 bar; 844 K &lt; T &lt; 1251 K).  In addition, the process of dual-fuel combustion was captured, showing two distinct ignition events.    Two graduate students were supported and obtained their MS degrees in Mechanical Engineering based on the work supported by NSF under this grant.  Multiple undergraduate students also made strong contributions to the project, including one student who is now completing his graduate degree on a combustion project funded by the Department of Energy.   The improvements to the RCM system that were realized from the support from NSF under this grant have resulted in a unique capability that has garnered additional support from DOE and private industry to study the physics of uncontrolled autoignition at engine-relevant pressures and temperatures.
