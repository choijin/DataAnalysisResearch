<AbstractNarration>From Friday, January 9, 2015 Sunday to January 11, 2015 the Conference: "Dynamics Days" will be hosted by the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics (CTBP), an NSF Physics Frontier Center. Located in Houston with participation from Rice University, the Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Houston, the CTBP mission is to foster the convergence of physics and biology to make sense of complex living systems. At the same time, results from this research will feed back into physics in general, and help develop new ways of thinking about all complex system phenomena. The conference will be attended by 100-200 people, with the core of the audience consisting from physicists and mathematicians, but including a substantial number of people from other fields such as engineering, biology, and chemistry. The conference format consists of a single plenary session. Topics covered in the conference will include dynamics on and of complex networks, nonlinear dynamics of biological systems, synchronization and self-organization of nonlinear systems, geophysical fluid dynamics, and pattern formation. This conference is essential for maintaining coherence among all the disparate researchers involved in using physics and mathematics to make sense of complex systems. Thus, researchers focusing on the Physics of Living Systems (PoLS) will be able to interact directly with researchers who may be pioneering new methods, in other contexts. Conversely, scientists who have never been exposed to the enormous challenges encountered in the biological realm will get to hear talks by leading PoLS researchers and may have much to offer. Even as the PoLS field reaches out to the biology community, maintaining ties with physics remain a high priority. Dynamics Days will help make sure that this occurs. This meeting will bring together scientists actively engaged in Dynamics research. Most of the participants in Dynamics Days will be students and postdocs coming from a broad spectrum of the community. They will all be expected to present posters on their own research work. The most immediate broad impact will be on broadening the educational experience for the junior participants. In addition, local undergraduates, both from Rice and from the CTBP's existing network of collaborating minority- and Hispanic- serving institutions will be invited.</AbstractNarration>
