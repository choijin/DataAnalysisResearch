<AbstractNarration>The 5th International Summit on Hurricanes and Climate Change will take place June 9-14, 2015 in Chania, Crete, Greece with organizing support provided by Aegean Conferences. The purpose of this summit is to bring together an international assemblage of leading academics and researchers on various sides of the debate to discuss new research and express findings about climate changes and future climate scenarios and their implications regarding regional and global hurricane (tropical cyclone) activity. The goals are to address what research is needed to advance the science of the hurricane climate and to provide a venue for encouraging a lively, spirited, and sustained exchange of ideas. Specific topics that will be addressed include surface wind fields, storm surge, seasonal prediction, remote sensing, interannual variability, paleotempestology, lightning, decadal variability, intensification, extra-tropical transition, air-sea exchange, and landfall probability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts will be a better understanding of the future hurricane threat to the U.S. and elsewhere as well as to allow early career participants to have international exposure of their research and network with each other as well as with leading international scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Collins and Walsh received a book contract (Springer) - the research  presented at the Summit can be disseminated to a wider audience.   Submissions from paleo-tempestology and sub-fields of  meteorology/climatology.  Early and advanced career participants  submitted including funded recipients.  Muller,  unable to attend due to  immigration issues, submitted a chapter with Collins who presented.  Collins/Murnane had discussions with Emanuel/ Holland to focus the  discussions at the 2017 summit on risk assessment and to include a  broader perspective including social science.  12 early career recipients - offered funding. Funds distributed  evenly between the two programs which provided supported. Some  recipients from under-represented groups.  Trouet, awardee, networked at the Summit. WHILE AT THE SUMMIT, she,  Collins and Welford submitted a paleotempestology grant application to  RPI.  Three months latert, post-Summit feedback was sought from the early  career recipients.

Finally, the summit afforded me the opportunity to meet  new  people within the field that I likely wouldnÆt have otherwise   (particularly those attending the summit from outside the U.S.). The   "smaller" size versus say an AGU or AMS conference along with a more   personal setting (group meals, etc.) allowed for more scientific   discussion than IÆve experienced at any other meeting.  Trey Alvey  Two important developments for me were being able to share a new   project I am working on with members of the ocean community. As   generally an atmospheric modeler, being able to discuss this new avenue   of my work with that particular subset of TC researchers was very   important.
