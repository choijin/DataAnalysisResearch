<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Chalcogenide glasses are an important class of materials that have found wide-ranging applications in the areas of photonics, telecommunication, optical memory storage, photovoltaics and environmental remote sensing. However, surprisingly, little is known regarding the flow response of the parent melts or liquids from which these glasses are derived, especially when these melts are subjected to large deformation rates during various industrial forming processes, including but not limited to molding, extrusion, embossing and fiber drawing. This project aims to investigate the mechanistic relationships between deformation rate and the flow behavior at the atomic scale in a variety of chalcogenide glasses and liquids for the first time, using a variety of cutting-edge characterization techniques. This fundamental understanding may enable the identification of chalcogenide glasses suitable for low-temperature polymer-forming processes, thereby permitting their widespread application in transformative technologies with strong societal impact. Scientifically, this work impacts materials science, physical chemistry and solid state physics. The interdisciplinary nature of this work transfers knowledge between fields and provides the students with unique opportunities for intellectual growth. The impact of this research in education and outreach is in three major areas: (1) participation by students, (2) active collaboration with industry, and (3) dissemination of knowledge, especially of glass science and technology, to the broader scientific community. The research activities provide the core of special topics courses that are offered to students in materials science, chemistry and other related fields; contribute to campus programs for women and minority students; and to recruiting promising students from underrepresented and economically disadvantaged groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The non-Newtonian flow response of a supercooled glass-forming liquid, when it is driven out of equilibrium via mechanical deformation, is intimately linked to its viability for various processing techniques and is of key significance in industry in controlling and optimizing the corresponding processing parameters. This GOALI project brings together investigators with complementary expertise and common interests from the University of California at Davis (Sen) and from Corning, Incorporated (Aitken) to address the connections between the atomistic and the macroscopic aspects of the non-Newtonian flow and related phenomena in chalcogenide glass-forming liquids in the systems Ge-As-Se and Ge-P-Se using a powerful combination of state-of-the-art rheometric measurements and structural and dynamical characterization with high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  and Raman spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and small-angle X-ray scattering. Predictive atomistic models of structure-deformation-viscous flow relationships, built on the basis of the results obtained in this project, may ultimately enable the use of chalcogenide glasses in a wide range of low-temperature continuous forming processes, thereby making these materials viable for widespread applications in modern technologies ranging from photonics and telecommunication to remote sensing. The focus of this project, namely how and why, the dynamic and thermodynamic aspects of strain-induced rearrangements of the atomic structure control the shear thinning behavior and related phenomena in chalcogenide glass-forming liquids is in itself crosscutting materials research. The breadth, flexibility and interdisciplinary nature of this project prepares students with powerful experimental skills and research experience in both academic and industrial settings that may open up many opportunities for their future careers. This project also enriches the graduate education and training experience through numerous scientific dialogues and interactions between the collaborating scientists and participating students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chalcogenide glasses are sulfides, selenides or tellurides, mainly of Ge, As, P and Si that have found wide-ranging applications in the areas of infrared photonics, optical memory, photovoltaics and environmental remote sensing. The equilibrium structure-property relationships in these glasses have been studied extensively in the past.   However, surprisingly enough, little is known regarding the structure-property relationships for the parent melts or liquids from which these glasses are derived, especially when these melts are subjected to large stress or strain rate during various industrial forming processes.  This  GOALI project brought together investigators with complementary expertise from UC Davis (Sabyasachi Sen, PI) and from Corning Incorporated, world's foremost innovator and commercial developer of cutting-edge glass technology, (Bruce Aitken, co-PI) to develop a fundamental atomistic understanding of the nature of strain-induced flow response in binary and ternary chalcogenide liquids that directly affects the forming conditions and technological functionalities of the derived glasses.  Over the duration of this project the mechanistic relationships between stress/strain rate and the rheological behavior in Germanium and Arsenic sulfides and selenides have been studied in unprecedented detail and groundbreaking accomplishments have been made in their dynamical characterization.  The latter enabled the establishment of a comprehensive predictive model of viscous flow of chalcogenide liquids as a function of structural connectivity. The major scientific findings of this project are summarized below.  (1)    All families of inorganic glass-forming liquids display non-Newtonian rheological behavior in the form of shear thinning at high shear rates.  Chalcogenides are found to have a remarkable universality in their shear thinning behavior, irrespective of chemical composition, structure, topology and viscosity.  (2)  In an effort to build fundamental understanding of the atomistic mechanisms of shear thinning, structural alignment in extruded chalcogenide fibers are studied using a variety of scattering and spectroscopic techniques.  The results indicate the appearance of partial alignment of selenium chain fragments in glasses with high selenium content, which is argued to facilitate viscous flow via avoidance of chain entanglement during flow and can thereby lead to shear thinning. (3) Se and/or S -rich chalcogenide liquids display a complex rheological behavior with a slow and a fast relaxation process that are attributed, respectively, to the bond scission/renewal dynamics and the segmental motion of selenium chains. This is a discovery with tremendous fundamental implications in our understanding of shear relaxation and glass transition in chalcogenide liquids.  The segmental chain dynamics disappears for liquids with average selenium chain segments longer than ~3- 5 atoms or average coordination number less than ~2.2, thus implying a dynamical rigidity transition.  This project provided major opportunities for training and professional development of 3 graduate students: Maxwell Marple, Weidi Zhu and Bing Yuan, who were supported by this grant.  As part of this GOALI project, these students were hosted for 2 weeks every year in Dr. Aitken's laboratory at Corning's Sullivan Park R&amp;D facility throughout the duration of the project.  Industry co-PI Bruce Aitken worked closely with the students in providing mentoring and training.  This industry-university collaboration provided a unique opportunity in broadening these participating students' horizons in terms of research experience both in academia and in industry.  Maxwell completed his Ph.D. in 2018 and is currently a scientist employed by the Lawrence Livermore National Lab. Weidi is scheduled to complete his Ph.D. in the summer of 2020 and Bing is entering the third year of her Ph.D.      The PI and his research group have been active in outreach efforts throughout the duration of this project.
