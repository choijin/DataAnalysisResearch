<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Indraneel Ghosh from the University of Arizona to develop new methods for controlling the activities of enzymes implicated in posttranslational chemical modifications using a combination of protein engineering and designed small molecules. The biological activity of proteins is controlled by numerous posttranslational modifications, whereby small chemical entities are added to newly synthesized proteins.  Almost all enzymes that are responsible for catalyzing posttranslational modifications belong to large families with similar structures.  This similarity precludes the design of specific small molecule probes for the direct inhibition or activation of the function of a specific enzyme.  A few elegant chemical genetic approaches have been developed to address this need but it remains challenging to control the activity of more than one enzyme within the same family in order to turn-on a desired enzyme to probe biology or engineer new and useful pathways.  This proposal seeks to establish a toolbox of enzymes that respond to unique molecular switches.  This project at the interface of chemistry and biology will offer a rich training ground for a diverse collection of undergraduate and graduate students.  The research will also accelerate the development of multidisciplinary undergraduate courses, with a focus on modern laboratory research methods and cross-disciplinary colloquiums for discussing a number of current topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, enzymes involved in acetylation and deacetylation will be redesigned for rendering them amenable to small molecule control.  A new and general method for controlling specific enzymes will also be developed using an engineered allosteric switch.  New knowledge obtained from the proposed approaches has the potential to provide the community with the ability to target multiple enzymes with unprecedented orthogonal control. These methods have the potential to better decipher the chemical cross-talk that governs biology and aid in the reengineering of cellular pathways with many potential applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We are very grateful to the National Science Foundation for supporting our research/educational program, which has provided numerous opportunities for the development of new edcuational material.  It has also helped in the direct education, training and professional development of both graduate and undergraduate students who have gone on to higher education (PhD in the biomedical sector) or are now part of the workforce in the Biotechnology Industrial sector.  These are important for the betterment of society and their rsearch efforts aid in a host of areas from food production, environmental betterment and human health.  The research we have carried out provides new methods to build switches that allow for the controling  the activity of functional proteins using external triggers. We have developed these new switches and their triggers in the context of human enzymes that allow us to control when they can be turned on. These new types of designed protein switches can be particualrly useful for understanding the function of specifc proteins in cells in all types of life. We have applied these switches to a calls of proteins called protein kinases and acetyl transferases that are implicated in many human diseases from cancer to dementia.  We anticipate these switches will alow for understanding the flow of information in human cells.  These designed switches beyond enhancing our basic undertanding of how cells work can also be used in biotechnological applications.  The switches can provide benefit in diverse areas that impact the well being of humanity from food production, environmental monitoring and health.
