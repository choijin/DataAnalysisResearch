<AbstractNarration>To date, that has been limited involvement by researchers and developers in the National Big Data R&amp;D Strategic Plan.  However, their input is vital to the success of the plan.  This one-day workshop in Washington, D.C. will being together academics and industry leaders across disciplines to inform the development of an effective National Big Data R&amp;D Strategic Plan.  The development of a government-wide strategic plan impacts all of the agencies involved.  The workshop will engage a range of experts to hear about the plan status and share concerns and ideas.  Incorporating this feedback will improve the plan and develop an overall blueprint for Big Data R&amp;D across much of the government.  The growth in scale, diversity, and complexity of data has increased the demand for understanding large amounts of heterogeneous data. This present new challenges to the way data and information are used and managed.   Need exists to understand ways to design systems for big data analytics, consider privacy issues that arise when using this massive data a determine ways to teach big data analytics across the sciences.  The workshops aims to balance plenary presentations and smaller focus discussion groups for in=depth discussions.  Coordinator reporters for each focus group will participate in writing the reports and outcomes of the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
