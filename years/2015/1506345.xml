<AbstractNarration>In the late 1800s, flash photography enabled the motion of macroscopic objects to be slowed to the point where the true order of events could be extracted.  Nearly a century later, femtosecond pulses (1 femtosecond is one millionth of one billionth of a second) enabled the motions of atoms to be frozen during the formation and breakup of molecules, resulting in an improved microscopic picture of chemistry.  The advent of attosecond pulses, a million times shorter, allows the motion of the tiniest building block of matter, the electron, to be stopped in its tracks.  Professors Chang, of the University of Central Florida, and Hill, of the University of Maryland, together with their students, use attosecond laser pulses to study electronic charge dynamics on timescales commensurate with its indigenous motion in atomic and molecular systems.  Charge migration, as it is known, is central to a variety of important processes such as photosynthesis, radiation damage in biomolecules and photovoltaics used in solar panels.  This collaborative project is providing insight into the collective and interactive motion of electrons that are ubiquitous in atoms, molecules and solids.  An improved understanding of charge migration will have broad application from controlling the flow of energy within a molecule to tailoring the performance of materials to specific needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photoinduced charge separation in molecules is the first step in many chemical processes and central to our understanding of electron correlation and the energy exchange between electronic and nuclear motion responsible for catalysis, photosynthesis, photovoltaics and radiation damage in biomolecules.  Comprehensive numerical simulations of complex molecules predict that when an electron is 'suddenly' removed from one end of a chain molecule, such as a small peptide, the hole can move to the other end of the molecule in less than 10 fs, before the electron-nuclear coupling takes place.  Intense, isolated attosecond pulses are required to study this naturally-occurring charge migration.  Professors Chang and Hill, in a collaborative project between the University of Central Florida (UCF) and the University of Maryland (UMD), exploit the attosecond source at UCF to investigate charge migration in multi-electron atoms (He) and multi-atom molecules (SO2) via attosecond pump - attosecond probe experiments.  The pump pulse initiates rapid excitation (in the absence of nuclear motion in the molecular case) while the probe pulse monitors the ensuing charge migration.  Two probe techniques are used to 'watch' the charge migration:  transient absorption and photoelectron angular distribution.  In distinction with previous attosecond studies, where charge migration was investigated in the presence of a strong external infrared field, the UCF-UMD study is probing charge migration subsequent to excitation but in the absence of any external perturbation.  As a consequence, this project is providing a clearer understanding of charge separation, energy flow and electron-nuclear charge coupling, which, as stated above, are relevant to a variety of processes associated with chemical reactions, dynamics in condensed matter systems and biological phenomena.  A secondary goal of this project is the development of general experimental tools that can be transferred to more complicated systems, such as ABCU (1-azabicyclo [3.3.3] undecane), for which theoretical predictions exist and the excitation spectra fall near those of the model systems of this study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An  ability  to  identify,  tag  and  follow  unambiguously,  quantum  trajectories  during charge migration in molecular systems is central to addressing questions that are key to unlocking solutions to an array of contemporary scientific and technical challenges &ndash; understanding the chemistry of interstellar media, reducing our carbon footprint, enabling efficient, clean energy sources  and controlling dynamics in biological molecules are just a few examples. Photoinduced charge dynamics, for example, is ubiquitous in catalysis, photosynthesis, the photovoltaic effect, radiation damage in biomolecules and atmospheric chemistry. With clock speeds of order 1 fs, the energy flow and correlated dance between electrons and atomic nuclei require attosecond temporal resolution and carefully-designed experimental techniques to track reliably.  Attosecond X-ray transient absorption is a powerful tool to observe the ultrafast charge dynamics in molecules. The most significant outcome of the program is the development of the attosecond X-ray sources in the 100 to 400 eV photon energy range and demonstration of attosecond  transient  absorption near the carbon K-edge (284 eV).   Ar atom was chosen for the demonstration of the temporal and spectral resolution. The state-resolved X-ray transient absorption spectrum is shown in the image.  In the experiments, the 4s and 3d levels of the L3 are populated by the photo-excitation from the core level 2P3/2,   which is followed by the Auger decay process. A two-cycle infrared pulse transfers excited state populations to other levels.   There  are  clear  half-cycle oscillations  in  the region  between  these two  levels,  which is  due to two  channel quantum interference.   Due  to  the  short  life  time  of  the  4s state  (5.4  fs),  the change  of  its  absorption  closely  follow  the 12  fs  IR pulse shape. These measurements open the way to extend attosecond time-resolved spectroscopies of molecules into the soft-X-ray energy range.
