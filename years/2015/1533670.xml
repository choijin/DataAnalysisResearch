<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides support for the design, implementation, and assessment of strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at Tougaloo College seeks to establish the foundation for "Preparing Undergraduates in STEM Holistically (PUSH)".  The goal of the project is to establish a multi-layered approach that engages faculty and students with the ultimate goal of developing a model for utilizing a strong academic environment to strengthen STEM education at the institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of the project are to:  increase student enrollment in STEM undergraduate majors, with a special emphasis in the Physical Sciences; improve retention in core courses with evidence-based teaching strategies and course redesign; and develop a dual-degree engineering curriculum with partner schools Mississippi State University and Brown University, leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees. The project will be guided by an on-going evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Tougaloo HBCU-UP Program was designed to accomplish the goal of increasing student enrollment and retention in STEM disciplines; and, increasing the number enrolling in graduate and professional school.  A significant aspect of PUSH goal achievement was evidenced by a successful Summer Science Engineering Program (SSEP) offered for 38 high school juniors and seniors during 2015-2016 and 2016-2017.  27 of the 29 senior participants in the 2017 SSEP are presently enrolled in Tougaloo College. SSEP participant responses revealed the program, tutors and teachers had a positive influence on choosing a STEM major and remaining in school based on their success in SSEP.     Mentoring experiences the upperclassmen received from faculty engaged in research projects was a strategy for implementing the retention goal. The research findings have resulted in students and faculty attending and making presentations at local and national conferences each year.  The major conference attended by faculty and students in 2017 was to the National Association of Black Chemist and Chemical Engineers.  STEM majors visited institutions where they interacted with professionals in the field who encouraged their decision to remain in a STEM discipline and pursue a subsequent career.  Field trips included visits to Ingalls Shipyard, Laser Interferometer Gravitation Wave Observatory (LIGO) in Biloxi, MS and Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN, Army Corp of Engineers in Vicksburg, MS, University of Tennessee Medical Center, Mud Island, and the Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, TN.     National conference and seminar participation also influenced retention allowing PUSH participants to associate with STEM majors, faculty, practicing professionals, and speakers. This interaction allowed them to learn more about current and relevant research in the STEM field.  Consultants who had rewarding experiences as STEM majors in the Natural Science Division (NSD) at Tougaloo College shared career opportunities and research in workshop settings that focused on computer technology and physics.  A practicing cardiologist who had participated in the Summer Science Program (now Summer Science Engineering Program) served as a consultant for the PUSH Program.  Participants attended seminars that focused on Life Science, Neurology, the Mississippi State University collaboration with Tougaloo College, and Summer Research Presentations. Collaborative efforts with other funded programs having a corresponding goal provided the opportunity of participants to attend the 11 Colloquia during the funded period.   Classes were flipped in chemistry, biology, mathematics, computer science, and physics as multiple disciplines linked together to teach basic STEM concepts. This strategy was launched in 2015 and involved faculty who agreed to participate and attend workshops to enhance their knowledge of how the flipped class concept could be applied in teaching. The data on the faculty and students? perceptions revealed they rated the strategy as successful evidenced by a high passing rate for students receiving a passing grade of "C" or better in the flipped classes.    Graduate and professional school attendance rates have fluctuated from and 11% to as high as 42% from 2002 to 2017.  The greatest impact of PUSH on increasing enrollment with students choosing a STEM major and ultimately enrolling in Tougaloo College has been through the SSEP.  Efforts are endless in retaining students and encouraging them, upon graduation, to pursue a career in a STEM discipline.
