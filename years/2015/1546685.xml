<AbstractNarration>The 11th William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is a five-day, directed workshop on Interactions between three and four manifolds, to be held at the Hamilton Mathematical Institute (HMI) in Dublin, Ireland, August 25-29, 2015. The workshop will consist of a two-day mini-course for graduate students and junior researchers, followed by a three day lecture series. The goal of the William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is to investigate  common themes and techniques in current research in geometry and topology and to support junior researchers interested in these areas.  This workshop will bring together leading researchers in the fields of three and four dimensional spaces with graduates students and junior researchers to investigate  questions at the forefront of research in these areas. The confluence of expertise from different areas will result in new collaborative projects, and in broadening the research horizons of the participants&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this year's workshop is to investigate common themes and techniques in the research of three and four-dimensional spaces. The two-day mini course will be on bridging classical three- and four-manifold theory given by Martin Scharlemann (Santa Barbara) and David Gay (Georgia). Major topics of this year's workshop include recent work related to the Schoenflies conjecture, the 4-dimensional smooth Poincare conjecture, and "trisections" of 4-manifolds.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The workshop website will be located at http://www.hamilton.tcd.ie/events/gt/gt2015.htm</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award helped to fund the 11th annual William Rowan Hamilton Workshop in Geometry and Topology, titled "Interactions between 3- and 4-manifolds".  It was held at the Hamilton Mathematical Institute (HMI) in Dublin, Ireland, August 25-29, 2015.   The workshop brought together a diverse group of researchers, from graduate students on up through established experts, for a mini-course and conference. The workshop focused on established themes in 4-manifold topology (e.g. the Schoenflies problem) and some new points of view on them (e.g. trisections), along with related topics in 3-manifold topology. The main goal was to introduce newcomers to the area through a 2-day minicourse, and to support the minicourse with a 3-day conference slate of related talks.  The first major activity was the minicourse, targeted at graduate students and newcomers to the area, which ran August 25-26.  It was co-led by Martin Scharlemann (UCSB) and David Gay (UGA), each of whom gave a sequence of four hour-long lectures.  Scharlemann lectured on material related to two old unsolved problems and approaches to them, while Gay lectured on material related to a new outlook on 4-dimensional spaces that dovetailed with the material of Scharlemann's lectures.  The second major activity was the research conference, which ran August 27-29.  It featured 14 lectures on a variety of related material.    The minicourse and lectures felt very cohesive, emphasized by many compliments to that effect by the program participants. One outcome that researchers and newcomers got (re-)educated about an old theme (the Schoenflies problem), what is known surrounding it, and potential approaches or special cases.  Another key outcome was the introduction of graduate students and postdocs to established researchers in the field.       Last Modified: 03/26/2017       Submitted by: Joshua Greene]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
