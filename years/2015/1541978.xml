<AbstractNarration>1541978&lt;br/&gt;Little&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third IWA Symposium on Lake and Reservoir Management will be held in 2015. The symposium will focus on all aspects of lake and reservoir management, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water may prove to be the most critical natural resource impacting human and ecosystem health. There is mounting evidence that the condition of water supplies in many regions of the world, including the United States, is worsening. With rapid economic growth taking place, there are challenging problems occurring in many water supply reservoirs.  This support will be used to develop a balanced array of presentations from US scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will address: 1) instrumentation and techniques for water quality monitoring; 2) in-situ control strategies to remove nutrients and contaminants, and to diminish the release of greenhouse gases; 3) best practices for the management of cyanobacteria and algae; 4) in-reservoir water quality management strategies; 5) evaluating reservoirs as barriers to or as sources of pathogens; 6) understanding the impacts of climate change; 7) employing hydrodynamic and water quality models to facilitate understanding and optimize operations; and, 8) actively integrating reservoir management and water treatment. While keynote speakers will be from around the world, this proposed project will fund US participants to the conference.</AbstractNarration>

The symposium focused on all aspects of lake and reservoir management, including: 1) instrumentation and techniques for water quality monitoring; 2) in-situ control strategies to remove nutrients and contaminants, and to diminish the release of greenhouse gases; 3) best practices for the management of cyanobacteria and algae; 4) in-reservoir water quality management strategies; 5) evaluating reservoirs as barriers to or as sources of pathogens; 6) understanding the impacts of climate change; 7) employing hydrodynamic and water quality models to facilitate understanding and optimize operations; and 8) actively integrating reservoir management and water treatment.  A single session format was used with all oral and poster presentations taking place sequentially in one auditorium, a format which encourages interdisciplinary exchange.  The program consisted of two pre-conference workshops (one workshop on oxygenation of stratified lakes and reservoirs and one workshop on algal management in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs), three days of presentations, one half-day tour of the water-supply reservoirs of the Western Virginia Water Authority, and a special post-conference Occoquan Watershed and Water Reuse Tour in Manassas, Virginia.  There were 68 attendees, with 15 students included in this total.       Last Modified: 01/23/2016       Submitted by: John C Little]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
