<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Transport and processing of granular materials costs the United States approximately one trillion dollars annually.  Further, granular flows are implicated in many catastrophic events, such as avalanches and earthquakes.  Thus, improvements in the predictive modeling of granular flow is valuable for a diverse set of engineering challenges, from the mixing of powders in the pharmaceutical industry, to rock avalanche hazard prediction and assessment. Most other efforts in this area focus primarily on the translational motion of grains from one location to another. This project, by contrast, explores the role of the rotational motion of grains in macroscale granular flows. The specific goals are to (1) measure and quantify rotations in 3D granular flows at the particle scale, (2) characterize and analyze collective rotations at the mesoscale and (3) connect rotational and translational motion across scales.  The project trains the next generation of scientists in experimental and modeling techniques that are highly transferable to a broad range of fields, e.g. to measure collective cell migration, collective firing of neurons, or to analyze social media via network analysis. The research team develops a boot camp to disseminate these approaches of measuring particle and rotational dynamics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to explore how important macroscale characteristics of granular flows emerge from the collective behavior of individual particle rotations.  Recent research indicates that particle rotations may play an important role in granular flows:  in some granular configurations, rotations can facilitate rearrangements with minimal frictional dissipation, while in other configurations torques can enhance jamming.   Rotational motion at the scale of individual grains is poorly characterized in three-dimensional systems, yet just like forces and translational motion, torques and rotations couple from grain to grain, and thus, particle scale rotations naturally connect to mesoscale and macroscale dynamics.   The project provides new insights into key bulk flow properties like reversibility and segregation, and also explores how preferred shear planes connect to rotational alignments.  The research team expects that insights into the statistics of collective rotations will have a transformative impact on the materials science of granular matter. Identifying the role of cooperative rearrangements in granular flows also has direct applications in a broad range of engineering, geophysical, and astrophysical contexts. The project's first objective, to accurately measure the 3D rotations inside a flowing granular material, builds directly on the research team's established expertise in measuring 3D granular flows. The rotational statistics and dynamics measured from careful experimental observations on 3D rotation dynamics have the potential to provide important validations for current and future models of granular flows.  The second objective, analysis of the collective behavior of rotations, has the potential to yield transformational insights into hidden mesoscale structures that could facilitate jamming or flow. We expect collective features of rotations to be as important as but distinct from collective translational motion since rotations couple in loops, while translational motion tends to couple in chains.  The approach to characterizing collective rotations is based on the team's expertise in nonlinear dynamics and network theory.  Finally, the third objective is to connect rotational dynamics across scales to gain new insights into bulk flow phenomena.  Here, the team benefits from prior in-depth studies of translational particle dynamics across scales in the context of reversibility, convective flow, and segregation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many real life granular systems are subject to cyclic compression or shearing, like roads compressed by cars, railway beds compressed by trains, geological structures cyclically compressed by earthquakes, or astronomical objects like asteroids cyclically compressed due to variations in gravity. Understanding whether the granular system will behave reversibly is important in all these cases as irreversible deformations can lead to failure of these structures.   Our hypothesis was that rotations and associated tangential forces are as important for granular dynamics and jamming as the widely studied translational motions and associated force chains. Thus we have developed a novel tool to measure collective rotations in a dense granular system. Transparent acrylic beads with one or two holes are placed inside a cubic container with transparent walls. Everything is submerged in an index matched fluid. Two scanning lasers allow capturing of 3D images.  Image analysis then enables tracking the positions and orientations of particles in three dimensions.  With this system we have carried out systematic experiments of systems under cyclic compression.  We were able to establish that at the end of each compression cycle, most beads were able to return to their initial positions, meaning that the displacement of the beads for low amplitude compressions is reversible. However this was not the case for the rotations of the beads: which did not rotate back to their initial orientation at the end of the cycle. Moreover, we found surprisingly that the amplitude of displacement and rotations where mostly uncorrelated. This means that a lot of beads moved without rotations, most probably trapped in "cages".  In parallel to the experiments, we have updated a molecular-dynamics simulation code to be able to reproduce our experiment by adding the possibility to track rotations. The numerical investigation allows us to change parameters that we cannot easily change in experiments, notably the friction between particles.  As expected we find that the correlation between the translations and rotations of the particles is directly dependent on the friction. There is a low correlation between the two at low friction as was found in the experiment. The very good agreement of the simulations and experiments also highlights the ability of the simulation approach to capture dynamics under cyclic forcing accurately.  The broader impact of our work has been through training of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in advanced analytics of 3D images, and analysis and simulation of collective behavior &ndash; both highly transferrable skills.  We have also developed and deployed demonstrations to illustrate jammed granular systems that were shown during several Maryland Day open houses of the university.
