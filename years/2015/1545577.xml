<AbstractNarration>Edward Henry, PhD Candidate at Washington University in St. Louis, will investigate ancient geometric earthen monuments in Eastern North America. This research will explore collective labor efforts within contexts of ritual action, their role in social integration, and their reflection of ideological participation. While the research focuses on the past it also has the potential to inform on the present. Ritual and community focused labor are factors which today still serve to establish and maintain social order. Scholars have noted that participatory engagement in ritualistic labor events can help create and solidify social bonds, reproduce ideologies, and reinforce sociopolitical and economic agendas. Using archaeology to assess the construction of ceremonial earthen monuments by ancient small-scale societies provides a context to explore the material indicators for social complexity, how it emerges, and is organized. A better technological and chronological understanding of how, and how quickly, earthen monuments are built by Adena and Hopewell (500 BCE-600 CE) societies of Eastern North America. These groups are seemingly mobile and do not have a state-like leadership hierarchy. Nevertheless, these people organized to build geometrically complex enclosure sites, large burial mounds, and maintain a continental exchange network in exotic goods. Examining how, how quickly, these practices of ritual landscape modification spread across the Ohio River Valley provides one understanding of emergent social complexity where massive labor feats were conducted outside a sociopolitical structure grounded in a rigid hierarchy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Henry will examine how ditch-and-embankment geometric enclosures were built across the Bluegrass Region of Central Kentucky in the Middle Ohio Valley. This region is considered the heartland of Adena and Hopewell societies in ancient Eastern North America. Examining these ritual sites in Kentucky provides a view south of the Ohio River, where chronological understandings of enclosure construction needs refinement. A better historical understanding of enclosure construction, use, and abandonment will help indicate how quickly social changes associated with the emergence of Adena and Hopewell (e.g., a hunting and horticultural economy, ceramic technology, new animalistic iconography) spread. In addition, this work will show how particular ritual practices were adopted across the region. By excavating multiple areas of eight earthen enclosures across Central Kentucky, Henry will see how the landscape was modified during each sites construction and determine if differences exist in traditions of ritual labor. He will examine the construction profiles of embankments and ditches with trenches and open large (ca. 4 x 4 meter) excavation blocks inside enclosures to explore the activities carried out within their boundaries. This robust dataset will be used to examine the organization and spread of social complexity in ancient Eastern North America. The historical component of this research will be relevant to the background of modern American Indians. This research will provide specialized archaeological training to students pursuing degrees in anthropology and archaeology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Between roughly 200 BC and AD 500, the Middle Ohio Valley in Eastern North America was a region of unprecedented cultural developments in pre-Columbian Native American history. During this time, societies referred to by archaeologists as Adena-Hopwell participated in the construction of monumental earthen infrastructure like burial mounds for select group members, and geometric earthen enclosures for periodic ritual gatherings. In addition to the creation of this ritualized landscape, elaborate items crafted from obsidian, marine shell, copper, and mica were produced and traded across most of the present-day United States. While researchers have determined this social movement lasted approximately 700 years, no one has identified how local communities began participating in Adena-Hopewell cultural practices and the rate at which they were embraced.</p> <p>This project conducted archaeological research at eight small geometric earthen enclosures across Central Kentucky to understand how quickly the ideas and practices underlying Adena-Hopewell materialized at a local scale (Fig. 1). Soil coring and excavations at these enclosures indicate that local communities were adopting the same general ideas and principles of constructing and using earthen enclosures, but they were also choosing to manipulate those ideas to fit local needs and social conventions (Fig. 2). For instance, all the enclosures this project examined were constructed by digging a ditch in a geometric form and mounding the removed soils to the exterior of the ditch. This isolated an interior platform people would have gather within. However, each embankment was constructed differently. Some were made by combining all of the excavated soils into a homogenous compound, others were made by deliberately selecting different soils at different points in the construction of the embankment (Fig. 3). In each case where an embankment preserved an original ground surface beneath it, evidence was present that the surface had been burned prior to construction of the enclosure. Other results from the refilled ditches of sites examined during this project showed that some had been refilled intentionally by humans, while others had refilled by a mixture of natural erosion processes and human action (Fig. 4).</p> <p>The timing for construction and deconstruction of enclosures in this study was examined through radiocarbon and OSL dating. Bayesian statistics applied to these dates suggest communities across Central Kentucky began participating in this aspect of the Adena-Hopewell movement quickly, beginning around 70 BC&ndash;AD 0 and ending between AD 100&ndash;165. Therefore, all of the earthen enclosures studied during this project were likely built in 170 years or less. However, the rate at which these sites were abandoned or deconstructed varied greatly. Some quit being used as early as the third century AD, while others were maintained until the eighth century AD, or preserved indefinitely.</p> <p>Curated samples of plant charcoal from the excavation of burial mounds in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century were also dated to compare the history of mound and enclosure construction in this region. The data from this portion of the project suggest that many burial mounds began being used as early as 400 BC but were revisited repeatedly through time to add deceased members within new construction phases. Sometimes this phenomenon took place over 400 or more years.</p> <p>These results speak to the diversity and longevity of placemaking among Native American societies in pre-Columbian North America. Connections to monuments on the landscape were often repeated through time, potentially reinforcing notions of place. Results from this project suggest local communities helped drive the rapid expansion of the Adena-Hopewell social movement and that the spread of this movement depended on the integration of diverse populations across the North American continent. In addition, this research points to the importance of understanding how local histories influence and introduce material variation into these movements as local communities adopt broadly distributed concepts and practices. The role of local histories also plays an important role in the ways communities abdicated their connections to enclosures as sites of social integration. This project shows that some communities abandoned connections to enclosures quickly after their construction and use, while others maintained strong associations to these sites long after their initial construction.</p> <p>This project was able to teach excavation strategies, geoarchaeological sampling techniques, and 3D photogrammetric archaeological documentation to undergraduate students and post-baccalaureate students interested in archaeology as a career. I am happy to report that five of the students who worked with me during my broader dissertation project have gained entry to graduate programs in archaeology; two were women. A troop of Boy Scouts also volunteered to work with me at one site, providing me an opportunity to discuss cultural preservation and conservation through professional archaeology. I have presented the results of this work at numerous academic conferences, one of which was held in Tulsa, Oklahoma and allowed me to meet with Second Chief of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe and discuss the results of this project.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/04/2018<br>      Modified by: Edward&nbsp;Henry</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1545577/1545577_10382082_1525465531268_Image4-examplesofditchfills--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1545577/1545577_10382082_1525465531268_Image4-examplesofditchfills--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1545577/1545577_10382082_1525465531268_Image4-examplesofditchfills--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Examples of different refilling scenarios for the ditches of enclosures examined during this project.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Edward R.
