<AbstractNarration>An important goal of development is establishing a rich knowledge base to support educational and professional achievement. Much of the information that people have in their knowledge base they learned through direct instruction. Yet learners also go beyond what they are taught and integrate information across media (text, video) and across multiple experiences to generate new conclusions. Self-generation of knowledge is assumed to play an important role in education, allowing learners to extend the scope of each individual lesson. In spite of its presumed significance for education, self-generation has not been examined in the classroom. This research will test self-generation in the classroom and how it relates to academic achievement. The studies will take place 1) in traditional single-language classrooms and 2) in an increasing common educational model in which children learn through two languages (dual-language instruction). When content is presented in different languages, learners must integrate not only across media and time, but across languages as well. Understanding self-generation of knowledge in single- and dual-language classrooms, and how it relates to academic achievement, are the central goals of this research. The outcome will benefit society by helping to optimize educational practice in both traditional and dual-language settings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work aims to examine integration and subsequent self-generation of information acquired in separate episodes in classroom environments. Concurrent and longitudinal individual difference measures of cognitive ability will be examined as possible underlying skills supporting knowledge extension in the classroom. Relations between knowledge generation and measures of academic performance also will be examined. Second, the study of self-generation will be extended into dual-language, an increasingly common model of education. Situations to be examined include information presented through different languages (English/Spanish) and information presented through the same language but tested in the alternate language. Finally, the work aims to address the paradox that in spite of presumed challenges to successful learning and extension of knowledge across language contexts, dual-language education has excellent academic outcomes. The expectation is that achievement of second-language proficiency minimizes the conceptual distance between to-be-integrated materials, supporting cross-language integration. Ultimately, the research will inform the underlying mechanisms necessary for self-generation of new knowledge through integration as well as how different language systems are represented and interact within an individual. The research has applied implications for educational practice in both dual-language and traditional education models.</AbstractNarration>
