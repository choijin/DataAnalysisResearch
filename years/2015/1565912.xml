<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Michael C. Heaven of Emory University and his research group investigate the unusual bonding mechanisms of beryllium. This element and its compounds exhibit unique properties.  For example, beryllium alloys are used as lightweight structural materials due to their exceptional strength to weight ratios.  The remarkable durability of the metal is reflected by the fact that it is used as a plasma facing material in fusion reactors.  The chemistry of beryllium is underexplored due to its toxicity.  To circumvent this problem, there have been many theoretical studies of beryllium and its compounds. However, beryllium poses a severe challenge for many computational techniques. The difficulties encountered are directly related to the unusual bonding characteristics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At present, the experimental data needed to evaluate quantum chemical models for beryllium are lacking.  This validation is needed to establish confidence in the computational methods used to identify compounds with valuable physical and chemical properties. Experimental studies of prototypical beryllium compounds are the primary objectives of this program.  Spectroscopic techniques, applied to gas phase molecules and ions, are used to obtain structural and thermodynamic properties.  The species examined, oxides, hydroxides and carbides, are chosen because they have been the subjects of high-level theoretical investigations. The research provides the graduate and undergraduate students, and post-doctoral associates involved with a rich experience in advanced experimental and theoretical methods. A successful collaboration with Spelman College, that provides research opportunities to students from a historically Black women's college, continues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The chemistry of beryllium is known to be significantly different from the behavior exhibited by the heavier group IIA elements.  Due to its high ionization energy and small size, the bonding of beryllium is significantly more covalent than the bonds of typical alkaline earth metals.  As a consequence, beryllium and its compounds exhibit unique properties.  For example, beryllium alloys are used as lightweight structural materials due to their exceptional strength to weight ratios.  The remarkable durability of the metal is reflected by the fact that it is used as a plasma facing material in fusion reactors.  The chemistry of beryllium is underexplored due to its toxicity. To circumvent this problem there have been many theoretical studies of beryllium and its compounds. However, beryllium poses a severe challenge for many computational techniques. The difficulties encountered are directly related to the unusual bonding characteristics.     In the NSF supported program we carried out experimental studies of a series of BeX diatomics and BeX2 triatomics by using laser excitation to eject electrons from beryllium-containing negative ions.  An imaging technique was used to analyze the kinetic energy distributions of the photo-electrons. These distributions contain information concerning the structure and bonding of both the negative ion and the neutral molecule.  One component of this program was the development of an experimental system that could be used for the safe handling of toxic metal species.     The electron binding energies and bonding characteristics of the molecules BeO, BeO2, BeS, BeS2, BeF and BeC2were examined.  To illustrate the results obtained, Fig. 1 shows an image obtained by photo-ejecting electrons from BeF-.  Each ring in this image reflects an energy state of the BeF molecule.  Analysis of these results reveals the presence of a strong bond between Be and F-, as shown in Fig. 2.  This is surprising as conventional models do not predict a bond for the interaction between these closed-shell atoms.  Data for the other species examined showed a range of different bonding mechanisms.  Computational models for the analysis and prediction of beryllium compounds were evaluated, and the level of theory needed to obtain reliable predictions was determined.
