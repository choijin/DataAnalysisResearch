<AbstractNarration>Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at his home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.  The award to Tuskegee University has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The goal of the project is to study  fundamental characteristics of jet instability and its potential alteration using an ultra-frequency micro-fluidic actuation technique called resonance enhanced microjets (REM). Instability modification, using REM, has potential applications in augmentation of air-fuel mixing in supersonic flow and control of jet noise. Undergraduate students will gain research experience in experimental fluid mechanics. A course in experimental fluid mechanics that includes topics such as digital data acquisition, random data analysis and gas dynamics will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes the design and fabrication of REM in the ultra-frequency range (above 20 kHz) and the study of their interaction and impact on shear layer dynamics of an air jet in free and cross-flow configuration. The jet properties will be studied using unsteady intrusive probes as well as non-intrusive techniques such as laser based microschlieren and planar scattering imaging. The proposed micro-actuation scheme is expected to modify inherent instabilities of a jet, exciting the most unstable modes and generating high frequency three dimensional vorticities for enhanced entrainment and diffusion. The actuators proposed here can produce high momentum pulsed disturbances up to 50 kHz generating instabilities every 20 microseconds in the cross-flow jet. Since such a time scale is very close to the mixing time of a high-speed combustor, this approach is expected to potentially enhance air-fuel mixing in supersonic flows. Fundamental studies on such a tailored jet flowfield will be useful for designing high-speed combustors with improved air-fuel mixing and flame stability.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>The key outcomes of this project are the design, development, testing and characterization of two nozzle injector systems integrated with high-frequency, resonance enhanced microactuators (called REM-nozzles) operating in a frequency range of 13-21 kHz and 2-4 kHz. Such active nozzle systems are expected to improve efficiency of mixing in high-speed combustion applications. Another major outcome is the establishment of a microscale flow diagnostic laboratory at Tuskegee University that is equipped with state-of-the art digital data acquisition and flow imaging systems. A high-speed camera and a lens based microschlieren system are used for image acquisition. This project produced a US patent (provisional patent, full application submitted and pending), one article in American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) journal, two AIAA conferences papers and a paper presented in an international conference. Twelve minority undergraduate students, including three women, were trained for data acquisition, data processing and image analysis using LabVIEW and MATLAB tools at various stages of the project. One undergraduate research assistant continued his research to master?s level and successfully defended his MS thesis. Students won several awards in the university level presentation contests. Three students received emerging research conference (ERN) travel awards from the NSF and they presented their research posters in DC. In order to support this research, an undergraduate fluid mechanics course has been re-designed integrating short, animated video lectures. </span><span><span><a
