<AbstractNarration>The activity will fund an invitation only workshop to explore fundamental issues pertaining to the computer architectures of the future. Due to the end of (Dennard) scaling and Moore's law regimes the ever increasing performance of computing machines have stalled in recent years. This may have strong negative implications not only on technological advancement but on the economy and society as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main technical bottlenecks in moving forward with new computer architectures has been the issue of power dissipation in miniaturized electronic circuits. This particular issue among other important issues will be given due importance in the discussion. Leading researchers from industry, academia and government will assemble to explore future technical directions for a solution to the problem. The results of the discussion and recommendations of the group will be made available for broader dissemination by industry, academic communities as well as funding agencies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Workshop on Computing at the Margins  Sustaining and Accelerating Scaling Through Adaptation, Resilience and Tolerance  Report Summary   Computing technology has transformed our society over the past six decades in myriad ways.  Drawing upon advances in many technical disciplines, from materials science to mathematics to psychology, computer science and engineering have revolutionized technology at all scales---ranging from the ubiquitous smart phone to supercomputer platforms for climate modeling and weather prediction. Until recently, Moore's law and Dennard circuit scaling continually reduced the cost and energy usage of computations, enabling the construction of progressively larger and more sophisticated computing platforms.  But after sixty years of rapid advancement, the computing revolution is confronting hurdles to continued scaling including fundamental physical limits due to the nanoscales at which computing substrates are fabricated and the increasing complexity of ambitious application platforms such as atmospheric modeling, media-oriented operating systems, deep space satellite probes, UAVs, and cyber-physical systems. Continued scaling of size, speed, and sophistication of computing systems hinges on achieving significant and novel breakthroughs in system design and implementation.     A promising strategy for overcoming looming resource limits is to rethink current technology design methodologies to emphasize techniques for efficient resource utilization. This may require renegotiating the relationship between the application and the computing platform. For example, we can gain orders of magnitude in power, speed, and potentially area efficiency using systems that operate at the margins of circuit stability.  The principles underlying advances in scaling the size, speed, and complexity through more efficient resource utilization are also applicable to the development of more resilient applications that cope with unforeseen dynamic alterations in available resources including energy and input data quality.  For example, the control system for a UAV might need to cope with failing sensors, battery drain, or even a hostile attack on the physical components of its hardware platform and still complete its mission albeit with somewhat compromised results.     In this invitation-only workshop, we explored and developed a vision for how future systems can function on the margin of available resources, constrained either by static limits (e.g., the power budget for a supercomputer or data center) or by dynamic deviations (e.g., battery drain or failing sensors in a UAV).  The focus was on system designs that generate acceptable or "good enough" solutions in the presence of severe resource limits.  Examples range from supercomputing applications performing numerical and computational algebra to embedded machine learning and mobile applications.  On the one hand, the goal will be to explore computing technologies that enable applications that are not possible within the confines of stable computing environments in which massive margins prevent loss of functionality with high probability. Interesting novel examples include 2-D phosphorous and graphene.  On the other hand, we recommend seeking computational solutions that vary output quality as system resources fluctuate. Several research challenges must be overcome to accomplish this two-pronged goal, ranging from novel programming and compilation mechanisms to tools for performing system adaptation and validating system correctness.     The following areas of investigation were comprehensively discussed and the complete report provided in pptx format summarizes recommended directions in each of these areas: i). mathematical foundations ii). Architecture and Hardware iii). Materials iv). Applications.     Discussion team leaders: John Augustine (algorithms), Mani Chandy (algorithms and systems), Peter Duben (applications), Sandeep Gupta (devices and circuits and materials), Krishna Palem (Chair), and Marc Snir (architecture and system software)       Steering committee (additional invitations pending): P. .Ajayan (Rice U), Arvind (MIT), Andrew Chien (U Chicago),  G.
