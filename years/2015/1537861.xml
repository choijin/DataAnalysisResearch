<AbstractNarration>The global process of subduction, which is the sinking of Earth's tectonic plates beneath other plates, is accompanied by physical and chemical processes that cause natural hazards such as earthquakes, magma generation, and volcanic eruptions. It is also the basis of the formation of many economically valuable minerals.  Understanding subduction processes in detail is of critical importance for protecting human interests, locating resources, and building a basic knowledge of the Earth.  This research focuses on understanding the initial stages of subduction, specifically the geochemical processes, that lead from incipient subduction to a self-sustaining subduction zone and volcanic arc.  Samples come from a core drilled in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana area in the western Pacific Ocean as part of a coordinated drilling expedition of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) in 2014. The expedition recovered over 1600 meters of core, preserving seafloor stratigraphy extending from the basaltic foundation of the subducting plate through overlying volcanic arc sediments.  Goals of the research are to use the geochemical composition of the basement rocks and volcanic sedimentary processes to understand subduction initiation, the causes of magma formation, and the timing and extent of volcanic arc eruptions. Broader impacts of the work include collaboration with researchers from Japan, Switzerland and the UK. In addition the lead institution is a large, public, Hispanic- and minority-serving institution, which provides the potential for engaging under-represented minority students in the sciences in the research project.  Additional impacts include support of an institution in an EPSCoR state (South Carolina) and outreach to Miami, Florida K-12 public schools.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One outcome of this project will be comprehensive geochemical analyses of volcanic rocks recovered on IODP Expedition 351, at Site 1438, which is located just west of the Kyushu-Palau Ridge, the site of Izu-Bonin Mariana (IBM) arc inception. Preliminary findings indicate that oceanic basement at ODP Site 1438 is close to the age of forearc basalts which form the base of the IBM forearc sequences.  Prior to the expedition, it was thought that magmas formed at subducting margins were "forearc basalts" of tholeiitic character, similar but not identical, to mid-ocean ridge basalts, followed by boninites.  Preliminary findings demonstrate that this initial magmatism may not have been limited to the forearc, but may instead have occurred over a broad area of the plate margin during subduction and arc initiation. This research produces whole-rock major element, trace element, and Hf-Nd isotope geochemical data for basement basalts at Site 1438, at ODP Site 1201, and at DSDP Site 447. Similar studies of clasts separated from volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks that overlie basement at Site 1438 will characterize the earliest products of arc stratovolcanoes and their compositional evolution through time.  The proposed studies will establish the full extent of geochemical similarity between forearc and basement basalts. It will also document compositional changes with time that may be recorded at Site 1438. Results of this work will likely lead to a revision of current hypotheses about magma generation during subduction initiation. The overlying volcaniclastic section of Site 1438 provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the chemical evolution of an island arc, from subduction initiation through arc growth and maturity, through the waning/cessation of arc volcanism as the result of rifting and back-arc basin formation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  In this project, we measured and  interpreted the chemical composition of basaltic lava flows and  overlying volcanic sediments from International Ocean Discovery Project  Site 1438 in the Amami Sankaku Basin, Philippine Sea.  This location was  selected for drilling by the IODP as one of two related sites to  investigate the processes that accompany the initiation of subduction  and its early stages.  We found that the lowermost basement basaltic  flows (Unit 1) were among the most compositionally depleted basalts in  the ocean basins.  This indicates that melting of the mantle during the  initial under-thrusting of one lithospheric plate beneath the other  sampled source rocks which had already partially melted in the past and  had melting reactivated by the subduction process.  The succession of  rocks found upward at the site changed from basalt flows to sediments,  some with coarse rock and mineral particles that could be analyzed.    Sediments in Unit IV, immediately overlying basalt Unit 1, contained  pyroxenes and amphiboles with arc-like trace element signatures.    Similarly, an andesitic sill or flow in the sediments of Unit IV has the  trace element signature of island arc rocks and matches those of  minerals loose in the sediment.  Rock clasts, minerals and melt  inclusions from sedimentary Units III and II also reflect an island arc  source and were  probably transported from the adjacent northern section  of the Oligocene early Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc as it grew and was  subsequently rifted.  We interpret the sill/flow in Unit IV as evidence  that subduction derived magma was formed in the same location as  chemically distinct ocean floor basalt magma within a few million years  after subduction was initiated.  This rapid transition of mantle source  compositions tells us that upper plate magmatism at the newly formed  plate margin ranged from oceanic to arc-like in character.  That the  main Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc (Units III and II) formed to the east of Site  1438, closer to the juncture of the subducting plates marked by the  deep-sea trench, indicates that the early magmatism was spread over a  broad swath of the upper plate.  Some of the earliest, pre-arc magmatic  products, like Unit 1 of Site 1438, are now in what would be considered the back arc of the  Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc (Figure 1).  This finding is important for the recognition  and understanding of subduction initiation sequences in the ancient  geologic record.   Broader Impacts:  Subduction, the sinking of one of Earth's lithospheric plates beneath  another, gives rise to the majority of  Earth's explosive volcanic  activity, high magnitude earthquakes and many economically important  minerals.  Understanding this process from its initiation to its  termination is valuable both for mitigating the associated hazards and  for locating mineral resources.  The results of this project contribute  to an improved understanding of subduction.    This project  supported the research of a senior female PI, two female doctoral  students and one female undergraduate student from a group under-represented in STEM fields.  The  undergraduate is now enrolled in a graduate degree program majoring in  mineral science. One doctoral student is finishing her dissertation on  the topic of this  project, and the other was trained in chemical  analytical techniques and assisted with analyses during the project.   Our work utilized and supported three laboratories: the Florida Center  for Analytical Electron Microscopy and the Trace Evidence Analysis  Facility at FIU, and the Mass Spectrometry laboratory at the University  of South Carolina.
