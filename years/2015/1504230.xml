<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is enough water in the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) that, were it to melt, it would raise sea level in most coastal cities significantly with huge consequences for society. In the face of accelerated ice sheet contribution to sea level rise, it remains uncertain how the GrIS will adjust to a warming Arctic, declining sea ice and related changing precipitation patterns. This is a concern, given that future sea level rise is strongly dependent on the GrIS response to arctic change. The scientific community is currently undecided between a model of a dynamic GrIS that becomes greatly reduced during warm periods and a model where it is relatively stable, even through periods warmer than today. This proposal addresses the idea that increased arctic precipitation offsets GrIS mass loss during times of elevated temperature. The researchers will test this by contributing significant new information on arctic system change and related GrIS dynamics during past and ongoing warm periods, and employing an ice sheet modeling effort synthesizing all new data aimed at both past and future GrIS simulations. The researchers explicitly combine multiple scientific disciplines to provide a better understanding of how key arctic system components such as precipitation, temperature, sea-ice cover and GrIS mass balance are interconnected. The results will be of fundamental relevance to the fates of the arctic system, the GrIS and global sea level rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will train six graduate students and one post-doctoral researcher. The cross-cutting research program is paralleled by the scope of the outreach plan, to develop a variety of deliverables, including development of an iBook and public outreach events. In addition the team will participate in public outreach events in Buffalo and New York City,  where the public and scientists interact in a casual setting. Finally, this work has synergies with ongoing missions at NASA and other programs within the NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to recent advances in numerical ice sheet models and new sub-ice topography of Greenland, combined with finely-tuned field approaches and geochronologic techniques, the time is ripe for a coordinated, cross-disciplinary effort focusing on cryosphere variability in a warming Arctic; the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and sea ice constitute the largest, and most critical components of the arctic cryosphere. The hypothesis that increased arctic precipitation can counterbalance GrIS mass loss during times of elevated temperatures stems from recent findings suggesting that it may be more stable than expected during interglacials. The researchers will: generate new GrIS margin reconstructions during and since the mid-Holocene Thermal Maximum (9,000 to 5,000 years ago), with a powerful approach that combines lake sediment stratigraphy with new sub-ice topography and novel high-sensitivity cosmogenic isotope methods; develop new Holocene climate reconstructions of moisture, temperature and sea ice conditions from lake and ocean sediments and an advanced synthesis of existing arctic ice core and other paleoclimate data; and employ state-of-the-art numerical ice sheet modeling fueled by ice margin and climate reconstructions to test a range of climatic and dynamic controls on GrIS change. If the idea is supported, then it would suggest a relatively stable GrIS during warm periods. If, however, this project provides evidence that the GrIS retreated considerably during the warmer-than-present mid-Holocene and in turn, that the GrIS has reacted more sensitively to temperature than to precipitation change, the results would support a tightly coupled ice sheet size-temperature link and in turn, a much greater near-term GrIS contribution to sea level rise. Either result will be of fundamental relevance to the fates of the arctic system, the GrIS and global sea level rise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is expected to the dominant contributor to global sea-level rise throughout the remainder of the 21st century.  Currently, our knowledge of GrIS change is mainly relegated to the satellite observational era (1980’s onward), therefore limiting our understanding of how anomalous current GrIS mass loss is.  By studying the GrIS over the geologic past (i.e. millennia), we are better equipped to understand just how anomalous our current and projected future changes may be.  Our research set out to provide a longer-term perspective of GrIS change by developing and improving upon constraints of ice margin change over the last 12,000 years across SW Greenland and through development of ice sheet model simulations that allow us to constrain rates of past ice sheet change.  We simulated the retreat of the SW portion of the GrIS over the last 12,000 years using NASA’s Ice Sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM).  This ice sheet model is able to simulate the GrIS ice flow as it responds to changes in past climate.   Our ice sheet modeling simulations required information about climate to estimate how much snow and ice accumulated and melted through time.  State-of-the-science reconstructions of past climate, produced as part of this project, were therefore used to drive the ice model simulations over the last 12,000 years.   Our ice sheet modeling results were then directly compared against geologic reconstructions of past ice margin change, providing an opportunity to assess the fidelity of our modeled results.  Our ice model simulations also extended out to the year 2100 forced by projections of future climate, allowing for a long-term assessment of SW Greenland change for the past and into the future.  Our results show that over the Holocene (last 12,000 years) the GrIS underwent periods of high ice mass loss during the past warm time interval known as the Holocene Thermal Maximum.  This mass loss rate is comparable with the what we have experienced in Greenland over the last few decades, with current mass loss rates residing just at the fringe of maximum ice loss we have experienced over the last 12,000 years.   Strikingly, however, our results also suggest that future mass loss from the GrIS will far exceed the mass loss rates that we experienced during the Holocene.  This result, for the first time, provides a much longer-term perspective on just how anomalous the changes across the GrIS are and will be going forward through the remainder of the 21st century.  Because the ice modeling results are validated against geologic records of past ice margin change, we are confident that our estimation of past ice mass change is accurate.  In total, these results suggest that without changes in our consumption of fossil fuels which drive global warming, the GrIS will experience unprecedented changes when compared to at least the past 12,000 years.  Beyond the scientific achievements of this work, our results have been shared for educational usage on NASA’s Virtual Earth System Laboratory (VESL), where users can visualize these ice sheet simulations and see how the SW portion of the GrIS changed over the last 12,000 years.
