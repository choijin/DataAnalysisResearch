<AbstractNarration>This research project will expand the computational, statistical, and methodological aspects of Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT) to handle a variety of new situations.  Knowledge, preferences, and beliefs shared by a group of individuals can provide valuable information to interested parties in a variety of settings.  Examples include eyewitness reports of a traumatic event, intelligence reports about the relationships between members of a covert network, grades assigned to student essays by a group of teachers, and shared folk medical beliefs in a particular cultural group.  Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT) is a formal, statistical way to analyze responses to questions regarding shared knowledge, to determine if there is evidence for an underlying consensus, and if so, to pool the responses to uncover the shared knowledge within the group.  This project will expand CCT to cover examples such as the ones above where there is no available ground truth to determine the answers to the questions that reflect the group consensus apart from the individuals' responses.  Estimating consensus knowledge is crucial for science and for addressing important national problems.  For example, properly pooled reports from eyewitnesses can assist in police investigations.  Proper pooling of intelligence information about a covert network can assist in discovering its nature.  Developing better ways to pool the responses of graders can improve the assessment of student ability, and uncovering shared medical beliefs can lead to public health policy that brings beliefs and scientific medical knowledge into proper alignment.  Freely available software will be developed for the new models along with user guides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will increase of the scope of CCT by developing new response models, discovering their properties, and augmenting their statistical inference.  CCT models will be developed for a number of different cases: paired-comparisons (where individuals indicate their preferences among pairs of options); networks (where individuals indicate which nodes in the network are connected); and similarity, distance, and triad questionnaires (where, for example, individuals indicate how close or how similar two items are in semantic memory).  The new models will be evaluated with statistically generated data and real experimental data.</AbstractNarration>

It first appeared in the 1980s as a statistical tool for ethnographic studies in anthropology, and since then it has been greatly expanded for use in many other situations in the social, behavioral, and cognitive sciences. CCT consists of formal cognitive models for different questionnaire designs, for example, true/false, ordered category, or continuous. The data format consists of the responses of group members to each of a series of questionnaire items. CCT models specify the consensus truth for the items as latent parameters, along with other parameters for respondent knowledge level, response bias, and item difficulty. Mixture CCT models have been developed where there may be several subgroups, each with its own set of consensus truths. Bayesian hierarchical inference has been developed for all of the CCT models, and the inference determines if there is evidence for one or more consensus truths in the response data, and if so, it estimates them as well as the other parameters of the model. Batchedlder and colleagues introduce a set of models designed to analyze datasets involving responses from multiple subjects on pairwise comparisons from a fixed discrete set of alternatives.  Like  other  CCT  models,  these  simultaneously  infer  each  individual's  tendency toward aligning with the group consensus,  level of agreement on each item, and also a latent consensus value of each alternative.  Two primary models were developed,  referred to as the Strong and Weak Consensus Paired-Comparison Models (SCPCM  and  WCPCM  respectively).   The  SCPCM  works  under  the  assumption that all individuals are answering in accordance to the latent consensus values but with varying degrees of accuracy,  while the WCPCM relaxes this assumption and assumes minor deviations from latent consensus values in people's average valuation of  alternatives.   The  WCPCM  also  includes  inferences  on  participants'  individual tendencies  toward  self-consistency  (related  to  their  tendencies  toward  committing violations of transitivity) as well as inferences on the tendency of each item to be evaluated consistently by individuals.  The Case III Thurstonian model is used as the backbone for both CPCMs, and inference is conducted under a hierarchical Bayesian framework.  Model checks along with applications to both simulated and real data are performed.</span></span></p> <!--   p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115% } --><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/22/2020<br>      Modified by: Ramesh&nbsp;Srinivasan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
