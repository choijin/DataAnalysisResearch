<AbstractNarration>This award supports the Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics (NCUWM) to be held annually for three years beginning in the winter of 2016 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  The conference brings together women undergraduate math majors from all over the United States for the purposes of encouraging them to go to graduate school in mathematics or a related field and increasing the success of those who do. NCUWM pursues these goals through a variety of activities.  Two plenary talks by prominent female mathematicians show that women have made, and are continuing to make, exceptional research contributions.  Also featured are 48 talks and a larger number of posters by undergraduate women about their own research; these presentations provide valuable experience for the women who give them and serve to motivate the less experienced women to find opportunities to do research projects.  Panel discussions demonstrate how mathematics offers natural and rewarding career choices for women and provide the undergraduate participants with insider knowledge and personal experiences that help them choose a graduate school and be successful.  There are also a variety of networking activities that help participants connect with peers and mentors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NCUWM plays an important role in inspiring young women to pursue mathematics. In addition to anecdotal evidence from former NCUWM attendees who earned PhDs in mathematics, an assessment report prepared after the 2015 conference concluded that NCUWM strongly influences the attitudes and beliefs of the undergraduate participants about pursuing graduate-level mathematics and mathematics related careers and that the conference significantly contributes to the professional growth of participants at all career levels.  Plenary and invited speakers at the 2016 conference include mathematicians Emina Soljanin, Bell Laboratories; Abigail Thompson, University of California Davis; Alejandra Alvarado, Eastern Illinois University; Lorena Bociu, North Carolina State University; Johanna Franklin, Hofstra University; Emilie Hogan, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; and Cristina Polizu, Standard and Poors.</AbstractNarration>
