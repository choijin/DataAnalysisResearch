<AbstractNarration>The project will provide travel support for US participants in a workshop ``Topological methods in singularity theory'' (http://www.icms.org.uk/workshops/topological) which will take place at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, U.K., from 20--24 July 2015. Its purpose is to bring together specialists in singularity theory and topology from around the world, to have them present new developments and perspectives in singularity theory and new applications of topology to singularity theory, and to introduce these new directions to young researchers. Singularity theory studies mathematical phenomena associated with degenerations of generic objects into special ones and which results in radical changes of the objects. The study of such ``catastrophes" concerns a wide range of areas, ranging through economics, biology, chemistry, vision and medial imaging, control theory, to engineering and theoretical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Singularity theory and topology work with each other, and the collaboration has led to many rich connections with various fields such as mathematical physics, symplectic and contact topology, surgery theory. Recently, many new connections have appeared. For example, low dimensional topology and new homology theories have brought new invariants to singularity theory, there are new applications of surgery theory techniques, and applications of metric geometry also form a very fruitful new direction. The workshop will concentrate on five particular particular areas among which there have already been strong interactions: 1. Singularities, homology theories and related invariants, 2.  Bilipschitz geometry of singular spaces, 3. Intersection homology, 4. Morse 2-functions, 5. Surgery theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The project was an international workshop "Topological methods in singularity theory" at the ICMS in Edinburgh July 20--24 2015, organized by Maciej Borodzik (Warsaw),  Walter Neumann (Columbia), Anne Pichon (Marseilles), Andrew Ranicki (Edinburgh). The NSF contribution consisted of travel support for the US participants. The purpose was to bring together specialists from around the world in the two fields of singularity theory and topology to have them present new developments which support and extend the influence of topological methods in singularity theory, opening new perspectives in singularity theory and new applications of topology to singularity theory, and to introduce these new directions to young researchers. Singularity theory studies mathematical phenomena associated with degenerations of generic objects into special ones and which results in radical changes of the objects. The study of such ``catastrophes" concerns a wide range of areas, ranging through economics, biology, chemistry, vision and medical imaging, control theory, to engineering and theoretical physics. Singularity theory and topology work with each other, and the collaboration has led to many rich connections with various fields such as mathematical physics, symplectic and contact topology, surgery theory. The workshop concentrated in particular on five important areas, among which there had already been strong interactions and which have led to new interactions since. The success of the workshop exceeded the expectations of the organizers. There were many excellent talks, where experts were presenting new developments in their fields. The workshop was a place for disseminating new ideas and building new perspectives in singularity theory and low-dimensional topology, as well as in theories that bridge the two. It is difficult to distinguish a single talk out of many great lectures, but the participants particularly highlighted talks of Sebastian Baader, Jim Davis, David Gay, Eugene Gorsky, Rob Kirby, Ursula Ludwig, Jake Rasmussen and Dirk Siersma.   Bringing together world-class experts from different fields resulted in new interactions of singularity and topology. More concretely, the participants specified Heegaard--Floer homology of L-space links, symplectic and contact geometry of surface singularities, trisections of 4 manifolds, and new invariants of homology spheres. All of these, and many more ideas that arose during the workshop, are continuing to bearing fruit.   Another important aspect of the workshop was the presence of young and very young participants, for whom it might have been the first occasion to meet experts in their field. During almost each coffee break these young participants were gathering around seasoned veterans such as Lev Birbrair, David Gay, Robion Kirby, Laurentiu Maxim and others, in order to get new ideas. Such meetings are very fruitful and will contribute in bringing to the math world the new generations of gifted mathematicians.
