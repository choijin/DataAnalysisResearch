<AbstractNarration>Seismometers are sensitive to tiny ground motions generated by distant earthquakes and other phenomena. As has long been known, in the absence of earthquakes, these instruments also record a background 'hum', a low level seismic signal originating in the earth that has energy cycling every 6-300 seconds. Broad waves called "infragravity waves" moving through the ocean are the source of most of the 'hum', imparting cyclic pressure on the seafloor as they travel through the seawater. This general relation between ocean 'forcing' on the seafloor and Earth's seismic 'hum' is understood, but how much is generated along the shallow margins of the ocean versus within the deep ocean basins, and why? This project investigates the relationship between the source region(s) of the 'hum' and the passage of major storms. It explores whether the shape of the coastal slopes influences how much hum energy is produced. In order to accomplish the work, seismometers both on the seafloor and on the continent will be used to combine information from the signals detected across the array of instruments, and point toward the location where the seafloor forcing occurred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a collaboration between seismologists and oceanographers, the spatial variability of infragravity wave (IG) energy levels, the influence of ocean storms on that pattern, and the generation of microseisms and Earth's long period "hum" will all be documented.  Broadband seismic and pressure spectra from the Cascadia amphibious array will be analyzed. Numerical models will be employed to explore the range of possible wave behaviors across the continental shelf. The coupling between wind-driven ocean waves, IG waves and the seafloor will be studied in a near-coastal region of the Pacific Northwest.  The results of this study will contribute to the characterization of IG noise levels on the ocean floor, link this variability to the near shore IG wave climate, and provide guidance for future off-shore deployments of seismic and pressure arrays. Improved understanding of the sources of Earth?s hum may help design approaches to using long period seismic noise data for the study of deep earth structure. The west coast of North America is uniquely suited for this purpose as it is has been documented as a strong source region for the "hum". A graduate student will play a significant role in this cross-disciplinary research, obtaining experience in array processing techniques such as stacking, beamforming, and back projection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The recently deployed Cascadia amphibious array (CAA), with its ocean bottom broadband seismometers and pressure gauges, together with land-based and other ocean floor broadband seismic  data, provides a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the spatio-temporal attributes of infragravity waves (IG) on the continental shelf, as well as that of the coupling between wind-driven ocean waves, infragravity waves and the seafloor, in a near-coastal region which has previously been identified as a strong source region for both microseisms and the earth's seismic low frequency "hum".  Our contribution to this multi-disciplinary Collaborative Research effort led by Dr. Barbara Romanowicz of UC Berkeley, is focused on the oceanographic aspects.  In particular, we compared the spatial variability in infragravity wave energy levels observed with the CAA array to model predictions of IG wave generation and propagation, in order to quantitatively test the long-standing hypothesis linking near-shore and deep ocean IG motions (Webb et al., JGR, 1991), and obtain a better understanding of the processes that control IG wave radiation from the surrounding coastlines.   Our research shows that observations of IG seafloor pressure variations on the continental shelf and offshore of the shelf break are highly correlated, even though energy levels differ by two orders of magnitude. The dramatic attenuation across the shelf break is well explained by a geometrical optics (WKB) model that assumes the inner shelf acts as an isotropic and homogeneous radiator of IG motions. These results corroborate the near-shore origin of IG energy along the U.S. West Coast and demonstrate that the shelf/shelf break system connecting the source region to the ocean, essentially acts as a waveguide trapping most IG energy on the shelf. The propagation dynamics of IG waves over the shelf break thus mimics what is observed near the coast (Herbers et al., JPO, 1995), in that the IG energy is predominately contained in trapped modes, with only a small fraction in leaky modes, explaining the dramatic attenuation of IG wave energy across the shelf break. Further, even though local refraction patterns can be complex, these effects are effectively smoothed out in the seaward propagation of an isotropic and homogeneous inner-shelf IG source, so that estimates of IG wave radiation into ocean basins can be directly obtained from simple scaling relations that do not depend on the details of the shelf geometry.  The link between near-shore and deep ocean IG wave properties established in our analysis has potentially important implications for studies of beach erosion which is believed to be largely driven by energetic IG waves in severe storms.  In situ observations of near-shore processes and beach erosion are difficult to obtain in extreme storm conditions, and are generally not available along many coastlines, especially in the remote Arctic and Antarctic regions where such information is of crucial importance to climate change studies.  Observing deep ocean IG levels has the potential for remotely monitoring beach processes on these inaccessible coastlines.  Furthermore, since these remote measurements effectively integrate the IG wave radiation along stretches of coastline, as opposed to a local in-situ measurement on a beach, they can provide useful information for the aggregate global changes in beach erosion.
