<AbstractNarration>The project will examine how the adoption of randomized controlled field experiments became the "gold standard" of evidence and policy. It will address how they came to shift power relations among the donors, development economists, local ministries, and intended beneficiaries-turned-research participants.  This project will study how field experiments came to be used to assess international economic development interventions. The project?s findings will help policy-makers to understand the kinds of technologies of evaluation that they fund and how these measure the outcomes of international economic development policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will extend existing scholarship on the practices and politics of scientific knowledge by studying the middle ground between the laboratory and field sciences where randomized controlled field experiments impact evaluation to produce evidence for "what works" in foreign aid. Through archival, interview-based and ethnographic research, this project traces the history of the controlled field experiments to analyze when and why social scientists and development practitioners use them, how they construct viable experimental spaces and subjects, and the implications for foreign aid and its intended beneficiaries. This research will consider how foreign technical assistance acts on scientific knowledge; and the political and logistical struggle of creating credibility for their continued use. The project will contribute to increased public scientific literacy and engagement with social science, understanding between academia and policy makers, and improved training of graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the last two decades, foreign aid donors, multilateral development institutions and development economists have enthusiastically adopted randomized controlled field experiments as the "gold standard" of development policy impact evaluation. The method?s advocates claim such studies will do for international development what randomized clinical trials have done for medicine, namely produce credible evidence for "what works" in foreign aid. Critics have challenged these claims on epistemic, programmatic, and ethical grounds, but have been unable to slow down the proliferation of now over 800 field trials in over 50, mostly low-income countries.  The major goals of the projects were to 1) investigate the history of experimentation in the social sciences in the context of foreign technical aid; 2) conduct an ethnography of ongoing randomized controlled field experiments in Kenya to understand their ethical dimensions; 3) analyze the implications of this method for international development practice; 4) to disseminate the findings to researchers and policy makers.  In order to address the major goals, the co-PI spent 9 months in Kenya interviewing researchers conducting randomized controlled field experiments, members of organizations participating in them, and research participants. The co-PI interviewed 30 researchers, members from three organizations participating in field experiments, and 10 research participants. The co-PI also observed project meetings and training sessions about specific field experiments. To complement the fieldwork, the co-PI spent three months in the Rockefeller Archives investigating the history of social experiments in the context of US technical aid.
