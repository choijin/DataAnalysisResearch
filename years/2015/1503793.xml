<AbstractNarration>This project will support the development of a national program of undergraduate STEM education through hands-on access to a world-class astronomical instrument. The program will expose students to a broad range of core science and engineering topics and techniques by means of direct participation in real-world research. The potency of curiosity-driven learning will be exploited to educate and motivate both future researchers and students destined for careers in industries that depend on core STEM competencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project funds a 2-year pilot study to implement student research projects at the 37-meter radio telescope of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Haystack Observatory. During this pilot, a cost-effective remote observing capability for the antenna will be developed and tested, opening up access to the telescope to a diverse body of students from institutes of higher learning. Participation in this program will expose students and instructors to current problems in astronomy and astrophysics and allow the establishment of linkages between basic physics, mathematics, and engineering concepts and their application to solving real-world problems. Tutorials, instructional materials, and data reduction tools will be developed and improved with feedback from students and participating instructors. The student research carried out under this program will produce scientific data capable of advancing diverse areas of astrophysics, including astrochemistry, star formation, and stellar evolution. Examples of specific project topics include hydrogen recombination line spectra and astronomical masers. This program will provide an avenue to carry out original research to a wide range of students, including those at two-year colleges and non-research universities who do not presently have access to such opportunities. It will also provide an innovative means for college and university instructors to incorporate discovery-based research into STEM curricula. Educators of underrepresented groups have been recruited to participate, starting with the development and testing stages. Development work carried out under this project will provide opportunities for STEM students in the Research Experience for Undergraduates program.</AbstractNarration>

Furthermore, the Air Force does not provide any direct funding   or support for astronomy operations. Consequently, it was necessary to   undertake significant development work to restore routine astronomy operations and accommodate student observing.</p> <p>To keep the  project within a modest budget, the project team  repurposed  components from  the pre-upgrade  antenna whenever possible,  although to  improve  functionality and  reliability, several  components of the  astronomy  system were overhauled or replaced. Development activities included:</p> <ul> <li>Updates  to the antenna control interface</li> <li>Installation of a new spectrometer</li> <li>Commissioning of a new 3 mm radiometer</li> <li>Redeployment and testing of the 7 mm and 1.3 cm radiometers</li> <li>Characterize gain and pointing of the antenna.</li> <li>Installation of a weather station</li> <li>Creation of a database to record monitor/control and weather information.</li> <li>Installation of a fiber link for signal transport.</li> <li>Replacement of miscellaneous filters, power supplies, and cables.</li> </ul> <p>Despite  these efforts, the project suffered a series of significant   setbacks  owing to a combination of equipment failures, persistent   equipment  reliability issues, and loss of crucial project personnel.  Consequently, a decision was made during Year 3 to shift the program to  the Westford 18m geodetic  antenna.</p> <p>The manner in  which the  Westford antenna is operated and controlled  is different in  several  ways from the Haystack antenna.

Development activities included:  Updates  to the antenna control interface Installation of a new spectrometer Commissioning of a new 3 mm radiometer Redeployment and testing of the 7 mm and 1.3 cm radiometers Characterize gain and pointing of the antenna. Installation of a weather station Creation of a database to record monitor/control and weather information. Installation of a fiber link for signal transport. Replacement of miscellaneous filters, power supplies, and cables.   Despite  these efforts, the project suffered a series of significant   setbacks  owing to a combination of equipment failures, persistent   equipment  reliability issues, and loss of crucial project personnel.  Consequently, a decision was made during Year 3 to shift the program to  the Westford 18m geodetic  antenna.  The manner in  which the  Westford antenna is operated and controlled  is different in  several  ways from the Haystack antenna. This  necessitated the  development  of new approaches and modifications to  existing hardware and software. Examples  included:  Hardware modifications to allow integration of the GPU spectrometer at Westford. Development of a new approach to metadata collection. Adaption to calibration using a noise diode. Installation of a switch to disable the injection of pulse calibration signals. Development  of  software to convert raw data to a   standard  format and join with its associated metadata  (e.g., time of  observation, antenna pointing coordinates, etc.). Development of quicklook tools for real-time plotting and examination of data during observing.   INTELLECTUAL MERIT  This project resulted in a new astronomical observing capability on the  Westford Radio Telescope.

It is anticipated  that  modified versions of the hardware and software developed for the  Westford antenna will be ported to the Haystack 37m  antenna in the  future to enable similar capabilities on that antenna.  In  addition to serving as a platform for carrying out original  research by undergraduates, the new astronomy backend on the Westford  antenna is expected to be useful for radio  frequency interference  monitoring and characterization---a rapidly  growing challenge in radio  astronomy.  The GPU spectrometer and  its associated software that  were developed here could provide a capable, low-cost  spectrometer  option for other observatories.  The quality of the data from this spectrometer has demonstrated the promise of the Haystack facilities for enabling engaging and original research projects by undergraduates.  BROADER IMPACTS  Undergraduates from several institutions were involved in aspects of    this project from its inception, providing hands-on learning and    training opportunities. Examples include:  A Cornell University student designed and tested a new GUI-based observing interface.    Two undergraduates from Morehead State  University were involved in   characterization of the Haystack telescope frequency  standard.   A student from the University of Minnesota-Morris designed a  python-based tool to aid in observational planning.   A Union College spent a week at Haystack  to receive hands-on  training with the Westford antenna (including  performing calibration  measurements, planning observations, and data analysis).   Three  educational modules were developed. These will  be made  publicly available and are intended to introduce faculty and students to  radio astronomy and the capability of Haystack's telescopes.  During  the course of the award, the Principal  Investigator gave numerous  tours of the Haystack 37m antenna to visiting  students and other groups  (including astronomy clubs, veterans groups,  and senior citizens).   Co-investigators also gave lectures on radio astronomy to visiting  students.  The awardees worked with an education professional to  develop a survey to evaluate the learning and experiences of future  student users of the Westford and 37m telescopes.
