<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 14-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world?s major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in this Collaborative Research Action, the partner agencies have provided support for research projects that utilize existing Arctic observing systems, datasets and models to evaluate key sustainability challenges and opportunities in the Arctic region, to innovate new sustainability science theory and approaches to these challenges and opportunities, and support decision-making towards a sustainable Arctic environment.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and end users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The eastern Siberian ecosystem is established on the largest and deepest permafrost region in the world, where much of the earth?s carbon dioxide is sequestrated. This unique permafrost-based ecosystem is currently threatened by global warming. In addition to the direct effects of this warming, permafrost degradation may cause further change in vegetation and carbon budget and greenhouse gas emission that may then feedback to the climate system.  In this vulnerable region, considerable economic and demographic change is taking place as populations within the cities of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) expand and increase their carbon emissions, while smaller settlements decline and struggle to afford heating fuel due to rising costs associated with the urban demands for energy.  The environmental impacts of population and emission growth in this environmentally vulnerable region and the need for viable low carbon energy solutions for Arctic residents drive the COPERA project.  The collaborative research team from the US, Russia, and Japan will establish a permafrost, hydrological, and meteorological observing network in cooperation with local communities to estimate CO2 sequestration by the permafrost ecosystem (tundra and taiga) and CO2 emission form cities and villages. In this study, the carbon budget (CO2 sequestration by ecosystem and CO2 emission through human activity) is estimated as a measure of two different points of view. One is a measure of impact on climate and environment, and the other is that of living cost because more fuel combustion means higher cost for energy. Both of these measures have impacts well beyond the local effects in the Sakha region. Data gathered during this project will be translated into publicly accessible materials and shared with local residents and government to inform municipal, regional, or Republic governmental committees and/or council meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>C budget of ecosystems and cities and villages on permafrost in eastern Russian Arctic (COPERA) project was part of Belmont Forum CRA ?Arctic Observing and Research for Sustainability? program that worked by Russia, Japan and US scientists and economist. For US contributions of this program was for understanding of the permafrost thermal state and involved education and local community outreach. Permafrost is defined as Erath materials that remain below 0?C (32?F) for two or more years. Permafrost forms when the ground cools enough in winter to produce a frozen layer that remains frozen throughout the following summer. The active layer (the soil near ground surface that thaws each summer) and the thickness of permafrost depend on local climatic conditions, vegetation cover, soil type and moisture content, and any effects from the heat at the Earth?s core. The Permafrost/Active Layer Monitoring network was developed entire Sakha Republic, Russia, which builds on work begun in 2005 to establish long-term permafrost and active layer monitoring sites adjacent to schools in Alaskan communities and in the circumpolar permafrost region. There were about 550 schools in the Arctic involved in the project. The project had both scientific and education outreach components. The monitoring sites collected temperature data on permafrost, and the seasonal length and depth of the active layer. Students and teachers in the local schools participate in the program by reading measurements at the monitoring sites, recording data, comparing data on-line with other schools, and discussing what they learn. Classroom lessons on permafrost have been developed for students at all grade levels. The lessons, combined with activities at the measuring sites, offer students hands-on scientific experience and an opportunity to see the connection between science and research. Cellar (underground food storage) is one of the smartest ideas of northern natives. Mainly whaling communities have one or several cellars in the villages.&nbsp; The meat stores well in the traditional natural freezer using permafrost, however, cellar temperature depend on permafrost temperature and climate. Thus, we monitored cellar/permafrost temperature in the villages. Most cellars are located 3m-6m below ground surface. That is still temperature season fluctuation zone, which usually -3 ?C to -40?C at cellars in northern Siberia and not freezing in southern Siberia. Climatic change has been suspected of compromising and causing damage to cellars in possibly northern communities, with thaw and spoilage of meat may occur in these case. Investigation of temperature regimes in these cellars is critically important for the continued well-being of local communities.&nbsp; Long-term monitoring may also yield useful climatic and permafrost information. This study shows temperature regime of the cellars were quite difference north of Yakutsk and south. Primary usages of the cellars of Northern communities are storage of fish or other meat. However, southern communities (around Lake Baikal) are temporary usage between November to May. The way of native subsistence life and permafrost temperature regime fit reasonably in these area. These temperature data was use local school for class or independent student projects such as science fair. The data gathered from these stations are shared with other schools and made available to the public through our web site (https://issuu.com/permafrostbook/docs/permafrost_25-02-21t). Through this project, students in remote communities learn more about science in a way that is meaningful to their daily lives. In addition, they experience research participation within a larger scientific community, expanding their worldview. This project involves more than 40,000 students and 700 teachers across Arctic.</p> <p>The intellectual merit of this program is that it will advance knowledge of our climatic system and the thermal state of permafrost as a complex process that is spatially and temporally quite variable. This is first time to have highest spatial resolution data set obtained Siberia and other Arctic region. The arctic climatic system has an important influence on global climate. Monitoring the thermal state of permafrost by measuring borehole temperatures is one of the methods that can be used to understand climatic trends. The degradation of permafrost is triggered by the length of the active layer freezing period; that is, seasonal lengths are an important factor. Implicit in many of climatic change reports is the desire to develop a sustainable scientific infrastructure to address needs, among which is the establishment and maintenance of long-term observational networks. The Permafrost/Active Layer Monitoring network provides opportunities for field experience and educational participation at levels ranging from elementary school to high school. It will help to provide high-resolution spatial distribution of the thermal state of permafrost, and will improve the general knowledge of Earth?s climatic pattern. It also offers an opportunity for students to take part in understanding climatic systems. This project highlights the interaction between permafrost, the active layer, hydrology, and the arctic climate system, and provides a strong educational outreach program involving remote communities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/27/2021<br>      Modified by: Kenji&nbsp;Yoshikawa</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1534766/1534766_10402108_1627405791774_map7--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1534766/1534766_10402108_1627405791774_map7--rgov-800width.jpg" title="monitoring sites"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1534766/1534766_10402108_1627405791774_map7--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="monitoring sites"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">red dots indicated school yard monitoring sites that established part of this project</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kenji Yoshikawa</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kenji&nbsp;Yoshikawa</div> <div class="imageTitle">monitoring sites</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1534766/1534766_10402108_1627405918990_chukotka2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1534766/1534766_10402108_1627405918990_chukotka2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="for example of the public data book"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1534766/1534766_10402108_1627405918990_chukotka2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="for example of the public data book"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is example page of the permafrost monitoring report book for schools and local governments</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kenji Yoshikawa</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kenji&nbsp;Yoshikawa</div> <div class="imageTitle">for example of the public data book</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1534766/1534766_10402108_1627406587642_temp--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1534766/1534766_10402108_1627406587642_temp--rgov-800width.jpg" title="permafrost temperature"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1534766/1534766_10402108_1627406587642_temp--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="permafrost temperature"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">red: thawedorange: 0 to -1dCgreen: -1 to -2 dClight blue: -2 to -3 dCdark blue: -3dC or colder</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kenji Yoshikawa</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kenji&nbsp;Yoshikawa</div> <div class="imageTitle">permafrost temperature</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
