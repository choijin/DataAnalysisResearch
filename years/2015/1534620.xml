<AbstractNarration>The Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) will plan and host an intensive workshop to design an instrument for universities to be able to collect and disaggregate information on the career pathways of STEM PhD students and alumni. The project includes two preparatory meetings with key stakeholders (one focused on disciplinary societies and the other focused on graduate deans and provosts), and a workshop where participants will develop a survey instrument and a framework document to guide universities in the administration of the survey. The workshop will help advance the knowledge by (1) providing the basis for universities to better assess the impact of their curricula and professional development offerings and (2) capturing the scope of the intellectual, economic, and social contributions of STEM doctorate holders.  The workshop also will synthesize the results of a gap analysis that was conducted during an earlier feasibility study. Instrument and survey results will be disseminated to the 500 CGS member institutions and the broader higher education community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data collection instrument will include variables using the CGS gap analysis of existing career pathways data collection efforts and items needed to inform improvements in doctoral programs such as (1) program of study, institution, graduation date; (2) professional development opportunities and their value; (3) motivations and determinants for exploring various career paths; and (4) employment status, employment sector, and relationship between employment and doctoral training.  The variables might correspond with those in existing datasets such as the Survey of Earned Doctorates and Survey of Doctoral Recipients for purposes of national comparisons.  A framework document will inform the scope of the effort and outline guidelines to support the consistent implementation of the PhD career pathways data collection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Much is already known about the first jobs of recent science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) PhD graduates, thanks in large part to the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and a host of university-led exit interviews. Yet much less is known about the long-term career pathways of PhD holders beyond that initial placement. The lack of information about PhD career pathways presents a challenge to graduate deans and program directors, who could use such information to better prepare PhD graduates and alumni for the demands of the 21st century.     In July 2015, the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) was awarded a National Science Foundation grant (#1534620) to host an intensive workshop intended to address this gap in knowledge about STEM careers. CGS convened an advisory committee of graduate deans, consultants, and other experts on PhD career pathways, and this group worked together to develop and refine a set of instruments designed to collect information on the career pathways of STEM PhD students and alumni. The workshop was one component of CGS?s larger project, Understanding PhD Career Pathways, made possible with additional funding from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the Alfred P.

Collectively, these activities resulted in the development of a PhD Career Pathways Student Survey, a PhD Career Pathways Alumni Survey, and an accompanying Implementation Guide. Some highlights from the workshop include:     There is broad-based interest in surveying currently-enrolled PhD students and PhD graduates at various points in their career, and universities are highly interested in having these data for benchmarking purposes. All universities administer the NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates, and all administer a common exit survey to all graduating PhDs. For those who currently have surveys of their own, there is a great deal of overlap in the CGS questions and they want the ability to pick which CGS questions to add. All universities would be able to link to existing student information systems for demographic information on respondents. In fact, no significant additional technology resources would be required to do this, although integration of existing technologies would lower staff costs and report cycle-times. The broad employment categories currently in the surveys could be more useful if they were finer-grained and/or incorporated job titles along with employment category.  Although graduate schools can lead PhD career pathways data collections efforts, close coordination with other campus units is required. Some universities expressed concern over the lack of staffing and resources necessary to implement the surveys.      The data collection instruments and strategy developed in this project have the potential to address a persistent challenge in the creation of STEM learning environments: the lack of long-term, program-level career pathways information about the range of careers that STEM PhDs pursue. The instruments developed by CGS can help advance knowledge in this area in two key ways: 1) by better linking individual STEM PhD programs and career outcomes, providing a basis for universities to assess their curricula and professional development offerings; and 2) by more accurately capturing the scope of the intellectual, economic, and social contributions of STEM doctorate holders.
