<AbstractNarration>1514637&lt;br/&gt;Goel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAGER: Understanding Microbiological Intricacies and Developing Modeling Strategies to Estimate Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Urban Engineered Green Infrastructures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Academy of Engineering published a report entitled "NAE Grand Challenges for Engineering."  One of the 14 challenges was to "manage the nitrogen cycle."  The importance of this project is to develop a better understanding of the nitrogen cycle in storm water retention ponds. This will enable scientists studying the nitrogen cycle to better account for this potentially important source of nitrogen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bioretention ponds have evolved as an excellent option in the form of green infrastructure to manage nutrients in storm water runoffs.  Very recent research efforts have evaluated the contribution of biological processes, such as nitrification and denitrification, on the fate of nitrogen in bioretention ponds. However, the information on the kinetics of these biological processes and most importantly, the information on the potential of nitrous oxide gas, N2O, formation from these green infrastructures are completely missing. This project aims to get the first information on the potential of nitrous oxide fluxes from prototype bioretention field scale facilities located at the University of Utah Campus. The results will be utilized to formulate conceptual model to predict these fluxes at a regional scale. The research objectives proposed in this project are exploratory as well as high risk as biological N removal in bioretention ponds is not well understood and little information is available on nitrous oxide emissions from these urban green infrastructures. This project is expected to lead to a new area of research linking microbiological processes in green infrastructure to urban site scale hydrologic processes, with eventual upscaling to the watershed level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall objective of this project is to study molecular basis of nitrogen transformations and nitrous oxide gas formation in urban green infrastructure. The main objectives of this project were:    Use a laboratory scale existing bioretention facility at the University of Utah Campus to establish protocols to estimate gas (N2, N2O and CO2) flux measurements.   Under different experimental conditions, estimate N2O fluxes using the protocols developed in objective 1 using 15N supplemented synthetic stormwater. This objective will be accompanied with laboratory scale serum bottle tests with soil samples collected from the model bioretention facility. Microbial ecology of nitrifiers and denitrifiers will be monitored using functional gene markers by the use of transcriptomics.    Upscale N2O flux estimates to the city scale for Salt Lake City to compare to other N2O sources.       The following main outcomes were obtained.  1. A female graduate student finihsed her thesis through this project scope.  2. The graduate student presented important findings at an international confernce (WEFTEC) and local conference (WEAU).  3. The results using in-situ chamber installation clearly demonstrated that indeed bioretention ponds contribute to nitrous oxide emisisons and this emission is temperature dependent.  4. The analysis showed a negative correlation of N2O emissions with evapotranspiration during almost all months.  5. The Pearson correlations of N2O emissions from each basin and respective relative humidity data reported a positive correlation.  6. The research established the presence of functional genes responsible for aerobic nitrifictaion and anoxic denitrifictaion.   7. This project developed methodologies and protocols which could be used by other research community to conduct similar research.   8. The overall microbila community diversity was depend on in-situ soil properties such as soil organic carbon content and humidity.
