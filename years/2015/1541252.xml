<AbstractNarration>Dedicated research networks form the crucial foundations for data-intensive science. These networks help researchers share data, create knowledge, and communicate scientific discoveries. This project from Montana State University deploys a dedicated research network in the form of a science demilitarized zone (DMZ) network across the Bozeman campus. The enhancements include: a new 40Gb/s core; 10 Gb/s connections to data-intensive scientific instruments; and 1Gb/s connections to individual big data labs and workstations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bridger creates a dedicated "data lane" for scientific research, allowing more efficient and effective data sharing to the national community for NSF-funded science drivers at Montana State. This network supports prior investments made by NSF in a major research instrument, a statewide EPSCOR environmental network, and projects in biology, chemistry, and physics. The project's broader impact is focused on the reuse of created data in data science curricula and formal existing NSF-funded outreach programs, including Montana Girls STEM Collaborative and the Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network. The Bridger project demonstrates an easily replicated solution that other state universities may copy to address the profound impact that data-intensive science is having on campus networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Bridger Research Network, funded by the National Science Foundation?s (NSF) Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program, is focused on providing a dedicated high-performance network supporting the data transfer and collaboration needs of a set of multidisciplinary scientific collaborations that span the State of Montana, across the United States, and around the globe.  The scientific applications selected leveraged existing investments made by NSF in a major research instrument, a statewide EPSCoR environmental network, a major Department of Energy grant, and projects in biology, chemistry, physics, and the humanities.    Bridger focused first on the technical implementation of a new physical research network on the Bozeman campus.  The network was developed to comply with the Department of Energy?s Science Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) architecture for big data.  The deployment targeted seven science intensive buildings identified through a Research Data Census (https://er.educause.edu/articles/2015/9/data-intensive-science-and-campus-it)  conducted as part of the development of the research proposal.  Deployment was in three phases:  1) Upgrade the existing Science DMZ core to 40 Gb/s for more use of  Montana State?s Wide Area Network (WAN), 2) Improvements to the distribution of campus bandwidth at 10GB/s to the data-intensive research buildings, and 3) the distribution of that new network capacity to individual labs at either 10 GB/s or 1GB/s based on user requirements.  All phases of the network improvement concluded with successful testing using both perfSONAR and GridFTP.    Seven of the nine application drivers in our initial proposal had meaningful and persistent use of the Bridger network, and many new collaborations and projects arose that leveraged the infrastructure.  The dominant use case among our users was in the facilitation of large data transfers to partner institutions that lacked formal DMZ architectures on the remote collaborator's end.  While we also had some usage between fully realized DMZ to DMZ architectures, these collaborations achieved the highest network performance but also required the most technical collaboration.    Surprisingly, and not anticipated in our proposal, the ?stickiest? use case for the network was in the off-site backup of large data sets.  As part of Bridger, Montana State was able to develop a work-flow with the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) that allowed our users to affordably and efficiently back up their locally stored scientific data to a national resource with multiple location redundancy.   Bridger also had a broader impact that was substantial and focused on reuse of institutional data for informal science education and bringing new communities into the research networking conversation.   Primary broader impact efforts focused on exploring the extent to which individual researcher data sets for the project would be open to the reuse of their scientific data for derivative informal science education efforts. A successful demonstration of this concept involved a Marmoset vocalization data set gathered to help develop signal processing algorithms with application to human hearing aids. This data was featured in Montana State University Family Science day that had engagement from over 500 students (k12) and their parents.  This pilot was not only individually successful but also demonstrated that enhanced network connectivity could be used to identify and target data sets for conversations regarding informal science education outreach efforts.  The greatest breadth of impact from the project was in increasing the diversity of academic communities involved in the national conversation regarding high-performance research networking.  Our engagement with the School of Film and Photography at Montana State led to a multi-party partnership as a proof of concept to transfer a digital planetarium film using Bridger and the DMZ at the University of Illinois-Chicago.  The planetarium film pilot demonstrated success then led to a new distribution channel for this content created by Nicolas Yunes, an NSF young CAREER award winner, to over 25 number of institutions.   In addition to this effort and discussion of it at the National Research Platform meeting hosted in 2016 and 2017 in Bozeman, Bridger acted as a catalyst for engaging digital curation experts at UC San Diego, New Mexico, and Montana State in the Library Sciences.  A data set of metrics associated with Institutional Repositories (RAMP, see http://ramp.montana.edu/) was successfully shared with a digital object identifier (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2036982) for promoting findability of data resources stored on a data transfer node.  This data set, which will be updated monthly, will be permanently hosted within the Bridger fabric for the Library community.
