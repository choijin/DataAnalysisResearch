<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud computing systems are revolutionizing business, government, and science by providing easy access to scalable computing. These public services, as offered by Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others, allow an arbitrary customer to rent, by the hour, the resources needed to run their applications within virtual machines (VMs) hosted on the provider?s compute infrastructure.  With these new services, however, comes subtle new security issues. Prior work by the PI uncovered attacks that abuse two aspects unique to cloud computing: resource sharing among mutually distrustful customers and pricing that incentivizes malicious behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is organized along the two themes of resource sharing and pricing. In the first theme, the work explores whether cryptographic side channel attacks and resource-freeing attacks pose serious threats to cloud customers and then develops new placement and CPU scheduling algorithms that realize the security principle of soft isolation: minimization of potentially dangerous cross-user scheduling interactions (e.g., sharing a server or CPU core).  Within the second theme, the work explores the implications of fine-grained pricing mechanisms on security. This includes developing pricemarks (mechanisms for accurately determining the true costs of a cloud service), understanding customer-controlled placement gaming that exploits cloud performance heterogeneity, and explores pricing-based security mechanisms that, in conjunction with the aforementioned scheduling mechanisms, will degrade fiscal incentivizes for adversarial behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the proposed work will be deeper understanding of threats in cloud IaaS systems, new security design principles, deployable security technologies, and improvements in security education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported research on computer security in cloud computing, particularly as it relates to public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) systems. Not only do these systems now host a significant fraction of computing tasks, they also introduce subtle new security problems. As such, they deserved special consideration.  The project investigated these new security issues via: exploration of new security threats such as side-channel attacks, development of new defenses that can be integrated into public clouds, and through education of undergraduate and graduate students about the importance of cloud security. Research highlights include the first-ever demonstrated cross-virtual machine side-channel attack that could steal cryptographic secrets; improved measurement approaches for understanding how two customers' programs could end up on the same physical cloud server (so-called placement vulnerabilities); understanding of placement and side-channel vulnerabilities in the case of platform-as-a-service systems; new side-channel countermeasures that take advantage of CPU scheduling and the principle of soft isolation; first-of-their-kind measurement studies for understanding newer cloud systems such as serverless (also called function-as-a-service); and finally initial understanding of new threats in emerging cloud-based machine learning platforms.     By working closely with industry partners, the research was able to help prevent attacks in practice by identifying and fixing weaknesses before criminals or other adversaries could exploit them. The project has had broad impact on the security and privacy of users of cloud computing, which directly or indirectly includes essentially everyone using the Internet.  It also has laid foundations for subsequent academic work on understanding how best to improve the designs of future cloud computing systems.
