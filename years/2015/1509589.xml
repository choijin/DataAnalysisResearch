<AbstractNarration>Abstract Title: &lt;br/&gt;Uncooled Silicon Germanium Oxide Microbolometers with Metasurface for Multispectral Infrared Imaging&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Many studies have shown that color imagery leads to faster and more accurate scene understanding, reaction time and object identification than intensity-based false color or grayscale imagery. Capturing the spectral distribution (color) in the infrared provides more information, improving contrast and object-identification, which provides better situational awareness than conventional night vision imagery. However, the current cooled multicolor infrared technology requires an expensive cryogenic cooling system for operation, while uncooled multicolor technology is complex and expensive. To address this issue, the research project will integrate metasurfaces onto uncooled infrared (IR) microbolometers in a novel architecture. The metasurface selective absorption will be combined with the Fabry-Pérot resonant cavity in a pixel with multiple stacked microbolometers, to provide high IR absorption in different spectral windows while maintaining a fill factor over 90%. This will allow attributes of incident radiation beyond its intensity, including its spectral distribution, to be resolved. The metasurfaces will allow the electrical and thermal performance of the microbolometer to be partially decoupled from its radiative properties. The resulting technology will lead to low cost, portable uncooled multiband IR detectors with a broad range of applications such as automotive safety, healthcare, surveillance, and landmine detection. The project will provide comprehensive educational training to graduate, undergraduate and high school students, and curriculum development. The outreach effort will be focused on guest lectures at Lincoln University, a regional HBCU, and recruiting students from underrepresented groups in STEM education. In addition, the project will also further scientific education by advancing integrated, multidiplinary, multicampus postgraduate training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research goal of this project is to establish the design and microfabrication frameworks for uncooled IR microbolometers by integrating a thermally isolated dual-level pixel architecture, a metasurface with engineered radiative properties, and an amorphous Si-Ge-O based sensing layer. This will create an uncooled multiband infrared (IR) microbolometer where the images from different bands are fused into a single multicolor image with high resolution. The multiband operation is accomplished by synthesizing metasurfaces to determine the absorption/transmission/reflection properties of the two microbolometers. The research project focuses on measuring the spectral content in the long wave IR range. The amplitude of the incident radiation is divided into two bands corresponding to the two microbolometers. This will allow the temperature of a radiating surface to be determined without knowing its temperature beforehand. The combination of Fabry-Pérot cavity and surface resonances provides multiple degrees of freedom for designing the spectral response of the pixel so the fill factor does not need to be sacrificed. The use of the metasurfaces as an absorber allows further exploration of the thermal characteristics of microbolometer design for improved performance. Rigorous coupled electromagnetic and thermal models will be built to predict the performance of the devices. These devices will be fabricated and characterized to identify sources of noise and optimize for noise reduction. The research objective is to generate knowledge about the electromagnetic/thermal and noise effects of integrating the metasurface and microboleter, elucidate the interaction between the Fabry-Pérot and metasurface resonance, and establish fabrication principles for the two-band microbolometer. This will provide better detection technology that will enable a future generation of smaller, lighter, low cost multicolor thermal imaging systems that consume less power and operates at ambient temperature.</AbstractNarration>

The measured thermal conductance and thermal response time were 7.62&times;10-8 W/K and 4.55 ms. The results demonstrated that annealing in vacuum lowered the noise much more than that of annealing in forming gases. The lowest measured noise was 1.723&times;10-15 V2/Hz with corresponding Hooge’s parameters &gamma;, &beta; and Kf of 1.02, 2.07, 6.375&times;10-14, respectively.  For the two-microbolmeter stack, the highest measured voltage responsivity and detectivity for the bottom microbolometer were 2.7&acute;104 V/W and 2.8&times;108 cm-Hz1/2/W, respectively, and 7.6 &acute;103 V/W and 7.5 &times; 107 cm-Hz1/2/W, respectively, for the top microbolometer, both at a bias current of 320 nA. The measured thermal response time for the bottom and top microbolometer are 4.4 ms, and 4.8 ms, respectively. The two-microbolometer stack demonstrated two independent spectral windows. The measurements of both microbolometer architectures also demonstrated that the spectral response changes as a function of metasurface disk diameter and periodicity. When disks with one size spaced by uniform periodicity is used a narrow band was achieved in addition to broadband absorption for tessalated disks of different diameters.  Several different SixGeyO1-x-y were tested, with and without the addition of metasurfaces. This showed that the metasurface slightly increases the magnitude of TCR (sensitivity) while the resistivity (noise) is dramatically reduced. The effect depends on the stoichiometry SixGeyO1-x-y and geometry of the metasurface. The metasurfaces of different periodicity and disk diameters were patterned on the films (e.g., Si0.583Ge0.282O0.135).  The metasurfaces with the highest overall fill factor produce the largest reduction in the overall resistivity. The results show a more dramatic reduction in the resistivity and improvement of the TCR with the addition of a metasurface to a film with a lower concentration of Ge (Si0.70Ge0.16O0.14).  The metasurface reduces the resistivity from 903 to 38 &Omega;&middot;cm (23&times;) while the TCR is slightly improved from -2.94%/K to -3.52%/K (20% improvement in sensitivity).   The frequency domain finite element method was used to model a unit cell of the metasurface using a Floquet modal approach.  This predicts the spectrally dependent absorptivity of the metasurface.  Initially, genetic algorithms were used to optimize design geometries with near-perfect absorption at different wavelengths in the LWIR.  These results were used to fit lumped parameter models for the metasurface and allows rapid synthesis of the metasurface dimensions and is being revised for publication.  The Floquet modal expansion approach does not account for truncation effects on the microbolometers as well as any interaction with the support structure.  Full-wave simulations of the model were simulated to evaluate the effects and showed some reduction in the performance (~10-20% lower absorptance) with overall spectral consistency with the unit cell approach.  The volumetric absorption was then used to calculate the thermal response.  These simulations agree the 1st order thermal behavior that is typical of microbolometers.  Many different metasurfaces were designed.  This includes designs with integrated sensing layers separated from the ground plane by an insulator, introducing phonon modes which couple to the metasurface resonance.  This complicates the response but offers opportunities to further engineer the spectral response.  A framework for designing this class of metasurfaces was created.  Other geometries that were investigated include polarization dependent absorbers as well as ultra-low thermal mass designs incorporating a &frac14; wave air gap separating the ground plane.  The PI and CoPI have integrated the metasurface based uncooled infrared detector into their courses (Advanced MEMS) offered for graduate students. Laboratory tours were offered to highschool students during Engineering-week and many undergraduate students. He supported 7 undergraduates and several REU interns in his lab. 3 journal manuscripts were published (4 more preparation), and 7 conference papers. 4 PhD student will graduate this year.
