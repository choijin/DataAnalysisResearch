<AbstractNarration>The broader impact and commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is to provide a usable stranded and associated gas collection capacity for oil &amp; gas exploration companies. During drilling operations, valuable gas is lost through intentional venting and flaring, causing losses in natural gas delivered to the power plant or city gate. With the sector's expansion into more remote low-volume sites, these losses are increasing dramatically. Through this project's proposed novel Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) based storage technology, framergy will deliver a re-usable and transport ready intermodal container, to store gas at low pressure, eliminating the need to use expensive gas capture, purification and multi-stage compression systems. An economically feasible unprocessed natural gas storage technology would provide a useful tool for the domestic oil &amp; gas industry in capturing what would be flared or vented and delivering it to the American economy. Taking framergy's novel MOF technology to the bench and pilot scale will show the feasibility of a flexible, transportable, low-cost infrastructure to abate flaring and venting. Beyond Phase I, framergy and its Automotive OEM-supplier partner will extend its novel Adsorbed Natural Gas (ANG) technology into large-scale versions of its vehicular tanks to allow for rapid implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this Phase I research project are the development of stable and low-cost Metal-Organic framework (MOF) based storage technologies for the collection of usable stranded associated gas during drilling operations. In order to harness point source emissions, before being vented or flared, framergy will develop a nano-engineered, MOF based sorbent for low-pressure capture and storage of unprocessed natural gas. During the Phase I period, framergy and Texas A&amp;M University will develop a robust and scalable method to synthesize new MOFs containing other high-valence transition metal ions such as Al3+, Fe3+ and Cr3+. Furthermore, the project will screen a range of organic ligands for improving MOFs' surface property and storage capacity. Finally, by following alternative synthesis routes with low cost catalysts, framergy and Texas A&amp;M University will identify sorbent synthesis cost reduction strategies. The sorbent material will be tested with simulated vent/flare-gas compositions in a cyclic pressure range and the sorbent stability will be verified by an assortment of X-ray, spectroscopy, and microscopy methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On July 1st, 2015, framergy, Inc., in collaboration with Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU), began a six month Nation Science Foundation (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program Phase I award to address the collection of natural gas at the well head that is normally lost to venting or flaring. The substantial increase in the production of natural gas since 2008 has led to a sustained reduction in cost of energy and a reduction in air contaminants, effectively enabling new domestic sources for American fossil fuels.  Unfortunately, a large amount of this benefit is lost due the lack of containment infrastructure as vast amounts of fuel gases are taken from oil fields in regions far removed from consumption.        At the conclusion of this award, framergy demonstrated the feasibility of using a Metal-organic Framework (MOF) based adsorbed natural gas storage system, for improved real-world separation and recovery of unprocessed natural gas and tail gas during fossil fuel production. framergy MOFs, invented by award partner Dr. Hongcai Joe Zhou at TAMU, are a novel family of physisorptive materials, which exhibit great promise for high capacity methane storage.  Enhanced by framergyÆs novel HAANG&trade; technology, an efficient capturing technology is now on the horizon to deliver the $1.2 billion in lost US natural gas to the market.     During the six-month award, framergy and TAMU demonstrated step change improvements to Adsorbed Natural Gas (ANG) using MOFs.  ANG tests conducted with unprocessed natural gas showed four times increase in adsorption capacity compared to a test canister without MOFs. Similarly, ANG tests conducted with tail gas stream, natural gas stripped of its natural gas liquids, revealed three times increase in adsorption capacity demonstrating a significant advantage in using MOFs for the storage of a variety of natural gas compositions whether at the well head or at natural gas processing stations. Under pure methane (the major component of natural gas), high alkane doped MOFs (HAANG&trade;) showed a more than 20 percent increase in the delivered amount of methane from the storage canister tested, indicating a substantial increase in the working capacity of MOFs with this technology.     Based on the improved gas storage results from framergyÆs SBIR award, compared to the state-of-the-art compressed gas storage technology, framergy has shown the feasibility of using MOFs for enhanced natural gas and tail gas storage and delivery.  The competitive advantage of this product is that it will allow for low cost (non-regulated) collection of stranded and associated waste gas through a porous media. The NSF funded research generated data, samples, software and models, which contributed significantly to the outcome of this project.  The scientific findings during Phase I of this award had intellectual merit of value in both their challenge to common orthodoxy and advancement in the field of gas adsorption.
