<AbstractNarration>This is a program for further development of the MUSTANG millimeter-wave camera which has been developed for use on NSF's Green Bank Telescope (GBT).  The main science goal is to obtain deep, high-resolution observations of galaxy clusters via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE), a decrement in the cosmic microwave background strength as photons pass through a cluster and scatter off of the high temperature intra-cluster gas and out of the line of sight.  Broader impacts of the work include the training of undergraduate and graduate students in instrumentation development.  Members of the team are actively involved with public outreach in the Philadelphia area including star parties, the Philadelphia science festival and mentoring in low-performing schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The upgrade is called MUSTANG-2, and will increase the number of detectors from 32 to 223.  The sensitivity of the detectors will be greatly enhanced as well.  Maps of the SZE in galaxy clusters at 90 GHz with the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope will provide a combination of unprecedented mapping speed, resolution, and sky coverage which will unlock the full potential of these complex objects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The MUSTANG instrument is a 223 element receiver built to operate on the Green Bank Telescope (GBT).   Operating at 3 mm wavelength on the 100 GBT, MUSTANG has 9 arcsecond resolution.   This provides the opportunity to make high-resolution, high sensitivity measurements of "cold" objects in the sky such as the star forming regions in Orion or the very small Sunyaev-Zel?dovic (SZ) effect in Galaxy clusters.  The main goal of this work was to complete the detectors for the MUSTANG camera.  The instrument, including the cryogenic receiver, optics, warm readout electronics, and interface with the GBT had all been completed.   However, we were missing a new set of antenna-coupled Transition Edge Sensor (TES) detectors which are manufactured at NIST.  With the resources provided by this award, graduate student, Sara Stanchfield was able to work with NIST to build, package, and test approximately 300 new TES sensors.  We selected the best 223 of these detectors and installed them (keeping the spares).  The new detector system utilizes microwave multiplexing (uMUX) technology for reading out the TES sensors.  This state-of-the-art system is capable of multiplexing up to 2000 detectors on a single pair of coaxial cables.  While MUSTANG only multiplexes 64 detectors, it is the first fielded instrument to use this next-generation system and is often quoted in discussion for technology to be utilized in the CMB-S4 instruments now being considered.  The detectors were successfully installed and tested at the University of Pennsylvania mid-2016 and MUSTANG was integrated on the GBT for the fall of 2016 with observations through May 2017.  While the weather this past year was poor compared to historical averages, we were able to make some very nice observations of high signal to noise targets such as the Orion star forming region as well as some SZ clusters.  These have provided us valuable data regarding the instrument functionality as well as some very nice images (see attached).  We removed MUSTANG from the GBT in the summer of 2017 to replace one of the multiplexing chips several of the bolometers. It is now back up on the GBT and we hope to be observing in the coming weeks.          Last Modified: 10/01/2017       Submitted by: Mark J Devlin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
