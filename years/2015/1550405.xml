<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE project is jointly funded by the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science, Physics of Living Systems in the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Math and Physical Science, Physical and Dynamic Meteorology in the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences in the Directorate for Geoscience, and the INSPIRE program in the Office of Integrative Activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in scientific instrumentation and computational hardware and software have resulted in an unprecedented ability to acquire, simulate, and visualize time resolved three-dimensional (3D) volumes of data, offering the promise of a greater understanding of complex systems previously beyond our technical grasp.  However, as the size and complexity of these data increase, analyzing them becomes increasingly problematic, inhibiting scientific discovery and limiting the utility of the data acquired at great expense and effort.  Two particularly cogent examples come from two seemingly disparate scientific fields: neuroscience and meteorology.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners can now acquire functional MRI (FMRI) volumes of brain activity in almost real time, while mobile Doppler radar (MDR) systems are capable of acquiring time-dependent volumetric images of thunderstorms during tornado formation.   In this project, entitled QUantitative Estimation of Space-Time processes in volumetric data (QUEST), the University of California, San Diego, Center for Scientific Computation in Imaging (CSCI), in partnership with the Center for Severe Weather Research (CSWR) and the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) will develop a novel framework for the analysis of time-varying 3D volumes, guided by large scale numerical simulations, to investigate two of the outstanding scientific questions of our age: What is the relationship between brain structure and function?, and How do strong, long-track tornadoes form?  The resulting computational platform will be disseminated to the NSF community through the open source analysis and visualization platform (STK) to improve the ability of researchers to quantitatively analyze, visualize, and explore complex time varying volumetric datasets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This INSPIRE project develops advanced methods for automated quantitative characterization of subtle space-time patterns embedded within spatio-temporal data from 3D voxel-based digital imaging modalities based upon the team's recently formulated entropy field decomposition (EFD) theory, a probabilistic method efficiently that employs the information field theoretic approach with prior information supplied using the team's entropy spectrum pathways theory, in conjunction with numerical simulations designed both to constrain results to physically realizable solutions.  The cross-disciplinary approach focuses on two outstanding problems in the respective fields of neuroscience and severe weather meteorology: 1) The identification of structural and functional modes of the human brain from high resolution anatomical MRI, diffusion tensor MRI, functional MRI data from the Human Connectome Project combined with numerical simulations of diffusion and functionally weighted MRI signals, and 2) The identification of signatures of tornado genesis and maintenance from MDR data from the Doppler-On-Wheels network in conjunction with tornado simulations using the CM1 model.  Significant social impact would result from the ability to categorize states of brain activity in normal and diseased populations and the ability to reduce the lead time between tornado formation and warning to threatened populations.  More generally, this novel methodology has the potential to transform the way analysis is conducted in a wide range of disciplines by enabling automated, quantitative detection of important, though perhaps subtle, variations in large, complex datasets undetectable by current traditional techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Characterization of complex spatio-temporal processes is an important aspect of data analysis in a broad range of scientific disciplines and of increasing importance as data acquisition systems become increasingly sophisticated, resulting in much larger data sets that are sensitive to increasingly subtle dynamics of evolving physical systems.  Such is the case in two important areas of research with direct human impact on: medical imaging devices for measuring brain activity, and Doppler radar systems for detecting severe weather events.  Despite the apparent dissimilarity between these two fields, the primary data analysis challenge is remarkably similar: detection and quantitation of the spatial and temporal evolution of the parameters that characterize these physical systems.  Brain activity is an exceedingly complex interplay of metabolic and electrical activity evolving within the complex topology of the brain, and multiple modalities, in particular functional MRI (fMRI), electroencepholgraphy (EEG)  and magnetoencepholography (MEG) are now routinely used to measure brain activity related to metabolism and blood flow (fMRI), electrical (EEG) and magnetic (MEG) activity.  Similarly, the evolution and maintenance of tornadic supercell thunderstorms is still poorly understood, but modern Doppler radar systems, such as the mobile Doppler On Wheels (DOWs), are increasingly capable of measuring physical quantities such as rapidly evolving velocity vector volumes with greater spatial and temporal resolution.  The ability to better understand these complex physical systems is predicated on our ability to measure the complex spatio-temporal dynamics within the data from these rapidly advancing measuring systems.    The goal of the QUEST project was to develop a more general theoretical and computational approach to this data characterization problem, as ‘standard’ methods typically involve simplifying assumptions that are increasingly tenuous as imaging systems and the resultant data become larger and more complex.  Supported by this NSF award, we developed and refined a novel theoretical and computational framework called the Entropy Field Decomposition (EFD) that is capable of detecting and quantifying subtle complex spatiotemporal patterns in large complex datasets from state-of-the-art imaging technologies, and demonstrated its efficacy in both human brain imaging and severe weather research into tornadogensis, including analysis of large scale numerical models of tornadoes, and actual mobile Doppler radar data.  The EFD method was used to develop a novel approach for application of diffusion MRI to detect brain tissue structural integrity and long range order, of critical importance in both basic and clinical neuroscience research. This derivative method, called Joint Estimation Diffusion Imaging (JEDI), overcomes some major limitations of current dMRI in its abilities to simultaneously detect both white matter (i.e. neural fibers) and gray matter (i.e. cortical nerve cell bodies) tissue characteristics, and has important implications for basic neuroscience research and for clinical utility in brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).  Our work on combining fMRI data with EEG using our JESTER extension of EFD for combining multiple modalities in order to construct a physics-driven model led us to more detail oriented treatment of EEG signals in the brain and to a new theory of the propagation of brain waves through complex tissues.  This theory explains the existence of brain wave loops that have been measured experimentally It also provides a novel theory for the generation of synchronous neuronal spiking behavior and thus has a potentially profound influence on the way we understand the human brain.  We also demonstrated the efficacy of the EFD method on three important components of severe weather research. 1) Understanding physical models in tornadogenesis: We created the most accurate numerically simulated tornadic thunderstorms (NSTT) ever generated and applied EFD to it. 2) Understanding radar signatures: We simulated radar signatures from NSTT and analyzed this data to better understand the relation between actual storm structure and its radar signature; 3) Understanding real physical process in data: We used EFD to analysis real data from multiple mobile Doppler systems, for comparison with the radar simulations from the NSTT.  This was the ultimate goal of the project - to use EFD, in conjunction with NSTT and radar simulations, to better understand the development and maintenance of tornadoes, paving the way for its use across a broader range of real radar systems, for both basic research and operational meteorological applications, to better inform and protect the public during severe weather (e.g. tornado) events.
