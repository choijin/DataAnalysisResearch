<AbstractNarration>In a project funded by the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Richard Stratt of Brown University is developing new ways of understanding the complex and seemingly erratic patterns of motion exhibited by molecules in liquids.  The immediate goal is to gain insights into the behavior of glass-forming liquids, and liquid crystals. Both of these materials are of enormous technological significance because of their relevance to the manufacture of amorphous materials and to practical display devices. In addition, these methods have potential applications to span an even broader range of chemical problems in solutions.  The basic idea is to take advantage of recent progress in using high-performance computation to map out the most favorable molecular pathways.  In combination with analysis methods being devised by Professor Stratt and his research group, other scientific groups using ultrafast laser techniques can look for these desired patterns of motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The engine driving this effort is that it is now possible to find the geodesic (most efficient) routes through realistic potential energy landscapes of such complex systems as supercooled and mesogenic liquids.  But, with the discovery that these routes can be computationally interrogated to discern molecular mechanisms comes the possibility of designing multidimensional spectroscopy experiments to ascertain those mechanisms.  The Stratt group will be investigating the specific nonlinear spectroscopic signatures of various kinds of geodesic-defined molecular mechanisms to see if properly chosen spectra can help resolve some of the current mysteries surrounding the dynamics of supercooled fragile liquids and liquid crystals.  An integral part of this effort (and part of its broader impact) will be the use of this project as a vehicle for exposing college undergraduates to issues faced in frontline computationally-oriented research.  It is hard to overestimate the importance of the United States having an educated citizenry with an appreciation of how such 21st-century scientific methods as computer simulation can be used to approach challenging problems.  By focusing on carefully selected portions of the project, undergraduates from a wide variety of different background will be able to gain an appreciation of the challenges and possibilities provided by scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             One would think that molecules in liquids should be able to move around relatively quickly.  Why is it, then, that their motion can sometimes be so slow that materials can become glassy -- that molecular rearrangement can take so long to happen that, for all practical purposes, the system solidifies?  For what are called "fragile" glassy systems, those lacking strong chemical bonds capable of holding the molecules in place, the situation is even more puzzling.              During the recently concluded grant period, our research group made a number of inroads into this longstanding mystery, both by developing some novel mathematical approaches to understanding the phenomena, and by exploring the surprising analogy between glassy and "liquid crystalline" behaviors.  We found, using our newly discovered random-matrix technique, that the remarkably slow dynamics seen in liquids close to becoming glasses ("supercooled liquids") has similarities to what is seen in liquids of long, thin molecules.  Under certain conditions, such molecules form relatively large patches in which each patch has molecules nearly aligned in some direction, but the patches do not seem to talk to one another.  The existence of such a globally disordered substance which has experimentally controllable amounts of molecular organization and slow dynamics -- two of the hallmarks of supercooled liquids -- means that we may now be able to use liquid crystals as a test case to gain a better understanding of glass formation.              The other mathematical avenue we took towards investigating these kinds of problems was to continue our study of the character of the so-called "potential energy landscape" of liquids, the map showing where the energetically favorable and unfavorable locations of molecules are.  In previous grant periods we had discovered that we could capture some of the features of slow molecular dynamics by looking for the geodesic (shortest) pathways that those molecules could take through that landscape: slow dynamics seemed to occur when there even the shortest available paths were long and tortuous.  During the recently concluded grant period, we found, to our surprise, that even the slower-than-expected dynamics found in roaming chemical reactions, the high-energy break-up of certain small molecules, were signaled by the presence of the same kinds of convoluted geodesic pathways.              It is worth pointing out that, consistent with the broader impacts portion of this grant, much of this work was carried out with, and in some cases, entirely by, undergraduate researchers.  Over the course of the grant, undergraduates in our group developed new geodesic-path finding methods for polymeric systems and investigated analogies between a supercooled liquid and a previously unseen kind of liquid-crystal surface phenomenon.  They contributed to our research group meetings and probably ended up helping the graduate students in our group as much as the graduate students helped them.  Including undergraduates as partners in genuine research endeavors, even in highly mathematical and technical fields, continues to prove its worth as an otherwise unobtainable educational experience for the students as well as a valuable stimulus to front-line research.
