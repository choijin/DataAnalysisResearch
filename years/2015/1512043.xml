<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Cunningham, Brian&lt;br/&gt;1512043&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel approach for coupling multiple optical cavities together to enhance the excitation of fluorescent emitters used for biological and chemical detection.  Wavelength-tuned external cavity lasers, photonic crystal resonator surfaces, and gold nanorods are combined to demonstrate large enhanced fluorescence detection of proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surface-based fluorescence assays and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) are widely used in life science research, molecular diagnostics, and microscopy. There is strong motivation to improve their detection sensitivity while at the same time reducing the cost/complexity of detection instrumentation. This project would develop and characterize a fundamentally new approach towards excitation of surface-adsorbed photon emitters and scatterers that can be applied towards surface-based fluorescent and SERS assays for biomolecular analytes used in life science research, genomics, proteomics, diagnostics, and environmental monitoring.  The approach incorporates inexpensively manufacturable nanostructured surfaces and an nexpensive, compact detection instrument that will facilitate broad adoption. The project involves graduate research, undergraduate internships, integration of laboratory demonstrations into undergraduate courses, and activities that involve hands-on demonstrations to middle school children.</AbstractNarration>
