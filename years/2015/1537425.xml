<AbstractNarration>In addition to the conventional concern of stability and collapse in large-scale engineering structures, buckling phenomena play a key role in many other natural and engineered systems, e.g., plants responding to stimuli, deformations of macro-scale engineering structures, patterning of periodic porous materials, and design of 3D shapes from 2D nanostructures. More generally, predicting the escape from a potential energy well is a universal exercise, and governs behavior in many physical systems that are unable to maintain stability in the face of disturbances. All these situations are essentially dominated by the large-scale organization of system states, as the system finds a way to exit one state (i.e., behavior) and get to another. Often this transition is sudden, and the consequences of this escaping behavior may be catastrophic. Focusing attention on low-order experimental buckling systems is the key intermediate step in transitioning from an abstract theoretical concept to practical and design-oriented guidelines. This award supports an effort to apply a new paradigm, by way of a fresh theoretical-computational approach, to assess the ways in which the problem of escape can be tested experimentally, in a statistical sense, and hence provide a framework for prediction, design, and in some cases prevention, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated design and control of such systems. This project brings together two researchers from complementary backgrounds. Although the framework will be developed within the realm of nonlinear structural dynamics, there are many other potential applications of the mathematics: chemical reactions, nanostructures, earthquake engineering, ship dynamics, to name a few, and even possible utility beyond engineering: certain biological and ecological systems. The broad range and reach of this research project will provide a strong training environment for undergraduate and graduate students. The research team will also develop an active outreach program to excite young minds about dynamics through snap-through phenomena and self-guided inquiry using 3D printer technology at high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support an effort in theoretical and applied mechanics to develop an innovative unified approach to experimental nonlinear structural buckling, using high dimensional cylinder-like phase space structures as the fundamental basis for understanding the dynamics governing motion between potential wells (equilibrium states) in phase space. These tube features organize the evolution of trajectories in phase space in a global sense. This point-of-view will be applied to understand the behavior of a number of axially loaded slender mechanical structures, of varying degrees of complexity.  Criteria and routes of escape from a potential well have previously been considered and determined for one degree of freedom systems with time-varying forcing, with reasonable agreement with experiments. However, when there are two or more degrees of freedom, the situation becomes more complicated. Yet, even for the higher dimensional case, recent work suggests the beginnings of a theoretical-computational framework for determining the boundary of those trajectories which will soon escape (or equivalently, transition between wells in multi-well systems). These methods are geometric in nature for deterministic systems, merging naturally into a probabilistic framework when noise and stochastic effects are incorporated. The research develops a consistent approach to a deeper understanding of an important class of structural mechanics problems, with potential applications to buckling prediction for traditional engineered structures, and emerging opportunities to design adaptive structures that can bend, fold, and twist, i.e., controllably morphing structures into a desired shape to achieve some objective.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This Project Outcomes report focuses on the Duke portion of the collaborative research with Virginia Tech. Although involving considerable overlap, the primary focus of the Duke effort was experimental.</p> <p>Across the physical sciences and engineering, systems exist in near equilibrium, typically under slowly evolving conditions. However, most realistic systems are nonlinear, and as such, may exhibit sudden transitions, e.g., when a structure buckles suddenly going from one configuration (shape) to another. Predicting this type of behavior is challenging, and although unstable equilibria cannot be observed directly (they are unstable by definition), they play a crucial role in organizing stability transitions. And the overall approach adopted in this project is to infer the location of unstable equilibria (typically saddle-points) indirectly, using transient dynamics and guided by ideas from tube dynamics (at Virginia Tech).</p> <p>The image "potential energy surface" shows a (potential energy) shape that corresponds to the strain energy of a buckled beam. The minima reflect stable equilibria. One of the main goals of the project is to identify unstable equilibria, and these are associated with the saddle-points in the shape of the surface. A digital camera tracked the motion of a small ball, with a specific focus on how the ball traverses the surface in going from one region to another. Two examples of trajectories are shown in the figure "trajectories'. Given some initial energy, the ball traverese the surface, and before ending up at a minimum it 'slows-down' and is infleunced by the presence of saddle-points - the location of which we seek to know more about.</p> <p>Shallow geodesic domes are in some ways a continuous analog of the 2D surface, not so much in direct comparion between shapes, but rather in terms of how equilibrium configurations can be viewed in terms of representative degrees of freedom, or dimensions. For example, an initial shape of the dome is represented by a local minimum in the surface, with a remote minimum in the surface corresponding to a snapped-through shape of the dome. This analog only works if the behavior of the structure is in some sense 'low-order'.</p> <p>An initial equilibrium configuration is 3D-printed (as shown in the image "domes"). It is then subject to loading in the laboratory. Snap-through buckling occurs in which some, or all, of the dome inverts. This is analogous to the ball moving from one minimum to another, but the domes requires a more sophisticated finite element modeling. A variety of domes were produced of various degrees of shallowness, and some with simpler geometries (in terms of the number of elements) than those shown in the figure.</p> <p>A typical comparison between experimental results and numerical simulation is shown in the figure "force-deflection". Finite element analysis compares very favorably with the experimental data for this highly nonlinear behavior, including jumps between configurations.</p> <p>Another successful component of this research concerned the ability to recreate features of potential energy by integrating measured forces. This is shown in the figure "recreation" in which the mathematical form of a surface and physical manifestation are shown in the top half. The bottom right component of this figure shows a close recreation of the shape of the surface from experimental data. An ongoing effort is directed toward applying this 'probing' approach for continuous structures.</p> <p>The final phase of this research involved more direct collaboration between the researchers at Duke and Virginia Tech, and involves developing algorithms to cconduct system identification.
