<AbstractNarration>This grant will support an effort to enhance the understanding of the formation processes for ionospheric plasma wave structures seen in regional distributions of Total Electron Content (TEC) events that exhibit circular patterns. These events are believed to be generated by deep convective processes within thunderstorm systems that launch gravity wave structures into the upper atmosphere region of 60 to 100 km where strong viscous dissipation of these wave packets occurs. Part of the wave energy of these primary waves is transformed into the production of secondary waves that are able to propagate higher into the region of atmospheric heights above 200 km. Here, the interaction of these waves with the ionospheric plasma (pushing or pulling plasma along magnetic field lines) would then generate structures called Traveling Ionosphere Disturbances (TIDs) that are so often seen in TEC data.  The primary objective of the research is to compare the observed concentric TEC perturbations with those calculated from realistic modeling of the primary and secondary GWs from deep convection in order to strengthen and validate the models for the calculation of these TID structures.  A secondary objective would be to utilize the amplitudes and scales of the observed secondary GWs to probe the dynamics of the 'dark' (but highly variable) region near 125-225 km where most of the primary GWs dissipate.  A satisfactory explanation of these TID events in terms of gravity wave processes by reference to the successful modeling of the formation of these structures has never been achieved. Thus, the funded research has a significant potential for providing an enhanced understanding of the properties of these circular TID events that relate to the heating and cooling processes associated with the dissipation and transformation of the primary wave structure into the secondary wave output.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Significant societal impact and transformative research outcomes for this award are expected to be achieved as a result of the success in modeling these circular TID events. Because GWs cause scintillation and plasma bubbles that can disrupt satellite communication and GPS signals, this study may lead to better predictions for the occurrence of these phenomena, which is nationally relevant. In order to enhance scientific understanding for the general public, the researcher will disseminate broadly the results via a web site, conference talks, and journal publications. Finally, this project would support the research of a woman scientist (PI).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) are waves that are created in the Earth's atmosphere.  These are waves in the air that we breathe!  They are created by thunderstorms, by tornadoes, by the wind blowing over mountains, and by tsunamis, for example.  Once created, they move upward higher and higher into the Earth's atmosphere.  As they do, their amplitudes get larger and larger until eventually they break, similar to how an ocean wave breaks just before it hits land.  After they break, they deposit momentum and energy into the atmosphere over a small localized region.  (Here, the momentum of a car is its mass times its velocity, and its energy is 1/2 times its mass times its velocity squared).  That deposition accelerates the atmosphere in that small region, thereby causing the air there to create another set of so-called "secondary" GWs; half of these secondary GWs travel upward, and half travel downward.  This shows the first 2 steps of the so-called "multi-step vertical coupling" (MSVC) and is the process by which momentum and energy within waves travels from near the ground to the F region (which begins approximately 180 km=112 miles above the surface of the Earth).  We saw this 2-step process occurring over the wintertime in Antarctica over McMurdo Station, which is a US station close to the South Pole.  We also saw this 2 and 3-step process occurring in SABER and GOCE satellite data over the wintertime Southern Andes Mountains.  We found that when mountain waves break, they create secondary GWs which travel higher and then break, which creates tertiary GWs which can travel to the F region!  So to get the energy and momentum from the wind blowing over mountains to waves in the F region requires 3 separate steps in the MSVC process!   We looked at something called the TEC, which is the integrated number of electrons between the Earth and a GPS satellite at a given location.  Most of these electrons are in the F region.  We found that rings spanning many many states can occur over regions of strong thunderstorms and tornadoes.  These rings move outward and upward, and are created by underlying GWs.  Sometimes these rings are moving so fast (faster than 300 m/s= 670 miles/hour, which is almost the speed of sound), that they can only propagate up in the F region, and not down here in the air we breathe. Figure 1 shows one of the ring figures from our published paper (Vadas &amp; Azeem, 2021).  You can see that the rings span the F region above Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas and  Louisiana. That is a lot of states!  In this case, we found that most of the GWs that created these rings are likely secondary GWs, not the primary GWs created directly by the thunderstorms.  Therefore, this is an example of a 2-step MSVC process.   We also saw smaller rings in the OH airglow by a satellite instrument (VIIRS) which looked down on the airglow from above.  Here, the OH airglow is a region of the atmosphere that emits light at 90 km (56 miles) above the Earth's surface.  These rings were seen east (downwind) of the Southern Andes during the wintertime and were also found to be likely secondary GWs.  These secondary GWs are a signal that momentum and energy were deposited below where we see the secondary GWs, and therefore help us to understand the momentum and energy budget of the Earth's atmosphere.  We also saw large lines in the TEC perturbations which moved inland from the western coast of the US, and found that these lines were induced by GWs that were created by the tsunami from the Tohoku earthquake in Japan in 2011.  These were primary GWs.          Last Modified: 07/09/2021       Submitted by: Sharon L Vadas]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
