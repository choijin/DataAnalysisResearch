<AbstractNarration>The future electricity grid will have significant renewable generation. This generation is variable it is intermittent, unpredictable, and uncontrollable. Using conventional generation to back-up this variability defeats the emissions benefits of renewables and is very expensive. So the future grid must turn to demand flexibility which will play a critical role to mitigate renewable variability. Consumers will be transformed from passive recipients of power to active participants in providing services to balance supply and demand. This project seeks to explore business cases, market mechanisms, and pricing for various balancing services that demand flexibility can provide. These services include balancing supply and demand as the retail distribution level, and reducing congestion on lines at the wholesale transmission level. The broad agenda of this work is to support the deep penetration of renewable generation by developing and understanding the underlying economic research issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future will have geographic clusters of distributed loads, generation, and storage. A load serving entity (LSE) represents the cluster in transactions with the grid. The LSE buys bulk power from the transmission grid in one hour blocks. At finer time scales, most of the power balance can be arranged internally by modulating storage and flexible loads within the cluster. This reduces the reliance on expensive and dirty reserve generation. &lt;br/&gt;We explore appropriate market instruments such as options and forward contracts that support harnessing demand flexibility for balancing. These instruments allow for the lead-time to organize flexible loads, and account for the randomness in their availability.&lt;br/&gt;We will study equilibria and price discovery for these instruments under various market models. Excess flexibility or storage capacity from a cluster can also be sold to other clusters. Bilateral arrangements between clusters can be clumsy. A better alternative is for clusters to submit their available flexibility to the system operator (SO). The SO conducts multi-period economic dispatch to minimize the social (fuel) cost. It determines optimal generation schedules and demand flexibility set points. Our value proposition here is that storage and flexibility can reduce congestion in transmission networks. &lt;br/&gt;We will quantify the system benefit of demand flexibility in this context, and explore incentive schemes necessary for load participation, as well as the degree of coordination and control across buses necessary to realize these benefits.</AbstractNarration>
