<AbstractNarration>Thomas Sommerfeld of Southeastern Louisiana University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Method program in the Chemistry Division and the NSF EPSCoR office to investigate how extra electrons aid in breaking chemical bonds. Chemical bonds themselves are electrons shared between atoms and can be thought of as a glue holding the atoms in a molecule together. The electron-glue analogy, however, only goes so far, because a bond can be weakened by both too little and too much glue, and weak bonds can be cleaved during the permanent motion of the atoms. In other words, adding an electron to a molecule generally weakens its bonds, and the resulting so-called temporary anion may undergo either bond cleavage or, alternatively, reemit the extra electron. Concrete examples where this reaction is applied or happens naturally are: plasma chemistry and plasma etching, chemistry in the ionosphere, damage to living tissue by ionizing radiation, cancer therapy with electron beams, and reduction reactions with solvated electrons, the so-called Birch reduction.  This research project supports the development of computer models of the temporary anion, the first intermediate formed in these electron-induced reactions.  This research is carried out with collaborators and with undergraduate researchers.  In order to introduce undergraduates to this research, Dr. Sommerfeld also designs educational mini-projects, which are only indirectly related to the current main project, but can be addressed with standard quantum chemistry methods, so that his students can be introduced to the research area step-by-step. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project Dr. Sommerfeld studies electronically metastable states - so called resonance states or, simply, resonances. On the one hand, he develops ab initio methods to characterize resonances, and on the other hand he applies the newly developed methods in selected applications. Computing both the energy and finite lifetime of a resonance is still a notoriously challenging task for quantum chemistry, because it combines an electron-scattering with an electron-correlation problem. To address the continuum aspect, Dr. Sommerfeld either uses complex-absorbing-potentials or the analytic-continuation-in-the-coupling-constant method.  To address the correlation aspect, he uses the symmetry-adapted-cluster configuration-interaction method, an electronic structure method closely related to the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method. One particular point of emphasis is the artificial stabilizing potential added to the Hamiltonian in the analytic-continuation-in-the-coupling-constant method. Dr. Sommerfeld aims to identify a short-range stabilizing potential that improves the subsequent analytic-continuation step. On the application side Dr. Sommerfeld's goals are to examine resonance states, which differ in electronic structure from a closed-shell neutral either by one-hole (Auger-like resonances) or by one excitation (e.g. Penning ionization or resonant photodetachment). For these resonances, treating electron correlation in a balanced way is particularly challenging.  Dr. Sommerfeld studies temporary anion resonances embedded in small molecule clusters with the goal of identifying trends in the change of the resonance parameters associated with the interaction strength (permanent dipole, higher order multipoles, dispersion) of the embedding molecules.</AbstractNarration>

As a professor at a primary undergraduate institution, the PI's first area of responsibility is classroom teaching with research following as a fairly close second. Yet, it is only through grants that a cutting edge research program can be maintained&mdash;a program that may not yield results and publications at the same rate as programs at research universities typically do, but still at the same quality. Having an active research program helps keeping an open mind, not only in research, but also in teaching: Keeping up with recent developments in the subject area and with new learning methods.  Benefits for the undergraduate research program at Southeastern.  It is thoroughly established that students benefit greatly from engaging into undergraduate research. However, students clearly sense the difference between educational projects and a real research projects that may lead to a presentation at a meeting or an earned co-authorship on a journal article. Moreover, students will engage far more deeply when the expectations of their work are not set at a normal course level, but for publishable quality.  In particular, at Southeastern 95% of 14,500 students come from Louisiana, a state which is ranked 50th out of 51 in poverty level with 19.7% of people living under the poverty line.

Even more, it is the PI’s experience that many Southeastern students have not ventured far beyond this region, and that even attending a regional meeting in another state is vastly expanding their horizons.  Specifically, seven undergraduate students were involved in the PI’s research for a total of 12 student-semesters. Three students presented their results as posters at meetings and three students earned a total of five co-authorships on papers.  Benefits from the research itself.  As a quantum chemistry project with both method development and application components, the research undertaken is highly interdisciplinary with chemical, physical, and scientific computing aspects.  The topic itself are negatively-charged molecular ions, so called anions, in particular, temporary anions and non-valence anions. As their name suggests, temporary anions are unstable in the sense that they may decay into a neutral and a free electron similar to a radioactive nucleus. Non-valence anions are stable, but the excess electron is only weakly bound by long-range forces and occupies a spatially extended non-valence orbital.  The most tangible outcome of the research is represented by five published papers and three manuscripts submitted for publication.
