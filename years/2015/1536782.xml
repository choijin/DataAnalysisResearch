<AbstractNarration>Coral reef ecosystems host some of the highest biodiversity of life per unit area on Earth and harbor about one quarter to one third of all marine animals. Reef-associated animals are a major source of protein for millions of people, and reefs offer shoreline protection and provide a significant source of tourism revenue, especially in developing countries.  Factors that influence supply and settlement of young (larval) fish, coral, and associated animals can have large impacts on reef ecosystem and population structure, and learning more about these can help improve understanding of how to maintain the benefits provided by coral reefs. This study will lead to a detailed, mechanistic understanding of how young larvae use natural sounds to orient toward, locate, and select preferred settlement habitat. The approach will combine detailed field measurements and experiments to isolate key soundscape variables that impact coral reef larvae. The results will be broadly distributed to the scientific community and the public through open-access articles, media releases, blogs and website updates. Graduate and undergraduate students will be directly involved in all aspects of the research and outreach. This project will leverage a skilled communications department, the Cape Cod summer community, a community outreach center in a national park and marine protected area, and the public's interest in coral reefs to broaden the awareness of marine ecology through: (a) public presentations in a summer seminar series, (b) direct communication and interaction with journalists and teachers, and (c) education in local schools for preschool, grade-school and college students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For marine communities, such as those on coral reefs, factors influencing larval supply and settlement can have major impacts on community structure and population replenishment. There are now some indications that sound plays an important role in attracting larvae to suitable settlement habitat. There is little understanding of what soundscape habitat information is available to larvae and how differences and variability in sound can influence settlement. This project will include comprehensive experiments, environmental measurements, and modeling with the goal of understanding the role of sound in influencing larval recruitment and local biodiversity. The investigators will measure in situ settlement of larval fish and coral in relation to different soundscapes and habitat conditions in a marine protected area using traditional larval sampling methods, moored acoustic recorders, and a suite of environmental observations. Controlled and calibrated environmental playback experiments will isolate soundscape components and determine specific and fundamental acoustic cues larvae use to orient and settle. The spatial and temporal variability of soundscape cues and components across reef habitats will be established. Finally, the project will determine the relevant ranges of sound plumes that larvae may encounter through direct measurements of the sound fields of multiple reefs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For coral reefs, factors influencing larval supply can have major impacts on community structure and population replenishment of the fish and coral that inhabit those reefs. Historically, research focused on fortuitous oceanographic conditions that may passively conduct larvae over large, open-water distances to suitable habitat. However, substantial new evidence indicates that larval settlement is also an active response that involves orientation toward certain habitat-associated cues. Addressing the relevance of such cues, especially in relation to levels of habitat degradation, is critical to fully understanding marine population and community dynamics, the efficacy of marine protected areas, factors governing biodiversity, and the replenishment of communities under stress. The overarching goal of this study was to understand the extent to which larval orientation and settlement is influenced by the biophysical soundscape of coral reefs and how, in turn, these soundscapes are determined by reef communities and biodiversity. A soundscape includes all sounds in an area including many fish and invertebrates that produce sound as part of natural behaviors. A densely populated place such as coral reefs can be rich with biological sounds. Over the course of this study we were able to listen to, and monitor, 10 reefs in the US Virgin Islands (Figure 1). Our important results include: (1) Sound can mediate and induce the settlement of coral larvae. The settlement of larval corals belonging to the genus <em>Porites</em> was highest in an acoustic environment with abundant, low-pitch fish sounds, typical of a healthy reef. This enhancement of coral settlement by healthy reefs soundscapes suggests a positive feedback where reefs soundscape properties high coral and fish abundance may facilitate larval recruitment back to that reef (Figure 2). (2) Sound also can mediate reef fish settlement, but taxa and biophysical conditions play a large role in these processes. Together, this suggests that reef sounds may be a way to attract and encourage larval settlement on reefs, perhaps helping to restore our reefs under stress. &nbsp;(3) We describe how animal sounds in the reef soundscape can be used to infer habitat health, specifically coral cover and fish community diversity. However, soundscapes vary substantially, as fish and invertebrate call patterns change on daily and lunar timeframes. Thus, using soundscapes to infer biodiversity should be done carefully, taking such variability into account. Yet there is substantial promise in marine acoustic diversity assessment methods and listening to reefs is a vital way to monitor habitats.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project provided diverse broader impacts to society as well as specific educational groups. Much of the rationale for studying reef biodiversity and ecology has been driven by the recent degradation of coral reef ecosystems, which have been impacted by ocean warming and other anthropogenic impacts such as eutrophication, overfishing and ocean acidification. Settlement studies of fish species can provide information for fisheries management and can form the basis for overfishing indicators. Investigations of coral settlement may address climatological impacts and system changes. Together, these data can provide an understanding of the efficacy of marine protected areas, levels of reef biodiversity, and the influence that larval settlement has on the resilience of these ecosystems after being subjected to perturbations. Thus, coral reefs and their associated settlement patterns represent a critically important system and process ideal for evaluating the ecological role of biophysical soundscapes. The results of this research will be valuable to scientists, managers and policy makers as they seek to understand and manage resources and marine protected areas. Further, this research lays the foundation for investigating how anthropogenic noise pollution may impact a central component of ecosystem function. Additionally, this research has been incorporated into educational programs that span Pre-K to grade school to college and has trained 35 students (undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral level) in this relatively new area of soundscape study.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/27/2020<br>      Modified by: T.
