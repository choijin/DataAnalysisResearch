<AbstractNarration>The Ecological Society of America, in collaboration with the Society for Conservation Biology, has received a Research Coordination Network - Undergraduate Biology Education award for their project entitled Next Generation Careers - Innovations in Environmental Biology Education. The PI team is forming a network to support workforce development for college graduate career progression into environmental biology, including fields such as ecology, evolution, conservation, plant biology, and natural resource management. The network is forging connections among academic faculty and administrators and the private sector, government, and non-governmental organizations.  Next Generation Careers is bringing 40 representatives from across these sectors to a workshop to identify potential resource needs, training courses, workforce development and alignment, and directions in environmental biology teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To inform participants, Next Generation Careers is surveying the chairs of Biology departments, undergraduate career development officers, biology faculty and faculty at the nexus of mathematics and biology.  Examination of job ads for entry level positions in related jobs is providing further information concerning the most commonly sought skills for graduates with  Associate's or Bachelor's degrees.  In addition, eight interactive sessions at collaborating disciplinary society and professional association meetings are providing input into the work of the network.  Assessment of the level of participation, the network space, including electronic platforms for information and document exchange, and project outcomes is informing both the process of effective network development and the design of valuable undergraduate career progressions.  This project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Next Generation Careers - Innovation in Environmental Biology Education incubator highlighted the need for programs and courses to recognize the many ways that science can be applied in many different settings, which present diverging career pathways and options available to students.   This project sheds light on changes that are needed on the way that environmental biology can be taught, how intentional career networks can be formed, particularly for underrepresented minority students and how career counselors and professional societies can shape career preparation.  Incubator activities included a job ad scan, a series of focus group meetings with professional societies, a survey on undergraduate biology environmental biology career preparation and a workshop of 36 representatives from academia, private sector, government, and non-governmental organizations.   Systematically building relationships with employers across all sectors was identified as a critical aspect in undergraduate environmental biology education.  Among the key issues that emerged were the high value employers placed on "soft skills" like communication, appropriate interactions with colleagues and supervisors, time management, creative problem-solving and the ability to process information and resolve conflicts.    Participants also noted the uneven access among different populations of students to career information and therefore, to opportunities. This is due in part to the idiosyncratic manner that such information is shared.  In a field where minorities are still underrepresented, ways to extend networks become very important for broadening participation.  The project outlined a series of activities to help undergraduate environmental biology education courses and programs address these issues.  They include connecting faculty with local and regional employers across all sectors; expanding the role of alumni in mentoring and career networks, and framing messages that showcase the societal relevance and value of environmental biology as a field and the visibility of environmental biology careers.  Professional societies and networks are uniquely positioned to facilitate cross-sectoral exchanges to advance best practices, host a database of experts and alumni across related fields, demonstrate the depth and spectrum of types of career opportunities and help determine appropriate mechanisms and levels of involving employers in career preparation activities.  By creating an infrastructure that connects universities, employers, professional societies and students, the focus and nature of resources, materials, programs, and courses to be developed will begin to shift, thereby creating a deeper awareness of career development goals, needs and demands among all involved.
