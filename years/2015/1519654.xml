<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project is to reduce the manufacturing cost of therapeutic biologics using more efficient production technologies. This will be accomplished by developing novel cell retention technologies for increasing cell concentration and productivity in continuous perfusion bioreactor cultures of recombinant microbial and mammalian cells.  Based on the inclined settler technology already proven in large scale mammalian cell cultures, compact and more efficiently scalable cell or particle settlers are being developed to expand its applications to other industrial areas, such as microbial yeast secretory production systems, heterogeneous catalysis, municipal water clarification, wastewater treatment, etc.  Following thorough characterization of a novel compact cell settler device for recombinant microbial yeast cells during this Phase I grant, it will be launched commercially for large-scale manufacturing of biologics from recombinant microbial and mammalian cells.  As biological manufacturing technology matures from early fed-batch cultures to continuous manufacturing due to increasing market size and more consistent product quality-by-design considerations, these novel compact settlers will enable more efficient production of many therapeutic biologics in large scale high cell density perfusion bioreactors and contribute to a significant reduction in cost of their manufacturing from recombinant mammalian and microbial cell cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel method of scaling up the proven inclined settler technology, which has been scaled up rectilinearly in the past as lamellar settlers.  While the lamellar settlers have been used successfully to manufacture therapeutic biologics secreted by recombinant mammalian cells in high cell density perfusion bioreactors, they have not yet been adapted for microbial cell cultures. The research objectives of this proposal are to develop more compact and efficient settlers for recombinant yeast cells and characterize the capability of these settlers to remove dead cells selectively in the harvest and recycle the live and productive cells back to the bioreactors. Initial results from the first prototype demonstrate selective removal of the smaller yeast cells, while most of the larger cells are concentrated and recycled back to the bioreactor.  Lower cell concentrations and smaller size distributions of the yeast cells leaving in the harvest stream from these compact settlers compared to the those in bioreactors will be measured in steady state continuous cultures and dramatically increasing cell density in the perfusion bioreactor due to the complete recycle of live and productive cells to bioreactor will be characterized for different perfusion harvest rates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The SBIR Phase I project has successfully demonstrated that inclined settler technology can be scaled up in a compact cylindrical and conical geometry with a smaller footprint (than the previous rectilinear scale up design) to acheive for the first time a very high cell density of microbial yeast cells in a 5-liter continuous perfusion bioreactor operated for about a month.  Previously these inclined settlers, which we have demonstrated for the first time to achieve selective cell removal of dead cells and cell debris and complete recylce of live and productive mammalian cells back to the perfusion bioreactor culture,  have been scaled up by others in a lamellar or multi-plate rectilinear design and used in commercial scale production of therapeutic biologics by several biotechnology manufacturers.  However, since our first publication on this technology in 1990 for mammalian cells, with previous funding from NSF Presidential Young Investigator award, no one has demonstrated for any smaller and more challenging cells.    As microbial yeast cells have now become well-developed for secreted overexpression of therapeutic biologics, we have tried applying the lamellar settlers for continuous perfusion bioreactor cultures of yeast Pichia pastoris cells and found that this scale up is very inefficient in achieveing selective cell retention at high enough harvest flow rates.  Therefore, we have developed novel more efficient scale up desgins for more efficient separation of yeast cells with a smaller footprint and applied for funding from NSF SBIR program to demonstrate its capability for the smaller more challenging yeast cells.  After receiving this Phase I SBIR funding, we have successfully demonstrated in a series of month-long continuous perfusion bioreactor experiments that very high cell densities (800 - 1,000 OD600) are quickly acheived within a few days of perfusion operation and maintained at that high celldensities for about 1000 hours or longer.  We have improved our prototype designs and gradually increased the maximum perfusion or harvest flow rate from the top outlet of our novel compact cell settler to over 5 liters/day from a 5-liter bioreactor and still maintained the high cell density for over 2000 hours in our latest perfusion bioreactor experiment.  We expect these impressive results will be more easily duplicated for the larger mammalian cells, which will required a much smaller settler for the selective retention of live cells and continuous removal of dead cells and cell debris.
