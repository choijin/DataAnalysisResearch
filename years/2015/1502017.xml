<AbstractNarration>Large rivers are important for regional economies and global ecosystems. Dam construction is perhaps the most obvious human modifier of riverine ecosystems and hydrology, altering not only the physical environment but also biodiversity within the watershed. Well-functioning foodwebs are fundamental for sustaining rivers. Understanding riverine foodwebs is essential in planning for wildlife conservation, environmental protection, and floodplain management.  Results of this project will serve as a model of historical analyses of foodwebs and the long-term implications of river engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How has river engineering over the past hundred years altered food web structure in the Mississippi and Ohio rivers? Documenting long-term changes in aquatic ecosystems is notoriously difficult. In this proposal, we will use an innovative, new, chemical analysis technique on the tissues of museum fish specimens collected over the last century, thereby providing a more accurate and precise measurement of food webs than ever before possible. From this, we will determine what changes over time and possible shifts in food webs have occurred in response to river engineering in the Mississippi and Ohio rivers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rachel E. Bowes has completed and defended her dissertation "Temporal Analysis of River Food Webs" in 2016, supported by the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant. Rachel Bowes also recieved the outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award from the University of Kansas in 2017 as a direct result of this funding.  Intellectual Merit:  The new techniques developed and improved in this funded project can be extended to all areas of ecological research. Through this project, not only have we shown the validity of compound specific stable isotope analyses in assessing the food web structure of an ecosystem, but we also developed multidimensional metrics that can be utilized by researchers across the field of ecology with any type of multidimensional data they are using. Furthermore, the new technique/technology of compound specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids used in this project requires fewer samples to be taken in order to accurately and precisely assess river health and food web structure (a main indication of river health).  Broader Impacts:  This project has specifically provided professional development and training for 3 undergraduates at the University of Kansas through direct one-on-one mentorship. Furthermore, this project has provided science outreach to K-12 students and the dissemination of project results and implications to policy makers and public.  Outcomes:  From the compound specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids, we determined that there were shifts in different species? usage of food sources over time in the two rivers (Mississippi and Ohio rivers) over the past 100 years. Overall, the main source of carbon driving the two rivers food webs is algae. There have been a number of significant achievements and outcomes from this funded project. Specifically, there have been 2 open-access publications, there is 1 publication in review, and 3 publications currently in preparation.
