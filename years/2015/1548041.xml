<AbstractNarration>The MSPinNYC2 project builds on a previous MSP-Targeted Partnership project (DUE-0412413, called the MSPinNYC), with new partners joining most of the original partners, to extend and deepen a promising program called the Peer Enabled Restructured Classroom (PERC), which was piloted during the earlier work. Core partners in the MSPinNYC2 partnership include Hunter College of the City University of New York (CUNY) as lead, the Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan and Bronx High School Districts of the New York City Department of Education, and three other colleges in the CUNY system: York College, New York City College of Technology, and The Graduate Center. Additional partners include the College Now program at CUNY, the CUNY School Support Organization, and New Visions for Public Schools. The PERC program restructures 9th grade STEM courses to have 7 or 8 Teaching Assistant Scholars facilitate group work on a daily basis. TA Scholars are average-achieving, i.e., not honors, 10th graders who passed the course and the associated required state exit examination during the previous year and are concurrently trained in a TA Scholar course led by the same teacher as the 9th grade class. Pilot studies with PERC during the MSPinNYC project suggested that the program reduces failure rates, closes achievement gaps, and improves graduation rates. Based on lessons learned in the pilot studies with 9th and 10th grades in high schools in Manhattan and the Bronx, the MSPinNYC2 partnership is implementing PERC in nine high schools in Brooklyn and Queens, while expanding the program within three schools in Manhattan and the Bronx to incorporate all of grades 9-12 mathematics and science. A TA Scholar-to-College Pipeline supports TA Scholars throughout high school and prepares them for success in college. Students from PERC schools in all four boroughs who enter CUNY colleges are being mentored during the college freshman year, while STEM faculty and graduate students at the participating CUNY colleges are being supported to incorporate more student-centered pedagogies into freshman year STEM courses. PERC experiences are also being integrated into teacher education programs at the CUNY colleges. The research plan includes studying how PERC serves as a catalyst for school renewal, how the depth and sustainability of PERC implementation support scaling the innovation, how participation by teachers in PERC effects deep change within their practice, and how and why PERC experiences, as well as other forms of student support, lead to improved academic outcomes for students. The evaluation examines the fidelity of implementation and quality of the project's major components to provide formative evaluation, while the summative evaluation focuses primarily on assessing student achievement outcomes, their long-term academic success, and the overall diffusion of PERC into the secondary and post-secondary settings involved in the partnership.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In 2011, three CUNY schools (Hunter College, York College, and NYC College of Technology) and the NYC DOE were awarded a Math Science Partnership to develop the Peer Enabled Restructured Classroom (PERC) model for NYC science and math secondary school classrooms. Elements of PERC had been shown to support student success in low-income, low-performing schools that served mostly minority students within NYC?s highly segregated, public school system.&nbsp; Motivated by student voices, success of prior work, and the research literature, the project leadership team (a partnership of CUNY education and science faculty and NYC school leaders) sought to significantly enhance student performance and improve school culture by addressing two overarching needs highlighted by students and teachers: more teachers in the classroom and greater student engagement. The only ongoing, affordable, and transformative approach to achieve both comes from the school communities themselves, particularly the teachers <em>and</em> students. PERC aimed to transform learning in STEM classrooms through the use of peer leaders present in the class every day acting as teaching assistants to build teaching power and increase student engagement.</p> <p>The impacts on learning when students are empowered to be teachers and explainers has a robust literature. The enhanced learning of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">peer leaders</span> as well as their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tutees</span> has been well documented. But who can be effective peer leaders? How do teachers restructure their classrooms to include peer leaders? <em>This project tested the hypothesis that students themselves in low performing NYC public schools could serve as peer teachers and leaders in science and math classrooms, that teachers could empower these students, and that through this process, teachers and students would change the culture of the schools.</em></p> <p>This highly ambitious goal required several proofs of concepts that were addressed and achieved in the early years of the project and constitute the <strong>intellectual merit</strong>: that middle performing students in low performing schools <em>can and are excited to become</em> teachers and leaders; that teaching is a powerful act for learning and thus test scores used for graduation or college readiness can be dramatically improved; that a curriculum can be developed to teach students to teach; that schools can reorganize their curricula to integrate peer teaching and learning; that peer leadership must be integrated <em>daily and deeply</em>; and that teachers must and can develop beliefs that all students can both teach and learn.</p> <p>Over the first five years of the project, 12 schools, 4600 students, and 100 teachers participated in the development of a mature PERC model. &nbsp;In the last two years of the no-cost extension, PERC was integrated into CUNY?s K-16 unit (figure 1), and an additional 4 schools, 3,000 students and 30 teachers participated. PERC is now one of the programs offered to NYC DOE Schools supported by CUNY.</p> <p>The PERC model uses a student-centered classroom approach in which Teaching Assistant Scholars (TAS), guided by their teacher, facilitate learning in small groups. The TAS are secondary students typically no more than one grade level ahead of the students enrolled in the PERC classes. Eligibility for a TAS position requires students to have simply passed the course requirements in which they will assist. <em>This is a minimal competency bar that enables schools to identify a significant cadre of students who have passed their courses but have not yet met college-ready metrics. </em>To complement and strengthen their work as teaching assistants, the TAS take classes taught by the PERC teacher (referred to as TAS classes that were developed, tested and refined over the course of the project) designed to deepen their knowledge of content, pedagogy, metacognitive, and communication skills. In recent years, PERC has become a fully integrated model that ensures students develop the college and career readiness skills necessary to be successful in the workforce and as life-long learners.</p> <p>Teacher practice is transformed by PERC. With the additional teaching support, teachers are able to more effectively differentiate instruction, increase positive classroom behaviors, operate a student-centered classroom, and continue to deepen their teaching practice by supporting the pedagogical skill development of others. PERC asks students and teachers to go beyond the content, recognizing that the transmission of information alone is insufficient for developing true scholars.&nbsp; PERC develops thinkers.</p> <p>Research on PERC impacts (see Figs.2-4) conducted by both the evaluation and research teams demonstrated numerous parameters of growth among TAS and PERC students.
