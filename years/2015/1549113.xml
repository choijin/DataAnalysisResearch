<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the significant performance improvement in hospitals, a potential to increase case load, and reduce lag time for patients to get surgery, and a reduction of associated costs without compromising on quality of care. This will lead to an overall reduction of hospital costs, and thus healthcare insurance costs, contributing to the achievement of goals set forth in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.  Hospitals have been making large investments recently in upgrading their Information Technology systems and implementing EHR (electronic health records) information systems, thereby leading to data collection on an unprecedented scale. Our project will leverage this massive collection and enable transformation of hospital processes, thereby leading to generation of value for the large investments in EHR systems being made. Everyone will be better off: Patients will have better care at lower costs, Insurers will lower costs, Hospitals can see lower costs and higher revenue, and last but not the least, it will reduce cognitive overload on the clinical and non-clinical staff thereby leading to better patient care and greater job satisfaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will research methods to improve scheduling of surgeries in hospitals. The goals include more efficient utilization of expensive resources such as operating rooms, surgeon and nursing staff time by reducing operating room idleness, delays and overtime costs. The project will develop: (i) A number of algorithms for advance scheduling, online scheduling, and real-time scheduling; (ii) Predictors that will combine surgeon estimates and data via online learning; (iii) A suite of algorithms for deep analytics of fine-grained EHR data and other hospital information systems, identify bottlenecks and provide real-time situational awareness; (iv) A visualization tool that will enable staff to input real-time information, quickly understand schedules and make manual changes when necessary; (v) A communication tool that will enable real-time communication between hospital staff, and with the patient and their families. Some progress on these objectives has already been made and our back-testing on existing datasets from four hospitals suggests scope for significant performance gains. A deployment of the system developed for a pilot study is planned.  We will follow up on this project by also investigating scheduling in the radiology department, out-patient department and cancer infusion and other clinical centers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Vivace Systems completed the technical milestones set forth in the project proposal funded by the NSF Small Business Innovation Research grant. The company has also started to gain traction through demonstration of our technologies to hospitals in the US. Specifically, the following funding-related objectives were achieved during the period of the grant.  Improved resource use duration prediction   Design and development of a resource use duration predictor that substantially increased accuracy over existing state-of-the-art techniques used in hospitals was completed. We tested this predictor on retrospective data at several major hospitals in California and demonstrated significant improvements over current methods consistently. We are now in discussions to conduct field trials of the technology.   Better scheduling methodology   Further refinement and implementation of our proprietary scheduling algorithms was conducted. Our techniques now generate optimized daily schedules in presence of contingencies and multiple priority classes. This has allowed us to provide support for emergency cases and urgent cases while reducing the disruption caused to the schedule by current methods. By generating schedules optimized for the hospital?s priorities, we have been able to proactively improve the hospital?s operations.  Deep-dive analytics of operational data   We completed design and implementation of deep-dive analytics that make it easy for hospitals to track day-to-day operational performance. Machine learning algorithms have been implemented to make the task of hospital managers easier.  HIPAA-compliant implementation   All of the above technologies have been implemented in a cloud-based system with a web-based portal, and a secure HIPAA-compliant database system and data pipeline.
