<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to scale up the production of low-cost, low-energy novel materials to allow more water recycling and reuse, preserving this precious resource for society. The aims of the project are to increase scientific and technological understanding of advanced material design with a detailed knowledge of biodegradation to specifically and efficiently remove problem chemicals from water systems. In some cases, the water may be made suitable for municipal use. In other cases, water may be restored to a level such that it can be used for agriculture or industrial processing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives of this Phase I research project are to design, construct and test encapsulated microbial materials that are targeted toward eliminating hard-to-remove or acutely hazardous chemicals from waters, so as to allow their reuse. The encapsulating material of silica is generally regarded as safe (GRAS), is inexpensive, and flexible. The materials are combined with specific microbial biocatalysts that are demonstrated to have broad biodegradation activities against a range of chemicals within specific chemical classes. One such class are the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and related aromatic ring chemicals that include demonstrated toxins, carcinogens and endocrine disruptors. The technology to be developed, unlike some existing technologies currently in use, will seek to completely destroy the compounds of concern such that no waste material need to further treated or disposed of. Moreover, the specificity of the biocatalysts can be used to, in some cases, selectively remove chemicals of concern while completely retaining other chemicals that may be needed for the further utility of the water.  Overall, the present project seeks to expand the use of biocatalysts and advanced materials to selectively and completely remove chemicals from water, thus minimizing cost and maximizing conservation and use of water resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bioremediation of Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons from Wastewaters  Access to clean water is a basic right as it has a direct impact on the health and safety of the general population and the environment. In simplest terms, the goal of this project was to develop a novel, commercially feasible way of reclaiming water using enzymatic removal of specific contaminants.  As water shortages become more commonplace, reusing waste waters and "produced waters" (e.g. waters returned from wells during the extraction of oil or natural gas via hydraulic fracturing) becomes more necessary. The focus of this proposal was to develop improved methods for treating contaminated waters that derive from many uses; including recreation, energy production, refining, and energy distribution, with specific emphasis on removal of low concentrations of hydrocarbons from produced waters.  The contaminants in produced waters that are often the most abundant and most difficult to remove are dissolved and suspended hydrocarbons. These may be present at concentrations ranging from 30-4000 ppm, requiring as many as three stages of physical and chemical treatment to achieve adequate removal. Many industries are facing the high cost of removing trace hydrocarbons and non-hydrocarbon contaminants present in produced water, the increasing need to re-use produced water, and developing a response to  impending regulatory changes. In this context, it is being projected that the real growth opportunities in handling produced water are in the tertiary treatment portion of the produced water value chain.  This Phase I project was successful in achieving the specific objectives and proving technical feasibility for the overall concept of using encapsulated cells to remove contaminants from  waste streams such as produced waters contaminated with hydrocarbons.  While the work encountered some unforeseen technical challenges, this lead to the discovery of a simpler and potentially more effective delivery mechanism to remove not only polyaromatic hydrocarbons, but many other potential contaminants from waste streams.  From a business perspective, the core technologies, modified with a potential new delivery system, open more immediate commercialization opportunities in areas with broad positive impact on both human health and safety and protection of the environment.  One early example and a potential immediate application is the removal of cyanuric acid from recreational waters to improve public health and safety. To protect swimmers? health in residential and community recreational pools, chlorinated cyanuric acid is commonly added to pool water as a disinfectant. The cyanuric acid moiety establishes an equilibrium of bound vs free chlorine that prolongs the functional disinfecting life of the chlorine.  However, over time, continued addition of chlorinated cyanuric acid leads to elevated cyanuric acid levels in the pool, directly affecting public health by decreasing disinfection activity of chlorine.
