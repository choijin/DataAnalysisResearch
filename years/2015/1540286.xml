<AbstractNarration>Markov chains play an important role in a variety of fields, but the analysis of their convergence properties remains a challenging problem. The emphasis of this workshop is on the analysis of "large" Markov chains, i.e., finite-state chains where the number of states is exponentially large as a function of the description size of an individual state. Such chains are especially important in the study of statistical physics models and the design of approximate counting algorithms. The workshop will bring together researchers in the analysis of large Markov chains from many areas of application, to review progress and to identify challenges for future research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently there has been considerable success in designing approximate counting algorithms without the use of Markov chains, relying instead on so-called "spatial mixing" properties. Remarkably, matching hardness results have been established in the special case of antiferromagnetic 2-spin systems. This beautiful collection of results ties together the complexity of approximate counting on a general class of graphs with an associated phase transition for the infinite regular tree. By highlighting recent results in the study of approximate counting problems, the workshop will explore analogous connections for other models and for related problems.  Video tapes of presentations and discussions will be distributed to the public.  Students will be encouraged to participate in this interdisciplinary area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The first workshop of the Simons Institute Spring 2016 program on Counting Complexity and Phase Transitions, entitled "Approximate Counting, Markov Chains and Phase Transitions" and co-organized by Martin Dyer, Catherine Greenhill, Allan Sly, and Eric Vigoda, took place the week of 22nd &ndash; 26th February 2016.  The workshop focused on phase transitions and their connection to the computational complexity of approximate counting problems and to the convergence rate of Markov chains.   The study of phase transitions is a central goal in the field of statistical physics.  A phase transition in a physical system is said to occur when a small change in a parameter controlling the microscopic interactions of the system, such as temperature, causes a dramatic change in the macroscopic properties of the system, for example, a liquid as it passes its freezing or melting point.  In statistical physics, idealized models of physical systems are studied in order to better understand the properties of phase transitions in a simplified setting.    There has been much recent work that ties together statistical physics phase transitions to the computational complexity of approximate counting problems and also to the performance of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.  One of the main themes at this workshop was elucidating known connections between these topics and discussing possible new relationships.  The workshop brought together leading researchers from statistical physics, discrete mathematics, and theoretical computer science, and one of the aims was to explore connections between these fields.  There were many talks exploring connections between algorithm performance and phase transitions in different contexts.   Leslie Ann Goldberg (Oxford) and Andreas Galanis (Oxford) discussed new connections for approximate counting problems on hypergraphs.  Antonio Blanca (Berkeley), Eyal Lubetzky (NYU), and Daniel Stefankovic (Rochester) presented results connecting phase transitions with the rate of convergence for MCMC algorithms on spin systems such as the Ising and Potts models, which are classical models in statistical physics.  Alexandre Stauffer (Bath), Fabio Martinelli (Roma Tre), and Dana Randall (Georgia Tech) described new connections in the context of random triangulations.  Much of the discussion in the breaks involved formulating possible connections between the different fields.  There were several talks presenting new approaches to analyzing phase transitions in various models, including Cris Moore (Santa Fe) for a continuous-space gas model, and Will Perkins (Birmingham) for the discrete-space gas model known as the hard-core lattice gas.  Exciting new results analyzing random walks on random graphs were presented by Yuval Peres (Microsoft) and Justin Salez (Universit&eacute; de Paris).  There was much discussion surrounding various models of card shuffling after the talk by Persi Diaconis (Stanford), who presented intriguing questions concerning shuffling problems that arose in his work with casinos.   Wednesday afternoon centered around an open problem session moderated by Prasad Tetali (Georgia Tech).  Nine researchers presented a collection of open problems.  Three senior PhD students, Antonio Blanca (Berkeley), Sarah Cannon (Georgia Tech), and Yumeng Zhang (Berkeley), typed up notes from the session; these notes are now available on the workshop webpage.  Significant discussion then focused on various approaches for tacking these open problems.  The organizers look forward to the outcome of these discussions in the coming years.
