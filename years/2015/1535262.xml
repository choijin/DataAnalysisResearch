<AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to understand expert secondary mathematics teachers' knowledge for teaching exponential functions. In particular, the study examines how mathematics knowledge for teaching is used by teachers as they are teaching students' and the factors that influence their interactions with students. The project is recruiting teachers in order to observe their teaching of exponential functions units in Algebra II, Pre-Calculus, and College Algebra courses in high schools. They will conduct classroom observations throughout the teaching of the unit and conduct interviews with the teachers before and after each unit. The project builds on other frameworks for understanding mathematics knowledge for teaching. Other studies have focused more frequently on elementary or middle school teachers. The contribution of this work is to understand the mathematics content teachers are using in high school in their work with students. Exponential functions are a common topic in the three high school courses and a foundational topic for students' learning of algebra and calculus. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research questions for the study focus on the decisions expert teachers draw on while making decisions related to teaching exponential functions, the mathematics knowledge for teaching they use to make decision, and the factors that influence the quality of those decisions and students' opportunity to reason mathematically. They are recruiting expert teachers who have taught the courses for at least two years and are recognized as high quality teachers. The data collected include video data from classroom observations and pre-observation and post-observation interviews. The questions to be asked in interviews focus on teachers' decision-making and will probe for their mathematics knowledge for teaching. Mathematics knowledge for teaching includes how teachers' knowledge that supports their planning, instruction, and assessment of students' mathematical reasoning. The study also provides a research methodology that could be used to study mathematics knowledge for teaching in other secondary mathematics topics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project Initiating a Foundational Research Model for Secondary Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (INFORMS MKT) aims to understand how expert teachers use their mathematical knowledge in their planning, instruction, and assessment practices. In particular, it seeks answers research questions   (nature) What is the MKT these teachers draw on while making these decisions? (enactment) What are the decisions expert teachers make while engaged in the work of teaching exponential functions that involve MKT? (mediation) What factors mediate the use of teachers’ MKT in their decision making? (quality) What is the quality of these teachers’ decisions with respect to students’ opportunity to reason mathematically and how is this quality related to the types of decisions they make, the nature of their MKT, the factors that mediate the decisions?   Significant results of the project include: novel research design, analytical methodology, and tools for studying the enactment of teachers’ MKT, explanatory models of significant variation in expert teachers’ enactment of mathematical knowledge, and a theoretical framework of MKT and its relation to components of teacher affect.   Research methodology  INFORMS MKT developed novel data collection and analysis protocols to observe and characterize expert teachers' enactment of their mathematical knowledge and the factors that mediate that enactment. Identification of expert teachers, as recognized by administrators, regional and state education agency staff, and peer teachers reduced bias toward researcher assumptions about effective teaching. Focusing observations around instruction on a single topic, exponential functions, positioned the researchers to identify mathematical similarities and differences across teachers and connect their analysis to a detailed conceptual framework on the subject. Project interview protocols evolved to reflect increasingly revealing prompts, reflection activities, and mathematical interpretations, and an extensive conceptual analysis of exponential function tasks and curricula enabled the researchers to map the conceptual and procedural knowledge of teachers focusing on the topic and the resulting shifts in their students' understanding. The research team developed and refined an analytic technique, or "reduction analysis," to generate models of teachers’ enactment of MKT. The model-building and reduction analysis represent new techniques that can be used in other research projects to focus on critical factors that mediate teachers’ enactment of MKT and the relationship between components of teachers’ affect and the content-based knowledge they enact while teaching.   Models of expert teachers' enactment of mathematical knowledge  INFORMS MKT developed models of the nature of each participating teacher’s MKT, the factors that mediated its enactment, and its relation to the instructional decisions each teacher made. For example, one teacher operated with an encompassing view of mathematics as a collection of tools for framing and exploring complex problems and an implicit learning theory of learning-by-doing, that then necessitated instruction by modeling inquiry, reinforcing these tools and facilitating meaningful problem-solving, struggle, learning from errors, and communication. Another teacher held a deep commitment to eliciting detailed student thinking and making all students' contributions explicit, valued, and included in the classroom conversation, all acheived through an extensive knowledge of reform-based instructional strategies. In-depth analyses of each teachers' planning, classroom activity, assessment, and reflection resulted in detailing these models across a variety of situations and establishes the extent and prominence of their entailments in influencing the teachers' classroom decisions.  Cross-teacher analyses reveal striking differences in the opportunities for students to learn despite numerous surface-level similarities. On one hand, these expert teachers differed little in the mathematical knowledge they leveraged, questions posed or meanings expressed during class, concepts and skills assessed, and pedagogical strategies. Their underlying beliefs and values, however, often led to subtle but continuous differences in the ways they enacted these goals and strategies in reaction to real-time classroom demands. The results accumulated to strikingly different opportunities for students to learn the material and promoted different dispositions among the students as learners. These results reveal a vast array of interrelated affective characteristics that mediate teachers’ enactment of their MKT that may inform teacher educators in support pre-service and in-service teachers development of cognitive and affective structures necessary for effective implementation of instructional strategies.  Theoretical framework of the enactment of MKT  INFORMS MKT has developed a theoretical framework for the cognitive and affective influences that mediate the enactment teachers’ MKT. This framework specifies the relationships between teachers’ learning theories, construction and appraisal of environmental factors, belief systems, values, emotions, goal structures, and professional identities. Teachers' mathematical knowledge is enacted in the service of informing goal-directed actions, constrained to the meanings, sensibilities, and ways of reasoning required to inform the actions they expect to advance specific goals. These goals are themselves cognitive constructions situated within an organic structure, defined in consonance with the teachers’ belief systems, epistemology, and identity, reflective of the structure of their mathematical knowledge, and responsive to their evolving construction and appraisal of their environment.
