<AbstractNarration>1336911 (Abdul-Aziz).  The objectives of this research are to (i) investigate and unravel similitudes (parametric reductions), spatiotemporal scaling patterns, and different environmental regimes of wetland greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon sequestrations; and (ii) formulate spatiotemporally robust models for predicting wetland GHG emissions and carbon sequestration across different climatic, hydrologic, biological, ecological, and biogeochemical gradients. A fundamental hypothesis of wetland GHG emissions and carbon sequestration following distinct biogeochemical similitudes and robust scaling relationships will be tested by conducting dimensional analysis and empirical modeling, which has successfully been applied in fluid mechanics, hydraulic engineering, and stream biogeochemistry/ecology. Robustness of the scaling relationships will first be determined by deriving analytical, truly dynamic sensitivity coefficients and uncertainty measures and quantifying them with field data. Scaling robustness will also be evaluated by comparing scaling parameters (coefficients and exponents) estimated with data from different seasons and locations representing a gradient of hydro-climatic, biogeochemical, and ecological processes. This research primarily leverages the PI's field data collections for major wetland GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) and environmental parameters, model developments, and knowledge formation underway in a collaborative project funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It also utilizes wetland biogeochemistry and GHG flux data collected by other collaborators through chamber-based field campaigns across the U.S. East Coast. The research targets to generate a fundamental body of knowledge and insights into the wetland biogeochemical emergence (similarity) patterns, identifying different environmental regimes and associated transition thresholds of GHG emissions and carbon sequestrations. Modeling of wetland GHG emissions has been an extremely challenging undertaking. Available models are mostly mechanistic and site-specific in nature, often failing to provide predictions that are relatively robust in time and space. To address this challenge, wetland biogeochemical similitudes and scaling laws will be investigated by employing analytical and empirical methods successfully applied in other branches of earth sciences and engineering. Improved understanding of similitudes and scaling is expected to lead to robust, parsimonious modeling and predictions of GHG emissions and carbon sequestration from diverse wetland ecosystems under a changing climate, sea level, and land use. The research on biogeochemical similitudes and scaling is anticipated to provide new insights into overall ecosystem carbon dynamics. The idea is potentially applicable to identify, understand, and predict robust patterns of carbon sequestration and GHG emissions from the terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The research should aid carbon management in wetland ecosystems around the world by unraveling fundamental scientific information and providing scale-independent engineering tools. Research outcomes will be broadly disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, presentations, workshops, reports, public meetings, open media (e.g., YouTube); and transferred to the coastal decision makers by leveraging the PI's current NOAA collaborative project-team of wetland scientists, engineers, economists, reserve managers, stakeholders, and NGOs. The research findings will be incorporated into education by designing inductive learning-based graduate and undergraduate courses at FIU (a large minority institution with around 59% Hispanic/Latino and 13% African-American students) and involving high school teachers and students. The research provides complementary funding for a current doctoral student at FIU and a potential undergraduate summer intern from the minority students.</AbstractNarration>

Wetland biogeochemical-ecological similitude (similarity) was discovered through a novel and transformative application of methods used in the field of hydraulic engineering and fluid mechanics. Two generalized process diagrams of wetland CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes were developed based on a small set of environmental drivers such as sunlight, soil temperature, pore-water salinity, and atmospheric pressure. Power-law based scaling relationships were developed between the wetland GHG fluxes and the environmental drivers by using data from Waquoit Bay, MA. The estimated scaling relationships were leveraged to develop robust (generalized) models to predict wetland GHG fluxes across different process regimes based on a small set of environmental variables (sunlight, soil temperature, pore-water salinity). The models were coded to develop an Excel-based user-friendly modeling software to predict the GHG fluxes and carbon storage of coastal wetlands, considering Waquoit Bay as a case study. The first of its kind, mechanistically informed, predictive modeling tool is applicable to similar environmental regimes in New England and beyond. The software is open-access and available at <a href="http://www.waquoitbayreserve.org/research-monitoring/salt-marsh-carbon-project/">http://www.waquoitbayreserve.org/research-monitoring/salt-marsh-carbon-project/</a>. The research further identified the wetland biological-environmental similitude, and estimated scaling laws to predict wetland GHG fluxes from a small set of biological and environmental drivers (e.g., plant biomass, height, stem density, light, soil temperature, pore-water salinity).</p> <p>An alternative scaling and similarity based harmonic model was also developed for wetland and forest ecosystems to accurately predict the hourly time-series of wetland CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes for any desired days and years. The wetland version of the harmonic model is represented in a user-friendly Excel spreadsheet named &ldquo;Florida Everglades NEE Model&rdquo;, which will be made available online in the near future.</p> <p>The developed, two Excel-based modeling software are intended to be used as the ecological engineering tools to formulate appropriate GHG offset protocols under a changing climate, environment and sea level. The tools would reduce the cost of wetland monitoring projects by estimating and predicting the greenhouse gas fluxes based on a few observation of the fluxes themselves or a small set of environmental drivers. Coastal stakeholders, land/reserve managers, restoration practitioners and agencies (e.g., city, county, state, NGOs), policymakers, and educators are the direct beneficiaries and users of the developed, user-friendly modeling tools.</p> <p>The project significantly contributed to the development of human resources. One Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering (CEE) doctoral student from the minority groups worked for the project since the inception (Fall 2013). The student graduated from Florida International University (FIU) in Fall 2015 with a dissertation entitled, &ldquo;<em>Robust Modeling and Predictions of Greenhouse Gas Fluxes from Forest and Wetland Ecosystems</em>&rdquo;. He was trained and professionally developed with an ecological engineering expertise &mdash; specializing on wetland and terrestrial biogeochemistry, GHG fluxes, empirical and data-driven modeling, and scaling. Additionally, a minority, female doctoral student of CEE worked for this project during 2015-2016. She was trained on wetland biogeochemical processes and GHG fluxes, data-analytics, and modeling. Further, nine minority undergraduate students worked for the project during 2013-16. They were trained in data preparation and analysis, computer programming, and GHG processes.</p> <p>Research findings and Excel software tools were shared with the junior/senior high school students and teachers in Miami, FL and Waquoit Bay, MA. Further, hands-on training on ecological GHGs fluxes and data-driven modeling was provided to 6-8<sup>th</sup> grade students and teachers of the Miami PREP STEM summer camp, which is well-known to serve economically disadvantaged and underrepresented minority groups.</p> <p>Research findings and products were communicated to the coastal stakeholders, managers, NGOs, end-users and general public through various avenues, including project-specific workshops and conferences. The project resulted in 1 doctoral dissertation, 10 conference presentations (3 invited: 1 plenary), 2 invited talks (1 to the U.S. Geological Survey), 2 published journal papers, 4 additional journal manuscripts, 6 working papers, and 3 convened/chaired sessions in American Geophysical Union&rsquo;s Fall Meetings of 2014 and 2015. Course materials were developed based on the research outcomes, and have been taught through an inductive learning course (developed by the PI, Dr. Abdul-Aziz), &ldquo;Ecological Engineering&rdquo; since 2015. Videos of the PI demonstrating the model developments and applications were posted on YouTube (e.g., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffr4qlYdxTw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffr4qlYdxTw</a>) for a broader dissemination of the research outcomes at the global scale.</p> <p>In summary, the research findings have led to a deeper and a broader understanding of wetland GHG fluxes and carbon dynamics, and will help develop appropriate protocols for the management of wetland carbon under different climate, sea level, and land use scenarios. Therefore, the research outcomes contribute to the adaptation with and mitigation of global warming, and promote <em>Environmental Sustainability</em>. Furthermore, the project trained two minority Ph.D. students (one female), 9 minority undergraduates, and many graduate students &mdash; contributing to the professional developments of
