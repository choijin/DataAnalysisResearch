<AbstractNarration>Ceramic nanomaterials have the potential to revolutionize energy storage because of their unique combination of geometry and chemical nature. By assembling oxide nanosheets into porous, sponge-like structures, we may build battery or capacitor electrodes applicable for commercialization. A clear advantage of the materials of interest is their low cost and broad availability. Further, by using different processing methods the final 3-D sponge structures might be optimized for specific applications. By using earth-abundant materials and traditional ceramic and chemical processing techniques, these nanostructures can be made at reasonable cost and with high reliability. Additional research into the structure and energy storage of these ceramic nanomaterials will take place in Japan?s science city, Tsukuba. Under the direction of Dr. Takayoshi Sasaki, the leader of the Soft Chemistry group at the National Institute for Materials Science, the new research will focus on new and improved processing approaches to optimize the nanostructures to achieve breakthrough charge storage capacity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanosheets derived from layered oxide materials, such as MnO2 and V2O5, are of interest due to their high surface area and variable chemistry.  By a unique flocculation method, these nanosheets can be self-assembled into porous 3-D macrostructures with surface areas exceeding 100 square meters per gram. The process involves oxide synthesis using a solid state process, followed by ion exchange and exfoliation. Thus far, it has been shown that colloidal nanosheet suspensions can be flocculated via coprecipitation with other nanosheet suspensions and controlling the suspension ionic strength. With their porous morphology and large accessible surface area, electrodes formed from these macrostructures may approach theoretical capacitance values. The proposed work will focus on developing the processing science needed to control the oxide nanostructures, focusing on the self-assembly of nanosheets. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
