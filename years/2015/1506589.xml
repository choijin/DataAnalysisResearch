<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical: Cellulose is the most abundant renewable polymeric natural resource on our planet.  For many years cellulose has been chemically modified to make it water-soluble or at least water-dispersible, enabling solution processing of cellulose.  However, the modifications are expensive and inhibit the crystallization of cellulose that imparts final mechanical properties.  Ionic liquids are nonvolatile solvents and recently, certain ionic liquids have been found to dissolve native cellulose.  There is a large inductrial research effort aimed at fiber spinning and other solution processing operations on unmodified cellulose with companies developing large patent portfolios on cellulose/ionic liquid solutions.  In support of such technologies, a fundamental study of the flow properties of cellulose solutions in ionic liquids is planned.  Since there are several unusual aspects of cellulose/ionic liquid rheology, including a seemingly large effect of trace amounts of water, this research may be transformative and enabling.  This study will provide a basis for understanding the rheology of native cellulose, enabling it to be processed in ionic liquid solutions.  This green processing scheme allows cellulose to be processed without chemical modification, which is already known to produce fibers with superior mechanical properties, and ionic liquids are nonvolatile and routinely water-extracted from the cellulose to be &gt;99% recovered without use of any volatile organic solvents.  Consequently, ionic liquid solutions may provide a viable pathway to high modulus polymer products from renewable resources that are non-petroleum based.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:  At a given concentration, ionic liquid solutions have higher viscosity than aqueous solutions and are slightly more elastic (longer relaxation time); both are advantageous for stability of coating and fiber spinning operations.  The planned rheology experiments will thoroughly characterize the viscoelastic response of cellulose in three ionic liquids (one that appears to be a theta-solvent and another that preliminary data suggests to be a good solvent) over wide ranges of temperature and concentration.  While the concentration dependences of viscosity, relaxation time and terminal modulus of dry cellulose/ionic liquid solutions in linear response have the expected scalings, the linear viscoelasticity is quite sensitive to small quantities of water.  Additionally, unexpected results are observed in stronger shear flows relevant to coating, fiber spinning and other solution processing; the shear viscosity is significantly larger than the linear viscosity from oscillatory shear, whereas conventional polymer solutions either show the two to be identical or find the shear viscosity is lower from chain alignment in shear.  This will be explored in detail using X-ray scattering in shear flow to detect alignment of cellulose chains.  The PI and his team will also begin to explore the solution rheology of other polysaccharides (chitin/chitosan, the second-most abundant polymeric natural resource on the planet) in ionic liquids.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cellulose is the most abundant polymer natural resource on Earth, produced naturally at a staggering rate of 1011 Tons/year.  Unfortunately, this polymer cannot be melt processed like conventional synthetic polymers and also is not soluble in any common solvents to allow solution processing.  For many years, humans have chemically modified cellulose to make it soluble for solution processing; a good example is a paper mill.  The chemical treatments are nasty and the chemically modified cellulose never has as good mechanical properties as native cellulose.  For this reason, it is important to develop ways to solution process native cellulose.     In 2002, native cellulose was found to be soluble in certain ionic liquids.  Those solvents are expensive but the fibers spun from native cellulose solutions in ionic liquids have twice the modulus of the fibers spun from chemically modified cellulose, since only native cellulose has all of the inter-polymer interactions that make wood strong.  The ionic liquids are non-volatile and water-soluble so the cellulose / ionic liquid solution is extruded into a water bath; the ionic liquid comes out and the cellulose crystallizes to make a very strong fiber.  The ionic liquid can be fully recovered by simply removing the water.  That makes the native cellulose fiber-spinning process quite ‘green’ with no volatiles other than water introduced to the atmosphere.      Our research studies the flow properties of the native cellulose / ionic liquid solutions.  The viscosity is surprisingly high and we prove that is caused by interactions between the cellulose chains in solution.  We also find that cellulose adsorbs to the air surface of the solution, having a higher concentration at the air surface.  Both observations are unusual for polymer solutions and we strive to understand them to be able to control the viscosity for fiber spinning and other processing operations.     Our research group makes a strong effort to involve undergraduate students in our research.  We strive to get them excited about science and encourage them to attend graduate school.  Two such students that worked on this project are now in Ph.D. programs at Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania.  We also prepare graduate students to become individual contributors in industrial research and development.  Both of these activities help to keep the US workforce educated so that the US can maintain our competitive edge over the rest of the world, and keep our high standard of living.
