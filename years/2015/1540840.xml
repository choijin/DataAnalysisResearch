<AbstractNarration>This Noyce Capacity Building project will strengthen a partnership between the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Milwaukee Public Schools aimed at improving the quality of STEM education in area high needs schools.  The goal of the project is to develop capacity to train Master Teachers in content knowledge propagated in the classroom through action research.  The key feature of the project is a needs assessment that will lead to the design and implementation of a series of micro-credential modules that will cover STEM disciplinary content, leadership, and evidence-based pedagogies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Research has shown that increased insight into disciplinary content and evidence-pedagogies has a positive effect on teacher performance and teacher professional identity, which in turn are directly related to more effective enactment of STEM curricula.   This project builds on that research basis with a micro-credentialing model that will provide participating teachers with opportunities to connect their learning to classroom practice.  The project also addresses a need to enhance Master Teachers' content knowledge in Milwaukee Public Schools, as captured by the secondary student achievement data in mathematics and science.  Evaluation of the grant activities will focus on gaining formative feedback related to implementation and effectiveness of the needs assessment, micro-credentialing modules, and faculty recruitment plans.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Ramping Up to the Milwaukee Master Teacher Partnership project had as its goals to recruit teams of secondary mathematics and science teachers in five to eight schools within Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) for a five-year teacher professional development project.  The anticipated 5-year project would provide math and science teachers the opportunity to conduct action research in their classrooms.  This research would be in areas of their choosing that they wished to learn more about related to math or science content, math or science teaching, or general teaching skills. The research would evaluate the impact of instructional interventions on student learning, and each research project would earn a microcredential, or "badge."  Specifically, the goals of this capacity building project were to 1) conduct a needs assessment with Milwaukee Public Schools high school math and science teachers; 2) design the professional development activities; and 3) recruit teams of teachers.  Regarding goal 1, the project conducted needs assessments in the form of two surveys and a series of focus group discussions.  The two surveys identified aspects of math and science content and pedagogy that teachers would like to learn more about. Focus groups brought small groups of teachers together to discuss challenges and opportunities and what they would like to see in the design of the professional development. Important themes that rose to the surface from the surveys and focus groups were a desire to learn more about modeling, real world applications, additional hands on opportunities for students including labs, geometry and statistics/probability, formative assessments, and action research.   Regarding goal 2, a joint team from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and MPS developed a template for the microcredential badges.  The project forged a partnership with Digital Promise, a leading microcreditial issuer, and developed 11 prototype badges.  Four common badges will be used in the first year of the full project.  Regarding goal 3, the focus groups yielded 28 applications from interested teachers across 9 MPS schools.  25 teachers in 9 schools were selected to begin the program, which was funded by a subsequent grant under the Noyce program.  The group of 25 includes 16 high school science or computer science teachers and 9 high school mathematics teachers.  They serve a diverse student population across the MPS district and across the next five years of the project, it is likely they will significantly impact student learning in a positive way.
