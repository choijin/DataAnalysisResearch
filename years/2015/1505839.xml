<AbstractNarration>Professor Zhihong Nie from the University of Maryland-College Park is being supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Chemistry Division to develop a deeper understanding of the interactions between nanoparticles. Nanoparticles (with diameters less than 1000th of that of a human hair) have properties that differ in important and useful ways from those of the corresponding bulk material. However, to realize the full potential of nanotechnology, it is essential to be able to arrange nanoparticles in specific two- and three-dimensional patterns that can enhance their properties or even provide new properties.  By controlling such interactions, it may well be possible to cause nanoparticles to self-organize into desired two- and three-dimensional patterns that would open the door to new applications in chemistry, physics, biology, and other sciences. The broader impacts of the proposed research program involve training students particularly from under-represented groups to acquire skills and knowledge in nanoparticles, as well as outreach activities including mentoring economically disadvantaged high school students, organizing one-day STEM event for academically advanced 7-10th grade students, and writing informative web-based articles for educating the general public.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed work seeks to create a new class of hybrid building blocks and to assemble them as molecular mimics into hierarchically-ordered nanostructures. The functionalization of nanoparticles with charged polymers encodes the nanoparticles with assembly instructions, thus guiding the self-assembly of nanoparticles at multiple hierarchical levels in a step-wise fashion. This project will use a combination of computational and experimental methods to gain a fundamental understanding of how to program the interactions between nanoparticles and to control the properties of assembled nanoparticles. The assembled nanostructures could find applications in such areas as metamaterials, coatings, sensors, medicine, and optoelectronics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nanoscale particles have shown broad applications in energy, coatings, sensors, medicine, and optoelectronics. Realizing their enormous potential requires the organization of nanoparticles in specific one-, two- or three-dimensional patterns that can enhance their properties or even provide new properties. In nature, molecules can spontaneously organize into larger structures with fascinating complexities and functions. However, there remain challenges in self-organizing nanoparticles into hierarchically ordered nanostructures as molecule does. The NSF project entitled, "Molecular-mimicking Self-assembly of Inorganic Nanoparticles Tethered with Charged Block Copolymers," aims to develop a deeper understanding of the interactions between nanoparticles grafted with block copolymers in order to achieve better organization of these particles. Herein specific objectives include (i) organization of polymer-modified nanoparticle into molecular-like clusters; (ii) further organization of these nanoscale clusters into larger ordered structures; and (iii) exploitation of the collective properties of assembled nanoparticles.  In the three-year period of this project, we have successfully accomplished our project objectives. We first explored the interactions between two types of nanoparticles modified with block copolymers carrying different charges and functional groups. Our results showed that appropriate design of polymer ligands (e.g., molecular weight, block length, functional group density, grafting density) enabled the formation of defined clusters with controlled size and symmetry. A correlation between building block design and assembly structures was established on the basis of our characterization and simulation studies.

The project has also provided research opportunities for three undergraduate students and one local high school student. Results have been published on scientific journals and shared on international meetings including on the 253th and 254th American Chemical Society National Meeting, the 7th International Conference for Colloids and Interfaces, the 2016Nano Korea Symposium, and the Mid-Atlantic Micro/Nano Alliance (MAMNA) Symposium.
