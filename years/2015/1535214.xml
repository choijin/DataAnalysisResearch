<AbstractNarration>Learning of fractions is a significant barrier for many in further study of mathematics and thus other science, technology, and engineering disciplines. Many students identified as struggling learners of mathematics are provided with interventions that focus on simplifying the complexity and breaking up the task into small discrete pieces, which is counter to the recommendations on supporting students in learning mathematics from the mathematics education community. The rigorous, large-scale study will explore potential benefits of a recently published instructional intervention, TransMath, to improve conceptual understanding and procedural proficiency with fractions for at-risk, fifth graders. The study will promote knowledge about a critical issue, learning of fractions by at-risk 5th graders through an intervention that combines explicit instruction common to special education (SPED) and problem solving and reasoning in small groups common to mathematics education (MTED). The research has the potential to make an important contribution to ways in which knowledge gained from previous studies in SPED and MTED may lead to improved instruction and student outcomes for a highly vulnerable population. Any successful initial efficacy studies about a Response to Intervention Tier 2 intervention in mathematics has the potential advance knowledge and have a long-lasting and meaningful contribution to the study of interventions and in the area of translation to practice. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study design will randomly assign 200 students identified in need of Tier 2 instruction to intervention and business as usual control groups. Teachers trained by the team to provide the TransMath instruction will teach students in the intervention group. The study will document the fidelity of implementation of the intervention, as well as the control condition for both Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruction. Using a regression modeling approach, the analysis accounts for partial nesting of students within small intervention groups to examine changes in student learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Purpose: Fractions present increased challenges to students because they are more abstract than whole numbers. As students are confronted with the abstract nature of fractions, many fall behind, which is likely to have long-term consequences on their mathematics learning trajectory and can even eliminate potential career options. Therefore, identifying an intervention for students who struggle with fractions has the potential to prevent long-term failure in mathematics. District and state leaders have consistently decried the limited availability of empirically validated interventions in fractions. By designing and evaluating a fractions intervention program, this study aimed to help build the evidence base for effective small-group mathematics interventions. A formative pilot study of a fractions intervention, Adapted TransMath (ATM; originally designed by Woodward &amp; Stroh, 2015), was conducted to address the intervention's potential for improving fifth-grade struggling students' knowledge and understanding of fractions, and to identify any logistical or instructional design issues, before scaling up for a randomized control trial. After revising the intervention after the pilot, an efficacy study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Intervention: ATM is an innovative intervention that not only builds students' understanding of fractions concepts and proficiency with procedures, but also devotes significant time to problem solving, approaching a problem in more than one way, and discussing students' solutions to problem-solving activities, thus making the intervention markedly different from other currently available approaches of fractions interventions for this grade level. The intervention targets both grade-level and relevant foundational fractions concepts.  Design: This project included both a formative pilot to determine the feasibility of the small-group fractions intervention, as well as a large-scale randomized controlled trial to test the impact of the intervention. The large-scale efficacy trial involved the random assignment of Grade 5 at-risk students identified by their score on a fractions screening measure. The impact of the intervention on students' fraction achievement was measured using a range of measures that assessed understanding of fractions concepts, procedural competence with fractions, fraction placement on a number line, and quality of explanations.  Pilot Study Findings: Formative data demonstrated that students who received the fractions intervention performed better on the fractions post-tests than students who did not receive the fractions intervention. Data also demonstrated that the small-group fractions intervention could easily be implemented in different school settings and districts during the large-scale study. Reflection forms filled out by the interventionists were used to identify areas for further refinements to the lessons. Through this work, tools and strategies that build mathematical reasoning were identified, such as emphasizing the number line as a conceptual tool, building problem solving skills, supporting student explanations, and providing opportunities to check for student understanding. RCT Findings: Results indicated that intervention students significantly outperformed students from the comparison condition on measures of fractions proficiency and understanding (g = .66 to .78), number line estimation (g = .80 to 1.08), and fractions procedures (g = 1.07). Intervention students also provided richer and more precise explanations of their solutions on a series of explanation tasks (g = .68 to 1.23). The positive and significant findings demonstrate that a fractions intervention that (a) is aligned to the state standards, (b) is grounded in a curriculum, and (c) builds understanding of foundational concepts and operations has the capacity to improve at-risk students' grade-level fractions performance. These findings also reinforce the importance of conducting universal screening to identify students who are likely to struggle with fractions in upper elementary school, as well as providing supplemental mathematics intervention for these at-risk students for 25-35 minutes at least 3 times a week. Results from the study contribute to the evidence base for effective small-group interventions for students who are struggling to learn fractions, which is critical because a solid foundation in fractions is a key predictor of success in algebra and more advanced mathematics, which in turn is predictive of entry into higher education and many high-paying vocations.
