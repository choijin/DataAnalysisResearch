<AbstractNarration>This award funds research that will develop new statistical theories and methods for analyzing three different kinds of data that are used to test economic theories.  The first project considers how to analyze data when the individual data points can be grouped into a small number of "clusters".  Since statistical methods begin with assumptions about randomization, the PI team will develop a theory of randomization tests that work in these settings.  The second project considers problems associated with using randomized controlled methods to test the effects of an intervention, policy, or technology.  These methods generally involve assigning people to a treatment or control group based on complicated rules that are designed to assure the two groups are comparable.  These rules have implications for the best ways to analyze the resulting data, and the PIs plan to develop a new method that takes this into account.  Finally, the team will consider how to best develop a method that can combine several separate statistical tests into a single framework.  The project advances science by developing new methods that will be used to test theories from economics and other social sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs  pursue three different projects in econometrics. First, in joint work with Joseph Romano, they will develop a theory of randomization tests under an approximate symmetry assumption. A leading example where approximate symmetry holds is settings in which the data can be grouped into a small number of clusters. The hope is that their new methodology will work well in such settings, for which inference is known to be challenging. Second, in joint work with Federico Bugni, they will study how complicated treatment assignment rules designed to balance baseline covariates across treatment and control groups impacts inference about the average treatment effect. In preliminary work, they have shown that the usual two-sample t-test can be quite conservative in such settings. We plan to develop methods that do not have this feature. Finally, in joint work with Andres Santos, the PIs will develop methods for testing unions of functional moment inequalities. This framework encompasses many problems that have so far been treated separately in the econometrics literature, including (subvector) inference for (conditional) moment inequalities and tests of stochastic dominance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project has led to the following developments:  1. Developed new results pertaining to the analysis of randomized controlled trials. In particular, it is shown that complicated ways of assigning treatment status -- so called covariate-adaptive randomization -- have important implications for inference about the average treatment effect.  "Standard" (and often-used) methods must be re-analyzed in he presence of covariate-adaptive randomization.  This has important implications for the analysis of randomzied controlled trials.  2. Developed methods to adjust for multiple testing in experiments.  Multiple testing may arise due to there being multiple outcomes, subgroups or treatments of interest.  Failure to account multiple testing is related to concerns about replicability with randomized controlled trials.  3.  Developed new results related to making inferences when there are few -- e.g., maybe even just five -- clusters that are suitably large.  This data structure is common in economics and other parts of the sciences and usual approaches to analyzing this type of data rely on there being many clusters and, as a result, they often perform poorly when there are so few clusters.   4. Developed new methods for inference about disease seroprevalence, which is obviously of acute interest in light of the ongoing pandemic.  5. Developed new methods for performing inference on the rankings of units -- such as teachers, counties, or hospitals -- which have recieved considerable attention in the popular press recently and are used for policy-making.  Invariably, the rankings of these units are reported without quantification of statistical uncertainity.    6. Re-analyzed data from a prominent early childhood intervention in a novel way, combining insights from the partial idenetifcation literature, the randomization inference literature and the multiple testing literature.   7. Developed new results concerning the use of instrumental variables to make statments about the sign of the average treatment effect.  This is a common problem not only in economics, but in many other parts of the sciences.       Last Modified: 05/20/2021       Submitted by: Azeem M Shaikh]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
