<AbstractNarration>1545637&lt;br/&gt;Trail&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program grant supports a laboratory technician over a two year period.  The technician will be responsible for daily operations of an extant laser ablation microprobe equipped inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS), testing and developing glass and mineral standards for geochemistry research, and assisting external users with the operation of piston cylinders used to synthesize phases in the experimental petrology lab at the University of Rochester.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare given the importance of training the next generation scientific workforce in modern experimental and materials analysis techniques which this new position will foster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technician will directly support PI, student and regional collaborator research in experimental petrology and geochemistry including studies of Earth?s earliest evidence of crustal differentiation based on chemical analysis of ancient zircons, fundamental studies of isotope fractionation between mineral phases in experimental run products in support of environmental proxy development, studies of trace element distributions and valence state determinations in accessory phases from ash deposits to assess the redox state of the parent magmas, and trace element investigations in support of studies in tectonics, metamorphic petrology and as indicators of artifact provenance for studies in archeology, to name a few.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported a research technician capable of overseeing day-to-day operations of the University of Rochester mass spectrometer (sensitive enough to measure parts per million/billion in minerals/fluids) and the high temperature high pressure experimental laboratory.  The experimental equipment is capable of creating a precision- controlled environment with temperatures up to 2000oC and pressures of 4GPa.  In the case of the latter, this is equivalent to a depth of 120 km depth in the Earth.  The equipment is state-of-the-art and requires a dedicated individual to ensure peak, well-tuned operation. Potential users meet with the research technician to discuss the goals of the project well before an analytical session is scheduled.   The major objective was to support research in geology including projects that help understand the origin and composition of the first continents on earth, the ages of continental rocks, to how modern-day volcanoes work.  The research technician helped to develop methods in our lab to analyze growth zones in minerals as small as 3-5 microns (the width of a human hair is about 100 microns). Several PhD students were trained in the principles of mass spectrometry and mineral synthesis techniques, which is applicable within and beyond the geological sciences.  Undergraduate students were also introduced to the technology over the course of the grant.  The research technician also help build new, custom-designed experimental equipment for geological research.   Another goal of this grant was to serve as an enabler of other scientific inquiry beyond the geological sciences.  Because of the research technician, the lab  was able to facilitate projects that ranged from nanotoxicology work (led by PIs at the U of R medical center), to the strength of Al which has applications for a wide range of industrial electronic applications (led by PIs in materials science), to studies which explored how quantum dots work (led by PIs in Chemistry).
