<AbstractNarration>Searches for planets orbiting other stars (exoplanets) have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting a wide variety of stars.  Most of these surveys are only able to detect planets on relatively small orbits similar to that of Jupiter or smaller. Furthermore, the vast majority of the stars so far known to host planets are relatively close to the Sun.  Therefore, little is known about the outer regions of planetary systems, and almost nothing is known about the distribution of planets farther away in the galaxy.  Microlensing, which occurs when a distant star gets sufficiently aligned with a massive compact foreground object to bend its light due to its gravitational field, resulting in an observable magnification, can address this. Microlensing surveys for exoplanets, on the other hand, are sensitive to cool, low-mass planets in the outer parts of solar systems.  Furthermore, microlensing is sensitive to planets in a range of environments in our Milky Way galaxy.  It is perhaps the only way to detect whether free-floating planets exist.  This team will develop microlensing methods and use them to determine the properties and Galactic distribution of planets that do not orbit close to a host star.  This work relies on observations from the amateur astronomy community, and this team will organize an international workshop to bring the amateur and professional communities together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is a combination of theoretical and observational work to develop methods to measure the mass and distance to a large and broad sample of microlens planets.  The CoPIs and their students will: 1) Develop methods to measure the microlens parallax effect, which provides the most robust way to measure the mass of and distance to microlenses.  Using the results from two Spitzer campaigns totalling over 900 hours, they will study the phenomenology of all types of microlens parallaxes measurement methods. (2) Develop a unified, comprehensive understanding of the microlens parallax effect.  This synthesis of various methods will enable parallax measurements, and thus mass and distance estimates, for a large and broad sample of planetary systems. (3) Continue to lead the Microlensing Follow Up Network effort to find extra-solar planets by monitoring high-magnification microlensing events.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The most important outcome was to characterize the population of low-mass exo-planets (at or below the mass of Neptune) in the cold outer regions of solar systems.  Microlensing is the only technique that is sensitive to such planets.  Prior to this project, only five planets were known with mass ratios below 1/10,000, i.e., twice the Neptune/Sun mass ratio, from 13 previous years of microlensing experiments.  All five had mass ratios above 1/22,000, i.e. roughly the Neptune/Sun mass ratio.  Our project played a central role in the discovery of five more planets in this class.  Critically, three of these five have mass ratios of about 1/50,000.  That is, it was previously unknown whether low-mass (i.e., sub-Neptune) planets form plentifully in the outer regions of exo-solar system.  In particular, they did not form (or at least did not survive) in our own solar system, where rock/ice cores seeded the ice giants (Uranus and Neptune) and even larger gas giants (Saturn and Jupiter).  Smaller planets (Mercury, Mars, Venus and Earth) only formed in the inner solar system (inside the so-called "snow line" between Mars and Jupiter).  Based on our work in this project, it is now known that the solar system is not representative of other systems, i.e., they do have cold, low-mass planets in significant abundance.  The upper panel of the Figure shows the ground-based microlensing lightcurve from which one of these planets was discovered (KMT-2018-BLG-0029Lb).  The event is significantly magnified for about 200 days, but the short "blip" near the peak, lasting just five hours, it the only signature of the planet.  The lower the planet mass, the shorter the blip, so 24/7 coverage is needed to find very low mass planets.  Our project played the central role in achieving this coverage over about 40 square degrees, containing about 200 million observable stars.  The black points on this figure are data of the same microlensing event as seen from the Spitzer satellite, roughly 250 million kilometers from Earth.  This different viewpoint yields a different lightcurve, via the so-called "microlens parallax effect".  From the difference, we can infer the mass of the planet's host star (about the same as the Sun in the present case), and so infer the mass of the planet (about six times the mass of Earth).  Our project played a key role in enabling such microlens mass measurements by combining Earth and Spitzer observations.  Remarkably, three of the five new low-mass planets have Spitzer-ground-based mass measurements.       Last Modified: 09/20/2019       Submitted by: Andrew Gould]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
