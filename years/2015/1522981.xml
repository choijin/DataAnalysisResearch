<AbstractNarration>This project supports participation of US based mathematicians in the international workshop  "Manifolds and Groups: Towers of Covers" which will take place from September 7th until September 12th, 2015, in Ventotene, Italy. A major goal of the workshop is to train and support the next generation of mathematicians in the field of geometric analysis. The conference will help to educate graduate students and recent PhDs on the latest developments in the field. The conference will introduce junior mathematicians to various topics in geometric group theory and  bring them up to the forefront of research. A part of the conference will be devoted to three mini-courses, taught by experts known also for their ability to give enlightening lectures. In parallel to the minicourses, there will be research talks. The speakers  will be prompted by the organizers to aim their lectures at a broad audience of mathematicians. The majority of funding will support junior participants coming from USA. The organizing committee will encourage and support broad and diverse participation. In particular, women mathematicians and members of other under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply for support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop  consists of the following three minicourses on different aspects of  "Towers of Covers":   "Invariant Random Subgroups in rank one and higher rank Lie groups" (Tsachik Gelander, Hebrew University and Weizmann Institute), "Coverings and expanders" (Emmanuel Kowalski, ETH Zurich), and "L^2-invariants and growth of homology in towers of finite coverings" (Roman Sauer, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology). The workshop  will also feature research talks and informal discussions. Participants will include leading U.S. and European researchers from  different areas relevant to the centerpiece of the workshop (3-manifold topology, probability and analytic group theory) as well as junior researchers, both graduate students and postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More infromation can be found at the website&lt;br/&gt;http://www.ventotene2015.net/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The workshop Moduli Spaces took place in Ventotene (LT), Italy, from the morning of the 11th until the morning (included) of the 16th of September 2017. It was organized by Roberto Frigerio (Univerit&agrave; di Pisa), Stefano Francaviglia (Universit&agrave; di Bologna), Alessandra Iozzi (ETH Zu&#776;rich), Kate Juschenko (Northwestern University), and Michah Sageev (Technion, Haifa).  Geometric group theory has developed into a field of considerable scope and variety of techniques. The aim of this workshop was to bring together geometric group theorists of various research directions in order to learn and gain insights from the interaction. We also wanted to have an instructional component to the conference, in order to be able to attract and introduce young researchers from all over the world to this circle of ideas. With these two goals in mind, we built the scientific program with three minicourses: they took place in the morning and each consisted of three 75? long sessions.     Upon demand of several participants, we are in discussion with the minicourse speakers to collect the notes of the minicourses in a volume of proceedings that would be published by the AMS. Each of the three minicourses was complemented by a 75? talk delivered by a different speaker: the three speakers were Marc Burger (for the minicourse given by Fanny Kassel), Jing Tao (for the minicourse given by Yair Minsky) and Mladen Bestvina (for the minicourse given by Karen Vogtmann). The afternoons were occupied by 9 research talks, each 45? long. We emphasized to the speakers the presence of a broad audience and hence the need to structure the talks accordingly. They all made a very serious effort and the talks were overall excellent and consequently extremely well attended. We also had a poster session to which around 20 among students and postdocs participated. The posters, in display the whole length of the conference, contributed to animated and profitable discussions. On Wednesday evening after dinner Ilya Kapovich gave a talk to illustrate how to create a Wikipedia article about a mathematical topic.
