<AbstractNarration>In 2014, approximately 750,000 United States high school students were enrolled in a calculus class, three times the number of U.S. students who took their first calculus class in college. High school calculus enrollments are still growing at roughly 6% per year, with increasing pressure on the most advantaged students to take calculus ever earlier. Over 100,000 now take a College Board AP Calculus exam by the end of grade 11. High school calculus teachers find themselves under increasing pressure from parents and administrators to admit into their classes students they know are not adequately prepared. The study of Characteristics of Successful Programs in College Calculus (NSF DRL 0910240) found that a quarter million of the students who study calculus in high school will retake mainstream Calculus I at the post-secondary level, and 40% of these quarter million will fail to get the A or B that signals they are prepared to continue in mathematics. There is very little known about the remaining half million. At the same time, half of all nation's high schools do not even offer calculus, and students from underrepresented groups, even when they are in a high school that offers calculus, are often discouraged from enrolling in this course. The result is that, if they aspire to a mathematically intensive major such as engineering or a physical science, then they will find themselves in competition against students with a much richer preparation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop project will bring together researchers and experts in the issue of the transition from high school to college mathematics to: (1) survey the state of knowledge related to this situation; (2) identify the most pressing and promising questions for exploration; and (3) lay out an agenda for future work. The project will bring together researchers who have worked to understand different aspects of these issues, including both those who have worked under the aegis of the College Board and those who have worked independently of it. The project will produce a greater understanding of how the rush to calculus affects the pathways that students ultimately take toward fields that depend on mathematics, especially science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)fields. It also will help to illuminate the obstacles faced by students from disadvantaged high schools. White papers, together with a summary of the recommendations for further study that come out of the workshop, will be published and disseminated by the Mathematical Association of America. The outcomes of the workshop will provide future directions for investigation in terms of (a) general transition across academic levels and (b) approaches that enhance the national need of broadening participation in STEM areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In March of 2016 with funding from this grant, a group of high school teachers, mathematicians, mathematics and science education researchers, state and district supervisors of mathematics, and representatives of organizations with a stake in the issues surrounding calculus in high school, which included the College Board and the National Academy of Sciences, met for three days in Washington, DC to clarify what we know and what we need to know about the role of calculus in the transition from high school to college mathematics.  A summary of what we do know has been published as a joint report of the Mathematical Association of America and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, The Role of Calculus in the Transition from High School to College Mathematics, David Bressoud, editor, ISBN 978-0-88385-919-3 (pdf available at www.maa.org/sites/default/files/RoleOfCalc_rev.pdf). This report has been distributed to district and state supervisors of mathematics as well as college and university departments of mathematics.  The conference identified 14 over-arching questions across all of which it identified particular challenges for students from under-resourced schools, students under stereotype threat, and students from families without a history of post-secondary education.    1. Who takes calculus in high school? When do they take it? Why do they  take it? What are the results? This includes both short-term results  including what they have learned and long-term results including how it  shapes preparation for additional courses in mathematics and future  career decisions.    2. Who should be taking calculus in high school? How do we ensure that  quality courses are available to all students who should be taking them?    3. Should high school calculus be widely available? Is either calculus as an intellectual achievement or as a sign of intellectual ability sufficient rationale for directing so many students toward it? To what extent does calculus on a high school transcript affect acceptance into college? To what extent does calculus in high school foster increased interest in the mathematical sciences or the mathematically intensive disciplines?    4. How do we know when a student is ready for acceleration into a sequence that will include high school calculus? How should we prepare students for doing this?    5. What are the effects of such acceleration at ever-earlier grades? Are there specific policies and practices that can counter inappropriate acceleration?    6. How do we build alternate pathways that enable students to back off the track to high school calculus without damaging their prospects for post-secondary studies that are mathematically intensive?    7. How do we ensure that a high school curriculum that includes calculus provides both a sufficient breadth of understanding of the nature of mathematics and ability in the use of the tools of advanced mathematics?    8. What are the obstacles and difficulties that students encounter as they attempt the transition from high school calculus to post-secondary mathematics? What policies and practices are known to be effective at removing obstacles and overcoming difficulties?    9. How can we do a better job of placing students in the appropriate courses when they get to college, and how can we ensure that these courses enable students to succeed in the courses that build upon them?    10. The transition from high school to post-secondary mathematics is frequently detrimental to students? sense of self-efficacy and mathematical identity, especially for women. What are the core issues here, and how can they be addressed?    11. What is the relationship between calculus as currently taught at the  post-secondary level and the true needs of those mathematically  intensive disciplines that require it?    12. How should colleges and universities respond to the growing proportion  of students taking calculus in high school in shaping what and how they  teach?    13. How do we ensure that both high school and college instructors are using the most effective methods for teaching calculus?    14.
