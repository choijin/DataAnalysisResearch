<AbstractNarration>Hydrothermal vents are an important source of sulfide mineral deposits to the ocean floor, but the processes of how trace elements get incorporated into the hot fluids and their corresponding sulfide chimneys is poorly understood. This project will measure trace element concentrations in fluid-chimney pairs from a natural hydrothermal vent system.  The data from this project will enhance our understanding of how trace elements transition between the fluid and corresponding mineral, as well as be included into studies that aim to quantify trace element fluxes from hydrothermal vents to the deep ocean and modeling studies focused on formation of massive sulfides and metal remobilization. This project will support the training of undergraduate and graduate students, and results will be shared broadly through the creation of educational videos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use of vent fluids and corresponding chimney linings to test hypotheses of partitioning has been hampered in the past by a lack of trace element data for both vent fluids and solids due to the very low concentrations. Recent efforts using improved analytical techniques now make investigations of trace element partitioning possible. This project will use a natural hydrothermal vent system to investigate trace element partitioning from fluids into sulfide minerals that precipitate along the linings of the chimney conduits, in contact with the hot vent fluids, at conditions difficult to reproduce in the laboratory. Analyses will be done on a set of fluid-chimney pairs (fluid and chimney sampled at the same time). Data and analyses from this project will be used to test the following two hypotheses: 1) Minerals precipitating from vent fluids along linings of chimneys incorporate some trace elements in a characteristic manner, with partitioning dominantly a function of element concentrations, and with pH, temperature, redox, and ligand concentration affecting free versus total concentrations; and 2) Seafloor sulfide deposits record critical information about both the trace element compositions of the fluids from which they formed, and about environmental conditions at the time of precipitation; thus, trace element distributions could be used as proxies for environmental conditions such as pH, redox, temperature, and/or metal concentrations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Investigations of actively forming black smoker chimney deposits, which form on the seafloor from interactions of very hot (~360oC, or 680oF) metal-rich vent fluids and cold seawater, provide opportunities to directly compare the compositions of the deposits with the hydrothermal fluids from which they form. Results of such studies provide insight into the formation processes of seafloor massive sulfide deposits, analogs of some types of volcanic-associated massive sulfide deposits, an important class of base-metal ore deposit.    This project focused on use of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and high-resolution inductively coupled mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS) to examine trace element (cobalt - Co, nickel - Ni, silver - Ag, Gallium - Ga, Indium - In) partitioning between vent fluids and minerals lining the chimneys, and to identify whether any trace elements or trace element combinations can be used as proxies of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, ratios of trace elements to the elements for which they substitute). As part of the project, a new method was developed for measuring trace elements at sub-ppm levels in sulfide minerals.  Minerals were analyzed to confirm that SIMS could indeed be used to detect a suite of trace elements at very low concentrations. Then, to convert data from SIMS to actual concentrations, standards needed to be developed.  An absence of mineral standards that were homogeneous with respect to the relevant trace elements made it necessary to use the chimney lining samples that were being studied (which are homogeneous with respect to many of the relevant trace elements) as standards. This involved picking chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) that exhibited homogeneity (based on SIMS analyses) with respect to specific elements (Co, Ni, Ag, Ga, In) from the chimney linings, and then dissolving and analyzing the carefully picked separates by ICP-MS.  This technique resulted in calibration curves for each of these five elements.  Once it was possible to measure the trace elements in the chimney linings, the next step was to compare the compositions of the linings with the compositions of the vent fluids.  This required measuring the trace element concentrations of the vent fluids that were flowing through the chimneys at the time chimney samples were collected.  Measuring trace elements in vent fluids requires analyzing the fluids, plus re-dissolving, diluting, and analyzing materials that precipitated from the fluids at the time of sampling (dregs) or that precipitated in sample bottles prior to analysis (filter fractions) by ICP-MS. Once all of these measurements were made, the concentrations were summed to "reconstitute" the trace element concentrations of the "end-member" fluids (concentrations extrapolated to a fluid that has zero Mg).  Once the full vent fluid compositions (including trace element concentrations) were known, they could be compared to the compositions of the Cu-Fe sulfide minerals (chalcopyrite and cubanite) from corresponding chimney linings, analyzed by SIMS.  To examine trace element partitioning, the comparison step of the project used aqueous speciation codes to model the trace element distribution in fluids at in situ conditions, resulting in estimates of amounts of free element (e.g., free Ag) relative to the element it replaces in the chalcopyrite or cubanite lattice (e.g., free Cu). Results show that Ag, Ga, and In all appear to be potential proxies of vent fluid pH. Ag is present in higher concentrations in chalcopyrite precipitated from higher pH fluids; this correlates with higher vent fluid free Ag/free Cu ratios because of lower concentrations of Cu in high pH fluids.

This likely reflects there being lesser amounts of free In and free Ga in higher pH vent fluids because In and Ga are instead present as hydroxide complexes; at lower pH there is less hydroxide to complex with In and Ga, and thus greater amounts of free In and free Ga that can partition into Cu-Fe sulfide minerals.
