<AbstractNarration>This project concerns investigations in the theory of numbers and arithmetic geometry. This is an area of research which has applications to cyber security, through cryptography, and to some aspects of coding theory. The research includes a number of projects in arithmetic geometry and transcendental number theory that focus on understanding how values of special analytic functions convey fundamental information about fields of algebraic numbers and geometric objects defined over them. The investigator plans to study quantities associated to Anderson-Drinfeld motives and to Mahler measures of multivariable polynomials in order to exhibit concretely this interplay between analytic and arithmetic information. Several parts of the project lead naturally to problems for student research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For problems on special values over function fields, the investigator will study periods and logarithms of Anderson-Drinfeld motives in positive characteristic so as to discover new results about values of zeta functions, multiple zeta functions, Goss L-functions, and Drinfeld polylogarithms. One line of inquiry will be to apply the Galois theory of Frobenius difference equations to find new results on algebraic independence of L-values and multiple zeta values over arbitrary base rings. Another path of investigation will be to uncover log-algebraic power series identities for Drinfeld modules and their tensor powers so as to produce new formulas for values of Goss L-functions and their twists that illustrate their connections with Taelman class modules. The investigator will also pursue research on Mahler measures of multivariable polynomials over the complex numbers in terms of special values of L-functions of classical modular forms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research under this award encompassed several projects in mathematical research in Number Theory.  The specific areas of study focused on the deep links between analytic and arithmetic information presented by special functions, especially exponentials, logarithms, zeta functions, and L-functions of various kinds.  Problems of this type have their origins at least as early as work of Euler and Gauss, and they are have maintained continued prominence in number theory research for many years.  Working with students and collaborators, the Principal Investigator researched problems involving special values of analytic functions in positive characteristic.  Such analytic functions are defined on complete extensions of finite fields, and by work of Anderson, Carlitz, Drinfeld, Goss, Thakur, Yu, and many others, we know that these functions live in convincing parallel to analytic functions of classical interest.  In addition to intrinsic interest in their own right, this study of function field arithmetic often leads to insights about classical phenomena.  The work on this project has settled some open questions about algebraic relations among various quantities in function field arithmetic. These include periods, quasi-periods, logarithms, and quasi-logarithms of Anderson t-modules modules, as well as their hyperderivatives.  Work on Drinfeld modules on coordinate rings of elliptic curves has provided new insight into product formulas for periods as well as special value identities for Pellarin L-series taking place in associated Tate algebras.  Further work on Drinfeld modules over Tate algebras themselves show that the analytic theory of Drinfeld modules can be fruitfully extended to this context as well.  These constructions have led to additional questions in transcendence theory that require further study.  The work on this project has led to new understandings of special values of Goss L-functions, especially at positive arguments.  These include new log-algebraicity identities on Drinfeld modules of arbitrary rank as well as on tensor powers of the Carlitz module, which produce special value formulas of Goss L-functions and their twists by Dirichlet characters in terms of Drinfeld logarithms and Carlitz polylogarithms.  Related work on this project produced effective criteria for showing that function field multiple zeta values are Eulerian.  Work on this project also produced non-archimedean limit formulas for Bernoulli-Carlitz numbers that have led to new limits of Goss-Eisenstein series, which do not yet have classical counterparts.  The Principal Investigator continued to mentor post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students in education and research projects in mathematics.  The present award led to several publications by students and junior researchers.          Last Modified: 10/31/2019       Submitted by: Matthew A Papanikolas]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
