<AbstractNarration>Microscopic fungi (microfungi) represent a diverse assemblage that is distributed worldwide and includes bread molds, plant pathogens, powdery mildews, rusts, slime molds, and water molds. A large percentage of these organisms are harmless or even beneficial, but some cause disease and death in animals, plants, and other fungi resulting in major economic loss and serious negative implications for human and ecosystem health. Despite their importance, little is known about their distribution, diversity, ecology, or host associations. This project is a collaborative effort involving 38 institutions in 31 states and aims to consolidate data from specimens housed in biodiversity collections for 2.3 million microfungi specimens and make these data available through online resources. The consolidation and increased accessibility of these data is critical to inform and promote new and innovative research, education and community engagement around this little-known but important group of organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specimen data generated by this project will be used to assess natural and human-induced environmental changes on microfungi distributions, and evaluate the impact of these changes on the function and health of ecosystems. This project fills a critical gap in the national digitization effort by contributing images, digitizing specimen label data, and linking associated ancillary data for over 1.2 million North American specimens of microfungi. Additionally, nomenclature and taxonomic information will be updated to reflect the newest practices as dictated by the International Codes for Nomenclature. These data will provide a foundation for making informed decisions by agribusinesses, educators, forest managers, government agencies, horticulturalists, policy makers, researchers, and the general public. The broader education goals of this project will be facilitated through the development and implementation of a teaching module for high school biology on the economic importance of microfungi. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to database all of the microfungi in the University of Michigan Herbarium&rsquo;s collection of fungi. Microfungi are those that are generally microscopic or make tiny fruiting bodies. This group is rich in plant pathogens, such as rust fungi, making them a vital resource for studies on agricultural and forest pests. The University of Michigan collection is one of North America&rsquo;s largest fungal collections thanks to a long history of mycology at the university beginning with collections from the late 19<sup>th</sup>century. Historically important collections of fungi by mycologists such as Calvin Kauffman, Alexander Smith, E. B. Mains, Bessy Kanouse, Robert Shaffer, and Robert Fogel include over 6,000 type specimens, the physical specimen that is associated with the original species description. In order to database these fungi we imaged all of the specimen labels, notes, and annotations for approximately 65,000 specimens. Using the specimen images, we transcribed over 45,000 of them completely into specimen records, and the rest are present as skeletal records. These images and database records were uploaded to an online database that aggregates data from dozens of North American fungal herbaria, the Mycoportal (mycoportal.org), where they are readily searchable and used by the scientific community and interested citizens. The data will be used to build regional floras, document species distribution, and to support more basic research on phenology, host-pathogen associations, and systematics. By completing this project, this work has helped the U. Michigan Herbarium catalog the entire collection of over 273,500 specimens. Therefore, the database generated by this project is also useful for the curators present and future of the U. Michigan fungal collection. Lastly, the project involved 9 undergraduate students and technicians who were trained in best herbarium practices and given a chance to learn about fungi and collection curation.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/05/2018<br>      Modified by: Timothy&nbsp;James</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
