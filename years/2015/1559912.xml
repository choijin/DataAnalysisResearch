<AbstractNarration>This award supports the summer REU site Valparaiso Experience in Research by Undergraduate Mathematicians (VERUM). VERUM will recruit twelve undergraduate students each year. The students will work in teams of three, for nine weeks, on solving open problems in biomathematics, enumeration, networks, or statistics. Each group will work with a project director who will provide guidance and feedback to the students on a daily basis. Participants will investigate open questions of interest to the larger mathematical community, therefore yielding potentially publishable results. The program will provide undergraduates with a first research experience in mathematics. Most of the participants will be students from primarily undergraduate institutions who have not yet decided on a graduate school career path. Additional attention will be given to recruiting participants from groups under-represented in STEM, including first-generation college students. The award is supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By modeling the research experience of a mathematician, the program will produce students engaged with, and prepared to join, the mathematical community. The program emphasizes the professional development of the students while encouraging them to pursue mathematically related careers and graduate studies, thus increasing the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines. Students will become part of a small professional group that will provide support during their undergraduate careers and beyond. As part of the program, students will visit graduate schools to learn about the experiences of graduate students in different types of institutions. Students will also be exposed to different areas of mathematics by following the progress of each research group and by listening to, and interacting with, weekly visitors to the program. VERUM participants will increase their communication and presentation skills through weekly group presentations, presentations at local and national conferences, and through writing a final project report.</AbstractNarration>
