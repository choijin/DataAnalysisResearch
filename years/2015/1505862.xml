<AbstractNarration>Quantum mechanics tells us that both matter and light can exhibit wave-like or particle-like behavior. Devices that use the interference of waves--the fact that waves can cancel each other out or enhance each other--enable highly sensitive measurements of almost anything: time, gravity, motion, or electric and magnetic fields. In particular, atomic clocks, that are based on wave interference, are the most accurate devices ever made by mankind, and have many important technological applications. Clocks and other interferometers operate by measuring many independent atoms in parallel to enhance the signal. The device readout is then subject to measurement noise (projection noise), not unlike the flipping of a collection of coins where the outcome is not always an equal number of heads and tails. Here it is proposed to develop methods to produce correlated states of many atoms (so-called entangled states) that can be used to reduce or eliminate the projection noise. Quantum mechanics allows one to prepare a situation where each coin individually still randomly shows head or tail, but the collection of coins always shows an equal number of heads and tails. By demonstrating the generation of such states, the proposed research program could boost the precision of atomic clocks and other interferometers, with significant implications for timekeeping, navigation, and precision measurements. The proposed work will unite research and educational goals by training graduate students, and by integrating undergraduate students and exceptional high-school students into the research effort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed at the deterministic preparation of non-classical (many-body entangled) states of atomic ensembles and of light fields using collective atom-light interaction enhanced by an optical resonator. Such states can be used to improve the precision of atomic clocks and other atom interferometers beyond the standard quantum limit. The main goals of the project are to demonstrate a non-destructive measurement of the power of a traveling laser beam below the photon shot noise limit, to create Schroedinger cat states or strongly spin squeezed states of a large atomic ensemble via the detection of a single photon, and to use such states to operate an atomic clock below the standard quantum.</AbstractNarration>

Under this grant, we have demonstrated for the first time direct laser cooling of a gas of <sup>87</sup>Rb atoms to quantum degeneracy. The method is fast, and induces little atom loss. The atoms are trapped in a two-dimensional optical lattice that enables cycles of compression to increase the density, followed by another optical cooling method, (degenerate Raman sideband cooling) to decrease the temperature (see Figure 1). Starting with 2000 atoms, we prepare 1400 atoms in 300 ms at quantum degeneracy, as confirmed by a bimodal velocity distribution. The method should be broadly applicable to many bosonic and fermionic species.</p> <p><strong>2. Nanofriction and Aubry transition studied with trapped-ion chains</strong></p> <p>Friction between ordered, atomically smooth surfaces at the nanoscale (nanofriction) is often governed by stick-slip processes. To test long-standing atomistic models of such processes, we have implemented a synthetic nanofriction interface between a laser-cooled Coulomb crystal of individually addressable ions as the moving object and a periodic light field potential serving as the substrate. We show that stick-slip friction can be tuned from maximal to nearly frictionless via arrangement of the ions relative to the substrate (superlubricity). By varying the ion number, we also show that this strong dependence of friction on the structural mismatch, as predicted by many-particle models, already emerges at the level of two or three atoms. We have observed the velocity dependence of stick-slip friction, measuring for the first time four regimes of friction in one system over almost five orders of magnitude in velocity. We have observed an Aubry-type transition in finite atom chains via friction: as the substrate potential is increased, the ion chain transitions from the chain's intrinsic arrangement free to slide on the substrate, to a pinned arrangement favoring the substrate pattern. Finally, for deeper substrate potential depths, we have also observed multislip friction, where the contact can localize in multiple stable minima upon slipping (Figure 2).</p> <p><strong>3.

Using Rydberg interactions, in collaboration with Mikhail Lukin's group, we have experimentally realized an exchange collision between two photons inside a highly nonlinear optical medium that is accompanied by a robust pi/2 phase shift, protected by a symmetry of the system.
