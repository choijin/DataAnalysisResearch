<AbstractNarration>Recent and on-going retreat of many Northern hemisphere marine-terminating glaciers is contributing significantly to sea level rise.  It is driven by poorly understood processes occurring at the ice-ocean interface, such as subglacial discharge into the ocean, turbulent plume dynamics, submarine melting, and iceberg calving. These processes are (1) inherently interdisciplinary, requiring expertise in both glaciology and oceanography and (2) difficult to observe, requiring innovative field techniques and careful site selection. This project will address the relationship between subglacial discharge, turbulent plume dynamics, and submarine melting through a comprehensive field campaign at LeConte Glacier, Alaska, supplemented by a state-of-the-art modeling effort. The field site is ideal because it spans a wide range of forcings on daily to seasonal time scales and because the near-terminus fjord environment is accessible year round.  A successful project will provide a unique data set and improved models for projecting contributions to future sea level rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project, at the interface of the the fields of glaciology and oceanography, provides support for an early-career principal investigator (PI) (Amundson) from a predominantly undergraduate institution (University of Alaska Southeast) and an additional early career PI at University of Oregon.  More mature PIs at Oregon State University and University of Alaska Fairbanks Campus will mentor the younger team members, promoting workforce development.  Additional workforce development will be promoted through interaction with high school students and at the participating universities.  The team of PIs will entrain select students from a local Alaska high school to participate in aspects of the field work and engage with the school to integrate their observations into the curriculum.  The project will also provide support for the training two graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar.  The associated mentoring plan is very good.  Outreach to the general public will be enhanced by leveraging the PIs? home institutions? activities.  The PIs will continue established interactions with the National Park Service and the US Forest Service.  These include public lectures, as well as training for interpretive rangers who can reach a broad cross-cut of the public.  Finally, they will develop a brochure concerning their work to further enhance their public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a parameterization of a plume, driven by subglacial discharge, as it interacts with the face of a marine-terminating glacier.  This is a goal that has been endorsed by the international community.  It will be accomplished by conducting three intensive field campaigns to&lt;br/&gt;i. sample the upwelling plume directly with manned and autonomous vessels,&lt;br/&gt;ii. measure the downstream impact of the plume on near-terminus fjord circulation,&lt;br/&gt;iii. determine subglacial discharge and submarine melt rates, and&lt;br/&gt;iv. survey associated changes in glacier terminus dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Subglacial discharge and ambient water properties in the proglacial fjord will be monitored throughout the project in order to provide&lt;br/&gt;i. important context for the intensive field campaigns, and&lt;br/&gt;ii. a range of parameter space to be explored by a turbulence-resolving hydrodynamic plume model.&lt;br/&gt;Data from the intensive field campaigns will be used to validate the plume model, which will then be used to explore the wider range of parameter space that is provided by long-term measurements. The latter will allow investigation of the impact of submarine melting on glacier dynamics over seasonal timescales.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Tidewater, or marine-terminating, glaciers define the boundary between ice and ocean systems in high-latitude environments, connecting the oceans to the continental ice sheet that covers Greenland, the ice caps of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and the expansive snowfields of southeast Alaska, Patagonia, and the western Antarctic Peninsula. How these glaciers move and melt determines how quickly ice is lost and where meltwater enters the ocean. This controls the rate that sea levels are rising, alters ocean circulation patterns, can change ecosystem productivity and affect sediment input into the oceans. Up until now we have lacked the basic measurements of how the subsurface face of these glaciers melt, relying instead on melt estimates based on formulae derived from experiments at the base of the Antarctic ice shelves.</p> <p>This project hypothesized that subglacial discharge - which are the rivers of melt water flowing beneath the terrestrial part of the glacier &ndash; create vigorous ocean flows near the glacier terminus, through which they control the amount of subsurface melt across a given glacier&rsquo;s face. Over three years and 7 field surveys to LeConte Glacier, southeast Alaska, we collected novel ocean observations via ship and autonomous vehicle, ice observations from land-based sensors, and weather data in order to test this hypothesis. We found that although subglacial discharge is indeed present at this glacier, it does not directly determine the subsurface melt rates observed. Instead, we found extremely high melt rates across the glacier face that were not directly tied to the presence or absence of the subglacial discharge plume. These findings, which combined numerous fields of study (oceanography, glaciology, meteorology), have led to a shift in how the ice-ocean interactions community thinks about subsurface glacier melt, transforming how future studies and predictions of glacier melt will be made.</p> <p>During the project period, the PIs also trained a large number of students and early career researchers. These include many undergraduates - led by a team of female engineers - &nbsp;who helped design and build new robotic ocean vehicles, graduate students performing cutting-edge PhD research and numerical simulations of glacier-ocean systems, and three postdoctoral scholars who have all successfully moved on to permanent positions. Since the project was based out of Petersburg, AK, we engaged extensively with the local community, given numerous lectures to residents and public radio, as well as giving local high school students opportunities to participate in the field work. &nbsp;Because of the paradigm-shifting findings several of the project&rsquo;s publications garnered press attention, resulting in dozens of national and international interviews and coverage in magazines such as National Geographic, Scientific American, and Time. To date, three publications have been published, one is in review, one submitted, and several more are in preparation. Finally, we note that all data from this project have successfully been archived at the Arctic Data Center.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/12/2020<br>      Modified by: Jonathan&nbsp;D&nbsp;Nash</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1504191/1504191_10380560_1578835225319_rose_zoom-in_with_captions--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1504191/1504191_10380560_1578835225319_rose_zoom-in_with_captions--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Images showing how our team obtains physical measurements at the face of an actively-calving glacier"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1504191/1504191_10380560_1578835225319_rose_zoom-in_with_captions--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Images showing how our team obtains physical measurements at the face of an actively-calving glacier"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A series of images showing how our team obtains physical data close to a glacier face.
