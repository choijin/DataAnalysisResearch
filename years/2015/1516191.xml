<AbstractNarration>This research project builds upon an Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) project (DRL#1114674) that investigated preschoolers' self-directed science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) related play experiences in outdoor nature-based playscapes. An emerging trend, nature-based playscapes have great potential for exposing young children to STEM-related phenomena, concepts, and processes in a variety of early childhood education settings, including daycare centers, pre-schools, playgrounds, and children's museums. In contrast to traditional playgrounds, playscapes are designed to result in complex, sensory-rich environments in which extensive access to natural materials and resources inspires young children's investigative and exploratory behaviors. This study explores the hypothesis that play in nature provides young children (ages 3-5) with extensive contact with science content and that a play-based curriculum could expand opportunities for STEM learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research-in-Service of Practice project will: 1) design, implement, and evaluate four digital play-based professional development curriculum modules for pre-school educators across multiple partner sites; 2) research the impact of professional training on educators' facilitation of STEM content and activities; 3) examine the impacts of play-based facilitation on young children's understanding of and engagement with STEM; and 4) evaluate the transferability and sustainability of new playscape design principles at three partner sites. This investigation will be led by researchers at the University of Cincinnati in close collaboration with early childhood educators at the Arlitt Center, Cincinnati Nature Center, and two local early childhood organizations that serve children in Head Start programs. The study will use a mixed-methods approach. Data sources include video observations, behavior mapping, teacher self-studies, surveys, interviews, child assessments and children's photo documentation of their experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is being funded by the AISL program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. Research that promotes the understanding of how designed play-based natural environments and related instructional approaches support the development of young children's engagement with STEM could lead to new learning theory, pedagogical approaches, and inform the design of effective informal learning experiences. Understanding the affordances of particular components of playscapes with respect to young children, as well as how pre-school educators could productively facilitate young children's engagement with, and understanding of, STEM would be a contribution to the informal STEM field.</AbstractNarration>

These data optimized the production of our digital learning modules.     Video-Based Fieldwork. A large number of video logs revealed children's sustained language related to the natural environment and investigations of phenomena. Children also used posted maps of the playscapes located within the space for wayfinding so we added an assessment of wayfinding to our child assessment measure. Video analyses indicate that children not only used science, technology, engineering, and mathematical concepts during time spent at the playscapes, but they also demonstrated a strong sense of self-determination. Moreover, we found that affordances within playscapes provide many opportunities to strengthen children's executive function, particularly through goal-directed and focused problem-solving during free play.     Behavior Mapping. We created an iPad app version of behavior mapping to strategically observe individual children on playscapes in five second segments. We documented information on where children play, their peer interactions, adult presence, environmental interactions, the use of affordances and loose parts, and more. We observed a strong relationship between children's play in creeks (water features), digging areas (sand box or gravel pits), and in areas with forts and hiding locations (woods, rocks, grass and tall plants) to science learning. In addition, children's interactions on circuitous paths and posted maps of the play space indicate they are important spatial intelligence affordances within well-designed playscapes.     STEM in the Playscape Curriculum-Based Assessment. To assess changes in children's scientific and mathematical thinking, we used a 20-item curriculum-based assessment (CBA) to measure growth at three points during each year of the project. Overall, repeated-measures General Linear Modeling (GLM) revealed that CBA scores showed statistically significant increases from pre-tests to post-tests during each year of the project. More specifically, preschoolers showed gains in: 1) correctly classifying living and non-living natural materials, 2) subitizing and counting natural materials (i.e., number sense), 3) understanding plant life and seasonal changes, 4) engaging in inquiry while using tools to find worms in soil and forming a question, and 5) using a map of a playscape for locating features and wayfinding. These results provide evidence that children's STEM learning in playscapes shows increases over time during the preschool years. We also discovered that children who had daily access and weekly access to nature had CBA scores that improved at similar rates, significantly different than children who visited playscapes on intermittent visits. This suggests that weekly visits to playscapes or nature-based learning environments may be the minimum nature immersion dose that enhances scientific thinking and knowledge about the natural environment.     Digital Learning Modules. Our STEM in the Playscape digital learning modules highlight pedagogical content and effective instructional practices that foster informal STEM leaning in nature-based learning settings, particularly playscapes, based on results from our collective inquiry. Told through a story that transpires in an early childhood program, each module has multiple levels of information and resources that will help teachers deepen and broaden their knowledge and skills related to the following module topics:  1.      The Importance of Play in Nature 2.      STEM Learning in Early Childhood Education  Teaching Strategies and Dispositions that Support STEM Learning in Nature   Module 4, Basics of Designing Nature Playscapes, is useful for interdisciplinary stakeholders interested in building a playscape or enhancing current outdoor play environments. These modules can be accessed for free on the University of Cincinnati's Office of Professional Learning and Continuing Education's website:  https://www.uc.edu/about/continuing-ed/continuing-education-courses/STEM_Playscape.html     Last Modified: 01/28/2021 Submitted by: Victoria Carr]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
