<AbstractNarration>Manufacturing and production have been big contributors to improved quality and sustainability of human life. Current market trends, such as consumer demand for variety, short product life cycles, high product quality and low cost, have resulted in the need for efficient, responsive, robust and sustainable manufacturing and production paradigm. 3D printing technologies hold the merit of affordability and customizability, while the key challenge in applying 3D printing for mass customization in real life is how to reduce the lead time per unit. The lead time of 3D printing a product unit comes from two sources, i.e., the pre-fabrication computation and manufacturing process. The pre-fabrication computation is increasingly significant and becomes the bottleneck in the manufacturing flow of mass customization in 3D Printing.  This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project looks to address this problem through new computational methods with potential for two orders of magnitude reduction in time for pre-facbrication computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop a transformative computational paradigm of 3D printing in mass customization. The project will pursue two novel and complementary objectives: 1) design a suite of quality-guaranteed geometric algorithms for the scalable and time-efficient pre-fabrication computation framework.; and 2) develop a low-complexity and efficient computing system to facilitate and accelerate the use of these methods and algorithms in Objective1. This new computer system focuses on domain-specific computing platforms as the next disruptive technology for power-performance-runtime efficiency improvement.  Specifically, the team will develop accelerator-based architectures for computing primitives of geometric algorithms. This new hardware architecture will exploit the parallelism and customization to improve the efficiency of the new computational paradigm in 3D printing with less delay, lower complexity and higher computing power.</AbstractNarration>

Current market trends, such as consumer demand for variety, short product life cycles, high product quality and low cost, have resulted in the need for efficient, responsive, robust and sustainable manufacturing and production paradigm. 3D printing technologies hold the merit of affordability and customizability, while the key challenge in applying 3D printing for mass customization in real life is how to reduce the lead time per unit. The lead time of 3D printing a product unit comes from two sources, i.e., the pre-fabrication computation and manufacturing process. The pre-fabrication computation is increasingly significant and becomes the bottleneck in the manufacturing flow of mass customization in 3D Printing. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project looks to address this problem through new computational methods with potential for orders of magnitude reduction in time for pre-fabrication computation.</p> <p>In the past two years, the team has investigated a set of multi-fold methodologies of accelerating 3D printing pre-fabrication, and evaluated the approaches in the real-world 3D testbench. Results indicate that the proposed software/hardware combined method can speed up the computational process of 3D printing pre-fabrication with two orders of magnitudes. This result is a breakthrough because traditional acceleration methods, i.e., parallelism (e.g., GPU) and customization (e.g., ASIC), can only speed up 2-5 times, and our approach far outperforms all state-of-the-art acceleration methods in the literature. Related research products lead to 9 peer-reviewed conference papers (in IEEE, ACM, and ASME) and 4 journal papers, including one best paper nomination. Our team also has won two highly competitive international design competition awards. The breakthrough in this EAGER project holds the potential to fundamentally address the computational challenges in current and future additive manufacturing and will generate a far-reaching impact in the CISE technology of manufacturing applications.</p> <p>In this EAGER project, the team also organizes a set of synergistic activities in educational and research communities as follows:</p> <p>(1) The team outreaches to pre-college institutes and under-represented groups. For example, in the summer of 2015 and 2016, the team organizes a &ldquo;Tinker Camp&rdquo; workshop, a one-week summer engineering camp for high school girls (30 participants). In May 2017, the team organizes a 3D printing workshop for middle school students accompanied by their parents. In September 2017, the team is invited to one local primary school to introduce emerging 3D printing technology to the students. These activities have greatly sparked the students&rsquo; interest in STEM fields.</p> <p>(2) The team is actively participating in the instruction of the entry-level introductory course IE 101/CSE111: Discover 3D Printing. The team has developed a tutorial module for 3D printing and received very positive student feedback. The PIs designed subsequent research training projects for the Center for Undergraduate Research &amp; Creative Activities (CURCA) at UB and has received many applications from freshmen and sophomores. To date, one undergraduate student has published and presented his work on 3D printing in ACM APSys 2016 and ACM ASPLOS 2017.</p> <p>(3) The team engages the graduate students to participate in multiple aspects of the project to broaden their range of scientific skills. In addition, the PIs highly promote the public awareness of 3D printing. In 2016, they co-advised a group of students to participate in Singapore International 3D Printing Competitions with an overarching mission to promote awareness and adoption of 3D printing technologies. The team won the top prize (over 100 teams participated from 9 countries, and we are the only Winner for Shoe - Open Category). In addition, the PIs guided another group of students to participate in the International Hardware Design Contest sponsored by ACM SIGDA and Lattice titled ``Towards FPGA-based Collision Detection Accelerator for 3D Printing Safety'' and won the Second Prize.</p> <p>(4) The PIs are committed to AM workforce development. By establishing a hands-on training program and proactively involving students in research, the PIs generate skilled professionals in 3D printing technologies. For instance, the collaborative team has already advised multiple students, who have earned positions in 3D printing sectors. Since 2015, the team has organized multiple open-house activities through the UB digital manufacturing lab to industry, state and local government, start-ups, and the general public. In addition, the team has established strong connections with local and global 3D printing companies (e.g., <em>Vader Systems</em>, <em>Great Lakes Orthodontics</em>, <em>Postprocessing Inc</em>., <em>3Digital LLC</em>.).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/09/2017<br>      Modified by: Wenyao&nbsp;Xu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547167/1547167_10393297_1512834646797_3dp4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547167/1547167_10393297_1512834646797_3dp4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="3D Printing Acceleration"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547167/1547167_10393297_1512834646797_3dp4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="3D Printing Acceleration"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Computational Challenges in 3D printing and Benchmarking</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wenyao Xu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wenyao&nbsp;Xu</div> <div class="imageTitle">3D Printing Acceleration</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547167/1547167_10393297_1512834746795_3dp5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547167/1547167_10393297_1512834746795_3dp5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Geometrical Reuse"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547167/1547167_10393297_1512834746795_3dp5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Geometrical Reuse"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A Geometrical Matching and Reuse Approach to Accelerate Slicing in 3D Printing</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wenyao Xu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wenyao&nbsp;Xu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Geometrical Reuse</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547167/1547167_10393297_1512834850848_3dp6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547167/1547167_10393297_1512834850848_3dp6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Side Channel Vulnerability"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547167/1547167_10393297_1512834850848_3dp6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Side Channel Vulnerability"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Studying side-channel vulnerabilities in 3D printing, receiving over 100 media reports.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wenyao Xu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wenyao&nbsp;Xu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Side Channel Vulnerability</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547167/1547167_10393297_1512834944089_3dp1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547167/1547167_10393297_1512834944089_3dp1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Outreach Activities"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1547167/1547167_10393297_1512834944089_3dp1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Outreach Activities"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Annual Tinker Camp -
