<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;PI: Xie, Huikai&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1512531&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how cellular, physiological, and anatomical changes in the brain alter behavior is one of the great challenges in basic neuroscience. An informative approach to linking brain and behavior is to continuously examine brain structure and function in actively behaving animals. The objective of this project is to develop a novel miniature two-photon microscopy (fTPM)  probe and use it to image and gain insight of neural activity and anatomy in awake, freely moving animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While fiber-optic two-photon microscopy (fTPM) approaches have shown promise for brain imaging in a natural state, current iterations lack efficient 3D-scanning capabilities and are not amenable for use in mice, the premier model for the mechanistic dissection of neural circuit function in the mammalian brain. The miniaturization of the probe is enabled by a unique electrothermal MEMS actuator design for both lateral and axial laser scanning. Specific tasks are (1) to develop a miniature MEMS-based fiber-optic probe with built-in full 3D scanning capability; (2) to validate the performance of the probe by performing chronic in vivo imaging of fine neural structure in cortical and deep-brain tissue in mice; and (3) to image and analyze neuronal morphology and activity, in awake, freely moving mice over time, using the miniature probe.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;Understanding how cellular, physiological, and anatomical changes in the brain alter behavior is one of the great challenges in basic neuroscience. An informative approach to linking brain and behavior is to continuously examine brain structure and function in actively behaving animals. While fiber-optic two-photon microscopy (fTPM) approaches have shown promise for brain imaging in a natural state, current fTPMs lack efficient 3D-scanning capabilities and are still too heavy for use in mice, the premier model for the mechanistic dissection of neural circuit function in the mammalian brain. The objective of this project is to develop a novel miniature fTPM probe and use it to image and gain insight of neural activity and anatomy in awake, freely moving mice.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miniaturization of the fTPM probe was enabled by a unique electrothermal MEMS actuator design for both lateral and axial laser scanning. The tasks of this project were divided into two parts: MEMS device development and fTPM probe development. On the MEMS development side, a new Al/silicon dioxide bimorph actuator design with high stiffness was proposed and validated experimentally. Both 2-axis scanning MEMS mirrors with large scan angle and z-axis scanning MEMS stages with high robustness were demonstrated. To further enhance the robustness of z-axis MEMS stages for loading microlenses, a unique copper/tungsten (Cu/W) bimorph actuator design was proposed and demonstrated 5x stiffness enhancement experimentally. Robust z-axis MEMS stages based on Cu/W bimorphs were successfully fabricated and applied to the fTPM probes. On the fTPM probe development side, the tasks for realizing all-MEMS 3D TPM imaging were divided into three phases: MEMS mirror-only TPM for lateral-axis scan, MEMS lens-only TPM for z-axis axial depth scan, and MEMS mirror/lens TPM for both lateral-axis and z-axis scan for 3D TPM imaging. Firstly, a TPM probe with a MEMS mirror was designed and assembled and its TPM imaging ability was verified by directly mounting it under a commercial TPM system. Next, a TPM probe with a microlens packaged on a Cu/W MEMS stage was designed and assembled. After that, a compact and MEMS-based fiber-optic TPM (fTPM) probe with a polymer fiber, a single-mode fiber, and a MEMS mirror was deisgned and assembled; all the mounting parts of this MEMS fTPM were 3D printed. Finally, a MEMS fTPM with a MEMS mirror for lateral scan and a MEMS lens for z-axis scan was designed and assembled. More testing and animal imaging experiments will be conducted with this all-MEMS 3D scanning fTPM.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/12/2019<br>      Modified by: Huikai&nbsp;Xie</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512531/1512531_10358353_1559635928952_Fig2-MEMSstage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512531/1512531_10358353_1559635928952_Fig2-MEMSstage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MEMS piston-scanning stage"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512531/1512531_10358353_1559635928952_Fig2-MEMSstage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="MEMS piston-scanning stage"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Chip size: 3.8mm x 3.8mmCentral aperture: 1.8mm in diameterTotal stiffness of the actuators: 6.9 N/mResonant frequency: 0.6 kHzMaximum vertical displacement: 124 umMaximum drive voltage: 5 V.</div> <div class="imageCredit">L.
