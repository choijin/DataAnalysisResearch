<AbstractNarration>This proposal will support U.S. Ph.D. students working in robotics the opportunity to share their knowledge and interact with each other and more senior researchers, to learn about different sub-fields within robotics, to meet potential employers, and to become apprised of new technology that will be demonstrated by vendors. This goal will be accomplished by partially supporting the travel costs for U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), which is one of the two flagship conference of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. The conference attracts an international group of attendees that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project funded a selected group of Ph.D. students from the US to attend the IEEE  International Conference on  Robotics and Automation (ICRA), held in Seattle, Washington, from May 26th to 30th, 2015. ICRA is the premier annual conference in robotics sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. It is attended regularly by members of the international community including academicians, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.   Sharing research ideas and collaborating on research projects across national boundaries is becoming critical to accelerate research progress, avoid duplication, and produce a greater return on investment.  The fact the conference is attended by researchers from all over the world exposed the students to different cultures and broadened their professional networks outside their own institution and their own country, preparing the foundations for long term international cooperation and better cultural awareness.  The students funded by this project have received unique and highly valuable training.  Students had multiple opportunities to interact with other students and researchers from all over the world.  Being able to interact with the scientific leaders of the robotics research community gave the students a deeper appreciation for the importance of the field, and a better understanding of the cutting edge technology that is being developed.  A valuable part of training new researchers is giving them the opportunity to interact with leaders in their research field outside their own research group.  This helps the students see their work in a broader context, and gives them the opportunity to make new connections and receive unbiased feedback on their research.
