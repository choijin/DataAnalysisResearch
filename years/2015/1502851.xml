<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Thomas Fai is "Modeling and Simulation of Deformable Cells in Microfluidic Devices." The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Chris Rycroft.</AbstractNarration>

The models of the red blood cell used biological imaging data obtained using a recently developed technique known as cryo-electron microscopy.
