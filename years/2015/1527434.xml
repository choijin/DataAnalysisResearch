<AbstractNarration>We often need to make collective decisions: who will represent us as president, where will we all go out for dinner tonight, who will receive the award, and so on. Similar problems are faced in multiagent systems in artificial intelligence. What are the best procedures for reaching such decisions? The agents could vote over the outcome, but what should the exact procedure be? This is studied in the theories of social choice and mechanism design, with the latter focusing particularly on agents that act strategically in their own self-interest. However, an ever-increasing amount of activity is moving online, and collective decision making is no exception. For example, we rate or vote on content, products, and people online. Key aspects of these novel applications are not present in the traditional models of social choice and mechanism design. For example, in an Internet-based mechanism, who gets to and who will participate? How can we know that a single agent is not participating multiple times? How can we allow agents to meaningfully participate when the number of voting events is potentially overwhelming? The proposed research aims to extend the traditional models to incorporate these aspects and to develop new algorithmic and other techniques to ensure outcomes are meaningful and increase economic efficiency and human welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many domains, multiple self-interested agents need to make a collective decision. The theory of social choice concerns how such collective decisions should be made. Closely related, the theory of mechanism design concerns how to design mechanisms for such problems that result in good outcomes even when agents behave strategically. In recent years, major progress has been made on understanding the computational aspects of both social choice and mechanism design. In the proposed research, the PI and his team set out to adapt these techniques to novel domains such as those enabled by the Internet or the availability of new data. For example, one key issue is the identity of the participating agents. In an Internet-based mechanism, who gets to and who will participate? How can we know that a single agent is not participating multiple times? The PI and his team aim to address such issues with techniques based on social network structure, as well as on the effort that agents expend participating. Another key issue is the possibility of agents strategically providing inaccurate data. Again, explicit modeling of the agents' effort costs in doing so will play a key role.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The theories of social choice and mechanism design concern how to make decisions based on the preferences of multiple individuals (or agents), and provide a useful framework for designing auctions, voting rules, matching mechanisms, etc., that are to be used by strategic agents.  Much progress has been made on understanding the computational aspects of these theories in recent years.  The goal of this project has been to make further progress along these lines, in particular where it concerns extending these techniques to our modern world, where many mechanisms are run over the Internet and we may not have a good sense of each agent's identity, but on the other hand there are many types of data available about the agents.  The techniques developed in this line of research have the potential to significantly improve existing, and introduce entirely new, online voting, rating, and auction mechanisms.  The resulting mechanisms could be more robust to undesirable behavior such as participating under multiple identities, make better use of existing data, and give users the right incentives to report relevant data.  The project has produced several major research outcomes.  First, within computational social choice, we made significant progress on algorithms for aggregating judgments about how entities or activities compare quantitatively ("Doing A is x times as bad as doing B" where the value of x is the judgment).  We provided theoretical justification for a specific rule and showed how to compute its outcomes efficiently.  Because it is not always reasonable to expect individuals to specify such judgments directly and completely, we also studied and showed how to aggregate responses to simpler queries.  Second, we made fundamental contributions to the theory of algorithmic fair allocation and decision making.  Most of the existing literature focused on the fair division of private goods.  We generalized many of these techniques to settings with arbitrary decisions affecting many agents; to settings where new decisions appear over time; and to settings where we need to consider not only the fair treatment of individuals but also of groups.  Third, we made fundamental contributions to mechanism design approaches in machine learning, specifically focusing on settings where we aim to classify something, but the only access we have to data about it is from an entity that has an interest in the result of the classification, and therefore will send us data only strategically.  We studied and characterized when we should ensure that that entity is incentivized to report truthfully, how many samples are required, as well as computational aspects.
