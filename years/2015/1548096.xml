<AbstractNarration>Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program (I-Corps L), this project will develop ways to increase the scale and impact of an experiment authoring system to guide students in designing, conducting, analyzing, and reporting their own experiments.  The Behavioral Research Instruction Through E-Prime (BRITE) project is designed to integrate research methods, design, and analysis instruction in a series of modules that build upon one another. The key feature of the project is that each module provides students with hands-on experiential applications of behavioral research. Each module includes the activities of research according to the scientific method culminating in the students designing, conducting, analyzing, and reporting their own experiments. The application of the E-PrimeÂ® experiment authoring system provides students with a high-powered research tool that they need to produce high quality, current research to answer questions they will find interesting. The curriculum integrates the different parts of behavioral research and carefully sequences them to build skills and understanding in an appropriate timeline. Having students conduct current research using E-Prime helps them gain competence and develop positive attitudes toward experimental behavioral research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BRITE research modules to be scaled to a larger user base will promote flexibility of implementation so that faculty in universities, small colleges, and community colleges can apply them over one or two semesters, with or without a formal laboratory.  Online delivery is anticipated and modules will be supported by a student access to E-Prime and possible textbook bundles. In addition to the student materials, there will be online support materials, and a help system for course instructors. The project is innovative in that is integrates the necessary skills for research making them current, accessible, hands-on, and interesting for students. The E-Prime software gives students the tools needed to precisely manipulate variables via computational resources widely available to students and accurately measure behaviors including reaction times. An engaged student learning method such as the BRITE program help students to apply the concepts they learn, solidifying learning gains and helping students to become competent research scientists.</AbstractNarration>

Through prior NSF funding a one-semester lab course integrating student driven E-Prime behavioral experiments was shown effective in giving students at one small liberal arts college the skills, competencies, and knowledge they need to succeed in science careers. I-Corps L gave the project team the tools needed to engage in an entrepreneurial approach to disseminating this curriculum.</p> <p>The PI, Entrepreneurial Lead, and Business mentor conducted over 120 customer discovery interviews in summer 2015. The value propositions of improved science skills, critical thinking and attitudes were important to our potential market segment but they did not believe the curriculum would work for them. The obstacles to curriculum adoption include perceived student abilities, faculty technology skills, faculty time, lack of technology facilities for undergraduate education, and intransigence in the current curricular structure. Faculty members wanted a single course module that introduced research to new students in introductory and/or first year seminar courses. They wanted to improve students&rsquo; critical thinking about research and general attitudes toward science.</p> <p>The project team made a major pivot and developed the BRITE Lite minimum viable product (MVP) concept. The PI developed a single class instructional module incorporating a real experiment as the central illustration. Students were pretested on statistical reasoning, participated in an E-Prime experiment on the Poker Face Effect, receive a lecture with the experiment and the results of their class as the example, compared to results of other classes, and then post-tested on statistical reasoning. The PI tested the module in both Introductory Psychology and in research design/statistics classes. Students showed improvement in statistical reasoning, but the pre and post tests were not parallel. By the end of 2015 we had demonstrated that the new MVP was possible when taught by a seasoned instructor to liberal arts psychology students. The Introductory Psychology student attitudes were indirectly assessed through their performance on team experiments presented as posters at the end of the class in lieu of traditional term papers.</p> <p>In order to demonstrate an improvement in critical thinking we needed a better measure. The PI attended an NSF funded CAT (Critical Thinking Assessment Test) trainer training workshop where developed two BRITE CAT Apps to assess critical thinking about experiments. They were validated with the full CAT during Spring 2016. Simultaneously, a new experiment (Survival Memory) was developed and tested using the standard E-Prime computer lab based protocol. This experiment was then translated into an internet based experiment to be delivered via a Meteor server using JavaScript because these technologies work on a variety of personal electronic devices, across platforms. The summer of 2016 was spent solving the many technical problems of running a real experiment over the internet using a variety of devices for data collection and then analyzing that data and incorporating the results (on demand and almost instantly) into teaching materials that could be easily accessed by novice instructors and incorporated into the teaching module. In addition, teaching materials (PowerPoint and Internet Results Display) and a brief teaching guide were written.</p> <p>The new MVP, BRITE Lite, was tested in the second and third weeks of fall 2016 in over 20 first year seminar classes at the same small liberal arts college. It was taught by four upper class students with no prior teaching experience (psychology, physics, computer science and theatre majors). Half the classes were randomly assigned to the treatment groups. They completed a BRITE CAT App critical thinking assessment as a pretest in the session before the module, and as a post test in the session following. The other classes served as the control group and completed both BRITE CAT App forms in the same class. Order of the two forms were counterbalanced. Students in the treatment classes participated in the Survival Memory experiment via their personal electronic devices (mostly smart phones), and were taught the BRITE Lite module by one of the novice instructors. Students in the most of the control classes also received the BRITE Lite instruction because their instructors requested it. The results showed an improvement from the pretest to the post-test across both treatment and control groups, but that the treatment classes improved twice as much. Informal assessment of the instructors showed an improvement in science attitudes.</p> <p>The MVP testing demonstrated that a brief instructional module integrating a real experiment through student owned personal electronic devices can be effectively delivered by total novices and improve students&rsquo; critical thinking about research. &nbsp;Further, research quality data (both memory responses and reaction time) can be collected. In the spring of 2017 the results were reported and new partners for future testing of the module at other institutions were recruited.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/08/2017<br>      Modified by: Sandra&nbsp;K&nbsp;Webster</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1548096/1548096_10378888_1504890486140_britewebmockup--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1548096/1548096_10378888_1504890486140_britewebmockup--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mock Up for BRITE Lite"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1548096/1548096_10378888_1504890486140_britewebmockup--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mock Up for BRITE Lite"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The MVP will be distributed to adoptors via an internet site similar in structure to this mock up.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Image copyright Psychology Software Tools & WCS</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sandra&nbsp;K&nbsp;Webster</div> <div class="imageTitle">Mock Up for BRITE Lite</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1548096/1548096_10378888_1504891281023_Psy101Postersw_Webster_720x480--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1548096/1548096_10378888_1504891281023_Psy101Postersw_Webster_720x480--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Introductory Psychology Research Poster Presentation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1548096/1548096_10378888_1504891281023_Psy101Postersw_Webster_720x480--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Introductory Psychology Research Poster Presentation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Introductory Psychology Students in Poster Presentation of Team Research Projects after completing BRITE Lite</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sandra K.
