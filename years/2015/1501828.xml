<AbstractNarration>Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College (OCtech) will implement the "Advanced Technological Education in Robotics and Automated Manufacturing Program" (ATE-RAMP) with the overarching goal of increasing awareness of opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines for women and underrepresented minorities.  To achieve this goal, the project team will implement a three-step plan focused on awareness, preparation, and career-readiness.  Within the region served by OCtech, interest in STEM careers and student achievement in STEM subjects lags behind the nation and behind many areas within the state of South Carolina. The five counties being targeted for this project are in the top six of South Carolina's forty-six (46) counties with the highest unemployment rates.  Efforts are being made to shore up the lagging economy in the area by recruiting a variety of high tech industries. These employers will need workers with knowledge and skills in STEM subjects, namely robotics and automated manufacturing (AM). Without a skilled workforce to offer, this region of South Carolina will fail to fulfill its potential role as a home to these much needed industries. In partnership with local industry and school districts, ATE-RAMP will help meet current and future workforce needs by attracting and engaging students from poor, rural communities who are not typically exposed to robotics, AM, and STEM career opportunities.  The partnering school districts have significant minority and female student populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are to: (1) introduce opportunities for underrepresented groups to have access to programs involving robotics and AM; (2) provide dual credit courses in robotics and AM for high school students; and (3) expand the course offerings in the computer engineering curriculum at OCtech to include robotics and AM and share developed resources with other colleges.  These objectives will be met through activities including, but not limited to, hosting Vex Robotics teams, competitions, and summer camps for rural K-12 students, deploying traveling robotics and AM demonstrations, adding dual credit courses to the STEM Academy of the Middle College at OCtech, expanding capacity of existing courses to facilitate better hands-on experiences for students, and revising the Associate in Applied Science (AAS) in Engineering Technology to ensure that it produces technicians with marketable skills necessary to work in fields related to robotics and AM.  Achievement of desired goals will be determined by employing mixed methods that assess affective and cognitive outcomes using both quantitative and qualitative data.  The results will help build the knowledge base on promising practices for engaging students from underrepresented groups who live in poor, rural communities in STEM activities, technician programs, and in the workforce.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, 30 postsecondary faculty members will benefit from professional development offered by the project. The South Carolina Technical College System has a Common Course Catalog and all courses will be available through the statewide e-Learning System hosted by OCtech. The infusion of robotics content, as well as the development and implementation of awareness activities, will promote greater access to the high paying STEM careers for all students, including populations that are currently underrepresented in STEM careers.     Outcomes Report Narrative:  The major goal of the ATE-RAMP project was to increase awareness of opportunities in STEM disciplines for women and underrepresented minorities through the development of programs and activities involving robotics and automated manufacturing (AM).  The project addressed the critical need for workers with knowledge and skills in STEM subjects within the area serviced by Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College.  The following three objectives served to stimulate interest and increase awareness of opportunities at all grade levels, and to better prepare students in grades K-14 for careers in the STEM disciplines:  1) Introduce opportunities for underrepresented groups to have access to programs involving robotics and automated manufacturing.  2) Provide dual credit courses in robotics and automated manufacturing for students in grades 9-12.  3) Expand the course offerings in the computer engineering curriculum at OCtech to include robotics and automated manufacturing and share developed resources with other colleges.  The project met or exceeded all planned goals, with notable highlights including:  Exposure of more than 8,000 individuals to robotics and automated manufacturing by way of summer camps and demonstrations/presentation, exceeding projected target by 330%. Steady increase in the number of females participating in the STEM 4-H Engineering Challenge: 37.2% in 2015 to 54.4% in 2017. Nearly half of the teachers participating in the summer professional development workshops were from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups.  Provided meaningful Co-Op and internship experiences including elevation of soft skills (problem solving, teamwork, and time management).   Project interns and co-ops built a simulator, which the project leadership reports saved the College significant funds. The acquisition of trailer wraps increased advertisement of the College's STEM programs. The early introduction of high school students to a core of Robotics and Automated Manufacturing through dual enrollment courses (AMT 105 - Robotics and Automated Controls; AMT 205 - Robotics and Automated Controls II; EGR 112 - LabVIEW; and EGR 130 - Engineering Technology Applications and Programming).   In summary, the project addressed the need for highly skilled automated manufacturing technicians the region through dual credit robotics courses; a variety of outreach experiences including summer camps, robotics team events; and professional development activities.
