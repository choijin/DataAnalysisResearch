<AbstractNarration>A Value-Creation Workshop for NSF's R&amp;D and Commercialization Initiatives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The systematic creation of high-value innovations from research represents a primary path for America to achieve growth, prosperity, meaningful jobs, social responsibility, environmental sustainability, and national security. Today, most measures of innovative success from basic and applied research and other innovation programs are relatively poor. Successful innovation is the result of learning and creating fast; not failing fast, as some believe.  It is a discipline based on both learning-science fundamentals and experiential practice. Successful innovation is a discipline that can be taught, applied, and improved. This initiative is an immersive, hands-on, workshop and coaching program. The workshop uses a value creation playbook, which satisfies the fundamental requirements for innovative success. To be systematically successful, professionals must understand value-creation concepts and language; have fundamental mental frameworks for collecting essential knowledge; and be able to rapidly create new value using learning best practices, such as continuous, unrelenting team-based iteration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial workshop teaches professionals the right questions to ask and gives them the framework for improved R&amp;D and innovative achievement. However, it is the continuous use of these principles that makes the biggest difference. R&amp;D achievement and innovative success are the result of a continuous learning process. Programs that do not require a continuous value-creation process are of limited or no utility. These fundamental principles are the intellectual basis of the workshop. Professionals and students with these innovative skills inevitability become some of the most productive researchers and innovators in their fields. The use of these practices can help catalyze a major competitive advantage for the United States, create a large number of new jobs, and educate the workforce required for our global innovation economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this project was to improve performance and maximize the translation of R&amp;D emanating from NSF Engineering Research Centers (ERC) into commercial value. Towards this end, the Value-Creation Playbook workshops, which formed the core activity conducted within the scope of this grant, taught: (1) innovation and value-creation skills (2) customer and market focus, and (3) the use of effective value-creation processes. Recognizing that NSF researchers and industry partners are superbly capable in their technical domains, this project sought to impart the knowledge and skills required to be fully successful in the global economy. By introducing researchers and commercial partners to the Value-Creation Playbook, the project focused on the "how" (rather than the "what") of innovation: how to better formulate value propositions; how to more fully understand the fundamentals of value creation; and how to most effectively create new products and ventures from R&amp;D and commercialization efforts.  To master the value-creation process, thirty-one ERC program participants from eleven institutions attended the following workshops as part of the Centers? initiation process:   An      introductory Value-Creation Playbook workshop held at NSF as part      of the two day ERC kick-off meeting. Follow-up Value-Creation Playbook consultation with Centers' teams      as they completed their ERC startup process.   At the workshops, ERC leadership team members comprised of Principal Investigators (PIs), scientists, and commercialization partners engaged in a process of: (1) identifying and understanding customer and market needs (2) articulating value-creation around the Center's area of research focus, and 3) engaging corporate partners and investors. The following ERC teams were represented at the workshops: Power Optimization for Electro-Thermal Systems (POETS), Nanosystems for Nanotechnology Enabled Water Treatment (NEWT), and Center for Bio-mediated and Bio-inspired Geotechnics (CBBG).   The Value-Creation Playbook workshops deepened participants? understanding of the "how to" of turning R&amp;D into commercially viable products with high value to customers that maximize opportunities in the global marketplace. The Workshops' agenda included:    Customer and market focus - recognizing that NSF Center teams are extremely capable in their technical domains, the workshops addressed customer and market knowledge, and preparing participants for greater success in the global economy.  Innovation fundamentals - addressing the fundamentals of customer value, value creation, and commercialization, the workshops demonstrated how continuous, proactive feedback and iteration from team members in "Value Creation Forums" allows teams/ventures to rapidly create value for their customers and stakeholders. Value propositions - to ensure teams understand the essentials of a compelling, quantitative value proposition that provides the framework for all the NSF Centers' work (including fundamental research, enabling technology research, integrated systems proof-of-concept research, and translational research for commercialization). Global innovation economy - addressing the standards for competing in the global innovation economy. Clarifying goals, objectives and milestones - to strengthen R&amp;D and commercialization efforts, the workshop and follow-on consultation helped teams to clarify goals, objectives and milestones for their Center partners to ensure that teams are aligned and able to effectively identify the other partners and skill sets required for their initiatives to be successful.   Included among a number of significant results, the Value Creation Playbook Workshops guided participants in articulating the right questions to ask and provided the framework for improved R&amp;D and commercialization.
