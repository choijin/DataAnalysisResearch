<AbstractNarration>1511959&lt;br/&gt;Boccelli&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real-time modeling of drinking water distribution systems has the potential to provide several benefits for water utilities by improving energy management, water quality maintenance, and response activities. While most utilities have a network model for planning purposes, these models are "static" and not amenable for making real-time decisions. Thus, there is a critical need to develop a real-time modeling framework that can estimate and forecast the unobserved demands that drive network dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop a composite demand-hydraulic model - one that couples a demand model with a network hydraulic solver - capable of being updated in real-time using observed hydraulic information. The central hypothesis is that the observed hydraulic data commonly collected via utility computer systems can be used to estimate the expected values and uncertainty of a structured demand model that characterizes the temporal and spatial patterns of consumptive demands. The rationale for developing the real-time composite demand-hydraulic model is to provide a framework to inform real-time analytics and decision support associated with our drinking water distribution systems. Collectively, these outcomes will produce a holistic approach for real-time demand estimation and forecasting through the development of the composite demand-hydraulic model and monitoring placement algorithm. The long-term positive impacts of this project will result from the ability provide real-time demand estimates and forecasts that will lead to real-time analysis and decision support tools such as pump scheduling to minimize energy usage, rapid main break detection, and spread forecasting of contamination events to better identify response and mitigation activities. The PIs will strengthen the link between academic research and industrial entrepreneurship to provide opportunities to the students through: 1) providing industrial research opportunities to both graduate and undergraduate students to extend our research and development activities; 2) developing and distributing our software through open-source activities to further enhance the opportunities within our field; and, 3) introducing a broader range of students to technology transfer and the opportunities and challenges associated with industrial research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Water utilities must ensure that our water infrastructure are sustainable, robust and resilient to both long- and short-term challenges.  Long-term challenges (e.g., climate change, population shifts) are likely to be addressed through changes in infrastructure design.  However, short-term challenges (e.g., energy management, main break detection, intrusion events) can be addressed through real-time monitoring and decision support.  The objective of this project was to develop a composite demand-hydraulic modeling framework that can estimate and forecast consumer demands - which are the driving force behind how water moves through the network - in real-time.  However, utilities do not generally collect detailed consumer demand data at time-scales needed for making operational decisions. Thus, the demands need to be estimated using data routinely collected by utilities (e.g. flow rates, pressure, tank levels, etc).  Figure 1 shows an example real-world network that represents over 12000 consumer demand locations, but only has six flow measurements (Q), nine pressure measurements (P) and two tank levels (T).  Unfortunately, the available data is insufficient to estimate the demands at 12000 consumer nodes, and the associated demands need to be grouped (or clustered) to devise an approach to capture some of the spatial distribution of consumer use while allowing for demand estimation to be performed.  Thus, the project outcomes are two-fold: 1) the development and assessment of clustering algorithms to effectively reduce the size of the estimation problem, and 2) the development of an integrated framework for estimating and forecasting clustered demands in real-time.  Our approach for clustering consumer demands rely on two different types of information: 1) sensitivity data - that allow consumer demands to be grouped to ensure the clustered demands can be estimated using the existing, limited data, and 2) exogenous information - that can include, for example, census-based information that allow consumer demands to be grouped based on similarity of the end-user.  Using the clustered consumer demands, the composite demand-hydraulic framework is able to generate real-time demand estimates and forecasts.  The unique aspect of the overall framework is the link between the estimated consumer demands and a time series modeling framework, which is capable of describing the temporal relationships in consumer demands.  The demand estimation framework works in two stages.  The first stage estimates the clustered demands based on current network measurements.  The second stage uses the demand estimates to update the parameters of individual time series models.  The latter is an important step as the resulting time series model, which is based on observed information, allows for consumer demands and the associated uncertainties to be forecast.  Figure 2 presents an illustrative example with the consumer nodes from the network in Figure 1 clustered into four regions, which was needed to provide a feasible demand estimation problem.  The inset shows the estimated demands (solid line) and uncertainty (blue shading) through hour 168, as well as the forecasted demands (dashed line) and uncertainty (pink shading) for the next 24-hours for a real-world network.  These results are intended to illustrate the output of the composite demand-hydraulic model.  The forecast demands and uncertainty provide the flexibility to forecast system-wide dynamics with hydraulic and/or water quality objectives.  The forecasts of the consumer demands and resulting system states provide a platform for the further development and implementation of real-time applications to assist utility operations.  These applications include, for example, generating pumping schedules that minimize energy costs while maintaining hydraulic reliability, providing response activity guidance for possible intrusion events such as cross-contamination events, and making operational decisions to improve water quality such as disinfectant residual maintenance or minimizing harmful disinfectant by-products.
