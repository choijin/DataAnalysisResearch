<AbstractNarration>This research is targeted to improve our understanding of the processes occurring within supercell thunderstorms that control the development of rotation at the surface, its possible intensification, and the evolution of the circulations thereafter using state-of-the-art observations from the Second Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX2) and a hierarchy of numerical models.  The generation of midlevel rotation in supercell storms is well understood, but there are a number of outstanding questions pertaining to the development of rotation at low levels and the subsequent intensification of that rotation to tornado strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of this research are&lt;br/&gt;- To examine how low-level circulation in supercells is controlled by the storm environment and buoyancy of the outflow&lt;br/&gt;- To investigate how environmental heterogeneity and storm interactions influence the development and evolution of low-level rotation&lt;br/&gt;- To determine how surface friction affects the development of near-surface vertical vorticity&lt;br/&gt;- To explore the origins of small-scale outflow "surges" and descending precipitation shafts on the supercell's rear flank and their influence on the development and evolution of low-level rotation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Despite having a good grasp of how vertical wind shear and instability in a storm's environment promote updraft rotation, scientists still lack a thorough understanding of how many other aspects of a storm's environment, including environmental heterogeneity, influence the development and maintenance of low-level rotation in supercell storms. Even less is known about how storm interactions, sudden precipitation impulses, and outflow surges affect low-level rotation.  Moreover, scientists are just now scratching the surface on how surface friction might be an important source of angular momentum for developing tornadoes (as opposed to simply playing an "indirect" role in tornadogenesis by enhancing near-surface convergence of angular momentum that arises through other means).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;A greater understanding of tornado genesis, maintenance, and demise will have a broad impact on our ability to predict and warn of these severe weather events and to reduce casualties.  The migration of National Weather Service (NWS) warning issuance from counties to more flexible polygons now affords the opportunity to tailor the size of the warning (and, implicitly, the duration of the warning) to the expected longevity of the tornado.  This research may help improve the guidance that can be used by forecasters to anticipate how long a tornado might last.  In addition to communicating findings to the academic community at conferences, both PIs have been directly involved with the transfer of new knowledge to the NWS via seminars.  Both PIs also have been active in a wide range of outreach activities, including briefing the Congressional Natural Hazards Caucus, briefing the National Academies Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate, serving as science advisers for an IMAX film on tornadoes, developing K-12 educational materials, giving talks to nonscientist groups (e.g., elementary schools, storm spotters, etc.), and developing museum exhibits.</AbstractNarration>

Additionally, when this 0-1km shear is increased in time as a storm matures, stronger vortices are produced than in simulations for which this shear does not increase in time.  These differences are tied to changes in the storm, including stronger rotation at the 1 km AGL level and greater ability to contract (e.g., "spin-up") the near-surface rotation.  A storm’s response to increasing shear is sensitive to the timing of the shear increase.  These findings are helpful for understanding the changing tornadic potential of storms during the early evening transition (i.e., the period near sunset) when shear often increases.     We next investigated the reasons that a nearly tornadic case from the VORTEX2 field campaign failed to produce a tornado, using wind observations from mobile radar along with in situ thermodynamic measurements from instrumented cars.  Several factors resulted in the inability to produce a tornado: outflow underneath the storm was quite cold, air did not follow a favorable trajectory to result in rotation reaching the area where it could be amplified to tornado strength, and there was an unfavorable orientation of the shear within the near-storm environment, leading to weaker upward motion above the near-surface circulation.  Understanding the reasons for tornado failure in marginal environments is crucial for improving tornado warnings.     As a supplement to this grant, we were able to develop and deploy a new method for obtaining temperature, humidity, and pressure measurements above ground within supercell storms using sensors that approximately follow the air current within the storm.  These were the first 3-D measurements of this type ever obtained in a supercell storm, and more measurements like these will be crucial for understanding tornado formation.     This project also included a study of the effects of terrain (hills, mountains) on tornado potential within supercell thunderstorms.  Computer simulations are necessary because in the case of observed storms passing over terrain features, it is not possible to know how the storms would have behaved in the absence of terrain.  However, in computer simulations, the terrain can be removed while keeping everything else the same.  Our study found that tornado potential can be enhanced within eastward-moving supercell storms that pass over the southern flank of a hill/mountain.  If tornadoes occur owing to terrain-enhancement effects, they tend to occur on the southeast slope of the hill, or occasionally east of the hill/mountain.  However, the outcome is very sensitive to small changes in the track of the storm relative to the terrain feature.         Lastly, the project included a study of how localized cold anomalies can influence tornadoes.  Such "surges" of cold air frequently occur in thunderstorms in conjunction with downdrafts or rain shafts.  In high-resolution computer simulations of surges introduced near tornadoes (or developing, incipient tornadoes), it was found that weak cold surges, associated with cold pockets less than 2 degrees Celsius colder than the ambient temperature, could temporarily intensify tornadoes.  However, strong cold surges, associated with cold pockets 2 or more degrees Celsius colder than the ambient temperature, abruptly weakened tornadoes, though occasionally the abrupt weakening was preceded by brief intensification similar to the case of a weak cold surge.  The outcome seems to depend on a delicate balance: a well-positioned cold surge can force existing angular momentum nearer to the axis of rotation (like forcing a figure skater to draw their arms inward), but cold air's eventual ingestion into the overlying storm updraft can weaken the updraft and facilitate the storm's demise.  The findings have implications for understanding short-term tornado behavior and perhaps even the prediction of tornado formation.
