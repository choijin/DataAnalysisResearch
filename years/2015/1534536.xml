<AbstractNarration>Do local communities continue to constrain moral choices and actions in an increasingly interconnected world? Globalization has altered the terrain of communities everywhere. Borders appear less distinct as markers of place or of a unique cultural identity. At the same time, people remain embedded in influential social, kin, and religious networks. How do people respond to these different and often conflicting pressures? Their responses, sometimes benign but also sometimes terrorist, increasingly affect us all. Examining the micro-processes through which people at the local level adapt their absolutist moral systems to changing configurations of self, community, and nation will provide critically important data for social scientific theory of how globalization affects and produces morally grounded action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research funded by this award is framed by these questions. The researcher, anthropologist Dr. Lauren Meeker (State University of New York, New Paltz), will undertake an ethnographic study of the relationship between social belonging and moral personhood. The field research  will be conducted in a village community in rural northern Vietnam. This is an excellent site in which to pursue these questions because this very traditional village was affected by the government's previous rules against the traditional rituals that ground their moral system. Now, although they are again able to perform the rituals, the government is promoting such activities as national heritage, a Western concept introduced through globalization. The researcher focuses on two broad questions: First, how is contemporary moral personhood negotiated, embodied, and shaped in and across popular Buddhist, communal, and lineage rituals in the village? Second, what do local ritual practices reveal about the relationship between heritage, place and identity in post-reform Vietnam? Data will be gathered through participant observation in daily life and at the annual village festival and other important rituals, as well as semi-structured and informal interviews with ritual experts and participants. The researcher will study how morality is defined and expressed and how perceptions of morality coincide or differ across ritual contexts. In addition, she will document and look at the effects of changing social ties in the village, in particular those resulting from recent attempts by lineage elders to expand extra-village connections. Understanding how villagers are responding to intensified and broader contact with others and how they reconcile those responses with moral responsibility to their local community is a central goal of this investigation into how conceptions of moral personhood are shaped and expressed through local practices affected by external interventions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research project is an ethnographic study of the relationship between social belonging and moral personhood as expressed and constructed through contemporary local ritual practice in a village in the Red River Delta of Vietnam. Two significant findings emerged out of the analysis of lineage and ritual data collected for the project: 1) Villagers place a high value on local historical practice, as conducted by a number of male elders in the village. Their activities include historical inquiry (seeking to understand, in particular, lineage histories), the collection of documentation of village and lineage history, and teaching history to village youth in the context of ritual. Exploring these historical practices ethnographically has led to a deeper understanding of how locals understand and construct cultural identity and that the practice of local history is a central component local practice of culture. This local construction of cultural identity provides an important counterpoint to national and provincial constructions of culture as &ldquo;heritage,&rdquo; which are unsatisfactory to explain local expressions and experiences of cultural identity. 2) The ethnographic data on ritual practices across several domains of village life (lineage, communal and popular Buddhist ritual), provide insight into how moral personhood is negotiated by individuals, who are simultaneously&nbsp;situated&nbsp;in what are sometimes conflicting moral systems. It became apparent that moral personhood in the village is not simply a matter of prioritizing moral actions according to a hierarchy of moral systems (such as those belonging to family, lineage, village life, religion), or even of acting out of practical necessity. Rather, moral personhood is a process of negotiating one&rsquo;s responsibilities such that one can bring together and reconcile overlapping and conflicting moral positions. This became particularly evident through work with women, who continually have to negotiate their insider/outsider status in the context of a patrilineal society. Interestingly, situations in which women have to maintain a moral stance in two different moral systems (such as a woman's role as daughter-in-law in a lineage and as a teacher or representative of the state), are felt to be moments of heightened responsibility in which their moral status is, if not in jeopardy, open to scrutiny and potential censure.
