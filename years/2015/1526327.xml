<AbstractNarration>This National Robotics Initiative (NRI) project conducted at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University will develop a set of instructional materials and related design competitions focused on the design of soft, co-robotic devices, and to evaluate their impact upon students' attitudes towards and understanding of engineering and science subjects through online instruments for large-scale data collection.  Introductory robotics teaching and outreach typically focuses on task-based applications in which robots are isolated from humans, rather than closely cooperating with them. Combining soft robotic technology with applications involving human interaction and the use of social and people-centric applications is expected to attract a more diverse population to the study of STEM (science, technology, mathematics, and engineering) subjects.  The proposed research incorporates a substantial mechanical design component with the aim of engaging students interested in this topic, who are not served by education and outreach programs that typically emphasize the software and electronic aspects of robotics design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will expose learners to subjects typically neglected in introductory robotic design experiences, such as material selection and manufacturing, and encourage participation by students with a broader range of interests and aptitudes. To evaluate the impact of the proposed instructional materials and design competitions, this research will include an emphasis on instruments for data collection and evaluation by drawing on best practice in evaluation and combining tools that have been developed, tested, and validated in the literature into a single online platform that will be shared publicly with educators and researchers.  The proposed research will contribute to an improved understanding of the factors influencing high school and undergraduate students' motivation to pursue STEM careers, and in particular the influence of application areas on students' perception of science and technology.  The compilation of a set of data collection and evaluation instruments will result in a platform for quantifying the impact of this research as well as other approaches to robotics education and outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For this research, we developed a set of instructional materials and activities focused on the design of soft, co-robotic devices, and evaluated their impact upon students? attitudes towards and understanding of engineering and science subjects. The differentiating aspect of the educational kits and activities we developed is that they incorporate substantial mechanical design, manufacturing, and material selection components. As part of this project, we grew the Soft Robotics Toolkit (<a href="http://softroboticstoolkit.com/">http://softroboticstoolkit.com</a>) platform, an online collection of shared tools to support research and design in the area of soft robotics. To date, the site as had 2,647,000+ page views (~600,000+ in 2019), users from 195 Countries, 414 average visits per day, 34,600+ file downloads, and 283,000+ distinct users.</p> <p>In order to increase the accessibility of these materials, we launched a ?Resources for Educators? section of the toolkit website, which supports the distribution of materials specifically for educators. Our low-cost educational fabrication guides have been downloaded over 2,960 times as part of this project. Our interactions with educators using the guides highlighted the need for additional materials to help them bring these activities into their teaching environments. The four activities now include worksheets with questionnaires for students, detailed video tutorials, and a version of the guides specifically for educators with notes and suggestions for successful integration of soft robotics materials into classrooms and workshops.&nbsp;</p> <p>Beyond putting materials online, we also developed physical versions of the soft robotics educational kits to be used in workshops. We created a multi-stage soft robotic instructional kit that grows with students as they advance in age and ability. Specifically, for this we created a soft robotic grasper. Beginning with a simple introduction to manual soft robots, students learn mechanical design and experiment with new materials and fabrication processes. As a student advances, there are two additional levels that facilitate exploring electronics and programming.</p> <p>Our team developed and ran a number of workshops and outreach events for students and educators, inviting the majority of participants from low-income and underserved communities. The goal was to promote access to STEM programming that can help benefit student exposure and foster interest to the field. The workshops also provided pilot testing opportunities for our instructional materials, ensuring they are accessible and useful towards lowering the barrier of entry for students into STEM fields.</p> <p>&nbsp;Finally, as part of our outreach and community building efforts, we ran yearly ?Soft Robotics Design Competitions? and ?Prize for Contributions in Soft Robotics Research?. We have had 800+ individuals participate in the competitions and many new materials added to the online resources as part of the Soft Robotics Toolkit online platform, with twenty four research groups from around the world contributing. Data was collected to evaluate the impact on, attitudes, and self-efficacy of high school and college participants before and after participation in the competition.</p> <p>By focusing efforts on combining soft robotic technology with applications involving human interaction, we aligned educational activities with the goals of the National Robotics Initiative. Our experience is that the use of social and people-centric applications can attract a more diverse population to the study of STEM subjects.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/04/2019<br>      Modified by: Conor&nbsp;Walsh</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494593850_Fig1Kitoverview2018--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494593850_Fig1Kitoverview2018--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Kit overview"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494593850_Fig1Kitoverview2018--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Kit overview"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Kit overview</div> <div class="imageCredit">Walsh and Holland</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Conor&nbsp;Walsh</div> <div class="imageTitle">Kit overview</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494640214_Fig2Kitoverview2019--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494640214_Fig2Kitoverview2019--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Kit overview 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494640214_Fig2Kitoverview2019--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Kit overview 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Manual gripper</div> <div class="imageCredit">Walsh and Holland</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Conor&nbsp;Walsh</div> <div class="imageTitle">Kit overview 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494680799_Fig3SDMFingerPaper--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494680799_Fig3SDMFingerPaper--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494680799_Fig3SDMFingerPaper--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Supplies</div> <div class="imageCredit">Walsh and Holland</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Conor&nbsp;Walsh</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494725583_Fig4StrategiesPaper--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494725583_Fig4StrategiesPaper--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494725583_Fig4StrategiesPaper--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Strategies</div> <div class="imageCredit">Walsh and Holland</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Conor&nbsp;Walsh</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig 4</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494755541_Fig5Workshops-2019--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494755541_Fig5Workshops-2019--rgov-800width.jpg" title="fig 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494755541_Fig5Workshops-2019--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="fig 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Workshop image</div> <div class="imageCredit">Walsh and Holland</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Conor&nbsp;Walsh</div> <div class="imageTitle">fig 5</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494797056_Fig6Workshops-2019--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494797056_Fig6Workshops-2019--rgov-800width.jpg" title="fig 6"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526327/1526327_10386512_1575494797056_Fig6Workshops-2019--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="fig 6"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Workshop image</div> <div class="imageCredit">Walsh and Holland</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Conor&nbsp;Walsh</div> <div class="imageTitle">fig 6</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
