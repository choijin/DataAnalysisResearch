<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to improve the resolution of numerical algorithms for the recovery of sources, obstacles, and medium characteristics from exterior measurements of various physical fields found in biomedicine, economics, geophysics, and material science. In particular, the results will dramatically enhance the quality of a cheap, fast, and safe diagnostic method called electrical impedance tomography. Examples of specific applications include deriving algorithms for finding volatility of financial markets and monitoring the economy, performing the non-invasive evaluation of protein in ion channels, and prospecting elastic structures for residual stress, which can determine the aging or defects of materials and the elastic parameters of the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, there is a great need for better resolution in electrical impedance tomography. This project seeks improvements for this method using higher frequency data for the complete Maxwell system by its reduction to a vectorial Schroedinger equation and using complex and real geometrical optics solutions of this system. To make progress, the principal investigator uses anisotropic reductions to mainly upper-triangular systems and uses the second large parameter in scalar Carleman estimates. At present, there are few analytical results on Carleman estimates, describing the uniqueness and stability of anisotropic systems, including the challenging and important case of transversely isotropic elasticity. Inverse problems for complicated drift-diffusion systems, such as semiconductors and ion channels, abound with mathematical challenges including analytic conditions for uniqueness and reliable numerical algorithms. The principal investigator addresses these by using various asymptotic simplifications, dual problems, and methods similar to those used in inverse obstacle problems for scalar elliptic and parabolic equations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was to study stability (and hence resolution) of prospecting of obstacles, media, or sources by stationary (acoustic, elastic , and electromagnetic waves).  One of major issues with inverse problems  for elliptic and parabolic equations is a weak (so called logarithmic) stability which is due to an exponential decay of a physical prospecting field, results in a very low  resolution of numerical methods and in a stabie recovery of only few (5-10) parameters of an unknown object.  So stability issue is crucial for study and practical applications of inverse problems. One of main  outcomes of this project is establishing of increasing stability in the Cauchy problem for general second order elliptic equations without any (pseudo)convexity assumptions on media and domains.  It suggests that one can recover a distant object by (higher frequency acoustical or electromagnetic) prospecting by placing sensors on an arbitrary observation site, while convexity assumptions require that sensors surround this object.  Under convexity assumptions much better recovery of sources of acoustic and elastic waves of higher wave numbers in a free space was analytically justified and rigorously tested numerically. One of major obstacles to use waves for geophysical and medical prospecting is their so called attenuation (or fast spatial decay, especially for high wave numbers).   In the project the influence of the attenuation was studied analytically and numerically, and it was shown that a moderate attenuation still admits an increasing stability for sources.   Contemporary science and engineering are in need  of detailed mathematical modeling by systems of partial differential equations, rather than scalar equations. Identification and control of systems are far more challenging than for single equations. One of outcomes of this project is a derivation of  most complete Carleman estimates for some anisotropic   (transversely isotropic) systems of importance in geophysics, material science, and medical imaging which imply stable recovery of elastic parameters and their robust control from outside. Another important outcome is a demonstration of increasing stability of the conductivity in the complete Maxwell system for larger wave numbers from all exterior measurements of the electromagnetic field. This promises a real improvement in a cheap, fast, and safe prospecting of the interior of a human body or of the underground which currently suffers from a very low resolution due to use of scalar conductivity equations.  The results of this research promise a significant improvement in processing of geophysical, industrial, and medical data to detect interiors from external acoustic, electromagnetic, and elastic measurements.  The fastest and reliable numerical algorithm for recovery of linearly time dependent volatility from realistic (European options) market data was designed and rigorously tested on real market data. The linear time dependence enables to predict volatility in near future from current data.       Last Modified: 09/04/2019       Submitted by: Victor M Isakov]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
