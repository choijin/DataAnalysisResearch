<AbstractNarration>Significant interest exists in treating diabetes, including the potential of chromium (Cr) to reduce its symptoms. As diabetics have a surplus of glucose in their bodies, blood serum proteins can be glycosylated to a greater extent than normal, resulting in detrimental effects on the hosts.  Previously glycosylation of the iron transport protein transferrin (Tf) has shown to alter its function.  As transferrin also transports chromium from the bloodstream to tissues, glycosylation of transferrin may also significantly affect chromium transport to the tissues; however, these effects have not been examined to date. This award supports research to explore the effect of glycosylation of transferrin on the uptake of chromium(III) using a rodent model system. The research will be conducted at National Chung Hsing University under the mentorship of Dr. Frank Moa and Dr. Wen-Ying Chen, experts in the effects of chromium in model rodent systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore the effect of glycosylation of transferrin on the uptake of chromium(III) in healthy, type 1, and type 2 diabetic animal models. Diabetes is a worldwide problem, and a potential therapeutic agent to treat symptoms of this disease that has received appreciable attention is chromium(III). Chromium(III) has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels in rodent models of diabetes.  One side effect of diabetes is increased blood glucose levels. As a result of the higher glucose levels, blood serum proteins can become irreversibly glycosylated. Glycosylation can alter the properties and functions of these proteins, including the iron transport protein transferrin. Transferrin not only carries iron in the bloodstream but also appears to be the sole agent that transports chromium(III) from the bloodstream to the tissues. Thus, glycosylation of transferrin of diabetic subjects could alter the ability for chromium(III) to be transferred to tissues and thus increase insulin sensitivity in tissues. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>
