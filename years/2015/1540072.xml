<AbstractNarration>Within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education community, there are repeated calls for changing the way we educate our students.  These calls for change extend beyond the classroom experience to the curriculum, co-curricular experiences, and institutional levels. And yet, despite the development of research-based teaching strategies, innovative co-curricular projects, and many years of funding and development from a variety of foundations and corporations, change in STEM education is not pervasive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lack of systemic change points to an important problem with the approach to change that the STEM education community has pursued thus far. Change has been targeted at the course and curriculum levels, focusing on teaching and learning methods. These beneficial activities have not, however, fostered the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) in motivation, communication, collaboration, and persuasion that are the foundation for change on larger, more institutional levels. These change strategies are well documented in the literature of other disciplines, such as organizational psychology and behavior, but have not been brought into the conversation within STEM education in a rigorous, accessible way. The work proposed here seeks to address this specific problem by answering the following question: Can we overcome limits that prevent the diffusion of new ideas, can we overcome barriers to the adaption of effective practices, by focusing on the change agents themselves in terms of their skills and change expertise?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study change agents who are engaged in making change on their campuses through the NSF Revolutionizing Engineering Departments (RED) Program.  The co-PIs will provide RED recipients the opportunity to learn and develop the KSAs that research suggests are essential for effective change management, through a customized change curriculum that will be delivered during the annual meeting of RED recipients and supported through monthly conference calls.  The co-PIs will also follow the work of these agents over a two-year period, capturing their reflections on their efforts during focus group interviews.  From the qualitative data gathered during this EAGER Project, the co-PIs will develop rich case studies that highlight the KSAs required to promote change in STEM; these case studies will serve as models for faculty and administrators who wish to make significant change on their campuses. The approach of this EAGER project represents transformative research that does not fit well into other funding opportunities, because change management KSAs are not well integrated in engineering education presently.  By demonstrating the importance of change management KSAs to effective change projects in engineering education, this project will provide faculty and administrators with a new model for change.  Consequently, this work addresses the EAGER focus on high risk-high payoff, radically different approaches that develop new expertise and engage novel disciplinary or interdisciplinary perspectives.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative grant between the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (RHIT) and the University of Washington Center for Evaluation &amp; Research for STEM Equity (CERSE) is a partnership created to support and study the change efforts of grantees through NSF?s REvolutionizing engineering and computer science Departments (RED) program. The RED grantees are engaged in large-scale change in their departments or colleges.

The curriculum is adapted from the successful Making Academic Change Happen (MACH) Workshop, a change leadership development program that has been offered by Rose-Hulman since 2012.  The research conducted by the University of Washington has yielded key insights into how teams do (or do not) create shared vision for their large-scale change projects, how teams are communicating their changes with key stakeholders, and understandings of the role of strategic partnerships in making change projects successful.  Together the partners have co-published two tip sheets meant to translate the academic research into actionable tips for others interested in making academic change.  In addition, Rose-Hulman has created multiple faculty development modules focused on key aspects of change, including effective communication of change projects and promoting inclusion and diversity in engineering.  The work of the partnership, via organized and managed cohort-building activities for the RED teams, has increased the social and institutional capital of the members of the RED teams; without the practical, research informed support from RHIT and UW, this capital would not exist.  Intellectual Merit:  The essential knowledge of change processes, administrative structures, change communication, risk assessment, and rewards and incentives for change are familiar to some individuals in business and industry, but represent new arenas for engineering faculty who envision change. We examined the experiences of the first 13 RED grantees, which resulted in actionable strategies for others to adopt and lessons learned.

Further, because of the facilitation of the Rose-Hulman team, the grantees learned new skills and concepts that have been helping them with their change projects.  As skills and knowledge are newly acquired, they must be formally practiced (such as during the RED Principal Investigators Meeting which Rose-Hulman organizes), supported (after the meeting through coaching and monthly calls), and analyzed (through video interviews/ focus groups and observations of calls) to determine how the strategies impact the success or failure of their planned change project.  Broader Impacts:  One of the broader impacts of this project has been in the development of a growing community for change within engineering and computer science education. Change agents need a community to act as a sounding board, provide support, and both encourage and challenge ideas. By connecting the community of scholars through the work of this grant, this project has created the landscape for key synergies and knowledge to develop.
