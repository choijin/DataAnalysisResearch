<AbstractNarration>The team will perform numerous state-of-the-art simulations of galaxy clusters spanning a large range in&lt;br/&gt;mass. The simulations will incorporate observationally-constrained&lt;br/&gt;models for feedback from star formation and supermassive black holes,&lt;br/&gt;along with a novel treatment of chemical evolution. The&lt;br/&gt;aims are twofold: (1) Establish a unified description for the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of the galaxies, the supermassive black holes, and the hot&lt;br/&gt;tenuous gas within the clusters; (2) Determine the key observable&lt;br/&gt;signatures that constrain the interplay between the processes of&lt;br/&gt;galaxy feedback and the growth of structure in the Universe. These&lt;br/&gt;efforts constitute a self-consistent, holistic approach to feedback that will be able to account for multifaceted&lt;br/&gt;properties observed across all mass scales. The team will continue its&lt;br/&gt;involvement in an established, successful STEM program. The research&lt;br/&gt;will increase the physical realism of the simulations, increasing the&lt;br/&gt;appeal of the image products released to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Clusters of galaxies are one of the most important probes of theglobal geometry of the Universe, of the evolution of the overallcosmic expansion, and of the nature of ``dark energy''.  Thisis due to the extreme sensitivity of the cluster population statisticsto these parameters and to the fact that as regions of high galaxyconcentrations are filled with luminous X-ray emitting plasma, thesesystems can be identified across a wide range of distances.  Clusters are also ``closed box'' laboratories for the study of galaxyevolution.  That is, gas driven out of galaxies by energetic processessuch as supernovae or active galactic nuclei will still remain withinthe cluster where it can be studied with X-ray and UV telescopes.  This study was an effort to ``holistically'' model galaxy clusters inthe sense of following the star formation and supernovae processeswithin individual galaxies and tracking how these processes interactwith the hot gas that fills the cluster.  In this way the study wasable to examine both how the cluster environment shapes galaxyevolution, and how galaxies influence the structure of the clustergas.  In the former case, the study has shown that the growth of thecluster active galactic nucleus tracks the growth of the starformation in cluster galaxies, somewhat independently of theenvironment.  This is contrary to previous ideas which invoked galaxymergers to fuel black hole growth.  In the later case, the study hasshown that the intracluster medium becomes increasingly multiphase(i.e. a mixture of gases at various temperatures) as one looks furtherfrom the cluster center, with 10,000 to 100,000 Kelvin gas dominatingin the cluster outskirts.  Predictions are made to confirm this modelof the cluster gas with observations with the Cosmic OriginsSpectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope.  Maps of the clusteras seen via various observational diagnostics are shown in theattached image.          Last Modified: 11/20/2019       Submitted by: Thomas R Quinn]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
