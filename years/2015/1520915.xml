<AbstractNarration>Quantum mechanics underlies much of our present technology, including computing.  However, many questions about quantum mechanics remain unsolved or open, especially in the areas of dynamics and open systems.  Exploring new regimes of quantum mechanics allows us to push towards next generation computing and other future technologies.  A key experimental context to gain this insight is ultracold molecules, where we have an extraordinary degree of precise control over many aspects of the quantum problem.  In this context, this project supports the development of a large scale open source code to push such experiments forward.  The code is run on high performance computers.  The training of students in rigorous numerical techniques and high-performance parallel computing is key to success in a number of arenas in society, from the materials genome initiative to the space program. This project will train students in a diverse research environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As more complex molecules approach quantum degeneracy, the number and complexity of many-body models to describe them will also increase substantially.  Additionally, searching for emergent phenomena such as quantum phases and robust dynamical phenomena requires exploration of vast parameter spaces and extrapolation using many different system sizes.  In order to meet these challenges, researchers seek new ways to design and dispatch simulations and collect and interpret data.  Open source tools which are to have long-term impact must be flexible to adapt to different physical degrees of freedom, different Hamiltonians, and different dynamical processes; they must be efficient to manage large parameter exploration; and they must contain powerful tools for extracting data from large simulations.  The matrix product density operator approach to be developed here will support innovative research in ultracold molecular physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A range of ultracold molecular and entangled quantum many-body dynamical problems were solved, leading to new opportunities for advanced material development and quantum simulators.  Research achievements include (1) experimental predictions for the effect of long-range interactions on defect formation during quantum phase transitions; (2) exact analytical prescription for new experimental controls on damping of multicomponent systems; (3) identification of new regimes of quantum chaos which are inherently many-body in nature; (4) prediction of many-body decoherence and thermalization times relevant for adiabatic quantum computing; (5) development of fractional calculus for novel multiscale materials; (6) discovery of a new set of quantum cellular automata that generate mathematically quantifiable complexity in terms of complex networks; and (7) applications ranging from controlling exciton transport to extended Josephson junctions.  This work resulted in 37 publications and papers under review in peer-reviewed journals, as well as 45 invited seminars and colloquia in the US and abroad.  As part of this work, a total of 25 students were mentored in research at undergraduate and graduate levels.  Course development in projects-based graduate classical mechanics using extensive computational modeling, integration of computation across the Colorado School of Mines physics curriculum, and transformation of undergraduate mathematical physics to undergraduate mathematical and computational physics all constitute professional training and development within the purvue of the NSF computational physics program.  With regards to the wider public beyond the Colorado School of Mines, our SourceForge website for our open source code had 2,099 downloads over the three year grant period, 44% of which were from the U.S., according to the statistics provided by SourceForge.  Broader educational contributions include a published physics education paper demonstrating quantitatively that collaborating often and widely correlates with high grades for undergraduates across a range of upper division physics.  13 out of the 25 students involved with this grant came from underrepresented groups.  This critical mass at over 50%, as compared to the usual approximately 20% in physics, has an impact through providing a visible example for young students wondering about quantum physics, and is available to the public through our group website at https://people.mines.edu/lcarr/, where participation of citizen scientists is encouraged and accessible decriptions are available.   In addition work bridging the sciences and the humanities was presented in public lectures, for example the Aspen Center for Physics Lecture Series for the general public, available on YouTube, as well as an Institute of Physics podcast, and other such media ventures informing the public about computation and quantum physics.
