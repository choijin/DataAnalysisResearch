<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM junior faculty at HBCUs who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who may have returned to the faculty ranks after holding an administrative post or who needs to redirect and rebuild a research program. Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Johnson C. Smith University (JCSU) will conduct research aimed at understanding the biodiversity of parasites in birds of prey. This project will be used to enhance teaching and learning at JCSU and thus, help motivate underrepresented minority students to pursue graduate studies and careers in biological sciences. The research and educational efforts will contribute to the University's goal to increase the number of minority students receiving BS degrees in STEM fields.  In addition, this project will help JCSU continue to build its reputation as an urban HBCU capable of producing professionally ready graduates and those that are well-prepared to manage graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed study is to examine the biodiversity of encysted protozoans in raptors and to begin to unravel the lifecycles of Sarcocystis species that use raptors as definitive hosts. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Determine the prevalence of encysted protozoans from the muscles of naturally infected raptors by histological and molecular methods; and 2) Collect intestinal tracts from raptors containing Sarcocystis oocysts &amp; sporocysts and determine the presence of S. calchasi by bioassay in cockatiels, Nymphicus hollandicus. This study has the potential to identify new avian infective and potentially pathogenic species. The findings from this study will improve knowledge of the species of protozoan parasites infecting raptors. This project will be conducted in collaboration with the Carolina Raptor Center and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.</AbstractNarration>

Raptors are apex predators that live in ecologically diverse habitats worldwide and feed on prey at many levels of the food web.<em> Sarcocystis</em> species are obligate 2-host coccidian parasites with complex life cycles that cause disease in mammals and birds. The definitive hosts (DH) produce environmentally-resistant cysts (oocysts/sporocysts) in their feces. When these cysts are ingested by an appropriate intermediate host (IH), the parasites eventually move from the intestines to the skeletal muscle cells of the IH and produce sarcocysts. Sarcocysts are infective for the DH when they are ingested. Raptors can serve as either the DH or IH for various <em>Sarcocystis</em> parasites.

Morphologically the sarcocysts were similar in each raptor. Differences in sarcocyst wall thickness were noted but no definitive differences in structure were detected. Molecular testing was done on the DNA from the muscles of 118 raptors using ITS based PCR and detected <em>Sarcocystis</em> species DNA in 27 samples. Examination of these 27 PCR positive samples using JNB primers and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using DraI and HinfI demonstrated that 9 of the raptors were infected with members of the <em>Sarcocystis falcatula</em> complex. RFLP indicated that <em>S. falcatula</em> was in 4 (cuts with HinfI only) and 3 raptors had <em>S. falcatula</em> Argentina-like strain (cuts with HinfI &amp; DraI), and 2 samples were not definitively identified due to low DNA content.
