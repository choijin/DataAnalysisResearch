<AbstractNarration>Field survey reports from recent tsunamis suggest that local residents in mainland areas shadowed by nearby islands may be under the impression that these islands protect them from tsunamis.  Recent numerical results using the mathematical procedure known as "active learning" have generated substantial attention in world media (The Economist, Der Spiegel, Science, Korean Herald, Kathimerini), because they suggest that,  in most cases,  islands amplify  tsunamis in the shadow zones behind them.  In this application, the active learning methodology requires about 100,000 times fewer computations than conventional mathematical approaches, and it is unclear if the amplification effect is real.  Through comprehensive laboratory experiments, the physical manifestation of this effect will be studied.  If indeed the physical experiments confirm the numerical idealizations, this research will help save lives by better targeting educational campaigns to at risk populations.  For example, it will be determined if coastlines shadowed by offshore islands along the Pacific Coast of the US are more vulnerable than earlier believed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The early numerical results from active learning are only applicable for non-breaking waves.  While many existing numerical codes attempt to model mild long-wave breaking, as they sometimes do, it is unclear how well they perform when scattered long waves break and interact.  It is equally unclear if the isthmus between islands scatters the wave energy or focuses further in the mainland behind them, or under what geographical conditions either effect prevails.  Through the laboratory experiments, it will be determined if this vexing phenomenon persists when waves break.  The results will help validate active learning as a mathematical procedure for uncertainty reduction which greatly reduces computational costs.  Also, a substantial laboratory data set will be developed to help benchmark numerical computations for interacting breaking wave fronts, under conditions as yet unstudied.  An outreach campaign is planned to educate populations at risk and improve the awareness of emergency managers on this unusual amplification phenomenon.</AbstractNarration>

In many of these regions, it has been commonly thought that these offshore islands can serve as protection from the devastating inundation from tsunamis. However, field surveys performed in the wake of the 2010 Mentawais tsunami in Indonesia have revealed <em>higher&nbsp;</em>tsunami inundation levels on shorelines in the lee of these islands than in adacent areas of the coastline.&nbsp;</p> <p>Experiments of long wave (tsunami) propagation past islands and the resulting inundation on leeward shorelines were conducted in the Directional Wave Basin at Oregon State University during 2016-2017. Sheet metal islands representing a variety of island types, from mountainous volcanic islands to low-lying reefs, were installed at varying distances from the toe of a metal beach. A variety of wave gauges and velocity sensors were installed to detect the height of the wave and speed of the currents, and a video system was used to determine the landward extent of the inundation as the long tsunami wave broke on the beach. In addition, two types of waves were generated. One is a so-called "solitary" wave - a single hump of water which propagates with no change in form over a flatt bottom. The second is a "full stroke" wave, generated by programming the wavemaker to travel its entire range of motion over a given time. The former is a&nbsp; long-used proxy for a tsunami in the laboratory, while the latter is a good representation of a landfalling tsunami.&nbsp;</p> <p>Results from the experiments indicate that there is, in fact, an enhanced inundation in the direct lee of the island relative to that experienced in open sections of the beach. In addition, the largest amplification of this inundation occurs when the island is very close to the beach. As the island is moved further away from the beach, the level of inundation amplification appears to decrease, but is always present. This confirms the field survey results showing increasing tsunami inundation due to the small offshore islands near the Mentawais.</p> <p>Numerical modeling is presently underway to help determine the cause of this enhanced inundation. Preliminary results using a computational wave model indicate that the process of a tsunami wave encountering an island creates a "stem wave" - a long wave generated by the two halves of the tsunami wave encountering each other right behind the island. For the cases where the island is some distance from the shore, the length of the crest of this stem wave increases as it moves toward the shoreline, reducing its height and thus its inundation. However, if the island is very close to the beach, the stem wave does not have enough room for its crest to lengthen and its height to decrease before encountering the decreasing water depth of the beach, thus greatly increasing its height (and thus the inundation) once the wave has reached the shoreline.</p> <p>The laboratory work trained several PhD students on laboratory techniques, and was also the focus of interest for several K-12 and senior lab visits during the time of the experiment. In addition, it is believed that one long term benefit of the work would be in hazard mitigation and planning for tsunamis. The proximity of islands near vulnerable shorelines seen in the Mentawais are not dissimilar from (for example) the Channel Islands offshore of California.
