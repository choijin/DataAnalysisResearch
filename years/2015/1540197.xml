<AbstractNarration>This award supports three annual "Effectively Communicating Science" workshops on the topic of weather modification and a pilot workshop on hydraulic fracking to help coach scientists in communicating and teaching complex Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) concepts effectively and ethically. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise of the workshops is that scientists must not be advocates for one side or the other, but must be able to convey the quality and accuracy of their work.  There is a significant societal impact in helping scientists better communicate and teach their expertise. At present, there are over 1,000 scientists in atmospheric, geospace, and related fields who are teaching, researching, publishing, and communicating with colleagues in the STEM community and the public at large. These scientists, and their work, will become increasingly important in future scientific and public discussions on complex STEM concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator team will build on the success of previous workshops; expand the number of participants who benefit from the workshops; further refine the workshop materials and methodology; implement and evaluate new materials to reach more participants in other STEM disciplines; and continue to provide ongoing support and resources to participating scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each workshop will include a diverse group of 20-24 participants and an experienced faculty. The workshops will include simulations where participants communicate and teach complex STEM concepts to non-scientists in a range of challenging settings. The workshops will demonstrate the merit of experiential learning and provide hands-on practice opportunities for participants to communicate and teach complex STEM concepts in a wide range of challenging settings. Workshop faculty will provide individualized feedback and coaching along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the workshops, participants will learn and practice the role of both scientists and non-scientists in order to: 1) learn to effectively communicate their expertise; 2) understand the culture and perspectives of non-scientists; and 3) develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of the different challenges in communicating and teaching complex STEM concepts to non-scientists. Participants will also discuss ethical issues concerning communicating and teaching STEM concepts to non-scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  The "Effectively Communicating Science" ("ECS") project is a series of annual one-week long workshops and ongoing support materials for scientists on communicating and teaching. The primary goals of the ECS are to train and equip scientists and science educations (hereafter, the project "participants") to communicate and teach complex STEM concepts more effectively and ethically.     Before this current grant, we conducted four ECS workshops with NSF funding in 2011-14 (Award numbers 1041512 and 1321562). Under the current grant, we conducted three additional ECS workshops in 2015, 2016, and 2017 (Award number 1540197).  A total of 149 scientists have participated in this program.  Design/Intellectual Merit  The workshop methodology applies two core assumptions: 1) scientists learn best by doing rather than just listening and observing and 2) scientists better understand how to communicate STEM concepts by learning about and playing the role of policy-makers, lawyers, and others who are not scientifically trained.     Participants were carefully selected by their level of experience and standing in the scientific community.  The participants also represented a diverse group of scientists.  For example, the 2017 ECS participants included 11 male and 12 female scientists that included all levels of professional experience from Ph.D. candidates to seasoned professors and professional scientists with a broad range of ages. The 23 participants hailed from 15 states and 20 different educational and research institutions.     The week-long experiential learning program included briefings by professors and other professionals, including judges, lawyers, and communication consults, on topics such as: ethical considerations in communication, communicating scientific and STEM topics to non-scientists, and various legal processes where scientific information is commonly communicated (such as depositions, direct and cross-examination, arbitration, pretrial Daubert hearing, rules of evidence, and jury trial).  In addition, participants received training materials and other resources for ongoing support, including communication textbooks and website resources.     As with previous workshops, law students were included (with no additional costs to the grant) to provide additional training and communication experiences for the participants, as well as provide the law students with intensive hands-on educational experience with scientists in legal settings, using the training materials developed in this program.  Broader Impacts of the Program     Participants in the ECS workshops bring their training back to their workplace and schools, where they share what they have learned and their new or improved skills with constituents, colleagues, students, and policy makers.  Then they recommend a new batch of participants, who are then able to participate in the program the next year.  Nearly all of the 149 scientists who have participated in the program were recommended by previous participants.     The need for this type of training is clear.  Science and complex STEM concepts are key factors in the strategic plans of many major corporations, public policy discussions, legal disputes, and in the education of future scientists and science educators.  Communication and teaching of these concepts to non-scientists is critical, as non-scientists are often in the role of decision-maker on issues involving science and complex STEM concepts.  Outcomes  We measure the results of the ECS workshops in two ways.  The first measure is the number of scientists who participate in the program.  Each workshop serves a new group of scientists and educators.  All participants are considered "Fellows" after completion of the program and receive ongoing access to the ECS portal and its many resources.  Fellows are also encouraged to keep in touch with the program and share results of the workshop in their work and teaching, as many have already done.      The second measure is the level of satisfaction of participants along a number of important vectors.  We use a complex survey instrument that is administered shortly after completion of the workshop.  For every question in every workshop, the responses were nearly unanimously positive, matching the affirmative results from previous ECS workshops.  Comprehensive results on the survey are included as Participant Evaluations and Comments in the annual reports.  (See image Table 1 for overview of years 2011-2017).      Lastly, we developed a pilot workshop and teaching materials during the final year so that the workshops could be expanded to new groups of scientists.  The current workshop exercise was based on a cloud-seeding scenario, designed for scientists and science educators with a background in climate science. We worked with faculty and science students at George Mason in developing a fracking-based simulation exercise and materials for scientists and science educators with a background in earth sciences.  We also developed a proposed course schedule to match the new scenario, which will be used in future workshops.
