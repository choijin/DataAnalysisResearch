<AbstractNarration>Sequence-defined oligomers are short polymers with chemical and biological properties that can be dictated by controlling the composition and relative arrangement of the building blocks. Motivated by their potential applications in biological systems, such as therapeutics, Prof. Alabi of Cornell University develops novel approaches to the synthesis of sequence-defined polymers and investigates how the composition and sequence affect their properties.  Educational and outreach activities are integrated throughout the duration of this research project through a common theme that is focused promoting peer-to-peer learning and empowering young aspiring scientists to take up leadership positions in communicating science ideas to the broader public. Based on the Dr. Alabi's experience creating a comprehensive 3-day workshop for underrepresented high school students, this project develops an "Ambassador Program" that involves teaching and supporting high school students how to disseminate ideas in science and engineering to their peers and the broader public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on the method invented by the Alabi group for the synthesis of sequence-defined linear oligothioetheramides (oligoTEAs) that undergo pre-programmed self-assembly into desired 3D architectures, this research project aims to further develop novel, efficient methods for the synthesis of sequence-defined multicyclic structures.  Towards this challenging goal, this research investigates how molecular composition and sequence influence chain dynamics, the efficiency of macrocyclization, and ultimately the properties of the macromolecular assemblies.  In addition to providing research training to graduate and undergraduate students, an "Ambassador Program" is being developed to train and equip high school students with the leadership and communication skills required to disseminate topics in science and engineering to their peers and the broader public.</AbstractNarration>
