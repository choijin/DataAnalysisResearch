<AbstractNarration>The release of water (and other volatiles) from subducted rocks represents an important part of the global geological water (and CO2) cycle.  More specifically, it is a crucial triggering process for arc volcanism, seismicity, and the generation of ore forming fluids.  Knowledge of the primary dehydration flux from subducted rocks as well as the timing and location (e.g. depth and temperature range) of this release is fundamental to understanding such broad tectonic processes, but rates of fluid production are currently generally poorly understood.  The proposed research will employ novel methods to reconstruct dehydration fluxes from a 45 million year old subduction complex now exposed at the surface as well-preserved blueschist and eclogite rocks on the islands of Syros and Sifnos, Greece.  With this unique information, geodynamic model predictions of subduction zone dehydration processes will be tested and refined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key question is whether the primary dehydration flux from subducted rocks is continuous or pulsed.  While many past predictions suggest relatively continuous release of water from descending rocks, recent work (including preliminary work on Sifnos) has suggested that metamorphic reactions during subduction can occur in brief bursts that rapidly liberate water.  Concentrically zoned garnet crystals, which grow during subduction zone dehydration, will be dated like tree rings with the Samarium-Neodymium decay system.  Crucially, the dating resolution will be sufficient to resolve changes in the rate of garnet growth (i.e. pulses) as short as a few hundred thousand years.  Thermodynamic analysis will provide constraints on the specific depth and temperature interval of garnet growth, which will be linked directly to concomitant water release for each rock.  Constraints from thermodynamic analysis will be integrated with direct rate &amp; age information from zoned garnet geochronology to provide a unique dehydration chronology.  These novel methods and resulting datasets will provide scientists a new window into subduction zone processes occurring deep within the Earth.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The release of water (and other volatiles such as CO2) from subducted rocks represents a crucial triggering process for arc volcanos, earthquakes, chemical transport, and slab densification which drives plate motion.  Knowledge of the primary net metamorphic dehydration fluxes as well as the timing and location (e.g. depth and temperature range) of this release is thus fundamental to understanding such broad tectonic processes.  In this research, we have reconstructed dehydration fluxes from different rocks, called blueschist and eclogite, that experienced subduction ~50 million years ago and are now accessible as an archive of those deep processes on the islands of Syros and Sifnos, Greece.  Our team sampled rocks from Syros in 2014 and had access to rocks from Sifnos sampled during previous campaigns in 2006 and 2009.  We employed and refined a novel integration of thermodynamic and geochronologic analysis of these samples, focusing on the mineral garnet as the key recorder of these ancient processes.  Garnet geochronology using the samarium-neodymium isotope decay system &ndash; which was further refined by PI Baxter and his lab in this project &ndash; provided growth ages of numerous Sifnos and Syros garnets.  Thermodynamic analysis of garnet growth provided constraints on the P-T span of garnet growth, and directly linked garnet growth to concomitant water release for each rock.  We find that garnet growth spans at least eight million years on the two islands, from at least 52 to 44 million years ago &ndash; sometimes even recorded within a single crystal &ndash; but that garnet growth and related dehydration tends to accelerate into a brief pulse during heating just before exhumation.  Water release of up to 1 to 5 weight percent occurred during garnet growth with the greatest water losses coming from the most ultramafic mantle like rock compositions.   During this grant period, PI Baxter moved his thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) lab from Boston University to Boston College where he and his team established the new lab as a leader in high precision garnet geochronology and neodymium isotope analysis. Significant innovations in TIMS methods and garnet analysis, published in several review articles, were made possible by this grant.  The grant initiated a lasting collaboration between the two lead scientists at Boston College and Virginia Tech with complementary expertise and supported the development of protocols to uniquely integrate garnet geochronology and thermodynamics.  The grant involved three graduate and three undergraduate students at BC (or Boston University), each of whom focused on garnet geochronology and/or linking garnet to devolatilization.  The BU/BC team worked closely together and with the VT team, including numerous group meetings and student exchange visits, to integrate their respective datasets leading to collaborative student-authored conference presentations at national conferences, two masters theses, three undergraduate senior theses, and additional publications in preparation. The grant also supported continuation of the successful ?RoBOT? outreach program that brings Boston area high school students together with undergraduates in shared experiential learning based on analysis of rocks sampled in their community.  PI Baxter also initiated a local K-12 outreach lecture program during support from this grant.  Themes, samples, and photos from grant supported research, including garnet geochronology, were integrated into these outreach program discussions, demonstrations, and lab tours.  These outreach efforts brought the excitement and awareness of modern geoscience research to over 450 K-12 students between 2013 and 2017.
