<AbstractNarration>Data Science is emerging as a highly popular academic degree program type both at undergraduate and graduate levels. Even a quick review of existing programs reveals that there are many different interpretations of data science, and the existing programs vary significantly in terms of their learning objectives and curricula. The programs are offered by many different schools and departments, including computer science, mathematics, statistics, computational science, information science, and business. This workshop will bring together experts from key academic communities that are offering data science degrees and the most important academic and professional societies that have demonstrated a long-term interest in supporting the academic community's efforts in developing effective curricula. The purpose of the workshop is to explore the current state of data science education and discuss actions that will best move the field forward. The results will be reported widely to both academic and practitioner communities, and they will serve as a foundation for further discussion and possible model curriculum development efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together leaders in curriculum development with expertise and interest in data science to explore the opportunities for developing some level of guidance for new and evolving programs of study. The questions are complex, involving interdisciplinary issues as well as variation in what aspects of the field are appropriate in different disciplinary settings. Workshop participants will attempt to establish basic guidelines for further curriculum development efforts. The result will be an exploration of the current state of data science education and a set of actions that will move the field forward.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2015, NSF made an award for hosting a workshop on data science education with the following goals:  Create an opportunity for key experts in data science education to discuss fundamental issues of the joint area of interest Allow primary academic and professional societies that have a stake in data science education to share their goals and experiences and explore opportunities for collaboration Develop tentative recommendations regarding the following questions:   What are the most useful practices for allowing early stage data science programs to share information so that they can learn from each other (including learning from failures)? Would it be helpful to develop a curriculum recommendation for undergraduate programs and/or master?s programs in data science? Would it be beneficial to consider accreditation criteria for undergraduate programs in data science?     Such a workshop was organized in October 2015 with 25 highly qualified experts participating, bringing together multiple viewpoints on data science education and representing all key professional and academic societies with a stake in data science education. The workshop led to specific recommendations regarding both the need for curriculum guidance and accreditation standards. The participants were overwhelmingly in support of development of curriculum guidance for data science at the undergraduate level and almost equally strongly against the development of accreditation criteria at this stage. Furthermore, the participants recognized and endorsed the importance of creating environments and mechanisms for sharing both developing ideas and further evolved best practices. Currently, many such environments exist but none of them have yet achieved a critical mass of support. Thus, the workshop identified a specific need to encourage the community to at least develop collaboration and crosslinking between the various platforms that have been built for sharing. The results of the workshop are summarized in a report that is available on the Ensemble (computingportal.org) platform.  In March 2017, a follow-up meeting was organized with the intent of laying the groundwork for societal collaboration on a curriculum recommendation in data science. The participants from leading societies (including American Statistical Association, The Association for Computers and the Humanities, Association for Computing Machinery, Association for Information Systems, IEEE Computer Society, INFORMS, and iSchools, with supporting participation from AAAS, the Business-Higher Education Forum and the European EDISON Project) concluded, however, that the conditions are not yet right for collaboration on curriculum guidance and that it is important to pursue further work to better understand data science and analytics in a broad area of study and education. The participants also agreed on the following outcomes:  The views regarding data science and analytics (DSA) held by the participating communities have both shared elements and substantive differences. The participating communities are not sure whether DSA is an emerging new field or an amalgamation of existing areas. The participating communities do not have a shared language to describe DSA, and the terminological challenges are not trivial. There is value in exploring, identifying, and analyzing the commonalities and differences in ways that allow the participating communities to inform each other. If we do not explore our commonalities, we loose opportunities to identify synergies and learn from our differences.   Finally, based on the need identified in the March 2017 meeting, the project conducted an effort in November 2017 &ndash; May 2018 to collect detailed curriculum data regarding master?s degree programs in data science and analytics with the purpose of providing support for further conversations and collaboration between societies that approach data science and analytics from different perspectives. The findings will be reported to the public as soon as the final cleanup and analysis of the data have been completed.
