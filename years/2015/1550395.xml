<AbstractNarration>Funds will partially support a conference "Critical Zone Science, Sustainability, and Services in a Changing World" that will bring together communities from the U.S. Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) network and the Chinese EcoPartnerships program for meaningful dialogue on the topic of Critical Zone science related to organic matter dynamics. The Critical Zone (CZ)is the Earth's surface layer extending from the top of the vegetation canopy to the base of ground water.  The conference will occur in conjunction with the annual meeting of US-China Ecopartnership for Environmental Sustainability (USCEES) program, which will be jointly convened by Purdue University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences at Purdue University during Oct. 21-24, 2015. The U.S.-China Ecopartnership program is a network supported by the US Department of State and China National Development and Reform Commission to focus on the sustainable use of natural resources in a changing climate.  In addition to the scientific exchange of ideas, the conference is an opportunity for enhanced student training and U.S.-China cultural exposure. Also, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese university scientific leadership within the USCEES will bring an important perspective of ecosystem network science in China and the possibility of standardization of metrics and methods to help assure transferable and directly comparable Critical Zone science outcomes for future US-China linked research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four specific activities will take place as part of the conference: 1) an instrument training short course on "The Role of Runoff and Erosion on Soil Carbon Stocks: From Soilscapes to Landscapes"; 2) scientific sessions on critical zone function related to organic matter dynamics and budget; 3) Cross-CZO Working Group workshop on flux, stabilization, and reactivity of organic matter in the Critical Zone with the goal of discussing scientific findings, common measurements, common methods, common laboratories, common experiments, and common questions to support cross- U.S. CZO and international CZ science; and 4) a field trip to the CZO site in the Upper Sangamon watershed in Illinois.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The reason for hosting the 2015 Conference and Workshop on Organic Matter Flux, Stabilization, and Reactivity in Critical Zone Science and Sustainability is the recognition among earth scientists that the management of the world?s soils and waters is occurring at an intensity that in many places exceeds the limit that the water resources, air and soil quality, and surface geology can sustain.
