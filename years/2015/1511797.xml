<AbstractNarration>1512109 (McCray) and 1511797 (Mozingo). The U.S. population will increase about 50% over the next 35 years, mostly as urban new development or re-development, presenting a unique opportunity to implement enlightened urban water solutions. Beneficial use of stormwater and recycled wastewater at the local urban scale are innovative water management options but are hampered by regulatory or policy barriers. The primary purposes of this research are (a) to develop engineered modules placed in reaches of constructed urban streams for treatment of selected wastewater or storm-water derived contaminants, including a subset of nutrients (N and P), trace organic chemicals (TrOCs), urban pesticides, metals, and pathogens, and (b) to understand the regulatory, urban planning, and social barriers that must be overcome, and to identify the most conducive urban-planning scenarios to successfully implement this technology at a relevant urban scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The treatment modules to be developed are termed "biohydrochemically enhanced stream-water treatment" (BEST) modules. If successful, BEST modules would enhance urban water quality, promote beneficial reuse of recycled wastewater and storm water, and provide social benefits. Specific objectives include: (1) Identify engineering design characteristics and regulatory opportunities and barriers important for widespread urban landscape-scale implementation of BEST facilities; (2) Test selected geomedia for removal of priority contaminants using column and intermediate-scale 2-D BEST experiments; (3) Design hydraulically optimal BEST modules using experimental results and mathematical modeling to ensure appropriate flow volume and RT that enable effective biochemical reactions for priority pollutants (4) Test BEST modules in our existing pilot-scale constructed streams using local recycled wastewater and stormwater. The research lessons and infrastructure will be incorporated into required graduate and undergraduate core classes in environmental engineering, design studios in urban landscape design, and a hands-on environmental engineering summer field session. An undergraduate senior design team will participate in the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    We conducted interviews with stormwater professionals to identify critical needs and opportunities for the implementation of Biohydrodynamically Enhanced Stormwater Treatment (BEST) systems, a novel stormwater treatment technology under development by our collaborators at the Colorado School of Mines.  Rather than await completion of technical research on the design and characteristics of BEST systems, we conducted these interviews as that research was ongoing, in order to identify potential points of optimization and desirable characteristics for technical R&amp;D to seek to achieve.  In this way, we intend to facilitate and accelerate eventual uptake and implementation of BEST systems by stormwater engineers, land use planners, landscape architects, real estate developers and others implementers of stormwater technologies.  We identified a number of important issues pertinent to the design and development of BEST systems (or any novel stormwater treatment technology), which we categorized into three overarching theme questions:  1. What are the stakeholder concerns related to novel in-stream stormwater treatment technologies?  Within this theme, stormwater professionals identified the following key issues:  The need to reliably meet diverse water quality control standards Cost and space demands Risk of catastrophic failure The need to treat stormwater before reaching receiving waters Acceptance by regulatory gatekeepers   What technical and nontechnical design modifications could improve acceptance and feasibility of in-stream BMPs? Within this theme, stormwater professionals identified the following desirable modifications:  Treatment trains and hardscape elements for scalability across a range of discharges Design for ease of maintenance Focus on retrofits for cost-effectiveness Maximization of aesthetic, recreational and property values   What knowledge gaps remain for in-stream BMPs that impact practicioner acceptance?  Within this theme, stormwater professionals identified the following knowledge gaps:  Performance in effluent concentration (as opposed to percent pollutant removal) How well will in-stream BMPs handle cold-season challenges? Life-cycle costs Defining jurisdictional boundaries for stormwater management   Technical research on BEST has proceeded at Colorado School of Mines in light of these identified themes and issues, which are elaborated in greater detail in our paper: Herzog, S., Eisenstein W., Halpin, B., Portmann, A., Fitzgerald, N., Ward, A., Higgins, C., and McCray, J. (2019). Co-design of engineered hyporheic zones to improve in-stream stormwater treatment and facilitate regulatory approval. Water, 11: 2543. DOI: 10.3390/w11122543.
