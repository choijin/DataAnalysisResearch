<AbstractNarration>Networking security is of critical importance in the Internet age.  The Network and Distributed Systems Security (NDSS) symposium, now in its 22nd year, is a leading venue for research on internet security.  The program typically includes 45-50 peer-reviewed papers and 2-3 keynote speeches. NDSS is always held in San Diego, CA, in February. The 22nd NDSS is scheduled for Feb 8-11, 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attendance at NDSS is highly useful to graduate students studying internet security. This proposal funds attendance by 10 students to attend the conference, thus furthering the research and future employment prospects of these individuals. The student travel grants will offset the costs of conference travel and registration. Preference will be to students who have submitted papers or posters to the conference, and women and underrepresented groups will be actively encouraged to apply through established networks of academics and industry leaders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project aimed to assist ten USA-based students, either graduate or undergraduate, to attend the Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposiums (http://www.internetsociety.org/events/ndss-symposium) held in San Diego, CA on February 8-11, 2015 and February 21-24, 2016. It is an annual, three and a half day conference that brings together innovative and forward thinking members of the Internet community who design, develop, exploit, and deploy the technologies that define network and distributed system security. Participation in symposia like the NDSS is a critical part of the studentsÆ educational experiences by providing them the opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field.  The National Science FoundationÆs support enabled the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the NDSS.  Women and under-represented groups were actively encouraged to apply through established networks of academics and industry leaders. Moreover, outreach was focused on networks of computer scientists who actively mentor under-represented communities in the computer technology sector, including outreach to academic colleagues at institutions where students are less likely to have travel funding available to make sure their students are aware of this opportunity.  The fellowship committeesÆ decision criteria included:  Evidence of serious interest and aptitude in the network security field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience; Evidence of community leadership interests and skills, as demonstrated by engagement with the broader community;  Evidence of collaboration and teamwork activities, especially as applied to problems in the network security field;  Identified benefit from attendance and participation, particularly how participating in the symposium could shape the studentÆs future studies and/or research; and Proof of enrollment in a network security-related program at a college/university located in the USA.   The award achieved its goals by supporting nine students to attend the 2015 NDSS meeting and one student to the 2016 meeting, all of which would otherwise be unable to attend the NDSS.  The selected students represent an infusion of new perspectives to the cybersecurity field, as well as the multiplier effect: taking their NDSS experience and knowledge back to their academic institutions to inspire and motivate others in the field.  Anecdotal evidence provided by each student after the event, in the form of a required Student Report, was overwhelmingly positive.  The common themes among the studentsÆ assessment of their experience were collaboration, sharing, and a renewed interest in pursuing their own research and professional development goals.  Regardless of the field, investing in the development of human capital is crucial for the future.  Supporting and nurturing the next generation of network security experts, providing them with an opportunity to learn from and engage with established experts benefits the entire community.  Each provides the other with lessons learned, fresh ideas, and infuses a spirit of collaboration among a rather small sub-section of the technical space.
