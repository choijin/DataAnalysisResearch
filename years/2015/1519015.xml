<AbstractNarration>The provision of a dependable water supply is of critical importance to human societies both today and in the past. Dr. Nicholas Dunning and Mr. Jeffrey Brewer of the University of Cincinnati, along with an interdisciplinary research group, consisting of colleagues from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, will study the development and maintenance of an urbanized, complex system of water collection, storage, and distribution within an area of limited and ephemeral natural water resources in the heart of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Previous studies on water management have identified and analyzed a variety of water management features within the context of regional environmental and cultural changes. Adapting to variable climatic conditions and expressing political control, in particular, are considered key considerations in the creation and oversight of water storage features. Archaeology is well positioned to provide unique insight into this discussion by focusing on the complex interrelationship between hydrology, topography, vegetation, and architecture across multiple spatial and temporal scales. When and how do carefully managed water resources become an inherent component of urban adaptation? Although the nature and scale of a community's water features change across space and time, understanding the relationship between water storage, climatic conditions, and human settlement is vital to promoting sustainability, resource conservation, and public education in global societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Dunning, Mr. Brewer and colleagues will use empirical data to study how residents of both the urban core and urban periphery managed their limited water resources and developed and maintained a complex system of water management. The research will be conducted at the ancient Maya site of Yaxnohcah, located within the central lowlands of the Yucatan Peninsula. This site provides a unique opportunity to advance understanding of critical resource management and utilization practices that permitted the local inhabitants to support a high population density across a long span of time. The researchers will work with a team of archaeologists, geographers, and environmental scientists to examine the area's hydrological, ecological, and land use history from the Middle Preclassic to Early Postclassic periods (900 B.C. - A.D. 1100). The combination of archaeological excavation, sediment core studies, and high-resolution satellite imagery analysis will permit a unique examination of this civilization's hydraulic developments and advance the field in new directions. This diverse multidisciplinary dataset will enable a more complete understanding of the physical, temporal, and spatial characteristics of these hydraulic features and their precise roles in the daily lives and activities of community inhabitants. This research will advance our broader understanding of the resilient capacity of human societies faced with significant environmental challenges, and the collaborative focus of the project will also establish and enrich opportunities for international student training and research.</AbstractNarration>

Construction of the project GIS (geographic information system) benefitted enormously from previously obtained (2014) lidar (light detection and ranging) imagery of the 25 square kilometer area centered on central Yaxnohcah, which provided a digital elevation model (DEM) revealing the extent and form of the ancient city essentially stripped of its masking tropical forest vegetation (figure 2).&nbsp; This imagery revealed previously unknown urban reservoirs as well as thousands of small depressions, some of which we believed likely to be household water tanks.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Excavations in 2015 and 2016 revealed that civic-scale reservoirs were constructed as a fundamental part of Yaxnohcah&rsquo;s urban design, with the paved surfaces created by monumental architecture delivering rainwater runoff into large reservoirs constructed in adjacent, low-lying terrain.

Test excavations conducted within these residential features were necessary to determine the presence and nature of culturally-modified surfaces that would have functioned as water retention seals at the base of the tanks (figure 4). Importantly, despite presenting similar physical profiles in the lidar and on the ground, not all investigated depressions contained either a plaster or clay &ldquo;floor&rdquo; and appear to be unmodified natural features or quarries (figure 5).
