<AbstractNarration>To understand the mathematical properties of a geometric object, often one needs to group families of objects of similar nature together and study a family as a whole. This concept arises naturally in quantum physics and string theory as well. A large part of this research project is devoted to the understanding the geometric properties of the parameter space inherited indirectly from the objects that it parameterizes. The Principal Investigator plans to investigate universal properties of such families in terms of various notions of negativity in curvature. Some of the problems to be studied are longstanding ones in algebraic and complex geometry. Another line of research is on the classification of some special geometric objects known as fake compact Hermitian symmetric spaces. These objects provide interesting geometric models for studying a wide range of problems from different areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, differential geometry, number theory, and representation theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the Principal Investigator will pursue research in several directions in algebraic and complex geometry. In the first part of the project, he intends to apply recently-developed tools involving generalized Weil-Petersson metrics to understand various hyperbolicity properties of specific families of polarized manifolds, including the hyperbolicity for families of Kahler Ricci flat manifolds, families of special log-general type manifolds, and families of general-type manifolds. In particular, he will investigate a conjecture of Viehweg about log-general type properties of moduli spaces of canonically polarized manifolds. In the second part, he plans to complete a collaborative project on the classification of arithmetic fake compact Hermitian symmetric spaces, a natural continuation of earlier work on fake projective planes. In addition, he will study problems related to these fake structures, such as the investigation of exceptional collections on fake projective planes from the point of view of derived categories, the characterization of the universal covering of a complex exotic quadric or a fake quadric, and the understanding of geometric properties of Cartwright-Steger surfaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In modern science, a lot of times we need to put objects of similar natural together and study the parameter space for all such objects.  This happens in the description of the physical world through quantum theory such as in Feynman diagrams. The concept is described more precisely in mathematics in terms of moduli space.  The study of moduli spaces of geometric objects has always been a central theme in complex and algebraic geometry.  A main outcome of the current project is a new approach to study moduli of some manifolds with some extra geometric structures.  A consequence of the outcome is that such moduli spaces would carry hyperbolic properties, a terminology to describe the phenomenon that the moduli involved is non-positively curved in some sense.  The result is a direct generalization of what was known classically for a moduli of closed real two dimensional surfaces, also known as Riemann surfaces.  The approach is through local construction of some special metric known as generalized Weil-Petersson metric which captures global properties of of a moduli space.  Similar to the role of moduli of Riemann surfaces in String Theory,  the understanding of moduli of higher dimension manifolds would hopefully lead us to better understanding of the physical world.  In another direction, we have also made contributions in the constructions and study of some concrete four dimensional real manifolds which are complex surfaces.  This is achieved through the study and classification of geometric objects known as fake projective spaces.  These are objects of interests in several different disciplines  of mathematics.  Hopefully our findings would lead to further construction of geometric structures which mathematicians have conjectured to exist in the past.      In the process of our research,  the principal investigator has trained and graduated a Ph.D. student in Complex Geometry.   The research of principal investigator has also attracted two other graduate students into the area of complex geometry.
