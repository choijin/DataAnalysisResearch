<AbstractNarration>Despite vast expenditures on prison construction in the late 20th century, infrastructure has not kept pace with the dramatic growth of incarceration in the U.S. As a result, extreme prison overcrowding has led to humanitarian, legal and fiscal emergencies nationwide. These emergencies are especially pronounced at the state level, where the Great Recession most directly affected and severely curtailed public spending; today, more than a third of state prison systems exceed institutional capacity. In the present policy environment, rather than investing scarce capital on building more prisons, state-level legal reforms aimed at downsizing the prison population are widely seen as the more prudent solutions. Little is known, however, about the diffusion and implementation of these laws among local criminal justice actors and their effects at the county level of practice, where the incarceration process begins for most inmates. Without a more sophisticated understanding of the complexities of local compliance, laws designed to downsize prisons risk unintended consequences and, ultimately, failure. This project examines how differences in local organizational culture shape the meaning of law on the ground in ways that bolster or undermine the reform goal of decarceration. The research focuses on two questions: (1) how do local criminal justice actors comply with, shape, and resist prison downsizing laws; and (2) what effect do these responses have on decarceration as a key metric of institutional change? The purpose is to identify the processes and conditions under which such reforms result in either decarceration or the mere relocation of incarceration in local jurisdictions. This knowledge will practically enhance state governments' heretofore largely frustrated attempts to systemically address overincarceration by sensitizing the architects as well as the implementers of legal reform to the predictors of and barriers to local compliance. It will also stress the need for organizational change programs in successful prison downsizing innovations that avoid trans-institutionalization. Ultimately, this project will leverage the lessons learned to national reform strategies by generating a typology of local receptivity to decarceration, which will inform targeted rather than one-size-fits-all interventions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses the recent "realignment" of California's prison system -- one of the nation's and western world's largest -- as an empirical window to examine the above questions. A combination of group-based trajectory modeling and institutional ethnographic methods are used to assess the proposition that local organizational culture mediates the implementation of prison downsizing laws and that variation in county organizational culture explains differences in the outcome of decarceration. These multiple methods enable to the study to: (1) specify the measures of local variation most salient in predicting decarceration; (2) identify the processes by which local organizational culture mediates law, as well as variations in these processes across counties; and (3) relate these variations to the outcome of decarceration. The overarching goal of this research is to help solve the problem of prison overcrowding by identifying its local variants, each with a distinct etiology and progression, to inform carefully tailored, evidence-based interventions.</AbstractNarration>

Little is known, however, about the diffusion and implementation of legal reforms among local criminal justice actors and their effects on county-level practice, the primary point of origin in the incarceration process.

California?s legislative enactment of Public Safety Realignment (Assembly Bill 109) in 2011 marked "the biggest criminal justice experiment ever conducted in America," according to criminologist Joan Petersilia in a 2012 keynote speech to the National Institute of Justice. Realignment is a case of policy localization, as it devolves criminal justice supervision to lower governmental levels based on the rationale that local jurisdictions can achieve superior outcomes to state or federal systems.

This project examined the compliance dilemmas raised such "realignments" and conducted the first in-depth analysis of a key question: will California?s Realignment result in system-wide decarceration or merely the relocation of incarceration to alternative institutional sites, such as local jails?  While sociological scholarship on mass incarceration has surged in recent decades, this research pivots attention to the phenomenon of prison downsizing and investigates the potential for system-wide decarceration as an emergent 21st-century transformation.

The dissertation also addresses outstanding questions about why some jurisdictions have relied more (or less) heavily on prisons and jails and how this historical variation shapes responses to legal regulation.  The project empirically addressed sociolegal questions raised by Realignment?s distinctive form of regulation, which renders legal compliance possible because of&mdash;not despite&mdash;local variations in front-line implementation. Research found that, through the processes and according to the distinct logics reflected in county practitioner implementation plans in the first year of enactment, local actors produced their own interpretations of the law in ways that facilitated the continuation of previous imprisonment practices.
