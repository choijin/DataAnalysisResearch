<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Purdue University acquires an atomic force microscope (AFM). Scanning probe instrumentation, such as a force microscope, has become central in characterizing materials at submicron scales for applications ranging from photolithographic patterning to studies of biological structure. In the past decade, substantial advances in atomic force microscopy have led to the ability to characterize materials in some cases down to the atomic scale, opening new doors in the understanding of how material structure impacts properties. In addition to its impact on research, the instrument advances the training of students at all levels in this modern technique preparing them for careers in the modern workplace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research especially in areas such as: (a) robust amphiphilic interfaces for energetic materials and biological structure; (b) self-assembled DNA nanomaterials for scalable nanomanufacturing; (c) functionalized collagen peptide supramolecular assemblies; (d) bioresponsive nanocarriers based on pseudorotaxanes; (e) block copolymers for organic photovoltaics; (f) energy transfer and charge carrier dynamics in solar energy conversion systems; and (g)conjugated materials and polymer composites for flexible printed electronics.</AbstractNarration>
