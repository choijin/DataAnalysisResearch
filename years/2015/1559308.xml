<AbstractNarration>This proposal focuses on providing international educational and research opportunities in geosciences for US students and underrepresented minorities in a non-traditional study abroad destination, in this case Ethiopia. Only 4% of international undergraduate student research experiences are in Africa. Recent research has documented the benefits of these international experiences including: increased knowledge of other cultures, world geography, cultural relativism, and global interdependence. Students in general show increasing enthusiasm about problems of global importance that have practical consequences and are strongly attracted to interdisciplinary courses, especially those of societal relevance. The collaborations in this proposal will aid the effort of developing a globally engaged workforce in the US and provide the opportunity for students to tackle problems of global magnitude as members of the world community. This project can have a significant impact on the participation of U.S. students in geosciences education and research at both participating U.S. institutions. We expect that students participating in the international study, research training program and field experience abroad will acquire knowledge and research skills in geosciences and will be encouraged to pursue academic and/or industrial careers in these areas. The scientists and students at North Carolina A&amp;T University (NCA&amp;T) and in Ethiopia are benefiting from the collaboration, as they are now developing long lasting relationships that create the conditions for joint global projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ethiopia serves as an ideal natural laboratory for training US students in the geosciences. The main Ethiopian Rift and the Afar Depression region is the only location on earth, other than Iceland, where the transition from continental to oceanic rift is being studied. The East African Rift System crossing through Ethiopia is one the geologic wonders of the world, a place where the earth's tectonic forces are presently trying to create new plates by splitting apart old ones.  Ethiopia and sub-Saharan Africa is also home to some of the highest levels of atmospheric aerosols from biomass-burning (BB) and BB is believed to be a major driver of regional carbon, energy, and water cycles. Selected IRES students will work alongside research mentors from NCA&amp;T, Addis Ababa University (AAU) and Appalachian State University (ASU) and student researchers from AAU to (1) conduct geophysics research including exploring geothermal energy and groundwater sources; (2) initiate long-term measurements of atmospheric aerosols in Addis Ababa; and (3) conduct laboratory-based studies of BB aerosol optical properties (4) apply Fourier Transform spectroscopic techniques to develop carbon monoxide (CO) emission inventories. The proposed activities build upon existing research capabilities at the three universities and collaborations between NCA&amp;T and AAU, which have involved numerous US undergraduates in international research experiences. The research experiences will be conducted in a region of the world that serves as an ideal natural geoscience laboratory (Earth and atmospheric sciences) and which has traditionally been neglected for international student research opportunities. U.S. student participants will work alongside AAU students and faculty researchers who are leaders in their field on interdisciplinary geoscience projects that will instill Earth system science approach and have societal implications, including geothermal energy, water resources, plate tectonics, and relationships between regional air quality and climate change.</AbstractNarration>
