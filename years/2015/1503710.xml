<AbstractNarration>Recognizing the national need for significant improvement in undergraduate STEM education, collaborators from six institutions (Rochester Institute of Technology, St. Mary's University, Oral Roberts University, Hope College, Ursinus College, and California Polytechnic University) will explore a new approach to introduce students to authentic research in biochemistry laboratory courses.  The project will test the hypotheses that engaging in authentic research will improve students' abilities to master key aspects of experimentation (experimental design, data processing and interpretation, and communication of research outcomes) and visualization (use of representations to communicate various aspects of the research process).  The project is likely to be transferrable to other institutions, and is an example of a cost-effective way to introduce course-based research into the undergraduate curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biochemistry laboratory courses will be redesigned to include modules in which students will integrate computational and wet lab techniques as they characterize proteins whose three dimensional structures are known but to which functions have not been previously ascribed.  Because the project is focused on discovery, it is reasonable to expect that some of the students will produce novel results that will contribute to the field of biochemistry.  Formative and summative evaluation will address assessment of student learning gains in terms of improved conceptual understanding and visualization of experiments using a validated instrument composed of open-ended and closed-ended questions.  Faculty members and teaching assistants will be surveyed and interviewed about their satisfaction with the project, its usability, and the extent to which they see the project as part of their own and their students' development.  The project team will create and disseminate modules (promol.org) that form the core of a new curriculum for undergraduate biochemistry laboratory courses.  The results of the work will be presented at professional meetings, such as the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and submitted to scholarly journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For the past two years, it has been a privilege to work with collaborators at institutions around the country to introduce inquiry-based research into the undergraduate biochemistry laboratory course.  Research experiences have long been known to be formative in the training of college students aiming for careers in science.  Traditional research has taken the form of an "apprentice" model where an investigator works with a few students over several years to further an ongoing research area. However, while effective, this model is limited in the number of students that can be accommodated in an individual research lab.  We and others have turned to the Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) model to bring authentic research experiences to our undergraduates as part of their normal course requirements, in this case the biochemistry laboratory.  To this end, biochemistry faculty from Rochester Institute of Technology, SUNY-Oswego, Ursinus College, Oral Roberts University, Purdue University, Hope College, St. Mary's University (TX), and California Polytechnic, have worked together to develop research experiences for our biochemistry lab courses.  Reflecting the research-driven nature of this work, we have named our collaboration the Biochemistry Authentic Scientific inquiry Lab, or BASIL (http://basiliuse.blogspot.com/).    In this lab, we leverage the bioinformatics database, using the some 3000 protein structures hosted in the Protein DataBank (PDB) from the NIH's Protein Structure Initiative.  The PSI produced structures of thousands of putative enzymes whose activities remain, for the most part, unknown. Funding from the NSF IUSE program has allowed us to purchase plamsids to express a subset of these proteins, reagents to purify them, and candidate substrates to assay for activity, as well as to devote time during the summer for us to develop written procedures to help us, and faculty at any other institutions who wish to join our project, facilitate biochemistry research for our students.  While adding inquiry-based goals, learning content in our lab courses remains focused on training students in protein purification and analysis using cutting-edge techniques such as inducible expression, affinity-tag purification, spectrophotometry, and kinetic analysis and modern computational and bioinformatics approaches to understanding protein structure, including ligand docking.       The BASIL lab curriculum has proved to be engaging to students, energizing them to ask questions about the proteins they study in ways that traditional cookbook labs tend not to address.  Additionally, the inquiry-based nature of the lab stimulates student growth in scientific reasoning and discovery.  We look forward eagerly to continuing this exciting and fruitful work.
