<AbstractNarration>This instrument supports large-scale, high-performance computing (HPC) at Trinity University, which enables a broad range of scientific research efforts spanning mathematics, computer science, chemistry, biology, and physics.  Many ongoing projects at Trinity relate to questions of 'big data' analysis, including such diverse areas as weak interactions in host-guest chemistry, multi-scale simulations of protein interactions, models of fluid dynamics related to cellular motility in membranes, analysis of high-throughput genomic sequencing data, multi-agent modeling of security systems, and simulations of particle collisions and gravity within the rings of Saturn. Each of these research areas requires considerable computational power to analyze extremely large datasets, whether generated through traditional laboratory experiments or through robust computational simulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HPC cluster provides a shared computational resource to all researchers at Trinity, and includes both traditional central processing units (CPUs) and newer general-purpose graphics processor unit (GPU) systems optimized for large quantities of floating-point numeric operations.  The cluster operates on the Linux operating system, with a hybrid queuing/priority system so that computational jobs submitted by any researcher are quickly and efficiently executed.  This resource enables Trinity University, an undergraduate institution, to more effectively train and educate students on tangible aspects of large-scale computational projects and research endeavors, such as the value of test-driven development, efficient algorithm design, memory management, and data visualization, while still tackling the challenges of open research questions on a modern scale.</AbstractNarration>

Over a dozen faculty and roughly thirty undergraduate students have used the cluster in a wide range of research endeavors. Among the research projects enabled by the cluster are analyses of sequencing data to determine the mammalian somatic mutation rate, molecular dynamic simulations of lipid systems, simulations of small body interactions in the rings of Saturn, development of neural network methods for music genre classification and style transfer, analyses of market dynamics in bitcoin and other block-chain based cryptocurrencies, studies of epigenetic markers in newborn children of diabetic mothers, simulation of RNA splicing mechanisms, development of machine learning methods for classic game theoretic problems, and many more. Many of these results have distributed to the public in the form of journal publications, conference presentations, and theses. In addition to these scientific achievements, the HPC cluster has enabled us to train undergraduate students in the use of cutting-edge computational methods and system, which better prepares them for graduate school or employment in computational fields. As of now, at least 6 of the students that utilized the HPC cluster in their research are pursing PhDs in STEM fields at universities around the country.
