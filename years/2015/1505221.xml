<AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial funding for the Theoretical Advanced Study Institute (TASI) at the University of Colorado, Boulder CO.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TASI is a one-month long Summer Institute for advanced graduate students working in the field of theoretical high-energy physics, held every June. The aim of TASI is to expose advanced graduate students to a much broader range of ideas and topics than they normally experience in their home institutions while working on their dissertation topics.  TASI has been held every summer since 1984, and has been held on the Boulder campus since 1989. A nationally-distributed Scientific Advisory Board selects a topic and recruits scientific organizers, who arrange the program for that year. In a typical year about sixty junior participants hear approximatly sixty presentations from approximately twenty cutting-edge established researchers. TASI is the most successful program of its kind in the world, and past students of TASI are found at major research institutions (both in and outside high-energy physics).  As such, it advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science and the training of junior scientists.  Further broader impacts associated with TASI are that the videos, lecture notes and written proceedings of TASI provide the same benefits more broadly to other members the the high-energy physics community and beyond.  A Public Lecture is also part of TASI's annual program, and attracts a large audience from the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Thomas DeGrand of the University of Colorado at Boulder is responsible for TASI's infrastructure:  he oversees annual TASI operations, maintains the web site, makes and distributes the poster, collects applications, assists in the admission process, organizes housing for junior and senior participants, takes care of the lecture venue, records the presentations, and allocates participant support costs.</AbstractNarration>
