<AbstractNarration>Creative educational and research programs need to be developed that will inspire young adults (also known as millennials) to pursue critical skills needed to drive our cybersecurity and STEM future and close the ever increasing cybersecurity talent gap. In this regard, educators and researchers must develop innovative curriculum incorporating emerging technologies, in addition to the theoretical content, to help cultivate and retain a highly skilled cybersecurity workforce. Along these lines, faculty and researchers at Metropolitan State University and the University of Minnesota propose to explore and investigate the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in imparting cybersecurity and forensics education and conducting related research; the major focus of the proposed work revolves around Smart- Glasses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creative ways  to  impart  cybersecurity  and forensics education through smart-glasses, related apps, and/or other AR devices will be explored using a Discovery  (or  inquiry-based)  Learning  approach. This mode of delivery will allow students to interact with cyber forensics theories in an innovative, interactive, and effective way, enhancing their overall live experience and experiential learning. This exploratory research work will be ultimately transformed into cybersecurity and forensics curriculum at the undergraduate and graduate level. The efficacy of AR and smart-glasses in attracting, motivating and retaining students (with special emphasis on minorities and women) in cybersecurity and forensics will also be explored. With the help of collected data [observations of first-person (students) videos (live or recorded) while performing various cyber forensics related tasks, pre- post-course tests and student satisfaction surveys], the proposed work will identify unique skillsets for future cyber forensics workers as well as deficiencies, and learning gaps. Various security and privacy issues of smart-glasses (hardware, software, and available applications) will be investigated. In addition, we will investigate case scenarios, exposing system vulnerabilities due to smart-glass? integration with other wearable devices such as insulin pumps or pacemakers.</AbstractNarration>
