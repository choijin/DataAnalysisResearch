<AbstractNarration>Aggressive scaling of CMOS technology and concomitant inventions of nanoscale nascent technologies have fueled the growth of computer, information, communication and consumer electronics industries of the 21st Century by leveraging the ground-breaking discoveries in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The workhorse of multibillion-dollar semiconductor industry, the CMOS technology is approaching its scaling limit due to the strong quantum-mechanical effects present at the nanoscale. To sustain the accelerated pace of economic growth during the post-CMOS era, this multi-university collaborative research proposal envisages building the roadmap of VLSI technology in two significant ways. First, the research is mooted to extend quantum transport principles to simulate emerging nano-devices based on novel semiconductor and 2-D layered materials by exploiting non-charge based degrees of freedom, electron spin controlled magnetization, interaction between electromagnetic waves and semiconductors in metamaterial structures, and topological states in topological insulators. Second, the research will systematically scale these properties from their fundamental atomistic limits to circuit level integration by developing industry-graded SPICE-compatible compact models for heterogeneous circuits that will define the landscape of beyond Moore?s Law VLSI systems. Integrative education, training, and outreach activities envisioned in this collaborative proposal will encompass K-12, undergraduate, graduate, female, minority, and postdoctoral fellows by leveraging the existing outreach activities of participating universities in order to advance science and engineering education in broader segments of the society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using density-functional theory (DFT), time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), time-dependent density-matrix functional theory (TD-DMFT), to phenomenological Extended Huckel to effective mass, in conjunction with non-equilibrium Green?s function (NEGF) methods, quantum field theory, and finite-difference time domain (FDTD) methods, a wide variety of computational methods are going to be developed to tackle the modeling of multiscale circuits in future VLSI systems. The software packages and multiscale modeling tools resulting from the proposed research activity are going to provide computer chip designers and manufacturers the ability to model complex hybrid substrates comprising nanoscale electronic, spintronic, opto-electronic, and plasmonic devices. The resulting software is going to be written with a view to enabling researchers from universities and practicing engineers in industries to develop their own modules that will engender improved system functionality, integration density, and operational speed.</AbstractNarration>

This will need new physics based simulation tools that will need to be translated into SPICE compatible circuit models. The goal of this proposal is to (1) extend quantum transport principles to simulate hardware devices based on novel semiconductor and 2D layered quantum materials, (2) exploiting non-charge degrees of freedom, specifically topological indices such as spin in magnets and topological insulators, pseudospins in graphene, and skyrmionic winding numbers in chiral magnets and (2) build SPICE-compatible models from atoms to circuits, leading to software components compatible with industry-graded SPICE software package.&nbsp;</p> <p>A particular unifying theme is the realization that topological indices imposed on transport provide added constraints (e.g. conservation laws for tunneling bits) that could be exploited for new kinds of switching ideas. This builds on the analogy between spins in magnets, pseudospins in 2D layered Dirac cone systems, polarization in photons and winding numbers in skyrmionic materials.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>For spin transport in magnets, a multi-scaled approach was developed that goes all the way from materials to circuits. This approach includes in particular a fast and accurate numerical tool that incorporates the evolution of stochastic switching probability based on the Fokker-Planck equation. This tool was applied to spin torque based magnetic memories to evaluate the dependency of write error on the material properties of the ferromagnetc electrodes. Subsequently a modular circuit modeling approach was developed that can study various flavors of spintronic switching, such as based on spin torque, spin Hall and voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy. Impact of switching was studied at the level of a cascaded set of read-write-erase blocks in a circuit configuration, for instance, a ring oscillator.</p> <p>As part of this spintronic switching study, a first principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) study was employed to search and identify half-metallic magnets (one with almost all up and no down spins at the Fermi energy) within the Half-Heusler family. These materials can be used to build a magnetic tunnel junction with a record high tunnel magnetoresistance, where one can distinguish between parallel and antiparallel (0 and 1) binary resistance states with very low read current. While the DFT studies were done within an NSF-DMREF grant, the transport and device studies used to quantify the efficiency and current of the tunnel junction were pursued within this NSF-SHF grant.</p> <p>Moving on the Dirac cone systems, the focus was on Klein-Tunneling physics arising from the topology of spins in 3D Topological Insulators (TIs) and pseudospins (bonding-antibonding orbital configurations) of mono and bilayer graphene. By coupling the atomistic bandstructure of a TI with transport and micromagnetics, experimental set-ups were proposed to observe Klein Tunneling at a topological insulator PN junction through the voltage-dependence of its angular spin transmission profile, as detectable with a spin polarized scanning tip. Furthermore, the impact of Klein tunneling on switching was quantified by showing reversible switching of a low barrier ferromagnet driven by gate tunable spin filtering at the PN junction.</p> <p>Finally, the novel transport physics of topological excitations (skyrmions) in chiral magnetic films was explored. Using automated micromagnetic simulation scripts developed under the SHF grant, with material parameters from the NSF-DMREF, the phase space was obtained for ultra-small, stable, and fast interface driven skyrmions.
