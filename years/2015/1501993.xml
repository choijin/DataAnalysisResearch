<AbstractNarration>The Southern Ocean plays a dominant role in the oceanic uptake of excess (anthropogenic) carbon, yet the extent of this air-sea exchange process is poorly represented by earth system models, and its future projection remains highly uncertain. The O2/N2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean Study (ORCAS) seeks to advance understanding of the physical and biological controls on air-sea exchange and uptake of O2 and CO2 in the vast Southern Ocean. This will be investigated through intensive airborne surveys of atmospheric O2, CO2, related gases, their state of equilibrium, along with other ocean surface properties over diverse biogeochemical regions adjacent to the southern tip of South America and the Western Antarctic Peninsula. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ORCAS will utilize the NSF Gulfstream V (GV) aircraft equipped with a suite of high-precision in situ and remote sensing instruments, on 14 flights over a period of 6 weeks in austral mid-summer, from Punta Arenas, Chile, out over the Drake Passage, and with concurrent overflights of the ARSV LM Gould sampling the Palmer LTER site. ORCAS observations will be guided by, and used to test a suite of ocean biogeochemistry models to improve our understanding of key processes and feedbacks in this under sampled yet climatically important region of the world.</AbstractNarration>

One of the surprises from the ORCAS field measurements was the magnitude of the CO2 depletion we observed in the atmospheric boundary layer over the Southern Ocean, which was a factor of 2 greater than we expected from prior climatological estimates. Our analyses of this feature have focused on using models to put it in a broader spatial and year-to-year variability context, and to evaluate its implications for our understanding of the air-sea CO2 exchange in the region. We have found that the ORCAS CO2 gradients are generally consistent with an increase in Southern Ocean CO2 uptake relative to the late 1990s, speculated by others based on pCO2 measurements.  Additionally, we have determined that atmospheric profiles of CO2 provide an important constraint for understanding Southern Ocean CO2 fluxes.  Another primary observational result from ORCAS is that the O2:CO2 ratio of the atmospheric gradients was consistently negative, indicating a clear dominance of biological over thermal forcing of summertime Southern Ocean CO2 fluxes. This result is interesting because state-of-the art Earth system models currently disagree on the seasonal phasing of these CO2 fluxes and which process, biological uptake or outgassing as a result of surface warming, is the strongest driving force.
