<AbstractNarration>A direct-write laser (DWL) is a system used to pattern fine features without the need for a photomask or reticle.  This proposal requests funds for the acquisition of a DWL system for innovations in electronic and photonic device design that will be used for a variety of research applications at RIT.  The DWL system will positively impact the quality and productivity of research in several projects that are currently funded by NSF, as well as other agencies and industrial partners.  There are several application areas under investigation including thin-film electronics, nanophotonics &amp; micro-optics, III-V / silicon integration, photovoltaics, MEMS, microchannels &amp; 3D integration; each of which will utilize specific advantages and capabilities of the DWL system.  Participants will include undergraduates and graduate students in several programs at RIT, including PhD programs in Microsystems Engineering and Imaging Science.  The DWL system will also be a resource for laboratory courses in photolithography, thin-film processes, and microfabrication which provide research training to students that feed into the graduate programs.  The DWL system will be housed in a user facility which promotes collaborative multidisciplinary research.  A number of undergraduate and graduate students majoring in science and engineering will use this instrument for research including capstone senior design projects, MS and PhD theses.  The laboratory courses impacted are available as elective courses to all undergraduate and graduate students in engineering and science, and may count towards a 5-course minor in microfabrication.  This broadens the student base that gains experience with the DWL system and will help to further increase the number of students that are retained for graduate study and participate in research activities.  Results from the DWL system will provide a significant contribution to the literature in relevant and emerging scientific fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A DWL system fills an important niche in R&amp;D for pattern optimization prior to committing to a fixed photomask design.  Depending on the laser source wavelength and optical design, a DWL system offers resolution comparable to projection optical lithography.  There are several advantages that a DWL system has over traditional proximity or projection optical lithography that makes it an attractive alternative including the ability to handle a variety of substrate shapes and sizes, make on-demand pattern changes, and implement pattern variations within a sample.  These advantages support a significant increase in the efficiency of experimental design.  Exposure levels using a DWL system with fine pattern alignment can be intermixed with e-beam or traditional optical lithography levels, providing design flexibility on several levels of pattern transfer in a process sequence.  The DWL system will also provide capabilities in backside alignment and grayscale imaging, offering researchers new options in microfabrication which are generally not outsourced due to the associated engineering required for implementation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Heidelberg DWL66+ at RIT has enabled advancements in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics, supporting research activities by students at the graduate and undergraduate level.  The system supports laboratory courses which broadens the base of student participants.  The system supports research training which enables undergraduate capstone senior design projects, and graduate research at the MS and Ph.D. level.   The DWL has been used on a daily basis with very little downtime for maintenance.  The system has been used for maskwriting, supporting a wide variety of research projects, as well as the academic programs in microelectronic engineering.  The in-house maskmaking capability that the DWL provides allows for 1-day turnaround between design and fabrication.  Several research projects are utilizing the DWL to direct-write patterns on wafers and other substrates (e.g. glass slides, III-V wafer pieces), taking advantage of the ability to handle pieces and irregularly shaped substrates without difficulty.  Some designs are full-wafer large area patterns that are perfectly suited for the DWL system over other pattern transfer systems (e.g. contact printing) due to the ability to change a layout arrangement without generating a new mask set.   The DWL system is accessible to students through laboratory instruction (two courses in micro/nano lithography), as well through senior design capstone research projects and graduate research where students become trained on the system and pass a tool certification process.  Certified students can operate the system independently, allowing them to set up and run their own experimental designs.  Process information and results are recorded in logbook entries, which students are responsible for making sure information is complete and accurate.   Undergraduate students that have been on cooperative employment internships with research groups and companies local to the Rochester, NY area have also used the system for R&amp;D activities.   The DWL system has supported several investigations which have been published by research groups of the project PI and co-PIs.  Results have also been presented at conferences by the IEEE, MRS, ECS and SPIE that have acknowledged support of the NSF and the capabilities of the Heidelberg DWL66+ system.  Information has also been shared with other university labs through discussions on MIT?s "labnetwork" with process details for maskmaking and direct-write imaging posted on the RIT SMFL process wiki.
