<AbstractNarration>This project will explore the question of the origin of Inupiaq culture in northwestern Alaska at the end of the first millennium AD. The project will document the cultural histories, social interactions, population diversity and dispersal, and environmental changes from data collected at Cape Espenberg and in relation to the greater Bering Strait and Arctic regions.  The research team will work together with community members in Shishmaref to conduct archaeological excavation, paleoecology and ancient DNA research to better understand who were the people that first settled the area around AD 1000, when and from where they came, and in what environmental conditions these events took place. At the same time they will work with cultural advisers and Shishmaref community members who have ancestral ties to the area to explore how material culture and landscape is interpreted to talk about the past and tell history.  The project will promote progress of science and education by conducting basic research and developing new methods in the several research fields involved. By insuring and promoting proper conservation of artifacts the project, will increase awareness and capacity to preserve the growing catalog of perishable organic artifacts, increasingly exposed due to eroding coastal and thawing permafrost. By including indigenous perspectives on material culture, the research will promote an archaeology that is more receptive to multiple voices. The project will also foster national and international collaborations between four US research institutes, a French University (U. of Panth√©on Sorbonne), a rural Alaska community and a regional non-profit corporation. Associated with the project a variety of initiatives represent opportunities in research, education and training for a number of underrepresented Alaska minorities, women, and undergraduate and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aims of this multidisciplinary program of research is to explore human interaction, settlement history, climate and landscape dynamics in relation to the Birnirk archaeological complex at ca. AD 1000. After a period of hiatus, Birnirk site KTZ-304 at Cape Espenberg (Inuigniq) was occupied at a pivotal cultural and environmental moment in Northwest Alaska and the larger Bering Sea region, just before AD 1000 and prior to the emergence of Inupiaq culture around AD 1300. Cape Espenberg is a key location for this cultural history both because of the presence of Ipiutak, Birnik and Thule archaeological sites and as ancestral land of today's Kigiqtaamiut of Shishmaref. Interrelated and integrated analytical approaches involving cultural and physical anthropology, archaeology and paleoecology will (a) form the framework for continued excavation at site KTZ-304 (b) contribute to study architectural features, archaeofauna, ceramics, and artifacts in order to elucidate social networks, subsistence systems and technology, and to understand the impact of climate and resource availability on peoples activities, decisions and movements; (c) guide the collecting of paleoenvironmental data through targeted sampling of swales and ridges to date dune ridge stabilization, reconstruct terrestrial vegetation and map the location of the ocean relative to the site; (d) integrate ancient DNA (aDNA) studies to establish the broader genetic relationships of Inuit societies in the region and beyond; (e) explore how Kigiqtaamiut interpret material culture to understand the past, narrate history and generate knowledge (f) foster a dialog on the role of material culture today in the community of Shishmaref and in between the Kigiqtaamiut and the scientists to construct more reflexive interpretations of the past, and thus (g) advance understanding of the origin of Inupiaq culture through the development of a high-resolution chronology of settlement and landscape formation, cultural shift and climate variation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Portland State University (PSU), led by Shelby Anderson, collaborated with several other institutions on a three year (2015-2018) multidisciplinary program of research to explore human interaction, settlement history, climate and landscape dynamics in relation to the Birnirk archaeological complex of northern Alaska, ca. AD 1000 (Figure 1). This is the second of two collaborative projects at the Cape, the first conducted from 2009-2011). The Cape Espenberg site complex is comprised of multiple components spanning ca. 4,500 BP to recent<sup> </sup>(Alix et al. 2018)(Figure 1).&nbsp; After a period of hiatus, the Birnirk site (KTZ-304) at Cape Espenberg was occupied at a pivotal cultural and environmental moment in Northwest Alaska and the larger Bering Sea region, just before 950 BP and prior to the emergence of Inupiaq culture around 650 BP. Cape Espenberg is a key location for this cultural history both because of the presence of Ipiutak, Birnirk and Thule archaeological sites and as ancestral land of today's Kigiqtaamiut of Shishmaref.</p> <p>The major goals of the project were to use interrelated and integrated analytical approaches involving cultural and physical anthropology, archaeology and paleoecology to: 1) form the framework for continued excavation at site KTZ-304; 2) contribute to study architectural features, archaeofauna, &nbsp;ceramics, and artifacts in order to elucidate social networks, subsistence systems and technology, and to understand the impact of climate and resource availability on peoples activities, decisions and movements; 3) guide the collecting of paleoenvironmental data through targeted sampling of swales and ridges to date dune ridge stabilization, reconstruct terrestrial vegetation and map the location of the ocean relative to the site; 4) integrate ancient DNA (aDNA) studies to establish the broader genetic relationships of Inuit societies in the region and beyond; 5) explore how Kigiqtaamiut interpret material culture to understand the past, narrate history and generate knowledge; 6) foster a dialog on the role of material culture today in the community of Shishmaref and in between the Kigiqtaamiut and the scientists to construct more reflexive interpretations of the past, and thus; 7) advance understanding of the origin of Inupiaq culture through the development of a high-resolution chronology of settlement and landscape formation, cultural shift and climate variation.&nbsp;</p> <p>PSU was responsible for research on ceramic materials recovered from the excavation (Figure 2 and 3) and for coordinating lipid and isotope analyses of ceramics and sediments as part of project research on diet, food processing, and fuel use. The goals of ceramic technological analysis were to address questions about Birnirk and Ancestral Inupiaq (Thule) subsistence and technology, with broader implications for interpreting seasonal movements and interaction with other people around region. Ceramic technology was adopted in Alaska as early as 2800-2500 years BP and became prevalent after 1500 BP in the Birnirk (ca. 950 BP) and Thule periods (ca. 650 BP).&nbsp; Pre-1500 BP vessels are thin-walled, mineral tempered, with globular shape; post-1,500 B.P vessels are thick-walled, flower-pot shaped, with flat bottoms and straight walls.&nbsp; Changes in vessel construction and morphology may represent cultural shifts in subsistence and food preparation practices, that could relate to cultural, environmental, and settlement pattern shifts over time.</p> <p>Ceramic analysis methods included metric analysis of ceramic technological properties to inform on production and use, as well as a comparison of KTZ-304 Birnirk ceramic technology to that of the Birnirk type site (BAR-1) in Barrow. Both petrographic and residue data were analyzed to characterize Birnirk ceramic technology and to link ceramic use to other Cape Espenberg subsistence data (see also Anderson et al. 2017). PSU collaborated with Tammy Buonasera (UC-Davis) to conduct residue analysis on ceramic vessels and sediments to provide another line of evidence regarding Birnirk diet, as well as addressing questions about fuel use and the intersection of ceramics, fuels, and food during food processing activities.&nbsp; Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) was conduct to identify ceramic source regions and inform study of mobility over the Birnirk-Thule transition.</p> <p>PSU's research resulted in new insights into changing patterns of mobility, food getting, and social networks in the North American Arctic over the last 1000 years (Figure 4) during a period of significant cultural and environmental change.&nbsp; More specifically, our ceramic analysis illustrates how mobility shifted during the period, ca. 1000 BP, when the culture of the ancestors of the modern-day Inupiaq of Northern Alaska developed.&nbsp; Bayesian analysis of new radiocarbon dates clarifies the timing of these transitions.&nbsp; This research also provides new information into how Ancestral Inupiaq communities were connected across the Bering Strait and North Slope regions through shared ceramic technology, decorative styles, and through interaction and exchange of goods and materials.&nbsp;</p> <p>Numerous undergraduates and graduate students were trained and gained experience as part of the PSU Espenberg research teach.&nbsp; In addition, we shared research results with the descendent community of Shishmaref, and with our broader professional community through various posters, presentations, and papers.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/06/2021<br>      Modified by: Shelby&nbsp;Anderson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1523079/1523079_10404098_1625595493208_Anderson_outcomes_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1523079/1523079_10404098_1625595493208_Anderson_outcomes_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1523079/1523079_10404098_1625595493208_Anderson_outcomes_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cape Espenberg site and feature locations (Modified from Braymer et al. 2020)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Johonna Shea</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Shelby&nbsp;Anderson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1523079/1523079_10404098_1625595549766_Anderson_outcomes_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1523079/1523079_10404098_1625595549766_Anderson_outcomes_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1523079/1523079_10404098_1625595549766_Anderson_outcomes_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Common Ancestral IÔøΩupiaq-Inuit ceramic types of Northwest Alaska: A) Dentate stamp, B) Curvilinear stamp, C) Corrugated, D) Waffle stamp, E) Textile impressed (various), F) Striated.

Bayesian analysis of new radiocarbon dates clarifies the timing of these transitions.  This research also provides new information into how Ancestral Inupiaq communities were connected across the Bering Strait and North Slope regions through shared ceramic technology, decorative styles, and through interaction and exchange of goods and materials.   Numerous undergraduates and graduate students were trained and gained experience as part of the PSU Espenberg research teach.  In addition, we shared research results with the descendent community of Shishmaref, and with our broader professional community through various posters, presentations, and papers.
