<AbstractNarration>This third phase of support for the Center for Child Injury Prevention Studies builds on a strong foundation that will, at the end of five years, transition into sustainability with the help of a broad base of industry and interested government agency support.  This Industry/University Cooperative Research Center is the only one devoted to the study of child, youth, and young adult automotive injury and injury prevention; and it applies its leadership position, cutting edge research, and synergistic partnerships to achieve its mission, by facilitating the conduct of scientific inquiry into child automotive injuries and translating these findings into commercial applications, interventions, policies, and public education programs for prevention. The fundamental idea behind the Center is that children, youth, and young adults are not small adults (mechanically, psychologically, developmentally, or socially) and car crash injuries are one of  their leading causes of death and acquired disability. Effective interventions, based on sound scientific foundations to car crash injuries in these age groups and their causes, are a national priority. As regulation, technology and consumer behavior and demand become increasingly complex and sophisticated, industry and government research and findings from the Center are able to guide strategies to protect our nation's children.  The Center for Child Injury Prevention Studies works collaboratively with industry across five related themes: biomechanics; technological solutions; human factors; safety promotion and education; and evaluation; and over the course of the last ten years the Center has more than quadrupled its dues paying membership from 5 to 22 members, initiating and completing 92 individual research projects that heavily leverage private sector funds. Broader impacts of the Center include student education and engagement in research, promoting the national health by providing fundamental research on child injuries and strategies for prevention, and performing precompetitive research of interest to a wide variety of private sector and governmental sponsors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this renewal phase (Phase III), Center leadership and its Industrial Advisory Board will continue to refine Center processes that they develop collaboratively to ensure that research carried out by the Center is diverse and responsive to scientific and industry needs. In the new phase, the Center is expanding its intellectual and research reach from automotive injuries and prevention to include those of injuries related to sports and aviation.</AbstractNarration>

With its unique and highly successfully translational research model, faculty experts in engineering, psychology, cognitive science, education and epidemiology, work with leading companies, federal agencies and advocacy groups to conduct research that is transformative and interdisciplinary, tackling complex, real-world problems that require a broad perspective. Our experienced outreach team ensures that our results are shared broadly for maximal impact.  Central to our work is the recognition that children are not small adults (mechanically, psychologically, developmentally, and socially). Therefore, child injury deserves to be examined and understood as a distinct branch of science. CChIPS funds a research portfolio that addresses cutting edge topics that impact children, keeping pace with research, technological and societal changes; including, autonomous vehicle technologies; changes in consumer behavior, transformations in medical care, and advances in biomechanics and brain science. The highly collaborative CChIPS model ensures that the research is readily applied to practical solutions by our industry and federal agency members.  Our five main areas of research and key achievements in each area are highlighted below:  Injury biomechanics, mechanisms, and tolerance: This theme informed priorities for technological development. Novel protocols in human volunteer studies revealed how children, youth and young adults respond to forces like those they might experience in a vehicle.  We identified child-specific injury risks (e.g. from side impact crashes), for specific sub-groups of child passengers (e.g. children in rear-facing and forward-facing child restraints) through sled testing and computational modeling and analyzed crash investigation databases to quantify real world injury risks and mechanisms of injury. Technological solutions (design, development and testing): This theme advanced safety technology for children through innovations and improvements in child crash test dummies (better representativeness of real children - biofidelity); and computational models and automotive safety devices that improved the accuracy of testing results, informed new product development and evaluated safety technologies. These efforts led directly to enhanced federal safety regulatory priorities, new safety product development and trauma medical protocols. Human interaction with and behavior related to safety technology: This theme advanced the acceptability and usability of safety product and adoption of safety behaviors. Specifically, CChIPS researchers ensured that the experience of children and families were a critical consideration in autonomous vehicles through influential usability assessments and qualitative research.  We utilized a driving simulator to observe the impact of distractions such as peer passengers and technology on young driver behavior and explored innovative ways to link and analyze traffic safety data to more effectively understand driver and passenger behavior in the real-world and make tailored recommendations for training and policy change.   Safety promotion and education: This theme provided the evidence base to guide the many educational efforts underway to improve the protection of children during transportation.  Areas of focus included a) identification of teen drivers’ perceived need for advanced driver assistance systems, receptiveness to in-vehicle technology, and intervention preferences, b) understanding the strengths and critical gaps in flight attendant and parents’ knowledge/perceptions that lead to low child restraint system use for child airline passengers and c) caregiver utilization of child restraint system use, carpooling behaviors and distracted driving behaviors. Evaluation of safety devices or behavior modification programs: This theme used a diversity of rigorous methodologies in the laboratory, community and on-line to evaluate the impact of technological and behavioral interventions on child injury and safety.  Achievements included a multi-year project that used a combination of sled testing and finite element modeling to examine the performance of different types of booster seats in side impact crashes and benefits of specific aspects of child restraint design (e.g. load legs, side impact wings, tethers, lower attachments) to improve safety of children in crashes.  We also created an educational automated feedback system to teach caregivers how to install and use a CRS correctly.     CChIPS is committed to growing the injury workforce. All CChIPS project incorporated students, training over 230 students. A complimentary NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates site and OSU’s Injury Biomechanics Symposium gave trainees more opportunities to engage in and present to academic and industry leaders in injury.  CChIPS will continue as a thriving graduated, self-funded I/UCRC and welcomes new member companies to join this exciting and vibrant center.
