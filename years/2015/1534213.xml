<AbstractNarration>The conference "The Legacy of Bernhard Riemann after One Hundred and Fifty Years" will be held at Tsinghua Sanya International Mathematics Forum with dates December 27-30, 2015. There are only a few mathematicians in history whose work is still intensively studied after 150 years in its original form and continue to provide inspiration to generations to come. Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) is one such mathematician. In this conference, young mathematicians and students will get both deep insights and gain inspiration from Riemann's work. The event will provide a forum to discuss future directions of development of mathematics and their interaction with physics. The URL for the event website is:  http://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/sanya/2015/LBR2015/synopsis_organizers.aspx&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One only need think of concepts such as Riemann surfaces, Riemannian manifolds, the Riemann integral, and the Riemann zeta function to realize the depth and breadth of Riemann's work.  Indeed, Riemann's contributions have set the foundations of entire areas of mathematics which are actively studied. Among these, Riemann's study of the geometry of space has evolved into one of the most important problems in geometry and theoretical physics: what is the geometry of space-time that can simultaneously explain the very small scale physics (quantum physics) and very large scale physics (cosmology as explained by general relativity)?  The organizers expect this problem to be a major driving force of geometry and theoretical physics in this century. This conference will feature a number of distinguished speakers, including Professor Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study. The activity will put Riemann's work into proper perspective, while attracting a younger generation of mathematicians to these subjects, and providing a forum to discuss future directions of development of mathematics and their interaction with physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bernhard Riemann was one of the greatest and original mathematicians in the history of mathematics. Even though he had a relatively short life, his work covered almost all major branches of mathematics. Even more importantly, his work is still relevant and is directly affecting what mathematicians do now. For example, the most famous open problem in mathematics now is the Riemann hypothesis which predicts that all nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have the real part equal to 1/2. Reimann raised this question in the only paper on number theory he wrote, and he introduced the method of complex analysis into number theory and changed forever the subject of number theory. His introduction of the notion of Riemann surfaces and the parameter spaces for Riemann surfaces (usually called moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces) has also changed both subjects of complex analysis and algebraic geometry. He also started the subject of differential geometry, which provided the right framework for Einstein's theory of general relativity. These are only some of the highlights of Riemann's work, even though Riemann only published 9 papers in his lifetime. Many works and ideas of Riemann have not been fully understood. At this conference   ``The Legacy of Bernhard Riemann After One Hundred and Fifty Years", we have gathered experts on subjects influenced by Riemann's work in both mathematics and physics. For example, Edward Witten was one of the speakers and commented on the integration of mathematics and physics in Riemann's work. Many young mathematicians and graduate students attended. The unity of mathematics permeated the conference and reflected Riemann's perspective on mathematics. In connection with this conference, a book titled "The Legacy of Bernhard Riemann After One Hundred and Fifty Years" was published right before the conference and displayed there. This book consists of many detailed commentaries on the work of Riemann and surveys of subjects influenced by him, for example, the current status of Riemann hypothesis. In summary, this conference provided a stimulating environment to both young and established mathematicians and was a successful one.
