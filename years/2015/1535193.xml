<AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This postdoctoral research project proposes to examine public attitudes in the US and the UK on unconventional oil and gas extraction technologies. Specifically, the project will focus on ideas about urgency as they figure in emergent public views on the risks, benefits and impacts of technologies used in hydraulic fracturing (fracking) to access oil and gas in deep shale rock. The postdoc will engage in a comparative analysis of existing qualitative data on how diverse groups of everyday people in the US and the UK attach ideas about urgency to economic, environmental, social, and political aspects of new unconventional oil and gas technologies. The results of this project will be of interest to STS scholars, environmental scientists and engineers, industry specialists, and policymakers working in multiple fields including energy systems, climate change, environmental justice; more broadly, they will be of interest to any who have a stake in in the perceptions and anticipated behavior of diverse publics regarding present and future energy extraction, production, and consumption. Broad dissemination of research results will be achieved through publications, and through the preparation of a white paper report and a policy brief. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is a cross-national comparative case analysis of the effects of fracking technologies on diverse publics' social values, relationships, livelihoods and practices in the two study countries through the lens of urgency. A detailed, qualitative account of how urgency operates in emergent public attitudes on unconventional extraction technologies will contribute new scholarly understanding to key debates within both STS and risk perception literatures on responsibility, equity, trust, and governance, and broader issues of energy and society, all critical issues in the emerging field of Responsible Innovation. The proposed focus on urgency will provide a new perspective for examining technological controversies, and will systematize approaches for understanding its effects on amplification of risk and benefit perception. The comparative cross-national study will provide greater clarity about the processes in play in each country and their historical specificities in approaches to energy futures. The proposed analysis will be conducted using an existing set of extensive qualitative data collected from four public deliberation workshops convened in October 2014 by a collaborative team including the PI and co-PI of this project.</AbstractNarration>

As a comparative cross-national study in the US and UK, the project provides greater clarity about the processes in play in each country and their historical specificities in approaches to understanding and implementing different energy futures.  Results have been shared through a series of publications in high-impact interdisciplinary journals and presentations at professional conferences (including annual meetings of the Society for Risk Analysis and the Society for Social Studies of Science).  Postdoctoral Fellow Partridge and PI Harthorn were first author and corresponding author respectively on primary publications from this research &ndash; all written in collaboration with international collaborators at the Understanding Risk Group at Cardiff University (UK). One paper, entitled "Urgency in energy justice: Contestation and time in prospective shale extraction in the United States and United Kingdom" was published in the leading cross-disciplinary journal Energy Research &amp; Social Science. This article advances the emergent field of ?energy justice,? and draws attention to the importance of issues of urgency to related fields of scholarship, policy, and research. The same team secured publication of another article, in the cross-disciplinary journal, Environmental Values, entitled "Disturbed Earth: Conceptions of the deep underground in shale extraction deliberations in the US and UK." In this article we show that concerns about prospective shale extraction in both the US and UK were not limited to specific, localized impacts but also addressed ecosystem links between surface and subsurface environments and raised broader questions about the use, identification and value of natural resources. A third article, "Seeing futures now: Emergent US and UK views on shale development, climate change and energy systems" was published in the high-impact, cross-disciplinary journal Global Environmental Change. PI Harthorn is first author on the article "Health risk perception and shale development in the UK and US," which is currently under review.  The above publications extend the work of the project that has resulted in collaborative research papers on research methods, comparative reviews of public perceptions of energy development, and public engagement in science and technology decision making. Postdoctoral Fellow Partridge and PI Harthorn were co-authors on the articles "Using role play to explore energy perceptions in the United States and United Kingdom" published in Energy Research &amp; Social Science, "Public perceptions of hydraulic fracturing for shale gas and oil in the United States and Canada" in WIREs Climate Change, and an article that received media coverage in both the US and the UK, "Deliberating the perceived risks, benefits and societal implications of shale gas and oil extraction by hydraulic fracturing in the US and UK" published in Nature Energy.  Project results address social and ethical aspects of modes of energy extraction, generation, distribution, and consumption. As such, this project and its findings are of interest to environmental scientists and engineers, industry specialists, and policymakers working in multiple fields (energy systems, climate change, environmental justice) who have a stake in diverse publics? perceptions (and anticipated behavior) regarding present and future energy practices. This project also expands on methods to broaden public participation with science and technology, analyzing aspects of social location in deliberative contexts, and their influence on public engagement.
