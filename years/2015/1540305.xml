<AbstractNarration>This project supports hosting the four-day 23th edition of the GENI Engineering Conference (GEC), including organizing and hosting the demo session, to be held June 15-18, 2015, on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus. The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a virtual instrument that is rapidly emerging in prototype form across the United States. GENI is an instrument designed to address three issues:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Science Issues: We cannot currently understand or predict the behavior of complex, large-scale networks;&lt;br/&gt;2) Society Issues: We increasingly rely on the Internet but are unsure we can trust its security, privacy or resilience; and&lt;br/&gt;3) Innovation Issues: Pre-GENI substantial barriers existed to at-scale experimentation with new architectures, services, and technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GENI addresses these issues via scale (from federation) and support for two kinds of experiments: 1) controlled and repeatable experiments, which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks; and 2) in-the-wild trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today's Internet and that engage large numbers of human participants. The GEC meeting and Demo sessions provide graduate students with both an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to formal publication. It is a key part of helping new graduate students understand what is being done with GENI and who amongst their peers at other institutions might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new community members, including the emerging US Ignite community. GENI is already being used as an instrument for research; this project supports further development and use of the research instrument.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 23rd GENI Engineering Conference Project Outcomes Report  The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign hosted the 23rd GENI Engineering Conference (GEC 23) from June 15 to 18, 2015. The four-day conference brought together users, developers and operators for GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovations). The conference helped further GENIÆs mission by promoting innovations in network science, security, services and applications.   GEC 23Æs agenda covered a wide range of topics and activities.  These included:  Newcomers Day. For those new to GENI, there was a detailed overview of the project, architecture and foundational components such as OpenFlow, as well as hands-on tutorials to learn how to use the GENI desktop to setup and instrument tests with experimental protocols across the network of switches.  A panel discussion on practical Software Defined Exchanges (SDX) deployments.  A tutorial  on using CloudLab to do research on the future of cloud computing.  Multiple sessions on planning the future of GENI.  A presentation and demo on Chameleon Cloud Platform,which is a configurable experimental environment for large-scale cloud research.  A presentation and tutorial on OpenFlow, which showed how to setup and control an OpenFlow switch.  Tutorials on using Virtual Topology Service (VTS).  Updates on Operations and Monitoring of GENI racks, including a tutorial session with the GENIMonitoring tools.  A diverse evening demo session held at the Memorial Stadium Colonnades Club with 30 demonstrations on cloud computing, SDN and OpenFlow, experiments and education, infrastructure and measurement, manufacturing, and life-safety applications.  In summary, GEC 23 achieved itÆs goal of allowing participants to engage in a range of activities designed to boost their understanding of and expertise on obtaining compute resources from locations around the United States, connecting computer resources using Layer 2 networks in topologies best suited to their experiments, installing custom software or even custom operating systems on those compute resources, controlling how network switches in their experiment handle traffic flows and running their own Layer 3 and above protocols by installing protocol software in their compute resources and by providing flow controllers for their switches.
