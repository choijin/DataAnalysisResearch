<AbstractNarration>With a decline in Americans pursuing advanced education in STEM fields (more than 67% of engineers receiving Ph.Ds in the U.S. are not U.S. citizens and only 18% of engineers are female, it became apparent that priming the pipeline with diverse, qualified, and prepared students is mission critical. Understanding, actively engaging, and retaining a diverse population of inquisitive students prepared with critical thinking skills is paramount. Recent studies have shown that active learning, which engages children in activities and involves interactions with peers, as opposed to passive listening, emphasizes higher-order thinking and results in significantly better comprehension and performance. To address this national problem, this team has developed the "A Hundred Tiny Hands" that focuses on teaching modern science concepts in a playful and cooperative way, through a combination of physical Inventor?s Toolboxes and an online social media platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Hundred Tiny Hands proposes 3 avenues for adoption: direct to consumers; working with after school / outreach and children's organizations (including Girl Scouts and Big Brothers Big Sisters); and adoption from private, charter schools and eventually public school districts. The typical user for the (initial) Inventor's Toolboxes is a child (especially girls) between the ages of 6-10. The buyers for the 3 different scenarios, however, are very different. For the direct to consumer approach, the buyers would be the parents, typically highly educated, tech oriented professionals with disposable income who understands the importance of STEM literacy. In order to reach a broader demographic and children who otherwise would not have access to such toys, the team has forged relationships with various children?s programs, outreach/low income programs, and after school/ summer camps. Finally, the team is working with key decision makers of school districts and charter schools to gain adoption into the STEM curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

The Tiny Hands platform consists of 3 different Inventor&rsquo;s Toolboxes that teach modern science and engineering concepts (tested with children 5-12), through maker tools, social and kinesthetic learning activities, open ended play and guided challenges, and character driven comic books with story arcs that teach the science concepts. We went through Lean Start up methodology as part of the award, and interviewed over 100 customers. Because of I-Corps, we were able to hone and improve on our prototypes. The Inventor&rsquo;s Toolboxes have now been tested with hundreds of children ages 6 and up. We have talked with parents, teachers, children, and other stake-holders to best understand the need we are addressing. We identified a more specific age group to focus in on (ages 6-9) and identified partners to work with. As a result, TinyHands is now being sold on Amazon and through Discovery Cube. The TinyHands comic book is also available on Reading Rainbow. We have stated working with more community and school programs. Most recently, we are negotiating a licensing deal with a major educational partner.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/04/2016<br>      Modified by: Michelle&nbsp;Khine</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
