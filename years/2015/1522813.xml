<AbstractNarration>Following the example of the previous three successful Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposia at the University of Georgia, this award will support participation in a cycle of three conferences rotating among major research universities in Georgia: Emory, University of Georgia, and Georgia Tech. The first conference will take place at Emory University on October 16-18, 2015. The second conference will take place at the University of Georgia in October 2016, and the third at Georgia Tech in October 2017.  The aim is to sustain and grow collaborations between mathematicians in the Southeast, and to nurture a new and diverse generation of students and postdocs, by providing a regular series of exciting mathematical activities and a forum to meet peers and attend talks by leading experts in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry are some of the most established and active areas of mathematics and have deep connections with many other subjects. In addition to their central role in mathematics, they have important applications in encryption, physics, engineering, biology, and a host of other sciences. The conferences will aim at presenting the latest advances in these fields to a wide audience of local researchers, students, and postdocs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symposium web site:  http://research.franklin.uga.edu/gags/</AbstractNarration>

The specific goals of this cycle of conferences is to strengthen the research ties between the major universities in Georgia, and the Southeast region; to provide oportunities to the students in the Southeast and beyond to attend lectures by the world-renown and rising-star mathematicians on new and exciting research; and for the selected young people also an opportunity to deliver a talk on their own research.   All goals of the project were successfully accomplished. We had exciting talks by leading researchers from the US, France, Russia, and Canada. After a stiff competition, ten best young people were chosen to deliver mini-talks on their own research. All talks, including the mini talks, were very well received to full rooms.  There were about 100 registered conference participants, the majority of them students and postdocs. This was an exciting event for everyone who participated. For many young people, this was the first major conference to attend. For the young people who delivered mini-talks this was also a very important exposure and invaluable experience.   The main point of dissemination is our web page https://sites.google.com/site/galgeoms2017. It contains the schedule, abstracts of all the talks, PDFs of selected talks, and the list of registered participants.
