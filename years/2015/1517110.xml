<AbstractNarration>All cellular functions require that proteins group together in different combinations, forming complexes with highly specialized functions. Yet, conventional approaches for studying such complexes have significant limitations. For example, because some complexes come apart easily, they are invisible to many standard experimental approaches. In addition, some proteins can alter their shape to interact with different partner proteins. To address some of the limitations of conventional approaches to study protein complexes, a new method called DEEPN will be refined that uses modern cutting-edge DNA sequencing technology to help identify protein interactions. DEEPN will be applied to the study of an important family of proteins that change their shape in response to biological stimuli. These studies will have high scientific impact since they will define new connections between proteins and their functions. This project will simplify and streamline this new methodological approach so that it is easy, effective and economical for other scientific investigators of varying levels of expertise (including undergraduate researchers) to perform. In addition, a number of interdisciplinary research and educational activities for undergraduates will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DEEPN strategy (Dynamic Enrichment for Evaluation of Protein Networks) was developed as a robust method for simultaneous discovery of dozens of protein interactions with statistical certainty. DEEPN uses newly available next-generation, high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches to computationally determine protein interactions. This technique will be used to comprehensively describe the protein complexes that involve members of an important family of proteins that regulate many cell functions, the Ras superfamily. These proteins are among those that undergo a shape change that influences their function, and DEEPN will be used to follow specifically how such changes affect the composition of protein complexes. The scientific merit of this work is that it will bring new mechanistic insights into how members of the Ras superfamily of proteins collectively contribute to almost all aspects of cellular function. The impact of this study will be broad because it will: 1) streamline methods and develop new computational tools that will allow other investigators to apply the DEEPN approach to the study of other important cellular functions, and 2) integrate aspects of the DEEPN approach into a laboratory class, exposing upper-level undergraduate students to how molecular biology and computational bioinformatics can be combined for modern state-of-the-art cell biology research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Eukaryotic cells contain thousands of proteins that interact with each other in ways that allow a multitude of physiological processes to occur at the right time and place.  One of the remaining steps toward a complete understanding of cell and molecular biology is to determine the full set of binding partners for each protein in the cell. We have developed a new approach called DEEPN (Dynamic Enrichment for Evaluation of Protein Networks) that takes advantage of yeast genetics, state of the art next-generation DNA sequencing analysis, and novel computational methods to find and compare protein binding partners.   A goal of this project was to use DEEPN to find specific binding partners for a very large and important protein family, the Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins. These proteins are essential for cells because they act like molecular switches that can turn critical processes on and off. The small GTP-binding proteins exist in two conformations, &Prime;on&Prime; and &Prime;off&Prime;.  We have used DEEPN to find on and off-conformation specific binding proteins for over 40 members of this protein family that will yield important insight into regulation of cellular processes such as synthesizing and responding to hormones.     There were also goals for this project designed to provide broader impact.  We developed a set of laboratory procedures and created a user-friendly DEEPN software package that can be used by other cell and molecular biologists to facilitate the identification of protein binding partners. Finally, we have developed undergraduate laboratory course materials based on the DEEPN process and used its genetic, molecular biological, and computational aspects as a set of hands-on teaching exercises for students.  These materials are being used at the University of Iowa, Gustavus Adolphus College, Hofstra University, Rhodes College, and Mt. Mercy College as part of their undergraduate laboratory cell biology coursework.  The course work allows students to learn genetics, molecular biology, and computational biology, while contributing to an actual ongoing scientific project.
