<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Summary&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a computational driven approach to develop the design principles of polymeric membranes which present an efficient solution for emergent technologies, such as CO2 capture and natural gas purification. While there have been many advances made in this field, most of them have been performed empirically - consequently, it is reasonable to state that there is little quantitative understanding of the molecular principles that control the separation ability of these membrane materials. Driven by these facts, here we propose to critically delineate the underpinnings of these separation technologies using a suite of molecular simulation methods on a variety of models, going from those directly relevant to experiment to ones that focus in extracting universal principles. &lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of the proposed research could result in the development of computational tools and fundamental understanding that could facilitate robust design methodologies for polymeric membranes specific to current and emerging clean energy technologies. Highly permeable, but selective, polymeric materials will enable efficient, low-cost, CO2 separations. These research efforts will be coupled to a suite of education and outreach activities. Driven by the group's recent success in recruiting high school and undergraduate students for summer research, the proposal is to continue to recruit students from historically minority schools, as well as undergraduate and high school students from the greater New York City area. The PI's group has previously worked with several women and minority high school students who have subsequently decided to study science and engineering in college. The proposal is to continue this pipeline approach to recruit and retain underrepresented minorities in science and engineering fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a computationally-driven approach to develop the design principles of polymeric materials for membrane applications - materials which present an efficient solution for emergent technologies, such as CO2 capture and natural gas purification. These polymeric materials have to be capable of selective and efficient transport of gases. The main objective of the proposed research is to critically delineate factors controlling separation processes in polymeric membranes by using a suite of molecular simulation methods, going from those directly relevant to experiment to ones that focus in extracting universal principles. &lt;br/&gt;The PI's approach is focused on the local, vibrational dynamics of a dense glassy polymer, as characterized by the long-time plateau value of the mean-squared displacement of the frozen matrix. This is postulated to define the appropriate dynamic "free-volume" metric. The PI's group will establish: if this dynamic "free-volume" metric is universal, if it has experimental backing, and how it is affected by chain stiffness, chain packing, solute-solvent interactions, the solute size and shape, the glassiness of the matrix, and the presence of heterogeneities such as nanoparticles. This will be achieved through a fundamental, simulation-based understanding of this relationship.  &lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of the proposed research could result in the development of computational tools and fundamental understanding that could facilitate design methodologies for polymeric and polymer-hybrid membranes specific to current and emerging clean energy technologies. Highly permeable, but selective, polymeric materials will enable efficient, low-cost, CO2 separations. These research efforts will be coupled to a suite of education and outreach activities. Driven by the PI's group recent success in recruiting high school and undergraduate students for summer research, the proposal is to continue recruitment of students from historically minority schools, as well as undergraduate and high school students from the greater New York City area.

Our work, which covers four published papers,and in addition a review paper in J Chem Phys., has addressed many of the issues raised in that proposal. Two more publications are in advanced stages of preparation.   Intellectual Merit:  Robeson Upper Bound from Simulations: Although solubility-selective membranes are often used in pervaporation processes, most glassy membranes used for gas separations rely on a strong size-sieving effect, i.e., through a large diffusion selectivity. In agreement with these notions, previous coarse-grained simulations suggest that gas solubility only follows a power law dependence on solute size ; thus, the permeability should be dominated by the exponential dependence of diffusion on solute size. From here the expression for the full selectivity follows. We thus recognize that the upper bound slope primarily depends on the functional form of the diffusivity so long as the solubility is insensitive to polymer permeability. Given these background facts, we thus first focused on the diffusivity part of the gas separation problem in this study. As noted earlier, our understanding of the slope of the Upper bound especially if it has a maximum value, remains open.     We performed Molecular Dynamics simulations of penetrant diffusion using three different coarse-grained polymer models. While chemical details are apparently not necessary to understand the Robeson plot slope, it is clear that stiffer polymers are better separation media (i.e., have higher  values) as has been conjectured previously by Koros.This result might provide us with a logical pathway for examining the idea of a maximum possible upper bound- does this occur when polymers are on the verge of their isotropic-nematic transition, i.e., where the polymer is as stiff as possible while still remaining amorphous? Or does Knudson diffusion take over at lower stiffnesses. This remains an open question that is motivated by our current work.   Membranes Comprised of Nanoparticles Grafted with Polymer Chains: Mixed matrix membranes can play a key role in several industrially important gas separation technologies, e.g., removing CO2from natural gas, with enormous economic and environmental impact. Baker advocates the development of such novel membrane architecturessince current, pure polymer membranes only offer limited systematic pathways for improvement. In independent work we developed a novel hybrid membrane construct comprised entirely of NPs grafted with polymers. These membranes are shown to have broadly tunable separation performance through variations in graft density and chain length.   Computer simulations: We performed computer simulations of spherical NPs of diameter 5 (the size scale is set by the monomer diameter). We grafted 20 chains per NP and in this case each chain was of length 40. The chain monomers were modeled through the flexible Kremer-Grest model, with interactions truncated such that they were repulsive everywhere.

Each box had 32 NPs and each system was simulated over a range of pressures, P, using the LAMMPS algorithm. In parallel, we simulated neat polymer melts without NPs ("ungrafted") under the same pressure conditions. We simulated the diffusion of several sized solutes in these systems, but below we report results for hard spheres of diameter 0.4 which are closest in spirit to the gas molecules of interest. Our results show that gas transport is speeded up in the composite relative to the neat polymer, but only at high densities where the polymer is close to vitrification.

We thus verifies that the increased mobility of gases can be attributed to the fact that the polymer density in the composite is always considerably lower than in the corresponding neat polymer.  Multiple experimental probes confirm that these materials have the predicted increase in "polymer volume", which explains their improved separation performance. However, the experimental decreases are about an order of magnitiude smaller than the simulations, presumably because the experimental chain lengths were much longer. Why grafting chains to NPs reduces the polymer (melt) density, and why this trend is accentuated in the vicinity of the polymer glass transition are two outstanding questions that we shall study in the proposed work.  Broader Impacts: Kumar has participated in several programs (NPR, New York Times, most recently on Feb. 7, 2018) on science outreach through the popular media. He has performed outreach through summer REU and high school programs, primarily to minority students, who spent time in their laboratories.
