<AbstractNarration>This award will provide participant support for US graduate students to participate in the Cygnus 2015 International Workshop on Directional Dark Matter Detection to be held on June 2-4, 2015 at Occidental College, Los Angeles, CA. This is the 5th in the series of workshops that have allowed a growing community of directional dark matter researchers to meet, exchange ideas, set priorities for the field, discuss international scale-up possibilities and, generally, encourage growth of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, this award has a particular focus on graduate students. It will allow 10 to 20 graduate students to attend this workshop. This will be an exciting and engaging activity and attending it will broaden the perspectives of this group of students as they interact directly with the more experienced scientists who are attending.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The discovery of the nature of dark matter is one of the most important scientific targets of the 21st century.  As such it has attracted hundreds of scientists worldwide to the hunt.  Unfortunately the signal for dark matter is weak and the backgrounds numerous.  A small community of ~50 researchers worldwide is pursuing a directional signal from dark matter recoils that would allow an unambiguous detection of dark matter even in the presence of background signals. In 2009 this community of directional dark matter hunters gathered in Boulby England to share knowledge and begin a discussion about working cooperatively for the first CYGNUS conference.  This was followed by CYGNUS conferences in Boston USA (2009), Aussois France (2011) and Toyama Japan (2013).  With support from Occidental College and the NSF the 2015 CYGNUS conference was held in Los Angeles. Over 3 days (June 2-4) 42 scientists from all over the world gathered in Occidental's newly refurbished Choi Auditorium and listened to 32 talks on all aspects of directional detection.  About half of those attending were students and were given monetary help to attend via this NSF grant.  Many could not have attended otherwise. One evening there was a conference dinner at the college's new Samuelson Alumni House.  Another evening there was a memorable trip to the  Mount Wilson observatory.  Participants were able to view the heavens through the historic 60" and 100" telescopes. The next CYGNUS conference is slated for 2017 in Honolulu Hawaii.
