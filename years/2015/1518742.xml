<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Vilenkin at Tufts University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of cosmic inflation, which was proposed as a speculative hypothesis 35 years ago, has by now accumulated substantial observational support and has become the leading cosmological paradigm.  This theory has also led to a major change in our global view of the universe.  According to the new worldview, much of the volume in the universe is in the state of explosive inflationary expansion. We live in a "bubble" where inflation has ended, but it will never end in the entire universe. The total volume of inflating regions continues to grow, and other bubbles with diverse properties are constantly being formed.  The major goal of the proposed research is to learn how this "multiverse" scenario can be tested observationally and to investigate its implications for the beginning of the universe. The multiverse worldview has far-reaching implications beyond physics. It provides a dramatically new perspective on the global structure of the universe and on our place in it.  Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:  the understanding of the properties of the universe.  Professor Vilenkin will also involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field.  He will continue his efforts to communicate the ideas of modern cosmology to the general public, in the form of public lectures, popular articles, and interviews for radio and TV.  He will also write a textbook, emphasizing the new worldview, based on his undergraduate cosmology course, which is aimed at students with no preparation in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, Professor Vilenkin will investigate the possibility of a direct test of the multiverse scenario by observing collisions of our bubble with other bubbles, or with topological defects that could nucleate in the inflating background.  Possible observational effects of such collisions will be studied using both analytic and numerical methods.  A complementary approach is to analyze the statistical properties of the multiverse and use them to derive predictions for the observed values of the constants of Nature in our bubble.  This approach will be pursued, with the main focus on the statistics of different states in the multiverse and of the transition rates between them.  The general problem of making predictions in the multiverse, known as the measure problem, will also be addressed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The theory of inflation, which has been the major cosmological paradigm over the last three decades, has led to a major change in our global view of the universe. According to the new worldview, much of the volume in the universe is in the state of explosive inflationary expansion. We live in a "bubble" where inflation has ended, and other bubbles with diverse properties are constantly being formed. String theory and other particle physics models that involve extra space dimensions suggests that the number of different types of bubbles is extremely large, so multiverse dynamics requires a statistical description. Our group has developed powerful analytic and numerical methods for studying multiverse statistics and applied them to derive probability distributions for the spatial curvature, the amplitude of density perturbations, and other observational parameters.  The results are in a good agreement with astronomical observations.  An interesting prediction of the multiverse scenario is the formation of black holes in the very early universe.  Bubbles that form in our region during inflation later collapse to black holes when inflation ends.  We calculated the resulting mass distribution of black holes and found that it covers a very wide range of masses. These black holes may account for supermassive black holes observed in galactic centers and for black hole mergers currently detected by the LIGO observatory. We found also that black holes formed in this way are very unusual: they contain inflating universes inside, which are connected to the exterior region by "wormholes".  A discovery of a black hole  distribution with the predicted mass spectum would provide evidence for  inflation and for the existence of a multiverse.  Another major topic of the reported research is an investigation of cosmic strings -- thin threads of energy that could be formed in the early universe.  We studied the bursts of particles predicted to be emitted from strings and found that the particles form high-temperature fireballs.  With plausible assumptions about the string parameters and  about intergalactic magnetic fields, the fireballs can generate  observable fluxes of high-energy photons and neutrinos with unique  signatures.  The theory of inflation has expanded the scope of inquiry in cosmology, providing a quantitative framework to analyze the initial conditions at the big bang. The multiverse scenario expands it even further, as it describes the structure of the universe beyond our cosmic horizon. Successful observational tests of this scenario would greatly broaden the bounds of our knowledge. A detection of cosmic strings would also be of great importance, as it would open a unique window into the physics of very high energies, inaccessible in particle accelerators.
