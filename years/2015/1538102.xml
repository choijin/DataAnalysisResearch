<AbstractNarration>Stochastic networks are a general class of time-varying probabilistic models where there is competition for limited resources.  They are used in a wide range of engineering applications such as communication networks, call centers, and manufacturing systems. Operators of these types of systems are often interested in achieving a high level of performance over the long run, i.e., in steady state. Thus, it is important to device efficient computational methods for steady-state analysis of stochastic networks.  Simulation is one of the most commonly used methods for estimating steady-state performance but straightforward application results in an initial-transient bias. This award provides a comprehensive set of tools that will enable exact (i.e. with no initial-transient bias) steady-state stochastic simulation of a wide range of complex stochastic networks of interest. This characteristic (complete bias deletion) is what defines a perfect simulation algorithm. This research will therefore enable accurate steady-state analysis in a wide range of areas of societal impact, thereby allowing operators to improve efficiency and performance. Because steady-state analysis arises in a wide variety of areas, including Bayesian Statistics, the award will also be impactful beyond the types of applications mentioned earlier. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steady-state performance analysis of stochastic networks (including general queueing networks) is of great importance in operations research. Stochastic simulation has been a traditional tool used by modelers and researchers to perform steady-state computations. The key challenge in steady-state simulation is the quantification of the bias caused by the initial transient behavior associated to any direct stochastic simulation procedure. This award's focus is on algorithms that fully eliminate the initial transient bias in a non-asymptotic sense; these are known as perfect simulation algorithms. This research will produce the first class of perfect simulation algorithms for general stochastic networks with features such as non-Markovian input, time-inhomogeneous (periodic) characteristics, long-range dependence traffic (e.g. fractional Brownian motion), and multidimensional networks with and without capacity constraints (such as generalized Jackson networks).  This research combines techniques from areas such as rare-event simulation and steady-state simulation, which have not been connected for the purpose of developing computational methods. The project has important implications for other scientific areas of great relevance, such as Bayesian Statistics, due to the connection between steady-state simulation through Markov chain Monte Carlo method.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project aims to the investigation of general principles for the generation of exact (i.e. unbiased) and efficient steady-state simulation algorithms for queueing network models. Queueing models are among the most widely used techniques in performance analysis of manufacturing, service-sector and computer systems. In particular, the steady-state of the queueing models connects to the long-term performance of the system. As the steady-state of complex queueing networks usually has no explicit solution, stochastic simulation has been a traditional tool for numerical computation of the steady state. The first goal of the project is to expand   substantially the types of models that have   been studied in the context of exact   simulation. Most of existing exact simulation   algorithms concern systems with Markovian   characteristics or bounded capacity constraints.   In this project, we have developed exact   simulation algorithms for non-Markovian and   time-dependent queueing networks with   unlimited capacity, which are more close to   real-world systems such as in manufacturing   or healthcare. The key theoretic challenge in steady-state   simulation is the quantification of the bias   caused by the initial transient behavior   associated to any direct stochastic simulation   procedure. In this project, we have investigated   this bias for the so-called reflected Brownian  motion (RBM), which approximates a large   class of queueing networks, and provided a   bound on the bias. To address the application   of queueing network models for large systems,   we also analyzed the behavior of the bound as   the number of nodes in the network grows. In summary, we have developed exact and   efficient steady-state simulation algorithms   for a variety of queue network models that   are not studied in existing literature. The   algorithms can be used by practitioners in   the design and performance analysis of   manufacturing, service-sector and computer   systems. Besides, our theoretic analysis on   the quantification of the bias caused by the   initial transient behavior provides the   researchers a set of mathematical tools   used in the design and efficiency analysis   of steady-state simulation algorithms.
