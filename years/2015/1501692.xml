<AbstractNarration>From discovering pharmaceutical agents to combat health disorders, to developing vaccines to prevent diseases, to increasing yields of food production and more, the life sciences enterprise impacts each of our lives daily. Through advances in science and technology and educational ventures to produce well-qualified professionals who utilize those advances effectively, the life sciences industries contribute significantly to the strength of the United States economy and to the health of its citizenry. The bi-state region of Kansas and Missouri, with the Kansas City metropolitan area serving as a hub, is experiencing robust growth in the life sciences industries, as a reported 21% increase in employment occurred across the 240 life science companies in the region from 2009 to 2012. In response to workforce needs and the continual innovations in science and technology, Kansas City Kansas Community College (KCKCC) will develop the Kansas City Kansas Biomanufacturing Training Laboratory (KCKBTL). The KCKBTL will provide educational opportunities that lead to employment in the local life sciences workforce to residents of communities served by the college. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The KCKBTL will establish educational pathways that lead from high schools through institutions of higher education and ultimately into professional careers in the life sciences. Educational partners in this collaborative endeavor include KCKCC, the Kansas City Kansas Public Schools and the University of Kansas Medical Center.  Project goals include: (1) working closely with representatives from the life sciences workforce to define and develop sequences of industry-validated courses that lead to a Certificate in Biomanufacturing or an Associate Degree in Bioscience to prepare KCKCC students for multiple entry points into careers in the local industry and (2) providing professional development opportunities for high school science teachers and community college faculty members in topical areas that facilitate technician education in the life sciences. KCKCC students will be placed into internships at local companies and in academic research laboratories at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Methods to evaluate project success and its impact include stakeholder interviews and focus groups, along with collecting data that monitors student success in the technician education programs and employment statistics for program graduates.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Kansas City Kansas Biomanufacturing Training Laboratory (KCKBTL): Developing the Bioscience/Biotechnology Workforce for the Kanas City Region program successfully developed a rigorous, industry-validated and Kansas Board of Regents-accepted 16-credit biomanufacturing/bioscience certificate curriculum at to prepare community college and high school students for entry-level biomanufacturing and bioscience positions. A strength of the program was the use of industry partnerships to clarify and delineate requisite skills. Credit transfer agreements were made with Johnson County Community College (JCCC) and the University of Kansas (KU), however formal articulation agreements were not completed and the A.S. degree in Bioscience was not approved by the Kansas Regents.</p> <p>While delayed, the project effectively equipped an industry-specific biomanufacturing/ bioscience-teaching laboratory to meet the needs of Kansas City Kansas Community College (KCKCC), Kansas City Kansas Public Schools (KCKPS), and regional students. The centralized location of the lab at KCKPS rather than KCKCC, as planned, allowed access to industry-identified course content and laboratory training readily accessible to co-enrolled high school/KCKCC students. As a result of the training, students were equipped with the requisite knowledge and skills and participated in research internships at a regional research institution.</p> <p>The program successfully provided professional development in biomanufacturing/bioscience skills and content not otherwise readily available to local educators and college faculty.

Recommendations for future research include using a nine-month follow-up survey for workshop participants to determine changes in instruction that are made during the academic year, and tracking certificate earners over time for education and employment outcomes.</p> <p>The Primary Investigator (PI) successfully navigated barriers at multiple systems levels including construction delays, a change in Primary Investigator, and multiple leadership changes at KCKCC and KCKPS. The no-cost extension year was capitalized on to bring several program components to fruition including the purchase of equipment, a boost in enrollment, and a more structured approach to teacher/faculty training. The PI continues to be forward-looking and is poised beyond the scope of the current project to contribute to regional efforts to leverage program success and impact. This is particularly true for nascent plans to participate in local efforts to develop standardized skills and course expectations outside of formalized articulation agreements and to make course
