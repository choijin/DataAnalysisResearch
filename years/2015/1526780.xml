<AbstractNarration>The tremendous expansion of wireless communications has improved the quality of life, provided economical growth, and assisted the expansion of new businesses. At the same time, the new opportunities have created a huge demand for higher transmission data rates and a need for designing more efficient wireless communication networks. Understanding how to deal with timing mismatch and imperfect channel information in communication networks is essential for designing the wireless networks of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, interference management techniques have provided enormous improvements in reliability and bandwidth utilization. These improvements are achieved under ideal assumptions such as perfect channel knowledge and perfect synchronization. In this project, the PIs will revisit the availability of perfect channel information and more importantly the assumption of perfect synchronization in multi-user wireless networks. This project analyzes the effects of timing mismatch on the performance of multi-user wireless networks, from the viewpoint of sampling diversity, with the aim to explore its benefits in the presence of timing mismatch. This will lead to a theoretical derivation of optimal timing mismatch values and the corresponding optimal timing delays, followed by the practical design of communication systems that benefit from timing mismatch and approach the theoretical performance bounds, under a comprehensive set of channel models.</AbstractNarration>

To increase the efficiency of wireless networks, the concurrent transmission of different users is unavoidable.

Even if we have perfect control over the timing at different transmitters, which needs a lot of feedback and coordination, we can only synchronize them perfectly at one receiver. In a concurrent transmission from different transmitters to different receivers, naturally the other receivers will experience timing mismatch among the received signals.We designed algorithms to improve the throughput and reliability of wireless networks with timing mismatch.  Specific technical accomplishments can be summarized as:  1) We investigated the inherent time delays between different users in a multiuser scenario and used it to cancel interference more efficiently.  2) We proposed sampling methods that provide sampling diversity and analyzed the effects of sampling diversity on the system performance in the presence of timing mismatch.  3) We designed communication systems that benefit from timing mismatch in a multi-user network suffering from interference. We studied both cases that the receiver knows the timing delays and the receiver does not know the timing delays.  4) We proposed adding "intentional" delays to different signals in multiuser systems and an overlay cognitive radio network to improve the performance.  5) We studied the impact of timing errors on the performance of asynchronous multiuser systems.
