<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research project addresses two critical national challenges: (1) cost reduction in healthcare. and (2) sustainable transportation.  Both of these problems are addressed by leveraging the common modeling framework of waiting lines or queues that are sensitive to time of day, day of week, seasonal, or annual effects. In the healthcare domain, a solution to the nursing home bed planning problem can be developed. This is an important issue due to the aging baby boomer demographic.  Also hospital bed cleaning costs can be lowered by finding the most effective time to have cleaning staff available. Drivers looking for parking generate a large amount of pollution and congestion. Methods, motivated by sustainable transportation and enabled by large data sets, to reduce the amount of pollution and congestion caused by parking can be developed. This research also includes the training of graduate students and the inclusion of underrepresented minorities. The Conference for African American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences (CAARMS) came into existence in 1995 to nurture and promote African American researchers in the mathematical sciences.  Both PIs have given lectures and tutorials at CAARMS to share with the community of African-American mathematicians and aspiring students some of their latest research work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops dynamic performance models and dynamic optimization solution techniques based on a rich class of time dependent stochastic network models called Markovian service networks. This modeling and optimization framework captures the stochastic dynamics of the system that cannot be found in the static, long term, steady state behavior. Using this framework, solutions to critical challenges in both healthcare and sustainable transportation can be developed. These solutions address problems such as emergency room cost stabilization to handle the payments from the costs of unforeseen medical emergencies. The aging baby boomer demographic is the impetus for this work on nursing home bed planning. Hospital bed cleaning costs can be minimized by finding the most effective time to have cleaning staff available. On the average, 30 percent of the drivers in central business districts are searching for a parking space. This leads to a dramatic increase in air pollution and congestion. Using a big data set from a large scale parking pricing experiment, parking prices can be set to minimize pollution. This queueing analysis can also be used for a dynamic priority policy for electric car charging stations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The supported work developed dynamic performance models and dynamic optimization solution techniques based on a rich class of time dependent stochastic network models called Markovian service networks. Using this framework, we proposed solutions to critical challenges in both healthcare and sustainable transportation.  We applied this framework to the modeling and empricial analysis of road congestion and pollution caused by the search for parking.  Our most significant results were to develop a systematic modeling and estimation method to estimate the amount of road traffic congestion due to driver's looking for parking spaces.The research takes advantage of a GPS based household travel survey, an extensive dataset of GPS with video, and a commercially purchased set of trip segments.   Our results suggest that cruising in San Francisco, CA and Ann Arbor, Michigan is acute in some locations but overall experienced in less than 5-6% of vehicle trips, and that it accounts for less than 1% of vehicle travel in these cities&ndash;considerably less than in previous estimates.   These results have had impact on how researchers and policy makers estimate road congestion and pollution caused by searching for parking. This is important due to the air quality, health and quality of life implications related to excess traffic congestion.
