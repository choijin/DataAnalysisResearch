<AbstractNarration>Tufts University will explore the feasibility of engineering instruments for audio composition to broaden participation in computing and engineering design. The Tufts project staff, in collaboration with Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink at Goldsmiths College, University of London, will investigate how participation in the development and use of a programmable instrument construction toolkit for audio composition and accompanying pedagogy can increase interest, engagement, and learning by underrepresented youth females, African-Americans, and Latinos in computing and physical engineering. The team will develop and evaluate physical and virtual kits that enable teens to design and build their own physical input devices, then to program electronic synthesizers that translate manipulations of those devices into audio compositions. WeJam uses design-based research, incorporating methods from participatory design and the learning sciences, to investigate how to refine these tools and the pedagogical activities that draw upon them in order to maximize interest, enjoyment, and learning by the target populations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The University of Colorado Boulder and Tufts University investigated the feasibility of designing, composing, building, programming, and performing with tangible, networked, multi-user computer music systems to support students learning about computer science, and to develop positive, stereotype defying identities and interests in computing. The research team developed a prototype programming environment called BlockyTalky WeJam and partnered with public middle school teachers to co-develop computer science and computer music curriculum. Classroom and summer camp based studies enabled investigation into the affordances of the project approach for student learning. <br /><strong>Intellectual Merits</strong><br />The research team facilitated four computer music workshops for middle school students. Two of these were conducted in partnership with community-based organizations offering summer programs for young people from populations that are under-represented in computing (African Americans and girls); the other two were conducted within middle school classrooms during the academic year. The BlockyTalky WeJam software evolved over three iterations, with modifications guided by research findings from within these workshops and in workshop co-planning with teachers. Analysis of qualitative and quantitative data from these workshops-cum-studies showed how constructing networked computer music technologies for performance enabled students to learn authentic contemporary computer science and computer music practices, to collaborate with one-another in novel ways, to apply their culturally-situated, and often embodied, musical knowledge within computing education, and to develop positive beliefs about computer science and who can be successful within it.<br /><strong>Broader Impacts</strong><br />Approximately eighty youth participated in project research studies, which each spanned multiple weeks. Four teachers participated. In addition, hundreds of youth and their parents participated in project outreach events (e.g. CS Education Week and lab open houses). Approximately thirty adult artists, mostly women, participated in a two-day creative arts and technology workshop using the project&rsquo;s software, suggesting ways that future work might broaden participation in computing by adults. Eight undergraduates and five graduate students assisted in these research and outreach activities. <br />This project has generated five peer-reviewed academic publications in learning sciences, computer science, computer science education research, and computer music research venues. Two additional publications are under review, and another is in preparation. <br />All project software tools are freely available via GitHub.com, and draft curriculum materials are available upon request.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/15/2017<br>      Modified by: R.
