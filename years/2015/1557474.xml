<AbstractNarration>Direct electrical connections between neurons are widespread throughout the mammalian brain, but their contribution to brain function is poorly understood. Similar to other types of connections or so-called synapses between neurons, electrical synapses are known to undergo changes in strength.  However, the specific conditions that result in plasticity or changes in strength of electrical synapses are unknown. This project investigates the specific neuronal activity rules and underlying mechanisms whereby these synapses are modified by ongoing brain activity.  Further, this project aims to advance our understanding of how these activity-dependent modifications of electrical synapse strength impact brain function, in particular that processing of sensory information via the thalamus to the cortex. The findings will yield important new insights into the function of electrical synapses and their plasticity across the brain, and how the brain gates cortical attention to the sensory environment surrounding the organism.  The project involves a combination of brain research, undergraduate and graduate training in neuroscience concepts and research techniques, and educational development through special institutional programs aimed at disadvantaged children and youth, with a goal of public education and broadening participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM disciplines) by traditionally underrepresented students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Learning rules and mechanisms for long-term synaptic modification have been described extensively for neurotransmitter-based synapses. However, strikingly little is yet known about activity-dependent plasticity of electrical synapses, also known as gap junctions. Because electrical synapses are widespread but their importance in mammalian brain function, it is critical that we advance our understanding of whether and how these types of essential synapses are regulated in a use-dependent manner.  The central hypothesis of this project is that the strength of electrical synapses in the thalamic reticular nucleus, the major inhibitory regulator of cortico-thalamic communication, is continuously updated by activity in electrically coupled neurons; in turn, this plasticity alters the synchrony within and the inhibitory output of the thalamic reticular nucleus. To test this hypothesis, the control and the impact of electrical synaptic plasticity is investigated using in vitro electrophysiology and optogenetic techniques. Aim 1 examines the mechanisms that underlie plasticity of electrical synapses, with the goal of elucidating and developing predictions about the relationship between activity and synaptic strength. Aim 2 measures the impact of electrical synaptic plasticity on synchrony within networks of coupled thalamic neurons, and thereby offers new insight into the inhibition that coupled interneurons deliver to their downstream targets. Aim 3 tests the functional role of electrical synapse plasticity in brain rhythms and network plasticity.  Together, the studies will lead to novel understanding of how electrical synapses contribute to brain function.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Activity-dependent changes in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons are vital for nervous system development and for continuously refining the brain's networked representations of the sensory environment throughout life. Learning rules and mechanisms for long-term synaptic modification have been extensively described for neurotransmitter-based synapses. However, strikingly little is known about activity-dependent plasticity of electrical synapses, also known as gap junctions. Because electrical synapses are both widespread and underappreciated for their power throughout the mammalian brain, it is critical to understand whether and how they are regulated in a use-dependent manner.  The overall goal of the project was to examine the mechanisms underlying plasticity of electrical synapses, aiming to better understand and predict the relationship between activity and synaptic strength. Beyond understanding the conditions and mechanisms of plasticity, we aimed to measure the impact of electrical synaptic plasticity on synchrony within networks of coupled neurons, and thereby on the inhibition that coupled interneurons deliver to their downstream targets.  We aimed at these goals using interwoven experimental and computational approaches.  We recorded electrical synapse strength by performing dual whole-cell patch recordings of coupled neurons, and tested the effects of various pharmacological and activity perturbations on synapse strength.  We assembled detailed computational models of neurons connected by electrical synapses, and examined the impacts on neuron-pair and neural network behavior under varied activity conditions and sets of synapse strength.  From these experiments, we determined that calcium entry, both through low-voltage activated T-type and high-voltage activated channels, is a crucial regulator of activity-dependent depression of electrical synapses.  We further identified a different activity pattern that potentiates electrical synapses, and that potentiation also depends on calcium influx.  Both forms of plasticity alter electrical synapses in a synapse-specific manner:  when activity is asymmetrical (ie only one neuron is activated in order to induce plasticity), change in synapse strength is also asymmetrical.  We explored the roles of neuromodulation.  We found that depression induced by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors acts on the same endpoints as activity-induced depression, while through different intermediate mechanisms.  As a result, the two forms of depression occlude each other.  We also found that activation of metabotropic GABA receptors gates plasticity, in a complex effect that depends on dose.  To explore the functional impact of electrical synapse plasticity, we embedded electrical synapses into pairs and networks of neurons.  Using these models, we determined specific functions for electrical synapses both in the thalamocortical circuit and in canonical cortical circuitry.  Electrical synapses between thalamic reticular neurons control thalamocortical relay:  inputs can either be merged as representing the same input, by thalamus, or further separated in time and thereby distinguished as distinct inputs as they are relayed to cortex.  We also showed that modulation from amygdala can activate the TRN circuitry in order to impose a pre-stimulus silence, and thereby enhance thalamocortical transmission, for relevant sensory inputs.  In a canonical cortical circuit of feedforward inhibition, we demonstrated that electrical synapses between inhibitory neurons control both subthreshold summation and spike timing in principal cells, in an effect that is likely recapitulated all across the cortex.  Beyond the intellectual merit of identifying the mechanisms and functions of electrical synapse plasticity, support for this project had the broader impact of addressing goals of education and awareness in underserved populations. Our laboratory work engaged undergraduate students who were each trained in the scientific method (experimental design, electrophysiological recordings, data analysis, manuscript and poster assembly).  Undergraduates also participated in lab activities, including journal clubs and Outreach activity.  Undergraduates were exposed to career opportunities through presenting their work at the Society for Neuroscience conferences.  In addition, PhD students engaged in the work made progress toward their degrees and also actively participated in our Outreach activities.  The lab as a whole made a series of visits to the A.P. Biology class at the Milton Hershey School in Hershey, PA. In initial visits, we each explained our individual roles and projects in the lab.  We played "brain games" together.  We asked students to perform a set of writing exercises with their non-dominant hand, then use that hand to perform activities of daily living until we met again.  In later visits, we retested the writing exercises.  This experience demonstrated the idea of plasticity to the students.   Some of the Milton Hershey students have matriculated to our institution.        Last Modified: 06/18/2021       Submitted by: Julie Haas]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
