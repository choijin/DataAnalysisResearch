<AbstractNarration>The PI's research is in number theory and representation theory; its goal, broadly, is to understand the Galois representations associated (sometimes conjecturally) to automorphic forms and automorphic representations.  The PI will undertake several projects related to the conjectures of Serre, Fontaine-Mazur, and Breuil-Mezard (and their generalizations) as well as to the emerging p-adic and mod p Langlands correspondences.  The PI will study the weight part of Serre's conjecture for reductive groups over number fields, with the goal of giving an explicit Serre weight recipe in considerable generality. The investigator will produce evidence for generalizations of the Breuil-Mezard conjecture, and will prove some cases of such a generalization, with applications to the Langlands program.  Another component of the project involves the explicit reduction modulo p of certain p-adic Galois representations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics.  At its most fundamental, number theory is the study of whole number solutions to equations, although sophisticated modern techniques can sometimes give the appearance of being far-removed from this goal.  Number theory has many important practical applications; for instance, most cellular telephone calls are protected by a code based on elliptic curves, one of the primary objects of study in the investigator's field.  In addition to these broader impacts, this award will support several educational initiatives, including a transition program for minority calculus students at the University of Arizona, the development of an undergraduate problem-solving curriculum, and the recruitment of underrepresented minority students to high school mathematics summer programs.  The PI is one of the directors of Canada/USA Mathcamp, a summer program for mathematically talented high school students.</AbstractNarration>

During the course of this award the PI made several major contributions to the study of the p-adic Langlands correspondence, most notably:  The proof of the weight part of Serre's conjecture for rank two unitary groups (joint with Toby Gee and Tong Liu); in combination with work of Gee-Kisin these results also imply the weight part of Serre's conjecture for GL(2). The formulation of a very general version of the weight part of Serre's conjecture, for higher-rank groups and over general number fields (joint with Toby Gee and Florian Herzig). The proof of Breuil's local-global compatibility conjecture for types in the p-adic Langlands program (joint with Matt Emerton and Toby Gee).   During the course of this award the PI also made several important contributions to the development of human resources. The PI founded a stipend program for economically disadvantaged high school students to attend summer mathematics programs.

The PI moreover supported a transition-to-calculus program for incoming minority students at the University of Arizona, and was the PhD supervisor for five graduate students (three of whom have completed their PhDs; the other two are on track).
