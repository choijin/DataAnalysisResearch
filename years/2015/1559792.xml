<AbstractNarration>Active and diverse microorganism communities are essential for soil; and hence for agriculture, food security, and ecosystem health.  Changes in these communities can significantly influence soil quality, health, and productivity.  This research uses experimental and statistical/modeling approaches to investigate and predict the impact of common metal nanoparticles (iron, copper, and silver), which are reported to have anti-microbial properties, on soil microbial communities.  The main research goal is to develop models that can help assess the ecotoxicity of common metal nanoparticles without having to resort to carrying out large numbers of experiments for each sample to be tested.  This work accomplishes that goal with a combined experimental/modeling approach.  Experiments involving the study of the toxicity of ten important soil parameters (pH, temperature, nanoparticle concentration, organic carbon content, soil moisture, and the concentration of various cations and anions like Na, Ca, Mg, nitrates, and phosphates) on the interaction between selected commercially purchased nanoparticles and two model soils, each with their unique microbial community, will be carried out in microcosms.  The toxicity of the nanoparticles to microbial communities will be evaluated using three different indicators of microbial health and metabolic activity: PCR-DGGE, Biolog Ecoplates, and total soil FAME analyses from which a single ecotoxicity value can be determined.  Results of the experimental matrix will be used to develop a linear regression model that will identify environmental parameters that increase, decrease, or have no influence on toxicity on the soil microbes.  A quadratic regression will be developed that build off the results of the linear model to predict the toxic potential of each parameter and identify and assess interactions among the various environmental parameters.  Broader impacts of the research include the strong integration of research and education, engaging large numbers of undergraduate students in environmental biology research, and using the research to augment undergraduate course curriculum.  Through a summer research experience, the project will also engage students from Southern University, a historically black college that is still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Katrina.  Participation of under-represented groups in the sciences will also be increased by recruiting students from the Dowling College Center for Minority Teacher Development and Training Program to participate in the research.  Free public lectures tailored for the general public to increase their awareness of their impacts on the environment will also be presented.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through the funded project, we were able to study the impact of Cu, ZnO, and Ag Nanoparticles (NPs) on microbes present in soil of various types, and how these NPs transform as a function of  time under different conditions.  Major results of the project are highlighted below.  1. NPs do not completely dissolve in soil under the conditions tested, even after prolonged incubation period.  2.  NPs impact soil microbes directly and through their transformation products.  3.  Soil type and chemistry strongly influences the fate and transport of NPs.  4.  Organisms involved in nitrogen cycle (particularly nitrogen  fixation) and bioremediation are highly susceptible to engineered NPs.  5.  It would not be possible, at this stage of our understanding, to identify any NPs as inert for negative control experiments.  6. Hands-on scientific training to elementary school students is  highly cost effective and has stronger impact on increasing their  interest for science and engineering disciplines.  The work resulted in 11 peer reviewed publications.   The project provided training and professional development opportunities  to undergraduate students (to work hands-on) on all stages of  experiment - literature search, design of experiments, conducting  experiments, data analysis, manusript preparation and, public  presentation of data.   Students from Southern University of New Orleans  also participated in research and performed experiments, analyzed data  and presented their work in vairous conferences.  High school students  were also involved in various stages of research.         Last Modified: 11/29/2016       Submitted by: Vishal Shah]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
