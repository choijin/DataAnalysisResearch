<AbstractNarration>Arctic terrestrial ecosystems exchange greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane), water vapor, and energy with the atmosphere.  The balance between uptake and release of these quantities influences both the Arctic region and the global climate system.  The terrestrial cycling of carbon, water, and energy are strongly linked, and therefore need to be studied at the same time and in the same place. This project continues long-term measurements of carbon, water, and energy balance in terrestrial and freshwater systems in the Alaskan Arctic, extending measurements that began in 2007.  Carbon loss over the winter has recently increased dramatically at one of our study sites, as winter air and soil temperatures have warmed. This study will determine whether these losses continue and seek to understand the underlying causes. Broader impacts of this project include contributions to teaching and learning, including underrepresented groups, support of undergraduate summer research, participation in the Marine Biology Laboratory Logan Science Journalism program and the Arctic LTER Schoolyard program, and outreach to K-12 schools in Fairbanks, Alaska, and to Native Alaskan communities. This project will support career development of two female Principal Investigators at UAF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will extend continuous measurements of carbon, water, and energy balance in three tundra ecosystems near Imnavait Creek, Alaska. Ecosystem/atmosphere flux measurements have been collected at these sites via eddy covariance since 2007. Long-term monitoring of hydrology and stream chemistry of Imnavait Creek and depth of thaw in its catchment area will be maintained. Additional measurements to help interpret these data will include water table depth, plant community composition, and vegetation greenness via reflectivity, which is related to leaf area and biomass. Long-term measurements of stream chemistry and discharge are also available at Imnavait, enabling a comprehensive assessment of carbon budgets.  All data will be made publicly available and archived at the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) web site, the International Arctic Research Center Data Archive, and the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
