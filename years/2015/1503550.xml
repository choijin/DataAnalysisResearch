<AbstractNarration>Natural gas is an important source of energy in the United States. However, some of the U.S. natural gas reserves are contaminated with nitrogen gas to the extent that it is necessary to remove the contaminant before it is used. Under the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Gohdes at Pacific University and Dr. Tyler at the University of Oregon combine molecular chemistry synergistically with polymer science to design and synthesize novel metal-templated polymers (MTPs) that will be useful as long-lived absorbents for the purification of natural gas. The fundamental knowledge gained from this project has broader scientific implications in other important areas such as catalysis and sensor design. Undergraduate and graduate students working on this project receive training in experimental design and a broad array of synthetic and analytical techniques. This project prepares students to become future leaders of innovation in STEM. This project also has extensive impact in the training of STEM educators through exciting vehicles such as a summer workshop on Informal Science Education (ISE) where students interested in science education learn techniques for effectively communicating with the public in venues such as science museums. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior work in the Tyler lab at the UO showed that water-soluble trans-Fe(P2)2(X)(Cl)-type complexes (X = Cl, H; P2 = a water-soluble bidentate phosphine) can successfully bind nitrogen gas reversibly under conditions suitable for a pressure-swing separation process. In this project, Dr. Gohdes and Dr. Tyler aim to enhance the stability of the nitrogen binding Fe(II) complexes by encapsulating them in a polymer matrix, forming MTPs around the nitrogen binding motif. Another approach to enhance stability of the nitrogen binding complexes is by replacing the bidentate phosphines with macrocyclic, tetradentate phosphines. These groups collaboratively perform research to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of the nitrogen-binding reactions of the iron complexes and MTPs. A fundamental understanding of how the properties of the polymer affect the intrinsic reactivity of the metal center is important for the design and optimization of the next generation nitrogen-absorbing materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In a collaborative effort between the Tyler research group at the University of Oregon and the Gohdes group at Pacific University, this project investigated a proposed new way to purify natural gas.  We need to find a way to purify natural gas because almost 15% of worldwide natural gas reserves are contaminated with high levels of nitrogen (N2).  The nitrogen "dilutes" the natural gas, lowering the energy density and limiting the gas?s use as a fuel.  In general, levels less than 4% N2 are required if natural gas is to be used as fuel.  Natural gas is mostly methane, and it is difficult to separate N2 from methane because N2 is chemically unreactive and also because methane and N2 have similar physical properties.  Industrial nitrogen rejection (the process of removing nitrogen from natural gas) could use cryogenic distillation to separate the gases, but this technique is energy-intensive and requires large capital costs, making it economically unfeasible.  Recent efforts have focused on membranes for the separation, but these methods do not work well either.    In earlier work, we showed that certain iron-containing molecules of the type trans-Fe(P2)2X2 (where P2 is an abbreviation for a part of the molecule known as a phosphine and X is chloride or bromide) will bond with N2 at high pressure and release the N2 at low pressure.  In other words, these molecules can act as absorbents for separating N2 from methane in a "pressure-swing" process.  Unfortunately, in prolonged tests of the iron molecules over 6-8 weeks, the phosphine ligands slowly came off the molecule, which decomposed the molecule and prevented it from acting as a commercially viable absorbent.  To achieve a longer lasting absorbent, we decided on two approaches:  1) We would replace the phosphine ligands (P2) with a newer type of phosphine that should bond more strongly to the molecule; and 2) we would incorporate the iron complexes into porous polymers with the expectation that this would help to stabilize the iron complexes and prevent the P2 groups from coming off the molecule, thereby stabilizing the molecule and preventing it from decomposing.    In collaboration with the Gohdes group at Pacific University, we developed a high yield synthesis of the new type of phosphines that bond more strongly to the molecule, and we showed that the new molecules made with these ligands do react with N2.  Unfortunately, with respect to our second goal, we showed that the new iron-containing polymers do not bind significant amounts of N2.  We undertook a rigorous investigation to find out why the polymers do not absorb N2, and we found that there are simply not enough iron molecules near the surface of the polymers to bind significant amounts of N2.  The development of more porous polymers is suggested as a way around this problem, but we did not have time to pursue this avenue of investigation.
