<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Drexel University engages undergraduate students in research focused around the critical and timely engineering challenges on topics related to energy and the environment utilizing the principles of experiential learning. With concerted recruitment of underrepresented minorities, women, and those who do not have access to advanced research facilities at their own educational institutions, this REU Site promises to open new career paths to some of the best and brightest students in the nation who might otherwise miss out on these opportunities.  The REU Site addresses two critical needs faced by the nation: 1) effectively developing human resources in science and engineering, and 2) addressing the scientific challenges on energy and the environment directly benefiting the ability to create a better, more sustainable future.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in energy and environment related research during a 9-week summer program.  The REU will encourage undergraduate students to explore research careers, develop graduate student educational and mentoring expertise, create collaborations on many levels, and inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. The three main objectives of the Site are: 1) Provide experiential learning research opportunities to students and their faculty advisors from institutions that do not typically offer research experiences to undergraduate students, with a particular emphasis on underrepresented minority groups; 2) Encourage participants to explore and pursue graduate education and research careers in cutting edge science and engineering fields; 3) Demonstrate to participants the benefits of experiential learning through synergy of hands-on research projects, active discussion and feedback, reflection of pursuits, and awareness of how their effort fits into the broader scientific and engineering challenges associated with energy and the environment. In addition to active energy and environment research projects all within the A.J. Drexel Institute of Energy and the Environment mentored by faculty from the College of Engineering, students will participate in research seminars, ethics training, writing and communications training, field trips to world class research facilities, educational outreach, and career development activities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The xREU: eXperiential Learning Undergraduate Research Opportunities on Energy and the Environment at Drexel University, lead by Professor Leslie Lamberson,&nbsp;grew from less than forty applicants in its inaugural year, to over 155 applicants in its final third year.&nbsp;The goal of the eight-week program was to engage between ten and fourteen undergraduate students from around the country, with a particular emphasis on recruiting underrepresented and minority students as well as students from institutions that did not have graduate research programs, in the opportunity to explore research and graduate careers, develop educational and mentoring expertise, and inspire the next-generation of scientists and engineers to tackle challenging problems on energy and the environment. &nbsp;As a result, each year our REU team consisted of a 50-50 ratio of genders, and at least 25% minority representation. &nbsp;We also always had at least one student (around 10%) who came from an institution that did not have a graduate research program. The student research experiences revolved around the experiential learning method of ?do-reflect-apply? and each student was paired with a different faculty mentor across the College of Engineering and their research team on projects in cross-disciplinary themes ranging from mechanical engineering, materials science and chemical engineering, to environmental and civil engineering. &nbsp;Some students worked on improving battery chemistry, while others tackled geophysical fluid flows for better ocean dynamics prediction, for example. The REU students were support through travel stipends to help get them to the our site, free housing on campus during the program, and biweekly stipend.&nbsp;Additionally, the xREU provided a complementary&nbsp;<em>Enrichment Program&nbsp;</em>which included biweekly ?reflect? lunch sessions with Dr. Penny Hammrich from Drexel?s School of Education, as well as weekly workshops for all the REU students to gather together which covered a range of important topics such as ?ethics in engineering,? 'effective technical communication,' and ?how to apply to graduate school.? Additionally, optional field trips were provided which included both educational and cultural experiences such as a behind-the-scenes tour of The National Academy of Sciences and the Philadelphia Art Museum, to name a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the program, the REU students presented experiential hands-on demonstrations for middle school students from FirstHand Philly, a nonprofit which aims to spark interest in STEAM disciplines, serving youth from under-resourced schools in Philadelphia. &nbsp;At the end of the program, the REU students expressed a stronger desire to potentially pursue graduate school and/or pursue additional opportunities on energy and the environment challenges, and had the skillset and network to more successfully and impactfully do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;The program culminated in an open research poster presentation presented by each student based on their projects with food and prizes provided, and was always well attended by the Drexel community with anywhere between 50 to 100 people stopping by. &nbsp;
