<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will provide greater visibility into network behavior and help identify problems before they occur in the network. Advances in cloud computing and network virtualization are changing the way networks are designed and monitored. This project will help small and medium businesses adapt to and take advantage of these advances by means of intelligent analysis of network traffic data, resulting in an optimized network and eliminating unnecessary additional capital expenditure. The resulting commercial impact is that the technology will eliminate tedious data analysis currently required of network engineers to isolate fault and performance issues, and help them achieve a more efficient, streamlined design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on delivering a predictive network behavior analysis product that will help small and medium businesses better understand the behavior of their networks. Due to the rapid growth of new network technologies and increasing application complexity, such businesses have to constantly change and upgrade their networks. By not understanding the overall network behavior under various load conditions, they are forced to use ad-hoc methods to design and equip their networks. The objective of this project is to build a prototype that will demonstrate the proposed predictive network behavior analysis capability to potential customers. The prototype will also be used with select partners for beta testing and refining of requirements. The results will be used to further refine this prototype into a commercially viable product that can be deployed in the networks of small and medium businesses.</AbstractNarration>

They also report on every significant and insignificant event, and the task of understanding the network behavior falls on the end user.  The primary goal of this project was to understand level of intelligence provided by network traffic data to derive fault and performance events using machine learning models. The secondary goal was to map the low level deterministic events to a higher level semantic definition thus reducing the cognitive burden on the end user.   Even though machine learning models have been used in academic research to understand network behavior, it doesn?t translate well to the actual network data. We used traffic data obtained from actual customer network. The reason for using the customer network data was two-fold. Unlike the lab and simulated data, customer network data is not optimized, and it provided us with a more realistic view of the network to determine the effectiveness of our models.  As part of this project we developed machine learning models for application specific fault and performance event classification. We also developed a set of semantic definition of events derived from low level deterministic events, which provided a classification heuristic model. These research efforts were then developed into a web application which can be deployed in a customer network to predict network events.  In addition to our research, we provided academic training to a Fulbright scholar who is continuing this research in his home country.
