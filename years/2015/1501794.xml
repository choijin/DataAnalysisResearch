<AbstractNarration>With national spotlights on community colleges, the need for technicians in advance technological fields in STEM, and the significant promise of online education, this research project will identify and synthesize what has been learned through efforts at developing and implementing online courses and course components in technical/technician education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), with a particular emphasis on development and implementation projects supported by the National Science Foundation's Advanced Technological Eduation program (ATE).  The research team will investigate how the implementation and use of online education can or does profoundly change the institutional culture and structure of teaching and learning.  Data collection consists of in-depth semi-structured interviews with faculty and key personal and structured document analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This qualitative research study examines the promise of online education for technicians in advanced technological fields in STEM.  The goal of the research study is to synthesize what has been learned about online technical education in ATE project and make connections to the broader literature about what works and what does not work in online technical education.   The research team will ensure the credibility, dependability, and confirmability of the research findings through an iterative process consisting of triangulation, peer debriefing, and member checking.  Data triangulation involves collecting data with multiple methods.  Peer debriefing involves an outside reviewer examining the data from transcripts of interviews and focus groups and document analyses to ensure that findings and conclusions represent the perceptions/perspectives of the research participants.  Member checking requires that researchers share their findings with research participants to ensure that information was interpreted correctly.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Online education is viewed as a way of expanding education to students who have obligations, such as work or family, that may prevent them from engaging in higher education. Yet, technical education encompasses fields that require specialized tools or laboratories in a hands-on setting. Our goal was to learn how technical education is being delivered online, how that has impacted the college, and make recommendations about what works and what does not work when offering online technical education.  The project achieved several outcomes over the course of the funded project. We investigated 17 ATE-funded projects that focused on online learning in technical education.  Our major findings include:  The majority of programs used a hybrid approach to technical education, with many requiring students to physically attend laboratory portions of classes. The bulk of online learning occurred asynchronously, where students and instructors communicated asynchronously rather than in real-time. Overall, there were positive outcomes in online technical education programs:    Active learning and problem based learning opportunities for students. Improved student access and reduced student costs due to OER materials Simulations on industry based equipment Opportunities for online collaboration.    Training was necessary for both instructors and students to approach technical education in this environment. The projects we investigated were highly reliant on ATE funding and would not have been able to engage in these types of online education without NSF support. The role of partnerships in implementing the online elements was key for the majority of the programs. These partnerships were fostered by the ATE program.   Intellectual Merit: We published several articles and presented at multiple national-level conferences. Our findings are deliberately being shared with both research and practitioner audiences so that the findings will benefit multiple audiences.  Broader Impacts: The findings from our project will assist colleges and universities that wish to implement or expand online education so that more students will have opportunities to earn college credentials and seek employment in these fields. We have derived best practice recommendations for implementation and partnerships to foster this type of education.
