<AbstractNarration>In 2005, Presidential Science Adviser John Marburger catalyzed the development of a new field of research, the Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP).  This project will enhance the benefits of SciSIP research by providing a clearer understanding of the needs of science and innovation policy practitioners.  This project will raise awareness of SciSIP research among practitioners, elicit the needs and priorities of practitioners to focus future research, and explore mechanisms for collaboration between SciSIP researchers and practitioners over the long run.  The research agenda that flows from this project will strengthen science and innovation policy, advancing this field of social science research and improving effective decision-making about the nation?s science and innovation system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project elicits, specifies, and analyzes the needs and priorities of the users of the results of research on the Science of Science and Innovation Policy, such as policy analysts, advisers, and managers who work closely with senior decision-makers in U.S. science, technology, and innovation policy.  By bringing together existing and potential consumers of science policy research, the project seeks to discover how the SciSIP portfolio might be improved.  The project also considers institutional designs and strategies for incorporating user demand into the SciSIP agenda on an ongoing basis.  This conference strengthens collaboration between SciSIP researchers and policy practitioners in research design and development of decision-support tools&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Enhancing the Usefulness of Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) Research  An Agenda-Setting Workshop     Project Outcomes Report for the General Public     Jeffrey Alexander, SRI International  David M. Hart, George Mason  Christopher T. Hill, SRI International and George Mason     This workshop elicited input from practitioners in the field of science and innovation policy about important policy questions that they have faced in their careers that might be addressed by future SciSIP researchers. A second purpose was to learn more about how these professionals learned about the results of academic research relevant to their jobs, and ways by which the SciSIP program could facilitate knowledge transfer from the research community to the practitioner community. It was held on December 7, 2015 at George Mason University and involved about 40 participants from the Federal government and organizations involved in advising Federal and state governments on science and technology policy issues.     The workshop relied primarily on the World Caf&eacute; format to elicit the perspectives of the participants. This format centers on 30-minute, facilitated small group discussions. Each participant joined six of these discussions over the course of the day.  In addition, the group heard keynote remarks from senior officials at the National Science Foundation and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and a perspective from the health policy field from the CEO of Academy Health.     The morning sessions, which aimed at building a practitioner-driven agenda for NSF?s SciSIP research, identified more than thirty specific questions, answers to which would help practitioners in a variety of settings.  In the final report, the thirty questions were grouped under the following ten broad themes that reflect the types of problems and challenges faced by practitioners.       Making R&amp;D Funding Decisions  Managing Agency and Multi-Agency R&amp;D Portfolios  Evaluating Federal R&amp;D Programs  Designing and Implementing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) for R&amp;D  Optimizing the Performance of the Federal Laboratories  Enhancing Regional Contributions of Federal R&amp;D Investments  Tailoring Industrial Innovation Policy to Sectoral Variation in Innovation Processes  Lessening the Burden of Regulation on Academic R&amp;D Performers Enhancing the Contributions of Scientific and Technical   Understanding to Regulatory Policy Making and Implementation Helping Education and Training Institutions Respond More Effectively to Changing STEM Labor Market Needs      The afternoon sessions, which sought to identify mechanisms that would strengthen the contributions of SciSIP research to practice, led to the following strategies for SciSIP research activities (items 1-5) and for SciSIP program management (items 6-10) to consider:      Commission meta-analyses or research syntheses on topics known to be of interest to practitioners and on which a well-established literature exists. Solicit proposals and cluster awards around specific practitioner-identified themes. Support research in order to identify research themes of interest to practitioners.  Create a "SciSIP Fellows" program in which researchers would serve temporarily in Federal agencies.  Establish a pilot version of I-Corps for SciSIP.  Articulate more specifically to proposers that the program will interpret NSF?s "broader impacts" criterion to include the anticipated value of the research results to the community of practice. Create a program advisory board that includes both practitioners and researchers.  Develop stronger relationships with communication intermediaries. Encourage SciSIP staff to intermediate actively between researchers and potential users of their research in the community of practice. Expand the use of practitioners as proposal reviewers.       It is expected that policy makers and analysts will find the workshop results of use as they continue to meet the challenges of optimizing the nation?s investments in science, technology and innovation.
