<AbstractNarration>This award, funded by the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI), promotes the progress of scientific research and supports undergraduate education at Wentworth Institute of Technology (Wentworth). The award enables interdisciplinary teams at Wentworth to conduct externally-collaborative, project-based, interdisciplinary trace metal analysis research projects and to develop new, scientific curriculum for undergraduate students. The projects are interdisciplinary by design and promote a comprehensive approach to trace metals research.  The research projects will enable undergraduates to study important issues such as the effect of trace metals on public health, safety, prosperity and welfare. Examples of topics to be studied include the identification of metals in blood, the transport of metals in soil and groundwater, the stabilization of metals in waste, and metals in alternative fuels. The projects also establish undergraduate science research as a significant and sustainable element in the new campus-wide "Externally-collaborative, Project-based, Interdisciplinary Curriculum for Learning" (EPIC Learning) currently being implemented at Wentworth. This award will also enable Wentworth faculty members to develop an interdisciplinary research model that can be used to promote science research at other undergraduate institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this award, Wentworth will acquire a PerkinElmer PinAAcle 900T graphite furnace/flame atomic absorption spectrometer (the PinAAcle 900T) equipped with a PerkinElmer FIAS 400 Injection Flow System (FIAS 400) (collectively, the "Major Research Instrumentation") in order to identify and measure trace metals. In addition to its use in undergraduate research, the Major Research Instrumentation will also be used in faculty development and in external collaborations with community and private-sector organizations. The expected outcomes of the trace metal analysis projects are consistent with Wentworth's institute-wide learning outcomes that are envisioned under its EPIC Learning Initiative.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A team of faculty, representing a range of different disciplines and interests, worked on this project to develop undergraduate research opportunities through studies of trace metals analysis.  In the process, the team promoted Wentworth Institute of Technology?s new learning initiative, "Externally collaborative, Project-based Interdisciplinary Culture (EPIC) for Learning", an initiative aimed to enhance collaborative work across professional degree disciplines to better prepare graduates for real-world career success.  Research conducted during this project centered around the use of an atomic absorption dual flame/graphite furnace spectrometer, an instrument capable of measuring metals in environmental samples and other materials at the low part per million to part per billion level.  The project succeeded in engaging 39 students and 11 faculty from 7 different disciplines, 14 different projects and 13 external collaborators over the past three years.  Overall project outcomes and individual research project outcomes have been disseminated at regional, national and international professional conferences.  Outreach to promote STEM through presenting research findings and emphasizing the importance of understanding the effects and impacts of metals in the environment and in ordinary materials has been accomplished through demonstrations and presentations to public school K-12 students.  The research performed during the project provided valuable relevant experience to participating students, helped faculty establish sustainable research programs at Wentworth (and serves as a model for future undergraduate research at Wentworth) and enhanced the broader understanding of metals in the environment and other materials to the general community and scientific community.  The powerful analytical capabilities of the atomic absorption spectrometer instrumentation used during the project provided undergraduate students the unique ability to conduct meaningful research to measure trace levels of metals in soil, drinking water, medicines, river water and other media and use this information to identify how low levels of metals may affect environmental quality, public health, land use and other matters of societal importance.  The project has given Wentworth an ability to assess how undergraduate research can be incorporated in its EPIC Learning initiative while providing project-based research opportunities that both encourage external collaboration and provide the means to disseminate results to STEM partners, the general community and the scientific community.    For the project participants and the audience of K-12 students, general community and practicing professionals reached through the dissemination efforts, the research conducted has served to have a broader impact of societal importance: communication and the understanding of sound science is necessary to make informed decisions.  The research conducted used sound scientific principles and practices.  The interdisciplinary nature of the projects helped insure the studies and findings were in proper context.  The engagement of other participants and stakeholders helped communicate the studies and findings meaningfully and effectively.  As a result, the broader impacts of this project include:  1) Participating students understand the value of interdisciplinary teams to define, address and solve complex problems and this experience will enhance their career success;  2) K-12 students that the project has reached through dissemination efforts will both see the relevance and application of science, engineering and other disciplines in the real world and (hopefully) many will be inspired to pursue a STEM career.  3) The general community that the project has reached through dissemination efforts will have a better understanding of the risks of trace metals in the environment and other materials and be better able to make informed decisions about protecting themselves and their community.
