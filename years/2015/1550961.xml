<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to explore how pre-college engineering programs affect those students who enroll into undergraduate engineering degree programs.  The project will use both qualitative and quantitative methods, with the results from the qualitative component used to develop a survey instrument.  This instrument then can be used to understand the impact such programs have at a national scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will help engineering administrators, instructors and designers of undergraduate and pre-college curricula adapt to students' changing needs and abilities. Examining the demographics of the participants will demonstrate who has access to or is taking advantage of pre-college engineering programs, and if the effects of pre-college engineering vary across different demographic groups.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by making investments that lead to emerging new fields of engineering, or shifting existing fields.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This engineering education research project explored how participation in pre-college engineering activities influenced students? transitions into first-year engineering programs. The first part of this project involved interviewing first-year engineering students who participated in various pre-college engineering activities and analyzing these interviews to identify five qualitatively different ways students experienced the transition to their first year of studying undergraduate engineering. These results were then used to create a survey that was distributed to students at two different universities to investigate the prevalence of the qualitative results with a larger sample size.  This project developed a useful framework for understanding how students experience the transition from pre-college to university engineering programs. In order of increasing integration in first-year engineering programs, students? experiences of transition ranged from feeling trapped in engineering, to frustration at the lack of alignment between their pre-college and university engineering experiences, to boredom in university engineering programs, to feeling better prepared for university engineering, to using their pre-college engineering experience to help others in their university engineering classes.  A survey of 413 engineering students at two universities on the nature and extent of their pre-college engineering experiences showed significant variation in the type and quantity of pre-college engineering experiences. High school classes were the most common place where students reported encountering engineering prior to university, with 64% of the respondents indicating exposure to engineering that way. This was followed by extracurricular activities (27%) and middle school classes (17%). Overall, only 11% of the respondents did not participate in any pre-college engineering experiences.[MEC1]   The results of this study indicate that students begin college with a wide variety of pre-college engineering experiences. First-year engineering instructors should consider different approaches to engage the diverse backgrounds and preparation of their students. These strategies might include considering pre-college engineering experience when forming student teams or developing and utilizing pre-assessments to measure students? baseline engineering knowledge as a tool for tailoring instruction. Tailoring instruction is complicated by the findings of this study that students experience the effects of similar pre-college experiences very differently in their first-year engineering courses. For example, while some students may find that being familiar with an engineering design process or technical skills such as programming increases their confidence and ability to learn this material in a first-year engineering course, other students may be disengaged and less motivated when learning material that they feel like they have already been exposed to or mastered.  As engineering continues to be incorporated in K-12 curricula and students? opportunities to do engineering prior to university continue to grow, the results of this study will aid university engineering programs as they adapt to this changing landscape and foster better alignment between pre-college and university engineering programs and experiences.
