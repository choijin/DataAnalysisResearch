<AbstractNarration>Model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, studies general properties of mathematical structures. Work in model theory often answers questions in other areas of mathematics. In the recent years there have been exciting new developments in applications of model theory to combinatorics and analysis.  This project advances research on definable topological groups and their actions, and also on combinatorial questions in the context of distal theories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project builds upon the investigator's previous work on definable group actions and combinatorial properties of theories without independence properties. This project undertakes a systematic study of definable compactifications of group actions, and extremal combinatorics in the not-independence-property (NIP) setting.  More specifically, the project studies extremal combinatorics in distal theories and the Erdos-Hajnal conjecture for graphs definable in NIP theories. The project will also investigate growth rates of Ramsey functions in o-minimal and other tame theories, and will develop a model theoretic framework for compactifications of continuous group actions, in particular Riemannian symmetric spaces.</AbstractNarration>

As a part of this project PI with collaborators continued developin a model theoretic approach to  algebraic and semi-algebraic flows on manifolds. It has a close relations to nilflow and ergocic theory.   Also as a part of this project PI with colloborators used model theoretic tools to generalized  Elekes-Szabo and related  theorems to a very broad class of graphs. In particular, PI with collobarotors proved Elekes-Szabo theorem for semi-algebraic relations, that was an open question.      PI had given a big number of research talks at international conferences and seminars, disseminations his results.        PI has been very active as a mentor to graduate students and postdocs.
