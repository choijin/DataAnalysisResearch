<AbstractNarration>This project aims to answer the question regarding how quickly subsurface microbial communities metabolize and grow. Microbial communities are responsible for the transformation of organic matter that is deeply buried in marine and terrestrial sediments and of organic matter generated at depth by hydrothermal processes and rock/water interactions, such as serpentinization. This organic matter is either converted to carbon dioxide and methane, which often returns to the surface and enters the atmosphere, or into more microbial biomass. Heavily biodegraded petroleum is the residue of these microbial conversions.  Subsurface microbial communities also mediate the concentrations of iron, uranium, arsenic and other toxic metals and organic contaminants in groundwater. They cause diagenetic alteration of mineral phases, such as the transformation of feldspar grains into clay and change the porosity and permeability of aquifers. The rate at which all of this biogeochemical processing occurs far beneath our feet, however, is poorly constrained. This project seeks to develop a new method of more accurately quantifying the in situ rates of subsurface microbial biogeochemical processes by determining the average age the microorganisms themselves. If the microorganisms are growing quickly then the biogeochemical cycling must be equally fast, but if they are very old, then the biogeochemical processes are occurring at very slow rates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past 20 years geochemical models for carbon transformation have been used to deduce in situ metabolic rates and anabolic rates of these communities. Depending upon the assumptions made and measurements used, estimates of these rates vary by three to four orders of magnitude for any site/sample. The investigator and his colleagues recently proposed that the analyses of the right and left-hand configuration (D/L) of aspartic acid (Asp) provides a direct constraint on the anabolic rate of subsurface microorganisms. These results suggest that the protein turnover times for thermophilic microorganisms are less than one year and that the biogeochemical rates required to support this turnover are much greater than previously guessed from geochemical models. With further refinements in measurement protocols and testing, the Asp D/L analyses could provide a far more accurate constraint on the in situ anabolic rate than previous approaches. When this rate is combined with metaproteomic analyses, then constraints can also be placed on the rates of the most abundant metabolic pathways and thus biogeochemical transformations from analysis of a single sample. This estimate is completely independent of geochemical models or isotopic assays that have been used in the past. To realize this goal starvation experiments will be performed over a period of 2 years on spore-forming and non-spore forming thermophiles and hyperthermophiles for which complete genomes currently exist. The rate of racemization of aspartic acid as a function of temperature will then be determined. The principal metabolic pathways will be mapped using proteomics to determine the rate of ATP production and consumption. This will then be compared to the measured rates of respiration as a function of temperature. If the racemization rate and rate of isoaspartate formation represent the major debilitating process, then estimates of the respiration rate derived from the D/L of Asp and the metabolic pathway analysis should coincide with the measured rates. These experiments will also reveal at what point the D/L of aspartic acid is so high that a microorganism truly dies, never to come back to life.</AbstractNarration>

A significant fraction of the deep subsurface biosphere is comprised of thermophilic spore-forming bacteria that sporulate upon deprivation of nutrients. The rates of maintenance processes and spore survivability and how both change with temperature dictate the abundance and composition of subsurface microbial life as a function of depth. The abundance of microbial life in turn impacts the rates of low temperature biogeochemical reactions. One approach to measuring the degree of protein decay in starved cells is by measuring the D/L of their aspartic acid (Asp) versus time comparing it to the Asp racemization rate of dead cells. Asp racemization rates are the highest of the amino acids utilized in proteins. L-Asp forms a significant fraction of the protein composition and replacement by D-Asp leads to protein disfunction. Accurately measuring the Asp racemization rates of dead cells on laboratory time scales still requires incubations at temperatures &gt;60?C. Constraining the rates of in vivo microbial maintenance processes therefore required us to work with hyperthermophiles, microorganisms capable of living at temperatures &gt;80?C.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, we focused our research on the survivability and the associated Asp racemization rates of two hyperthermophilic archaea,&nbsp;<em><span>Pyrococcus furiosus</span></em>&nbsp;found in&nbsp;deep sea vents&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Thermococcus litoralis&nbsp;</em>found in the deep subsurface,&nbsp;under prolonged starvation at temperatures of 95<sup>o</sup>C and 85<sup>o</sup>C, respectively. To measure the resilience of thermophilic spores we focused on measuring the survivability and the associated Asp racemization rate of one subsurface thermophilic spore-forming bacteria,&nbsp;<em>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</em>,&nbsp;at 65 to 98<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp;The starved&nbsp;<em>P.</em>&nbsp;<em>furiosus</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>T.</em>&nbsp;<em>litoralis&nbsp;</em>cells survived over tens of days and maintained low D/L Asp ratios likely via constant repair of D-aspartyl residues in the damaged proteins (Fig. 1). Transcriptomics revealed that PIMT and many DNA repair enzymes might be involved in the processes of maintaining protein function and genomic integrity during the survival under prolonged starvation (Fig. 2). The importance of PIMT in the repair of protein damage during the survival of thermophiles under starved conditions might be extended to other<a name="OLE_LINK36">&nbsp;</a>psychrophilic and mesophilic microorganisms surviving in lower temperature oligotrophic environments over decadal time scales.&nbsp;The Asp racemization rates of spores were not significantly different from those of autoclaved deactivated spores indicating that spores are not capable of repairing their Asp (Fig. 3).&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor were the spore Asp racemization rates significantly different from that of starved vegetative&nbsp;<em>G. stearothermophilus</em>&nbsp;cells at 65<sup>o</sup>C consistent with the absence of the PIMT repair enzymes for this species. The viability of spores and vegetative cells decreased dramatically over time, and the&nbsp;mortality of spores correlated exponentially with the degree of racemization (Fig. 4). This latter correlation predicts spore half-lives on the order of hundreds of years for temperatures typical of shallow marine sediments, a result consistent with studies about the survivability of thermophilic spores found in these environments. This relationship, if found to hold true for spores from other thermophilic bacteria, predicts a significant environmental bottleneck for colonization of the deep subsurface from the surface by spore-forming thermophiles. Given the importance of the PIMT enzyme to the survival of subsurface microorganisms we performed a phylogenomic survey of genomes to identify in which phyla it is present and discovered that some members of the Firmicutes do contain the gene coding for PIMT in their genome contrary to existing beliefs based upon an outdated survey (Fig. 5).</p> <p><span><br /></span></p> <p><span><br /></span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Tullis&nbsp;C&nbsp;Onstott</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1528492/1528492_10369055_1601149601599_finalreportfig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1528492/1528492_10369055_1601149601599_finalreportfig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1528492/1528492_10369055_1601149601599_finalreportfig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Racemization rate of starved versus dead (control) cells of P. furiosis and T. litoralis.</div> <div class="imageCredit">R.
