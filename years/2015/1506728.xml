<AbstractNarration>The Albany 2015 19th Conversation will be held on June 9 - 13, 2015 at the State University of New York at Albany. This yearly meeting is an important forum for exchange of new research and ideas among scientists studying DNA and RNA - the main two kinds of genetic material encoding the information about all living organisms. This conference series pays particular attention to inclusion of women and young, beginning scientists as speakers. Notably, the Young Scientist Speaker Program intersperses these presentations with lectures by senior researchers, including Nobel laureates (Nobel laureates Philip A. Sharp and Martin Karplus are slated to be speakers at the 19th Conversation).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Albany 2015 19th Conversation subjects include RNA localization/structure/catalysis, DNA-protein interactions, DNA damage/repair, DNA nanotechnology, protein folding/design/engineering, optogenetics, among others. A defining feature of this meeting is the emphasis on biophysical and computational approaches to these problems. The format of the meeting involves talks from invited speakers who are leaders in the field, speakers chosen from submitted abstracts, and poster sessions. The organizers have paid attention to diversity, which has been of particular concern in the biophysics arena: over 40% of the speakers will be women, 35% will be junior researchers, and participants are expected from across the US (~50%) and approximately 20 nations. The requested funds will be used to support 12-15 students and post-docs for travel and participation costs (total costs, including registration, housing and meals are $826 and $976 for graduate students and post-docs, respectively). There is a well-established, transparent procedure for selecting speakers and travel award recipients. Common housing and meals on the university campus for all participants foster diverse and open exchanges among the participants.</AbstractNarration>
