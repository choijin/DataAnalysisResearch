<AbstractNarration>Bates College, in partnership with the Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership, is granted an award to coordinate the research and training efforts of a network of Gulf of Maine (GOM) field stations.  Historically, the GOM was one of the world's most productive marine ecosystems. However, in August 2014, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that the cod population had plummeted to 3% of what is considered to be a sustainable population size, indicating the commercial extinction of cod in the GOM.  In addition, the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and others recently reported that the GOM is warming faster than 99% of the world's oceans, suggesting that the Gulf could serve as a "living laboratory" for rapidly changing marine ecosystems.  At least 20 field stations collect environmental data in the Gulf of Maine.  Of these, 10-15 operate on a small scale, with limited faculty, staff and equipment.  Most emphasize undergraduate education and some place a high priority on engagement with diverse coastal communities.  Individually, these stations cover limited geographic ranges; together, they cover the distance from Nantucket to Nova Scotia.  Furthermore, their combined data sets document fine-scale conditions across a wide range of natural systems, and across decades of place-based observation and research.  The central purpose of this award is to strategically leverage the research and training capacity of small field stations as a coordinated network.  Its successful implementation will foster synergies and innovation, with the potential to yield significant findings on near-shore conditions in the Gulf of Maine, and to contribute to a larger understanding of environmental change in coastal waters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award allows a network of small GOM field stations to do the strategic planning necessary to implement shared research and training goals. Planning activities will include two multi-day meetings for all station directors, scientists associated with field stations, and three scientific advisors.  Outcomes of this phase will include a summary of knowledge gaps and research priorities; equipment needs; teaching and training recommendations for students and citizens; and a data management strategy.  During the second phase of the project, directors from the three lead stations-the Bates College Coastal Center at Shortridge (http://www.bates.edu/harward/bates-morse-mountain-shortridge/), the Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership (http://www.hurricaneisland.net/ ) and the Bowdoin Scientific Station at Kent Island (https://www.bowdoin.edu/kent-island/)-will produce a ten-year strategic plan for the network, identifying actionable items for implementation based on prior meetings.  A business planning workshop will inform the strategic planning efforts. A final report will detail priorities, action steps, and the specifics of shared research and training programs.</AbstractNarration>
