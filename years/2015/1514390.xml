<AbstractNarration>Federal, state, and local agencies must understand the availability of regional Ebola-specific resources to develop effective response plans. This research shall result in the development of methodologies to integrate data pertaining to available regional health infrastructure with population-specific information to identify capabilities and resources for mitigating a potential Ebola outbreak. The primary focus is the design and implementation of computational tools that facilitate the quantification of the availability and distribution of resources across regional healthcare infrastructure, specifically resources that pertain to the isolation and treatment of Ebola patients. This research will have broader impact by improving best practices for the allocation of limited health resources to mitigate the effects of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases, which may threaten the United States. The resulting computational framework may become an integral component of the national chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) preparedness effort. Further, the proposed research will involve students, providing them an opportunity to conduct research in an interdisciplinary STEM project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed computational methods will construct a hierarchy of regional healthcare facilities and their corresponding Ebola-specific capabilities. Geospatial partitioning algorithms, such as Voronoi tessellation and uniform partitioning (UPAS) shall form the basis for delineating service regions corresponding to available healthcare facilities, thereby quantifying the per capita resource availability. This will enable agencies to address existing resource constraints and develop strategies for the effective allocation of Ebola-specific resources to achieve adequate regional coverage. Resource constraints can be expected to affect mitigation efforts differently at different levels of outbreak magnitude. As the magnitude of the outbreak increases, adequate local and regional resources must be made available to reflect the increased demand. The proposed computational methods shall provide the necessary functionalities to estimate the required levels of resource availability for different levels of outbreak magnitude. The design and implementation of new methods to augment an existing planning framework (RE-PLAN) will extend its applicability to the geospatial allocation of health resources pertinent to Ebola mitigation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   CDC guidelines provide explicit information on the types and quantities of resources needed at healthcare facilities (HCFs) to address outbreaks of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) or other High Consequence Infectious Diseases (HCID). Interim guidance for hospital preparedness specifies a multilevel approach that includes three levels of assessment and care HCFs that should be utilized in the event of an EVD outbreak: frontline healthcare facilities, Ebola assessment hospitals, and Ebola treatment centers. However, without an adequate understanding of the demand landscape, implementation of these guidelines are likely to prove ineffective. In this project, factors which would hinder the efficacy of CDC guidelines were identified, and methods to estimate resource needs and population demands for medical care during a complex EVD outbreak were developed.  To estimate the demand landscape, strategies were developed to quantify the needs of specific resources at each HCF by considering the type of each HCF, the geography of areas impacted, evolving disease dynamics, and populations surrounding each facility. A computational methodology was devised to consider the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of the disease as it spreads through the population. This included the development of a Decision Support System to allow decision makers to interact with computational models and define characteristics of individual HCFs using a graphical user interface.    Population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, service areas of health care utilization using Primary Care Service Area (PCSA) boundaries from HRSAÆs National Center for Health Workforce Analysis, and spatial population partitioning algorithms were employed to quantify the resources needed at existing HCFs to satisfy population demand. Outbreak models were used to better understand how disease dynamics within a population affect the spatio-temporal fluctuations of healthcare resource needs. Differences in population distribution patterns exhibited by urban and rural areas, coupled with the uneven spatial configuration of the three types of facilities, introduce biases into the demand landscape which complicate the equitable distribution of Ebola-specific resources, thus leading to disparate levels of service among population subgroups. Findings of this project indicate that current CDC guidelines will lead to inequitable and inefficient levels of service and are likely to fail to adequately address the unfolding outbreak.
