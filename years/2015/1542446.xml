<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma (OU) Norman will involve rural high school science and mathematics teachers and regional community college instructors in bioanalytical engineering research, to help them improve STEM teaching in their classrooms, and to have them participate in a sustainable professional network that will increase the number of rural students who select and successfully graduate from higher education STEM fields. Bioanalytical engineering encompasses the design and manipulation of biomolecules, viruses, bacteria and cells, as well as the fabrication of innovative analytical devices for the detection and monitoring of these biomaterials.  These efforts directly address pertinent problems related to medicine, public health, petroleum and biofuel production, bioremediation of groundwater, and designing target-specific pharmaceuticals. Because these are important and relevant topics for Oklahoma rural communities, integrating these topics into STEM education will: strengthen rural education, build a network of educators (ranging from rural high school teachers and regional community college instructors to university research faculty), and promote a career-preparation pathway for rural youth in Oklahoma.  This effort will increase the Oklahoma workforce, which needs highly trained professionals in these areas. In the long-term, the knowledge and results gained from this RET program will help build sustainable education initiatives to reach rural students and teachers, and as a result, will support sustainable rural communities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over three years, 48 rural Oklahoma educators (high school teachers and regional community college instructors) will conduct bioanalytical engineering research (for seven weeks each summer) at the University of Oklahoma (OU) in collaboration with eight faculty associated with the OU Center for Bioanalysis (CBA). The summer research experience will be designed according to the SUCCESS Framework to maximize RET educators' sense of efficacy for conducting research and to increase their motivation to transfer these experiences into their classrooms. The SUCCESS Framework guides teachers, designers and instructors at all levels and in all contexts, providing a structure for integrating theory-based motivational features into any type of instruction. Educators will be recruited from three regions of rural Oklahoma that are typically overlooked because of their distance from urban centers and major universities. Educators from the same or adjacent rural districts will be paired to facilitate collaboration in the development and implementation of authentic, guided-inquiry curricula that utilize fundamental STEM concepts, apply bioanalytical engineering, and address issues of rural interest and relevance. The SUCCESS Framework will be integrated into the curricular design to improve the students' motivation in learning and the educators' teaching efficacy. This collaboration will establish a professional rural educator network that includes interactions with faculty research mentors and graduate students through classroom visits, field trips, sampling trips, virtual presentations and interactions. The professional rural educator network will be further strengthened and expanded upon by dissemination of curricular materials and motivational design methods through workshops for rural STEM educators at the annual OU K20 Center's Innovative Learning Institute, annual sessions on rural STEM education at the National Rural Education Association, and educator-student poster sessions and presentations at the annual CBA symposium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over five years, thirty rural Oklahoman educators (high school teachers and regional community college instructors) spent seven weeks each summer, conducting bioanalytical engineering research at the University of Oklahoma (OU) in collaboration with eight research faculty associated with the OU Center for Bioanalysis (CBA).  The summer research experience was designed according to the SUCCESS Framework to maximize RET educators’ sense of efficacy for conducting research and to increase their motivation to transfer these experiences into their classrooms.  Bioanalytical engineering encompasses the design and manipulation of biomolecules, viruses, bacteria and cells, as well as the fabrication of innovative analytical devices for the detection and monitoring of these biomaterials. These efforts build upon the fact that public health, medicine, agriculture, energy, and the environment are important and relevant topics for Oklahoma rural communities, thus integrating these topics into STEM education strengthens rural education. In addition, this effort increases the Oklahoma workforce which needs highly trained professionals in these areas. By highlighting these areas of interest and need, rural communities are recognizing ways in which their youth can apply their STEM knowledge and skills in order to give back and sustain the rural community rather than permanently outmigrate to urban areas.   A key finding of this RET project is that rural teachers are a demographic with unique challenges different from those experienced by urban and suburban teachers.  These challenges required us to adapt the RET summer research program to meet rural educators’ needs and lifestyles.  Because the rural schools served by this RET program are 60 miles or more away from the OU Norman campus, teachers were provided with on-campus residential facilities.  However, the residential program requires rural teachers to spend time away from their farms and ranches, as well as their families. Many rural educators depend on their farms and ranches for a major portion of their income.  This requires them to be on their farms and ranches for agricultural or livestock activities at specific times during the summer.  Therefore, we adapted a more flexible approach to the summer research scheduling.  For example, we have the teachers work for three weeks, get one full week off, and then return to the OU labs for another three weeks, giving them a break in the middle to dedicate to farming and ranching activities.  We also allowed teachers flexibility in ending or starting early or later if they used the middle "off" week for laboratory research.  To be respectful of teachers with children, we worked an arrangement with OU to provide housing that allows minors so that teachers could bring their children with them to Norman for a week or so to take advantage of K12 summer programs at OU and Norman summer festivals.  Another finding from this RET project is the importance the rural community and rural family play in placing importance on STEM education.  Rural students are sometimes discouraged by their family and community from pursuing higher education for fear that they will permanently leave their community in search of professional positions.  This fear is real, and many rural populations are atrophying as the younger generation moves elsewhere in search of good-paying jobs.  The thesis of this RET was that teaching STEM in rural schools must be done in a meaningful context related to rural activities, economies, and jobs.  This RET attempted to make this connection using BioAnalytical Engineering as the bridge.  One finding from this RET project regarding connection of research topics with an economic driver pertinent to rural communities, is that currently, there is not yet enough commercial development or marketing in rural communities related to BioAnalytical Engineering to close the gap between students learning STEM and having skilled STEM jobs available in their community.  Although students found the topics related to biology and agriculture very engaging, the link between their learning and future job prospects in their rural community was still missing.  Therefore, a recommendation for improving rural STEM education is to identify commercial and economic drivers that are positively impacting rural communities and connect them with K12 STEM education.  This hypothesis was used for our current RET program "Sustainable Energy Engineering for Empowering Rural Communities" by partnering with the wind energy industry and the nascent solar energy industry in Oklahoma.  These industries desire to implement K12 and community outreach efforts so they can build good-will in communities where their wind and solar farms are located, as well as nurture a future generation of high-skilled workers who will build and maintain sustainable energy infrastructure in rural areas.
