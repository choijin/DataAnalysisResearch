<AbstractNarration>Elementary particles have an intrinsic property called spin--they act as if they were constantly spinning around like tops.  Just as a tops precess in the presence of gravity, the spins of fundamental particles precess in a magnetic field.  This precession is the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance which is the underlying physics used in the medical diagnostic known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Recently developed precision optical techniques have allowed the study of interactions with particle spins with unprecedented precision.   The researchers will use these precision techniques as tools to investigate the fundamental forces and symmetries of nature.  At the most basic level, our present understanding of nature is summarized in the "Standard Model' of particle physics.  This model requires four fundamental forces (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong and weak) to describe all of reality as it is presently known.  In one experiment, the investigators will look for a new long-range force between particle spins that can't be described by the Standard Model.  To optimize their search, they will measure the interaction of their laboratory spins with the sum of all of the electron spins within the Earth.  In their other experiment, the researchers hope eventually to see if the fundamental laws of nature might be asymmetric in time.  This breaking of "time symmetry" can be studied by looking for the precession of a nuclear spin in an electric field.  Here the experimental sensitivity can be increased by using a very cold beam of molecules.  Additional time asymmetry (beyond that which has already been observed) is believed to be necessary to explain the existence of our universe.  Without time-reversal violation, our universe would have produced equal amounts of matter and anti-matter.  Their mutual annihilation would not have allowed for the formation of galaxies, stars, planets and life. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, the researchers created the first map of the electron-spin density within the Earth.  These "geo-electrons" constitute the largest polarized spin source known.  Precision measurement of spin-precession frequencies in laboratories at the surface of the Earth as a function of their applied magnetic-field direction, allows one to look for long-range spin-spin interactions (LRSSI) between the geo-electrons and the laboratory spins.  In the first proposed experiment, a refined spin-precession apparatus will be constructed which is both well calibrated and relatively immune to AC light effects.  This should allow at least an order of magnitude improvement in the sensitivity of these measurements to LRSSI.  If an effect is seen it would suggest the existence of a new force of nature.  In current models this force might be associated with an ultra-light vector meson, a "dark" photon, the "unparticle," or torsion gravity.  In the second proposed experiment, critical parameters that determine the viability of an electric-dipole moment (edm) experiment in thallium fluoride (TlF) will be investigated using an ultraviolet laser and a cold molecular source.  Specifically, the researchers hope to demonstrate the existence of a cycling transition in TlF and to measure the efficiency with which TlF can be ablated from a surface.  If the results of these measurements are favorable, TlF will then be proposed as a candidate system for a cold-beam precision measurement of the edm of the thallium nucleus.  The discovery of a permanent nuclear edm would imply a violation of time symmetry and could help explain the existence of our matter-dominated universe.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for PHY-1519265   A Search for Long-Range Spin-Spin Interactions (LRSSI) using the Earth as a spin source   Precision measurements of the spin interactions of elementary particles can provide new insights into the fundamental laws of nature.  Elementary particles have an intrinsic property called spin &ndash; they act as if they were constantly spinning around like tops.

The ultimate motivation for our investigation of thallium-monofluoride is to see if the fundamental laws of nature might be asymmetric in time.  Additional time asymmetry (beyond that which has already been observed) is believed to be necessary to explain the existence of our universe.  Without time-reversal violation, the big bang would have produced equal amounts of matter and anti-matter.  Their mutual annihilation would not have allowed for the formation of galaxies, stars, planets and life.  This breaking of "time symmetry" can be sensitively studied by looking for the electric-dipole moment (edm) of the thallium nucleus.  An edm would result in the precession of the thallium nuclear spin in the strong molecular electric field.  The sensitivity of this experiment can be increased by using a cycling transition and a very cold beam of molecules. We have built a cryogenic beam source and measured critical parameters on the TlF X-B transition that determine the viability and ultimate sensitivity expected of an edm experiment in TlF.  Our measurements of branching fractions and hyperfine structure suggest that it should be possible to cycle about 100 photons on two different rotational transitions on the X(0)-B(0) vibrational transition.  This should allow efficient state detection in the edm experiment.  In collaboration with researchers at Yale we have finally unraveled the hyper-fine structure of TlF.  This new understanding has allowed us to calibrate our measurements of optical cycling.  Thus far, we have succeeded in observing about 50 photons on the optical cycling transition, enough to ensure that every molecule in our cold-beam apparatus can be detected.  These results have been sufficiently encouraging that a new cold-beam TlF edm experiment is now being constructed at Yale by the CeNTREX collaboration.  The discovery of a permanent nuclear edm would imply a violation of time symmetry and could help explain the existence of our matter-dominated universe.  Broader Impacts.  Our group?s tradition of strong undergraduate participation and training has continued under this grant.  Two students wrote honors theses on these projects.  One is now enrolled in a Ph.D. program in the department of computer science at U.C.L.A.  The second was awarded an NSF graduate fellowship and is now working on the CeNTREX experiment as a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at Yale.  In addition, nine undergraduates worked on these projects during the summer and over interterm. Two of the summer students were woman, one who is presently pursuing her honors thesis in our lab.  The project has also provided a great training for the post doc involved who has interest in a small-college faculty position.
