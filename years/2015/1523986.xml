<AbstractNarration>Understanding how human societies respond to large-scale environmental changes has become a critical issue across multiple scientific disciplines. Archaeology is well positioned to study the long-term dynamics of these responses. With the support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Naomi Cleghorn and an international team of research archaeologists and students will investigate early human responses to drastic shifts in ecosystems and landscapes, and how human-environment interactions during glacial-interglacial cycles shaped modern human behavior. Previous scholarship suggests that human populations may respond to massive environmental shifts through innovations in technology and food-acquisition strategies, as well as through societal re-organization. Southern Africa is a region with some of the oldest evidence for complex technology, symbolic and artistic traditions, and the first evidence for coastal foraging (a strategy that has been linked historically to hierarchical social structures). In this region, it has been proposed that the evidence for these key cognitive developments (which characterize modern human behavior) correlate with peak cold and dry periods, and may be adaptive responses that buffer populations by creating social and subsistence-related safety-nets. However, less is known about how humans coped with the long phases of environmental instability leading up to these periods. This project focuses on those periods of prolonged instability and investigates the related issues of continuity and disruption in human traditions and adaptations. These issues are of relevance today as modern societies in both industrialized and developing contexts struggle to adapt to changing climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Cleghorn and her team are investigating site use, subsistence strategies, and technological adaptations in the context of a landscape that, over the past 45,000 years, has fluctuated between a coastal zone with rich marine resources, and a broad plain with terrestrial plant and animal resources. Since 2014, excavations at the site of KEH-1 on the southern coast of South Africa have produced evidence of intensive site use during periods when the relative location of the coastal zone was shifting between 5 and 75 km in distance. This occupational sequence provides a unique opportunity to study responses to large-scale environmental changes that would have presented human foragers with radically shifting foraging opportunities and challenges. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Cleghorn will lead a multidisciplinary team of archaeologists, faunal specialists, geochronologists, and geoarchaeologists in the analyses of materials excavated from KEH-1. The integration of the resulting datasets will contribute to models of human behavioral adaptations to fluctuating resources. The team will implement and build on new analytical methods while creating training and collaboration opportunities for junior scientist and students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Dr. Naomi Cleghorn is studying long-term human adaptation to climate and sea level change in coastal and near-coastal societies. Her NSF-funded grant supported archaeological research on the coast of southern Africa, at the site of Knysna Eastern Heads Cave 1 (KEH-1). This site preserves a long record of over 55,000 years of human activity through dramatic landscape changes as the coast shifted between less than 5 km to more than 70 km away. Dr. Cleghorn is particularly interested in understanding how these changes in landscape may have impacted societies across southern Africa.</p> <p>During the grant period (between 2015 and 2018), Dr. Cleghorn directed 4 six-week field excavations (2 months in total) and more than 12 months of laboratory analysis by multiple specialists and student researchers. The team produced a state-of-the-art data record, including more than 60,000 archaeological finds, recorded with millimetric accuracy in a 3D database, a detailed stratigraphic record photographed with high-resolution imagery and imported into the spatial database: evidence of more than 50 well-preserved hearth features, and a fine-grained record of ancient climate and environmental change through time. One of the key results obtained with the aid of NSF funds was a detailed chronology, developed through multiple lines of independent evidence. This provides the critical framework for interpretation of all results from the site.</p> <p>The South African archaeological record includes some of the earliest evidence for the complex behaviors we would recognize as modern (including art, symbolism, and complex manufacturing processes). The KEH-1 site is thus far unique in documenting how people lived in the shifting environment of the south coast of southern Africa during a critical point in this record of human behavioral evolution, and in bridging earlier and later parts of that record. The data produced provide a foundation for further research and understanding of human social adaptation in general, and for greater understanding of the southern African record in particular.</p> <p>Dr. Cleghorn's project has also provided training opportunities to 35 students during the grant period. Of the 16 graduate student participants, 6 are developing or have completed MA and PhD thesis work related to the project. The project draws international and South African students, and collaborating researchers, and provides an important nexus of scientific communication between the US and South Africa. In addition, the project has supported researchers from a diversity of economic, ethnic, and national backgrounds, including traditionally under-represented groups in science. Dr. Cleghorn and her team have presented results of this phase of the project in conference presentations (8), invited public lectures (6), and an academic publication.</p> <p>The KEH-1 project is continuing to build on this foundation, with more detailed analyses of the ancient environment and human technologies and adaptations. The PI is also working in collaboration with other projects in Africa and Eurasia to standardize these data for meaningful comparison across broad regions, ultimately providing a clearer picture of the evolution of human societies and behavior.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/01/2019<br>      Modified by: Naomi&nbsp;Cleghorn</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1523986/1523986_10377314_1568576377155_2015-08-0711.57.03--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1523986/1523986_10377314_1568576377155_2015-08-0711.57.03--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Knysna Eastern Heads Cave 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1523986/1523986_10377314_1568576377155_2015-08-0711.57.03--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Knysna Eastern Heads Cave 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Excavation area, July 2015</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ximena Villagran</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Naomi&nbsp;Cleghorn</div> <div class="imageTitle">Knysna Eastern Heads Cave 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1523986/1523986_10377314_1568577604732_2018-06-2013.13.01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1523986/1523986_10377314_1568577604732_2018-06-2013.13.01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Excavators at KEH-1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1523986/1523986_10377314_1568577604732_2018-06-2013.13.01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Excavators at KEH-1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Team members excavate at KEH-1 in 2018.
