<AbstractNarration>Rapid, short-term global warming events in the Early Paleogene (~65-45 Million years ago) were caused by massive greenhouse gas release into the ocean-atmosphere system. These warming events, called "hyper thermals", had far-reaching effects on the evolution of life on Earth, ecosystems, and the carbon cycle. The most extreme of these events was the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (~55.5 Million years ago). Hyperthermals resemble what could happen during anthropogenic climate change, and provide analogs for the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and their long-term effects on life on Earth. By testing earth system interactions during the Paleogene hyperthermals, this interdisciplinary project will provide new insight into global climate-carbon cycle feedbacks and extremes in climate. The research will serve the national interest by improving a widely used Community Earth System Model on high-performance computers, and by synthesizing data and model output with observations from novel isotopic and trace element techniques in marine geology and paleoceanography. Multidisciplinary research and educational activities are integrated and will lead to development and widespread circulation of educational materials on abrupt climate change, thus enhancing training in quantitative science for undergraduate and high school students from diverse backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this collaborative effort involves integration of new biotic, isotopic and trace element proxies with existing data into a state-of-the-art, high-resolution, comprehensive earth system model to test the hypothesis that deep-sea ventilation released a massive amount of carbon from the refractory dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool during hyperthermal events, increasing atmospheric CO2 levels, and thus amplifying climate change through carbon-cycle feedback. The research team will investigate the environmental response (e.g., ocean acidification and deoxygenation) and its impact on pelagic ecosystem structure for three Paleogene hyperthermals with different magnitudes and durations. The project will focus on a key mechanism involving remineralization of organic matter and oxidation of the DOM pool in the ocean, with potentially major implications for future climate evolution, addressing these questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) How might changes in oceanic productivity, organic carbon remineralization, ocean oxygenation, and export efficiency during hyperthermals have contributed to changes in the oceanic dissolved organic matter reservoir? &lt;br/&gt;(2) Could DOM release due to enhanced ocean ventilation have been at least a partial cause of Paleogene hyperthermals?&lt;br/&gt;(3) What are the implications of Paleogene climate?carbon cycle changes associated with DOM storage and release for future extremes in climate and the environment?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New data on planktic and benthic foraminifera, and accumulation of marine barite on the same samples will be obtained and integrated with a large amount of existing data to provide insight into ecosystem-dependent export productivity and remineralization, as well as regionally varying vertical carbon fluxes. Recently gathered data from the equatorial regions will be incorporated in a database to provide initial conditions for the earth system model. The model results will give insight into changes in ocean stratification, vertical carbon gradients, DOM reservoirs, oxygenation, and ecosystem composition during transitions into and out of hyperthermals. In particular, the team will evaluate the possibility of extreme changes in response to ecosystem-related fluctuations in DOM accumulation and subsequent oxidation and emission from the oceans, because the DOM pool is the largest reservoir of easily interchangeable carbon. This mechanism has not been thoroughly explored as a contributor to a transition into a hothouse climate with more extreme weather patterns.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Fifty-six million years ago, a massive release of greenhouse gases led to an abrupt global warming event on the order of 5&ordm;C. This event, known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (or, PETM, for short), is generally considered to be the best analog we have in the relatively recent fossil record for our current, anthropogenic global warming event. That said, how informative the PETM is for the present day depends on a lot of factors including the rate and the magnitude of global warming. NSF Award 1536604 allowed my group to provide new constraints on the duration of the abrupt warming phase of the PETM by modeling how geological processes distort environmental signals. As a result of this work, we found strong support for PETM warming to have occurred over a few thousand years [Kirtland Turner et al., 2017]&ndash;much longer than the hundred-year time scale of current global warming. This difference in time scale may account for the relatively mild negative effects of the PETM on life. We also developed new methods for understanding how the biology of the shell-forming organisms used to trace environmental change act to distort the primary environmental signal [Edgar et al. 2017; Gaskell &amp; Hull, 2019], particularly during abrupt global warming events. &nbsp;As biologists, we were able to extract important biological data from the structure of the environmental signal distortion. By investigating stable isotope composition change in this way, we were able to make inferences regarding changes in photosymbiont-host relationships during the PETM and other, small warming events that followed shortly thereafter [Shaw et al., 2021; Davis et al., in revision]. Counter to evidence from today, where global warming is particularly harmful to photosymbiont-bearing organisms like corals, the much more gradual warming of the PETM does not appear to have been particularly harmful to photosymbiont-bearing plankton [Shaw et al., 2021; Davis et al., in revision]. In addition to funding research on the comparative effects of different global warming events on past life [Forster et al., 2018], this award also funded comparative investigations into the interaction of multiple components of the earth system during warming, and their effects [Penman et al. 2019]. An outreach partnership with the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History&rsquo;s EVOLUTIONS program brought 2 high school students and an undergraduate student from under-represented minority groups in the New Haven area into my lab for summer internships, provided mentoring experience for one graduate student, and led to the development of an interactive-cart display for the halls of the museum. The award also indirectly fostered the research programs of two postdoctoral researchers and two graduate students in my group, and supported my efforts as a co-host of a Royal Society meeting on the topic.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/27/2021<br>      Modified by: Pincelli&nbsp;M&nbsp;Hull</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
