<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to use sophisticated computer models of the human body to help design the next generation of robotic prosthetic technologies that maximize mobility for lower-limb amputees. The major outcome of this project will be an improved approach for designing prosthetic devices that reduce loading on the body and make walking easier. The success of this project will improve the quality of life for lower limb amputees by increasing their mobility and their ability to participate in the activities of daily life. The proposed research is especially relevant for older amputees whose residual limbs cannot tolerate significant loading. This award will also support the training of the next generation of engineers and scientists and the development of an innovative STEM robotics program targeted toward middle and high school teachers and their students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on creating a new design process for assistive robotic devices that aid people with mobility impairments. Using modeling and simulation, optimal robot forms and controls will be identified. The case study for this project is the development of prostheses for below-knee amputees. The guiding principle of the project is to consider the complete and altered anatomy of the person and develop solutions that are not limited to anthropomorphic mimicry. Detailed musculoskeletal models and optimal control simulations will be used to guide the robotic prosthesis development process towards optimized loading conditions while minimizing metabolic energy consumption. In this process, the optimal prosthesis form and specifications are initially unknown and are generated through predictive simulations. The results will then be reverse-engineered to develop robotic ankle prostheses that enable these optimal gait patterns for below-knee amputees. This approach will later be extended to maximize the performance of other co-robot systems such as exoskeletons and other rehabilitation robots.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>We achieved the overall project goal to combine predictive musculoskeletal simulation with prosthetic design to create a foundation upon which intelligent prosthetic technologies can be coordinated more naturally with the unique anatomy of a person. A major focus of this work was to reduce the interface pressures and increase gait efficiency. The impact of this research is improving the quality of life for people with lower limb amputation by increasing their comfort and efficiency as they independently participate in the activities of daily life.

We made advances in predicting muscle activations needed for generating efficient and stable walking for people with, and without, below-knee amputation by leveraging a computationally efficient method known as direct collocation. To investigate the factors that govern human walking we evaluated different performance criteria that underlie how and why people walk the way they do. We examined factors such as muscle activation, energy efficiency, stability, movement smoothness, and loading on the limbs. Insights to the contributions of each of these factors were gained using a computational efficient nested evolutionary approach to solve complex bilevel optimization problems that reveal the terms and their relative weights in the cost function for human walking. Our results demonstrated the importance of muscular effort, maintaining stability, and avoiding jerky movements for achieving realistic simulations of human walking. This approach provides practical utility in designing assistive mobility devices and could yield insights about the control of human walking. Additionally, we developed two new experimental motion capture techniques for measuring bone motion within the prosthetic socket, and a virtual marker placement optimization algorithm for increased accuracy and repeatability of reconstructed kinematics for both able-bodied subjects and persons with amputation.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong><span>2.&nbsp;Using&nbsp;the predictive simulations to create new assistive devices that optimize the person's gait efficiency and stability while minimizing the pressures on their body.</span></strong></p> <p><span>We applied the predictive simulation approach to two human-robot systems, an ankle exoskeleton and a prosthetic ankle. We simulated a person walking augmented by a powered ankle exoskeleton which showed the energetic cost of walking could be reduced by an amount that agreed well with experimental results from other researchers. For the prosthetic ankle simulations, we developed a general&nbsp;modeling approach to find optimal prosthesis dynamics in gait simulations without constraining the prosthesis to follow kinematics prescribed by a specific joint mechanism. To accomplish this, we generalized a transtibial prosthetic device as the composition of its resultant forces and moments as they act upon the prosthetic foot and socket and allow the ankle to both rotate (as a biological joint) and translate (which is not biological). The model was implemented into a human musculoskeletal model and used to solve dynamic optimizations of muscle and prosthesis controls to minimize muscle effort and loading on the residual limb during walking. We found that both muscle effort and socket loading measures were reduced for our prosthesis model compared to a standard revolute joint prosthesis model. Our results suggest this approach could assist in the design of non-biomimetic prostheses that enhance mobility for the users, but first requires experimental validation to assess our modeling assumptions, as well as progress toward increased fidelity of predictive simulation approaches more generally. Lastly, we finalized the design and started construction on a prosthetic ankle test device that is a cable-driven prosthetic ankle and a backpack actuator and controller that allows for overground testing and operation.
