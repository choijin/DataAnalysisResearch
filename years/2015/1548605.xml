<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in addressing a long-standing roadblock to widespread consumer adoption of wearable tech devices for Smart Health use-cases.  The primary barrier is that the current devices are woefully inaccurate when it comes to converting body-worn sensor data into activity/gesture data. A second barrier is that without reliable gesture data, there is no mechanism for providing meaningful feedback to users.  To address these barriers, we propose an innovative approach to gesture/activity recognition from body-worn sensor data. The software can rapidly learn and adapt to user's motion idiosyncrasies, in a computationally lightweight but powerful system. The commercialization plan is to license the software to equipment manufacturers for them to embed it in their motion sensing products.  Products and use-cases that have been impossible to analyze previously can now have tracking enabled, thus driving value for the end-user and expanding economic opportunities for the manufacturers.  The proposed software will empower individuals to manage their fitness and rehabilitation regimens; sports trainers and physicians will have unprecedented tools for monitoring outpatient treatment; and the field will have troves of behavior data to mine for research implications and additional societal outcomes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will lead to software that can be integrated with wearable tech devices, either embedded into silicon or as a stand-alone mobile app.  The software will be capable of 1) accurately recognizing multiple activities/gestures despite individual variances and other noise factors, 2) providing reliable and valid attributes (metrics) of those activities, specifically range of motion, path efficiency, and power, and 3) providing meaningful data for user feedback and research purposes. Despite the plethora of related devices and technologies now available, current technology is lacking as to the number of gestures identified, accuracy of identification, support for on-device learning, and the ability to provide valid and reliable gesture metrics.  The proposed technology will address current limitations in and market demand for functionality, accuracy, and robustness.  The overall technical question is whether the software can be developed to adequately compensate for sensor drift and for other types of uncertainties in motion data, at the level of complexity posed by increasingly sophisticated physical behaviors and output (metric) requirements.  The anticipated technical results include novel algorithms, fundamental performance bounds, software prototypes, and testing and validation studies. Phase I demonstrations, if successful, will lead to full-scale software development of these and additional functions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual/Technological Advancement. This project advanced current capabilities in motion sensing software and gesture recognition through expansions to a patented 3-d software modeling architecture.  The Phase I findings demonstrated the concept of on-the-device learning and recognition of several user-defined gestures (physical exercises) despite individual variations and other noise factors, together with reliable and accurate metrics, specifically range of motion, path efficiency, and power, for those gestures.  These capabilities were demonstrated in the form of a proof-of-concept mobile application that works with Android smartwatches.  The app learns and records a user?s form for each type of unique exercise, recognizes subsequent repetitions of the exercise, and provides data to the users on their performance over time.  Data includes a log of repetitions over time, weight and duration, progress over time, active vs. rest time, and other personal records.  Societal benefits.  Accurate wearable motion sensors are important in several Smart Health applications. The software developed as part of the Phase I project empowers individuals to manage their own fitness and rehabilitation regimens.  In addition, sports trainers and physicians now have advanced tools for monitoring outpatient treatment over time, and access to troves of behavior data to mine for research implications and additional societal outcomes.  The technology will also potentially foster other innovators to develop unforeseen wearable devices and applications, which are innately accessible to populations of underserved and differently-abled individuals previously unreachable with more expensive, unmovable treatment and monitoring facilities.  The potential for cost reduction alone is hard to estimate, not to mention improved quality of life in improved health, fewer injuries, and quicker recovery times.  All of these outcomes will ultimately help realize the Smart Health goals of proactive, person-centered, preventive, and cost-efficient healthcare.  Market Demand.  Commercial interest in our technology has been validated by general contractual relationships with market leaders. Several partnership agreements have been executed to assess and use Rithmio software in its products for fitness, medical, industrial and textiles industries. Non-Disclosure Agreements for future exploration are currently in place between Rithmio and several leading sports and technology manufacturers. Demand is also growing from end users such as the U.S. Paralympic Committee, who are requesting the technology even in its current, pre-market form.
