<AbstractNarration>A longstanding problem in astrophysics is to understand how galaxies form and develop throughout their lifetimes.  Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to study supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies and how these black holes interact with their host galaxies.  Observational evidence suggests that black holes and galaxies evolve together.  This evidence includes the tightness of the correlation between the black hole mass and galaxy bulge properties and the similar history of black hole growth and star formation.  This evidence is supported by theoretical arguments.  Black holes in their active phase emit more than enough energy to unbind the host galaxies' bulge, and in their non-active phase should be present in the centers of most present-day galaxies.  As a consequence, many models for galaxy formation include a unspecified process by which a fraction of the energy released in the region surrounding the black hole contributes to the galaxy formation environment.  This interaction is generically known as "feedback," and the mechanism by which the black hole acts on the host galaxy remains a mystery.  This project uses a novel spectral synthesis and statistical approach to build the tools needed to constrain the key parameter characterizing one type of feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the project activities will directly contribute to the training of young scientists, including undergraduate students, in techniques of spectral and statistical analysis.  The PI will develop and teach a course, directed toward advanced undergraduate and graduate students, on machine learning and statistical methods, some of which will be used in this project.  The PI will bring the results of this research to the citizens of Oklahoma through participation in the OU speakers program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research effort will constrain the key parameter characterizing quasar mode feedback: the ratio of the kinetic luminosity to bolometric luminosity, in the SDSS broad absorption line quasars as a whole.  In addition, the carefully-phased research program addresses related scientific questions at each check point.  These include the location and nature of feedback interactions, a search for and evaluation of absorption-line spectral diagnostics, and constraints of key outflow physical parameters, including column density, ionization parameter, and covering fraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will yield insights into the physics of quasar outflows, and measurements of key parameters that will be valuable to a wide variety of researchers.  These include scientists who are interested in on-going interactions potentially occurring in infrared-loud quasars, data analysts who use spectral diagnostics to infer physical conditions from spectra of individual objects, and theorists who need observational constraints to develop their hydromagnetic wind models, as well as providing an assessment of the viability of quasar-mode feedback for galaxy evolution models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most pressing problems in astronomy is how the Universe evolved from a nearly smooth and almost featureless state at the time of the Big Bang to the highly structured environment we see today. Large-scale cosmological simulations of structure formation have seen notable success, but a key result is that feedback - energy returned to the galaxy by the accreting black hole - is necessary in the models.  The issue is that large-scale models are not able to determine how the black-hole feedback occurs, since the scale of the black hole is tiny compared with the scale of the simulations.  One of the most promising of the feedback candidates is the high-velocity winds that are seen in the rest-UV spectrum in about 20% of quasars - the so-called broad absorption line quasars (BALQs).  BALQs were discovered about 50 years ago, yet their potential as feedback candidates remains unknown because quasar spectra are not easy to analyze, especially when there is severe line blending.  Under this grant, we developed a novel method for analysing broad-absorption line quasar spectra.  The traditional method involves measuring individual absorption lines and comparing those measurements to results from the photoionization code Cloudy.  This method is time consuming and can lead to ambiguous results.  Our method, called SimBAL, inverts the process.  We create synthetic spectra from the photoionization results, and compare those synthetic spectra with the observed ones using a machine-learning technique.  The outcome of this project was the development of SimBAL, and application to several 10s of BALQ spectra.  Many technical problems were solved, including writing the base code, determining the most efficient machine-learning methods, determining how to model the velocity-resolved absorption lines, and how to model the continuum. Our results revealed hithertofore unknown wealth of information in BALQ spectra, much more than we had anticipated.  For example, we found that BALQ troughs are generally complex, with evidence for thicker regions at certain velocities.  We found that outflows in a sub-class of broad absorption line quasars span an enormous range of distances in the quasar, from very close to the accretion disk all the way out in the host galaxy.  We discovered the most energetic outflow ever identified, where the energy of the outflow is comparable to the luminosity of the quasar.  Most importantly, we established that SimBAL enables us to begin the first systematic study of the physical properties of BALQ outflows, which in turn will permit us to evaluate the contribution of BALQs to feedback and to constrain dynamical models.  The SimBAL project offers excellent opportunties for education.  Under this grant, Leighly developed a graduate Machine Learning course, and taught it twice.  This course provides a ambitious romp through statistical inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, cluster analysis, regression, principal components analysis, classification, and time series. The class was a success. Several students became very interested in machine learning techniques, and adopted them in their research. Three students now working in data analytics jobs at the FAA and Boeing report that having this class on their resume proved a significant advantage in getting those jobs.  The SimBAL project also offers opportunities for mentoring student research.  Under this grant, a total of nine students worked on the project.  The results include on-going PhD research by one student, one completed masters thesis, three completed undergraduate capstone (senior thesis) projects, and two more in progress, six REU mentorship experiences, and long-term undergraduate student research experiences for five students, all of whom are attending or who are are admitted to graduate school, and of whom two are women.
