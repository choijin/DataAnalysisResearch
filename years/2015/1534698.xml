<AbstractNarration>This ECR synthesis project will build consensus on the key attributes of high-quality math/science teacher leadership development programs. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.  The program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project objectives are to 1) review the literature on math/science teacher leadership development and descriptions of existing programs; 2) organize a symposium of knowledgeable practitioners, researchers, and policymakers to build consensus on attributes of quality programs; and 3) communicate the consensus attributes and recommendations for implementation and future work to stakeholders. The researchers argue that a workforce development systems approach  to teacher leadership development considers not only training/development but also the systems and structures that shape it, including infrastructure development, organizational development,  recruitment/retention, and  research and evaluation. Thus, using a workforce development perspective, the researchers can look at how teacher leadership development is embedded within the system in which math/science teachers collectively work, noticing where there are advances, gaps, or deficiencies.  The project will produce critical guidance for the design of teacher leadership development programs that is grounded in scholarship and exemplary practice and that represents consensus among leaders in the field.  It will help decrease fragmentation across the math/science education system and facilitate more thoughtful connected approaches to teacher leadership development.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific research questions are: 1) What patterns exist among attributes of math/science teacher leadership development programs? 2) What patterns exist in how leadership development programs define and measure program quality? 3) What evidence exists for the effectiveness of leadership development programs? The researchers will apply a coding scheme matched to the research questions and a two-coder process to analyze the information to test whether math/science teacher leadership programs predominantly focus a) on improving individual teachers? classroom practice to prepare them to serve as instructional leaders in their schools or districts and b) on developing teacher leaders (individuals) rather than building capacity for teacher leadership. They will include initially approximately 20-30 studies on this topic.</AbstractNarration>

If teacher leadership development becomes standard practice, math and science teachers would have multiple opportunities to exercise formal and informal leadership across their careers (National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality, 2010) and more fully contribute to systemic improvement efforts. With this aspiration in mind, BSCS in collaboration with the Knowles Teacher Initiative (formerly KSTF) and the Education Development Center (EDC) embarked on a project supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (ECR-1534698) to synthesize research and practice focused on math/science teacher leadership development programs. Of the 89 research abstracts and 70 program descriptions vetted, 18 research articles about programs and 15 program descriptions served as the basis for face-to-face and online discussions among leaders in math/science teacher leadership development. Through the synthesis process, four focal areas emerged as organizers for consensus statements (see below) and recommendations.  Focal Area 1: Programs and the teacher leadership development landscape  The landscape of teacher leadership development includes varied combinations of leadership roles and development opportunities nested within the larger educational system.  Formal programs are more likely to appear in research studies and evaluation reports; however, they represent only part of the broader mathematics and science teacher leadership development landscape.  Teacher leadership development, in this study, generally does not reflect the dynamic and complex nature of a teacher professional continuum.  Equitable access to teacher leadership development opportunities is an important, but understudied, dimension of teacher leader development.  Focal Area 2: Purposes of teacher leadership development programs  While to date the majority of teacher leadership development programs position teacher leaders as implementers of reforms conceived by others, teacher leaders will need multiple pathways for leadership and leadership development to advance and support their capacity to drive improvement efforts.  The use of teacher leadership models was not evident in the research or programs reviewed nor were there clearly articulated teacher leadership frameworks across research or programs.  Focal Area 3: Attributes of teacher leadership development programs  A limited number of teacher leadership development programs met criteria for inclusion in this synthesis, and those that were reviewed provided uneven descriptions of program attributes and outcomes making it difficult to aggregate findings.  Most of this study?s research and programs addressed two general categories of leadership content&mdash;leadership identity and skills&mdash;but specifics varied across individual research and programs.  Most teacher leadership development programs in this study included enhancing quality teaching through deepening pedagogical content knowledge in their designs, and many also focused on deepening discipline-specific content knowledge.  The majority of teacher leader development programs in this study served state-, district-, and/or school-level needs to improve performance in a particular content area.  Teacher leadership development programs in this study tended to be designed so that teacher leaders committed a significant amount of time toward learning, practicing, and implementing skills.  Teacher leadership development programs in this study used various designs (summer institutes, school year workshops/seminars, cohorts, professional learning communities, design cycles, and internships/fellowships) to provide time and space for teacher leaders to work with each other and their colleagues during implementation.  Most teacher leadership development programs in this study included expanding teachers? knowledge base, investigations into practice, practice with enactment, and reflection using a variety of processes.  Focal Area 4: Research on teacher leadership development programs  The research on teacher leadership development in mathematics and science that met the criteria for this study is limited.  Teacher leadership development programs draw from a limited repertoire of valid instruments to study program impacts and rely mostly on program-specific instruments and self-report surveys to measure effectiveness.  To realize the benefits of a strong teacher workforce, the STEM education community must take a systems approach to STEM teacher leadership development. We must offer formal and informal teacher leadership opportunities for growth with consideration given to where teachers are along a professional continuum as well as at multiple entry points and pathways along the continuum.
