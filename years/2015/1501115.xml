<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to bring together a group of researchers with experience in a broad array of topics in higher dimensional algebraic geometry, in order to make progress in two closely related areas: birational geometry in positive characteristics and the theory of singularities and linear series arising in the minimal model program.  While there has been a lot of recent progress in our understanding of the geometry of higher-dimensional varieties, almost all of this body of work is restricted to characteristic zero, due to the use of vanishing theorems that can fail in positive characteristic.  The first goal of this collaborative research is to build tools and a framework that would allow the main results in birational geometry to be extended to positive characteristics.  This would make systematic use of the recent techniques that have been devised to exploit the Frobenius morphism.  A second goal of the project is to further develop the study of invariants of singularities and of linear series, with an eye toward the remaining problems in the minimal model program.  There have been many recent advances in this area. In particular, a conjecture of Shokurov asserting that certain invariants of singularities (the log canonical thresholds) satisfy the so-called  ACC property has been solved by some of the PIs.  This suggests that other related but harder questions might be within reach, questions whose importance comes from the connection with one of the remaining conjectures in the minimal model program, the termination of flips. The PIs propose to attack one of these problems, predicting the ACC property of another invariant, the minimal log discrepancy.  In a separate direction, the PIs plan to undertake a systematic study of examples of linear systems on algebraic varieties that exhibit a pathological behavior from the point of view of various positivity invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last ten years have seen major breakthroughs in the study of higher-dimensional algebraic varieties, but several important problems are still open.  A central such problem is intimately related to the study of singularities and one of the goals of this project is to make progress on understanding the properties of the invariants of singularities that appear in this setting.  Another general goal of the PIs is to develop systematically the study of algebraic varieties of dimension at least 3 in positive characteristic.  A lot less is known in this setting, where new phenomena (sometimes considered pathological) arise.  The PIs expect that cross-pollination of ideas with other areas, in particular with commutative algebra, will play an important role in making progress in this direction.  Moreover, it is likely that techniques and results in this context would have many applications to other fields (for example, in arithmetic geometry).  As part of the collaborative effort, the PIs plan several events that will bring together members of the mathematical community working on related problems and also help disseminate the results and the techniques developed as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This was an FRG (Focused Research Group) grant performing basic research in mathematics, specifically in a field called algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometry of polynomials like the parabola., defined by y=x2.   Algebraic geometry is an important part of our modern secure communication infrastructure (ie, encryption) and also is used in theoretical physics.  This particular grant focused on higher dimensional algebraic geometry (so like the parabola, but involving more variables).  When studying geometry in higher dimensions, singularities are frequently unavoidable (imagine a curve that crosses over itself such as the one defined by the implicit equation y2=x3+x2).  The characteristic mentioned in the grant title refers to whether we are working in the setting of classical geometry (characteristic zero) or in a positive characteristic / clock arithmetic world (5 hours after 10 o'clock is 3 o'clock, so 5+10=3).  Geometry in this positive characteristic setting is the sort used regularly in our modern communications systems.  My portion of this FRG grant especially focused on singularities, and I also worked frequently in positive characteristic.  I particularly tried to illuminate the connections between the classical characteristic zero world and the positive characteristic setting.  These types of connections have lead to many advances in both classical and positive characteristic algebraic geometry.  For this grant we trained a new generation of algebraic geometers and increased communication between our group of algebric geometers working on related topics. To train younger algebraic geometers, we held mini-workshops, a special month at the University of Michigan where the PIs and their students had a chance to interact, a summer school and a concluding research conference.  Additionally we funded graduate student research and funded travel of both ourselves and our graduate students to disseminate our research.  We also funded the travel to invite leading researchers to visit, who helped students learn about cutting edge techniques.  I should also mention that this grant helped us develop a lot of new mathematics.  For example, we showed that singularities that arise naturally in the positive characteristic world are not as twisted in on themselves as you might first expect.  Several of the other research papers that came out this grant focused on learning how geometry and singularities change as one deforms your object (for exmaple changing the coefficients deforms a parabola, y=1.1*x2).  We showed that certain limitations on the deformation of singularities imply other unexpected restrictions on what can result.
