<AbstractNarration>NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;GEOGRAPHY SPATIAL SCIENCES (GSS) PROGRAM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support efforts to bring together scholars from around the world for two mobility and movement-related conferences at the University of Texas-Austin and Ohio State University.  NSF support will facilitate the participation of up to 50 scholars and graduate students from the U.S. and other countries.  The two conferences are aimed at stimulating research that draws from research communities that focus on human mobility and animal movement ecology.  These two communities previously have not interacted extensively, so the conferences are expected to facilitate interactions across the research domains to enhance understanding of frameworks, approaches, and methods that are useful in studying varied complex, dynamic, spatiotemporal systems.  The conferences will provide opportunities to share latest research and advance knowledge about understanding spatial behaviors and integrating research opportunities between the two domains.  The conferences will stimulate research that ranges across a broad range of topics, including disease spread; social networks; information diffusion and its impacts on privacy and identity; knowledge transfer, and urban, social, and ecosystem dynamics.  They also will facilitate scientific collaboration among young, underrepresented researchers who may not ordinarily have such networking opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These conferences will bring together a unique blend of scholars from the human mobility community, such as transportation, urban science, sociology, and public health and those researchers associated with movement ecology, a nascent but growing research area in the ecological sciences.  The conferences will take place at a time when scientific communities are just beginning to focus on movement and interactions motivated by advances in location-aware technologies and high spatial resolution global datasets.  The first conference will focus on measuring and analyzing interactions among mobile entities.  The second conference will focus on analyzing mobility data in the geographic context.  The events will include a balanced mix of keynote addresses from top scholars in the fields, interdisciplinary research presentations to facilitate interactions amongst the diverse set of scientists, and breakout group activities to delve deeper into specific topical areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent years, the development and deployment of location-aware technologies, such as global positioning system (GPS) receivers and mobile telephones and low-cost sensors, is creating a data-driven revolution in scientific fields concerned with human mobility and animal movement.  However, these revolutions are occurring independently.  Greater integration between these fields can generate intellectual synergies that advance the scientific frontiers in understanding movement phenomena.  It can also have broader societal impacts through better understanding, planning and management of systems such as ecosystems and cities that shape and are shaped by movement.  We held two workshops with the intent of bringing animal movement and human mobility researchers together to explore the possibilities for an integrated science of movement:    Workshop 1: Measuring and analyzing interactions among mobile entities. University of Texas-Austin, 10-11 November 2016   Workshop 2: Analyzing moving entities within geographic context.   The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, 11-12 May 2017.    These workshops attracted approximately 30 participants each, with a nearly equal mix of animal movement and human mobility researchers, and also students, early career scholars and senior scholars.  We are encouraged that there is sufficient common ground for an interdisciplinary science of movement.  However, the following issues/research questions should be addressed for this interdisciplinary science to progress:  Same problem, different approaches.  Animal movement ecologists follow a bottom-up approach that starts with movement to infer activities, while human mobility researchers follow a top-down approach that starts with activities to infer movement.  There is value in both approaches; a key research frontier is integrating these approaches into a common conceptual framework.   The challenge of big but thin data.  In both animal and human domains, data was historically scarce but richly attributed, favoring careful theory construction. New location-aware technologies are generating data that is plentiful but thinly attributed, favoring pattern description and prediction over theories.  How can researchers use these new data sources to develop behavioral theories?  Do we need a grand theory of movement?  Some animal ecologists contend there are too many species and for a grand theory; some human mobility researchers contend there are too many types of travel for an overall theory.  A crucial question is the possibility and utility of a grand theory of movement and whether this is necessary for a new interdisciplinary science of movement.  The role of quasi and natural experiments.    In both animal and human domains, new data technologies allow ongoing, persistent observation of movement patterns.  Persistent observation creates possibilities for natural and quasi experimental designs in anticipation (prospective) or response (retrospective) to real-world changes or events.  These experimental approaches allow stronger causality claims.        Treatment of geographic space.  Human mobility researchers tend to represent geography using abstract space (focusing on track geometry) or networks (focusing on network routes and flows).  In contrast, animal movement ecologists place a greater emphasis on geographic context such as habitats and land cover.  These differences results from the respective intellectual histories of the two fields; this may be changing as high-resolution, detailed geographic data are increasingly available for natural and built environments.        Normative versus positive theory.  In animal movement ecology, normative theory is easier and useful than positive theory since these researchers rarely have access to measures of an animal's preferences, intents and states of mind.  Normative theory may also be a good descriptor of animal movement due to evolutionary pressures.  In contrast, normative theories of human mobility are out of favor compared to positive theory since evidence suggests humans rarely optimize.        Other fields?   Anthropologists can help bridge the gap between human mobility analysis and animal movement ecology since they work within a normative, evolutionary framework with rich depictions of geography, but are concerned with the relationships between location and movement.Computational geometers and computer scientists can help inform new new algorithmic methods for processing movement data.     Focus: Individual or collective?  Do we care about characterizing individual movement to a high degree, or collective patterns?  Theoretically, both human and animal researchers are concerned with individuals.  However, from a pragmatic perspective, understanding collective movement patterns is easier and collective movement has bigger impacts on broader systems such as ecosystems and cities.    Different scales of collective movement.   Animal movement ecologists tend to focus on collective behaviors such as flocking and schooling, while human mobility analysts tend to treat collective movement at broader scales such as traffic patterns and origin-destination flows.  Integrating ancillary data.   Sensor data such as accelerometers (measuring activity levels) or temperature and humidity sensors are increasingly available in conjunction with movement data available from location-aware technologies.  How can these data be leveraged to understand the physiological and environmental context of movement?     Relationships to grand challenges.  To establish the importance of the new interdisciplinary science, we must articulate the contributions to movement science to grand societal challenges such as sustainability, resilience and social equity.
