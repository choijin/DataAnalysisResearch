<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the 2015 Maine-Québec Number Theory Conference, taking place on October 3-4, 2015 at the University of Maine.  This is an annual conference, held at Laval University in Québec in even years, and at the University of Maine in odd years. By providing a forum for number theorists from New England, Québec, and beyond, it promotes interaction and collaboration between Canadian and American mathematics researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference includes approximately thirty lectures addressing recent progress in different areas of number theory. The small scale of the meeting (with roughly 65 attendees) makes this a good opportunity for graduate students and young mathematicians to interact with leading researchers.  This award also provides travel support for US-based participants to attend the 2016 meeting in Québec. The conference website has more information, including recent programs and participant lists: &lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.umaine.edu/numbertheory/mainequebec.html</AbstractNarration>
