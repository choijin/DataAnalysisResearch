<AbstractNarration>PI: Lee, Gabsang &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1547515 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in stem cell biology hold great potential in regenerative medicine. To realize the therapeutic promise of stem cells, approach to realize high-quality and high-precision culture system is essential. The investigator proposes an innovative approach of optical control of stem cell behaviors through blue light illumination. If successful the approach will be expanded to other stem cell applications by controlling multiple signaling pathways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current stem cell culture systems include different growth factors, but their uneven distribution in the media (lack of spatial control), and gradually decreased activity due to temporal-instability, often cause significant problems in a large-scale stem cell biomanufacturing. To address this problem, the investigator proposes photo-inducible modulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in human pluripotent stem cells and muscle stem cells, using an innovative optically controlled fibrobast growth factor receptor (OptoFGFR) system allowing precise control of FGF signaling. The proposed investigation will accelerate the in vitro and in vivo spatio-temporal modulation of stem cells, and will be the first example of the 'opto-signaling' application in stem cell biology with potential translational characteristics. More importantly, the OptoFGFR system will be expanded to other signaling pathways such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF, and nerve growth factor (NGF), and if successful the approach could be useful for multiple human diseases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Stem cell fate is largely determined by a cell-signaling network and can be controlled by the supplementation of exogenous recombinant proteins; this, however, may cause heterogeneous and unsynchronized signaling due to the uneven distribution of recombinant proteins. Such issues are closely associated with the spontaneous differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which lead to a continuing loss of pluripotency. We developed a novelhPSC culture system to use optical stimulation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway, without the daily supplementation of recombinant FGF2 protein, a key molecule for their stemness. The optically maintained hPSCs in multiple passages have similar cellular and molecular profiles to those cultured with FGF2 protein, and display differentiation capabilities into three germ layers. These data demonstrate that optical stimulation of the FGF signaling pathway is sufficient to maintain hPSCs, providing proof-of-concept that the optical control of signaling pathways can be applied to human stem cells.      Our study show the promises that optical modulation of signaling pathways in human stem cells will  transform the current culture system, into a next-generation level system, allowing a spatiotemporally precise optical control of stem cell behaviors, toward qualitatively and quantitatively innovative biomanufacturing of human stem cells for future cell replacement approaches.
