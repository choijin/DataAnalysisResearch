<AbstractNarration>August 11, 2015 is the 50th Anniversary commemoration of the Watts Riots.  The commemoration will include a series of media, educational and community-based programs that highlight issues relating to social justice, community policing, and group relations.  With the heightened sense of group identity through the community focus on the Watts commemoration as well as other incidents, one can survey the population of Los Angeles to examine attitudes to race, ethnicity, and in-group vs. out-group.  The questions along with survey experiments will provide us with a better understanding of the lasting impact of the riots as well as impact of other incidents that have occurred throughout the past year.  The finidngs can be used to develop policy and programming recommendations for the L.A. Human Relations Commission, community partners, city council, and the major's office.  They findings could also be relevant for other communities with heightened intergroup tensions.  This includes areas where community and law enforcement controversies have raged, such as Baltimore, Ferguson, and Charleston.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This projects holds promise for political scientists and social psychologists interested in questions related to particularistic and superordinate identities.  First, the Los Angeles focus regarding the Watts anniversiary allows for understanding of whether and how random exposure to particularistic and/or superordinate identity cues against a "real world" backdrop of increased public consideration of intergroup boundaries produces results different from what scholars have disccovered in using identity primes in the lab or survey-based studies outside of areas such as this one.  Second, the survey instrument enables this project to examine the effects of identity priming on a wider array of outcome meaures than imployed in political science to date.  Instead of focusing just on future political behavior such as voting, demonstrating, etc. the focus is broaden to focus on neighborhood, social network, policing, mental health-related issues, etc.  This broader focus enables broader insights into identity-based effects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The major activities undertaken in this project included use of an NSF RAPID grant to conduct a survey experiment of Los Angeles-area residents to develop a series of indicators of effectiveness of group inter-relations statements in promoting positive group outcomes (as indicated in survey responses). We conducted a randomized experiment using inter-group relations statements as a way to determine which statements might improve perceptions of commonality across racial and ethnic groups. Statistical results suggest that randomized exposure to a common in-group identity cue across different racial and ethnic groups increase self-reported perceptions of group commonality, especially for Latino and Anglo respondents. Findings from survey experiment have been summarized in a report presented to the City of Los Angeles Human Relations Commission as well as city council members and staff. These findings will work to reinforce and refine existing and future human relations commission strategies. The project has enabled us to continue a close working relationship with the City Human Relations Commission. This has increased our professional acumen for conducting research in this topical area.   Insights generated by the project will help develop the literature on inter-group relations, government services, and group identity across multiple disciplines, including political science, sociology, and social psychology.
