<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the creation of commercial viability for 3-D printing unique ceramic structures by transforming 3-D printing of advanced ceramics into mass-production additive manufacturing.  This will be a new capability for the US. The 3-D structures being considered can't be easily made with traditional manufacturing techniques but have significant advantages over traditionally manufactured geometries. If 3-D printed structures could be manufactured economically, the societal impact could be tremendous ranging from creation of hundreds of US manufacturing jobs to reduction in CO2 emissions. Commercially viable products that can improve existing markets and enable new markets are realistic expectations. Structures for improved filtration, catalytic production of clean fuels, H2 reformers, emission controls for stationary fuel cells, and CO2 sequestration have been inspired by Other Equipment Manufacturers and are already being jointly developed as a result of Phase I progress. Interestingly, these products and more could be produced from the same product lines just by changing a computer program. This great efficiency of infrastructure is a fortunate trait of additive manufacturing. In short, this project will position Robocasting Enterprises as a US exporter into world-wide markets for economic and societal benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is based on foundational technology called robocasting for 3-D printing ceramic materials.  Robocasting is an additive technique demonstrated to be useful for rapid fabrication of ceramics into advanced lattice structures for enhanced filtration and catalytic performance.  However, robocast products have been largely limited to products with dimensions less than 2 inches because of problems related to cracking. The goal of this project is to make additive manufacturing much more commercially viable for ceramics by: (a)  overcoming the technical challenges for robocasting large ceramic parts and; (b) designing and implementing a scaled-up manufacturing line commercially competitive with traditional manufacturing processes and production from low-wage countries. To achieve these goals; materials, processes, and equipment improvements are required.  Developments will include:  1) material innovations to reduce cracking in large ceramic bodies; 2) processing innovations to reduce cracking in large ceramic bodies; 3) equipment and automation innovations to increase production rates. At the end of Phase II it is anticipated that rapid manufacturing of large (i.e., 5-10 inch) advanced ceramic lattice structures will be demonstrated to be commercially viable and penetration into several markets will be significant.  The technology will be perfectly poised for investment from larger companies and Phase III growth.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to transform the additive-manufacturing process of robocasting ceramics into a manufacturing method capable of mass-production that could economically produce ceramic products with beneficial structures that were previously unobtainable (i.e., parts with a dimensions in the 3 to 10 inch range).  The robocasting process is an extrusion-based 3D printing technique that uses a ceramic paste as its feedstock.  It is similar to traditional ceramic fabrication techniques in that a liquid / ceramic particle mixture is used as the feedstock followed by fabrication of a shape, followed by drying and heat treatment.  The process is near-net-shape but not near-net-size.  There is extensive particle movement, shrinkage and densification from start to finished part.  As such, it can be extremely difficult to maintain the desired shape and dimensional tolerance of large components in a manufacturing setting.   At the beginning of this effort the state-of-the-art for commercialization of robocast parts was limited to parts with dimensions on the order of 2 inches because drying cracks often made a component unusable.  Overcoming this limitation in a rapid-production setting was critical for advancing the utility of robocasting for production of larger parts.  The approach was to develop and demonstrate a production line that utilized additive manufacturing via a large-scale robocasting technology.  Milestones included:  - scaled-up batching to at least 15L of feedstock at a time;  - development of a large-scale platform and controls for parallel robocasting that could print at least 2L of feedstock per hour;  - incorporation of continuous drying and pusher-plate sintering that could keep up with 15L worth of product per day; and,  - demonstration of an economy-of-scale price reduction.  To successfully implement such a production line appropriate modifications and advances were necessary for equipment, materials, and processes.  It was determined that  planetary mixing used in conjunction with rheological modifying additives was the preferred method more scaling-up the batch size of the robocasting feedstock.  While the extrusion-based robocasting technique is very fast relative to other additive-manufacturing techniques for ceramics it is still slow and not cost competitive when compared to traditional manufacturing techniques.  For this reason, one milestone for this project was to develop and demonstrate a robocasting platform that could print several large parts simultaneously in parallel.  Furthermore, in order to keep up with the rest of the production line the platform had to be able to print at least 2L of feedstock per hour.  A build envelope with the capability to print twelve 4-inch parts simultaneously or four 12-inches parts simultaneously was needed.  The large-scale robocasting platform that was designed, built, and demonstrated had 12 extruders assembled in parallel on a three-axis CNC platform.   The electrical/mechanical design for the customized CNC platform required movement of a 48? L x 12? D table with heavy-duty ball-screw actuators that provided 16 inches of travel.  Proprietary CAD/CAM software used to control the robocasting platform and build parts had to be developed in-house.  Because ceramic-based feedstocks have a consistency similar to toothpaste it is extremely difficult to have clean and precise starts and stops during the extrusion process.  Therefore, typical toolpaths that are created for 3D printing are not very useful for the robocasting technique in which starts and stops should be minimized.  Finally, to round out the production line a custom continuous pusher-plate sintering furnace with a pre-chamber dryer was designed, built, and demonstrated to have a daily capacity to densify all the product that could be printed with 15L of feedstock.  Ultimately, the production line was demonstrated to have the capability to produce thousands of parts with an economy-of-scale and showing that the robocasting technology for additive manufacturing of ceramics and composites is amenable to scale-up and mass production.  A lattice structure that is 89mm in diameter and sold 2,000 units at a time was used as an example.  At the beginning of this project this part could only be 3D printed with robocasting one at-a-time using an experimental system.

The successful implementation of large-scale robocasting and the associated material developments have also lead to state-of-the-art capabilities for several other unforeseen materials and custom products.  The attached photos demonstrate some new-found capabilities for additive manufacturing of large ceramic parts via robocasting technology.  Large printed products of alumina, aluminosilicates, mullite, nickel-zirconia composites, silica, silicon carbide, zeolite, zirconia-toughened alumina, and zirconia-toughened mullite have been produced with dimensions larger than 3 inches and up to 10 inches.  These same products and material systems would have been extremely difficult to robocast into viable products before this project began.
