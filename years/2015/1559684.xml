<AbstractNarration>Scientific interest in infrastructure has tried to understand the mechanical, human, and natural forces that impact the flow of information and services. These infrastructures have become increasingly dependent on the global movement of goods and peoples. The global systems that deliver these resources, however, are inevitably funneled through bottlenecks or "chokepoints", such as canals, tunnels, maritime straights, border crossings, etc. Constricting the flow of materials and people, such chokepoints are both vital to national and economic interests, and uniquely vulnerable, dynamic, and prone to disturbances. Not surprisingly, governments, corporations, and communities have taken a keen interest in securing and regulating these sites. Little is known, however, about how these passageways actually work. This collaborative project seeks to explore how local communities, environments, and infrastructures interact to allow passage through these sites (or not), as well how ordinary (and sometimes extraordinary) events at chokepoints affect economic systems, security, and lives well beyond these points of passage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christopher Middleton and Gabriela Valdivia of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Ashley Carse of Vanderbilt University, Jatin Dua of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Elizabeth Dunn of Indiana University, and Jason Cons of the University of Texas at Austin, will explore six chokepoints around the world. Each member of the team is an expert in their region of study. Each will focus on a particular kind of chokepoint. These include: the Panama Canal, a tunnel in Russia, a land bridge in India, an oil-refinery and pipelines in Ecuador, a network of rivers in Bangladesh, and a maritime strait leading into the Red Sea. The researchers will utilize extensive interviews, observation, and first-person engagement with officials, workers, and chokepoint residents in order to understand the distinctly human dimensions of these transit zones. Bringing together data from around the world, this study will provide a strategic reassessment of the global movement of goods, information, and people by examining these vital and dynamic points of national and world interest. The results will speak directly to current concerns over migration, security, and economic wellbeing.  In doing so, this project promises to alter the ways governments, industries, and others understand and engage with these critical transit points of the world today.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report covers one of six linked ethnographic studies that collaboratively project explore nodes of vulnerability&mdash;chokepoints&mdash;in networks of global mobility and trade. This specific part of the study investigated tensions emerging around climate change and regional economic integration in Bangladesh?s southwestern delta region. The research used ethnographic methods was carried out over 10 weeks of fieldwork. It asks how competing visions of the future are worked out in the present in the delta region. This study revealed critical dynamics that pose immediate challenges to a region that is both emerging as an engine for Bangladesh?s growth and is regularly described as the most climate vulnerable place in the world.  The project traced four dynamics:  1)    Climate Security: A wave of new development projects have emerged in the region that seek to provide people with the tools to remain in place and not have to migrate in the face of climate perturbations. An often-stated goal of these projects is to stem potential regional instability caused by mass climate-induced displacement. Project findings suggest that while these development projects experiment with technologies that might help people stay in place, they are unequally distributed among vulnerable populations in the delta and not deployed at a scale that would have any significant impact in helping stem large-scale migration.  2)    Conservation: In the past decade, a suit of conservation programs have emerged in and around the Sundarbans, the world?s largest mangrove forest that straddles the India-Bangladesh border and sits at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal. These programs seek to stem anthropogenic change in the mangroves&mdash;which are both a critical wildlife habitat and a buffer-zone protecting cities in the delta from cyclones&mdash;by limiting small-scale resource extraction from inside the forest. Project findings indicate that these programs do little, however, to offer alternative livelihoods for fishermen and small-scale agriculturalists who often rely on resources from within the mangroves for their livings. This produces a situation where fisher and community lives are systematically criminalized and devalued.  3)    Waterway Transportation and Navigation: Mongla Port is Bangladesh?s second largest port and a critical site for regional economic integration. In the past decade, the number of ships using Mongla?s Port Authority has increased by 500% and is expected to continue to grow. Transportation to the port through the Sundarbans and from the port to the rest of the country via inland waterways relies on maintaining open and clear shipping channels. Project findings indicate that this has proved increasingly difficult as decreased downstream river flows, due in part to upstream damming in India, has meant that such channels are silting at increasingly rapid rates. This poses challenges to dredging teams in both keeping critical shipping lanes open and managing the sheer volume of silt dredged from the waterways. It further raises questions about the long-term viability of Mongla Port.  4)    Industrialization: A growing industrial corridor near Mongla Port signals the import of the region to national economic growth.
