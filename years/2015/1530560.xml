<AbstractNarration>1530560&lt;br/&gt;Shugar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding from this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant will enable an early career investigator to acquire and deploy a novel remotely operated/autonomous shallow water bathymetric mapping system for hydrographic surveying in rivers, lakes and remote locations inaccessible to traditional survey vessels.  The unmanned surface vessel (USV) is manufactured by Teledyne, is 1.8 m long, has twin props and will be outfitted with a multibeam sonar, a real-time kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver and an inertial measurement unit (IMU).  The operating system will include survey planning and data analysis software.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USV as equipped offers the capability to map bathymetry with cm-scale resolution especially in shallow water systems where traditional survey vessels cannot operate (e.g. proglacial lakes, shallow inlets, estuaries and proglacial rivers).  By using repeat mapping over time the investigator will gain an advanced understanding of fluvial sediment transport, bedform and delta evolution in environments that impact human populations.   Many of the investigators mapping targets have never before been surveyed so the knowledge gained has the potential to be transformative and therefore supports NSF mission of promoting the progress of science.    Undergraduates at this predominantly undergraduate university will be engaged in experiential field mapping using the USV, increasing employability in fields that routinely engage in hydrographic surveying and thus promoting the national welfare.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF MRI grant allowed us to acquire a cutting edge multibeam sonar system for high-resolution mapping of shallow-water (&lt;100m) lake, river, and ocean bottom environments. The sonar is mounted in an Unmanned Surface Vessel (a drone boat), which allows personnel operating the equipment to be out of harm's way when surveying dangerous environments such as in glacial lakes.

We have successfully used the instruments in a variety of environments, including a fjord in southeast Alaska, proglacial lakes in Yukon and British Columbia, a shallow river in Washington, and the Puget Sound.

Since the USV is best suited for mapping relatively small areas, we tied the data collection to that of a larger vessel, but which could not map in as shallow water as the USV could.
