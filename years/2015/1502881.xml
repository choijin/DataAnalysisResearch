<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Khrystyna Serhiyenko is "Maximal Green Sequences." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California-Berkeley, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Lauren Williams.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project investigated and established various connections between the representation theory of associative algebras and the combinatorics of cluster algebras, certain commutative rings that are related to many areas of mathematics and theoretical physics.   It involved the study of maximal green sequences for different types of quivers.  A major achievement is the proof of the conjecture that coordinate rings of Schubert varieties have a cluster algebra structure governed by the combinatorics of plabic graphs.  Moreover, another result of the award implies that these cluster algebras are well-behaved. In particular, they have a basis of theta functions because the corresponding quivers admit a green-to-red sequence.  The PI also initiated the search for longest and shortest maximal green sequences, and together with her collaborators she built explicit sequences of minimal length for quivers coming from triangulation of polygons, annuli, and punctured disks.    The second important aspect of the project dealt with certain combinatorial objects called friezes.  It established a novel relationship between SL_k friezes, Grassmannian cluster algebras, and their categorification in terms of representation theory, which offers significant potential for further research.   In addition, it introduced and studied the mutation operation on friezes of types A and D that comes from the analogous operation on the level of cluster algebras.  Finally, the PI worked on the development of the representation theory of cluster-tilted algebras and solved important questions about local slices.  During Spring 2016-Spring 2019, the PI organized Berkeley Combinatorics Seminar, where a large portion of the audience and the speakers were graduate students and postdocs.  She also gave interactive lectures to K-12 and undergraduate students on the combinatorics of cluster algebras, exposing young people to mathematics outside the standard curriculum and research.
