<AbstractNarration>Complex mission, infrastructure and safety-critical systems are shifting away from traditional contract mechanisms of fixed-price followed by the purchase of support. Newer performance-based contracts are growing in popularity for governmental and non-governmental acquisitions of critical systems, such as for energy, defense, transportation and healthcare. These contracts allow the customer to buy the system performance rather than to purchase the product itself, or to buy availability rather than to pay for maintenance.  Performance contracts are not warranties, lease agreements, or maintenance contracts, which are all break-fix guarantees; rather, these contracts are highly quantified "satisfaction guaranteed" contracts where "satisfaction" is a combination of outcomes received from the product, usually articulated as a time (e.g., operational availability), usage measure (e.g., miles), or energy-based availability.  Performance-based contracts (also called outcome-based contracts) can take different forms where the particular performance that the contract specifies distinguishes the contract mechanism, e.g., performance-based logistics (PBL), public-private partnerships (PPPs), and power purchase agreements (PPAs).  Unfortunately, the contract design itself is almost always performed separate from the engineering design process and provided as a requirement to the engineering design process.  This award supports fundamental research towards the integration of the contract and system design for systems that are subject to performance-based contracts.  Such an integrated approach has clear societal benefits since contract failure may mean hundreds of millions of dollars spent by the public for either no outcome or inadequate outcome, or result in the contractor being driven out of business, which can lead to disaster for all parties involved including the public.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research approaches contract design as a system design problem where the process of designing contractual terms that address performance metrics, the payment model, and performance assessment, represents a multidisciplinary design process that can be integrated into the broader engineering design process. The development of a new methodology will be explored that uses the customer and contractor goals as an input for determining the contractual and engineering design terms using principal-agent and contract theory to factor in incentives and information asymmetry.  As a concrete case study, the research team will study PPA contracts for wind farms with multiple design parameters within a stochastic energy-price environment and uncertain wind profile.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Contract design for performance-based contracts is generally performed separate from the engineering design process and provided as a requirement to the engineering design process.  This project performed fundamental research on the integration of the contract and system design for systems that are managed under performance- or outcome-based contracts.  This project approached contract design as a system design problem where the process of designing contractual terms that address performance metrics, the payment model, and performance assessment, represents a multidisciplinary design process that can be integrated into the broader engineering design process.  Product-service systems (PSSs) are increasingly being provided and managed via outcome-based contracts in which the customer purchases the performance of the product (rather than purchasing the product and/or purchasing specific product support activities). For complex safety, mission, and infrastructure critical systems, when the outcome-based contract becomes a competition between two parties, there is a significant risk that either the customer overpays (and/or does not get the performance they desire) or the contractor is driven out of business - if this is the case, and then both sides lose.  To design systems that can succeed under these types of contracts, a new design paradigm in which engineering and contract design are integrated is needed.  This project developed the concept of contract engineering.  Classically, contract/firm theory uses theoretical principles to design structures in which the desired system-level value of outcomes can be obtained, even with large uncertainties in the outcome.  Contrary to the abstract approach of contract theory, contract engineering is a bottom-up modeling and valuation study of engineering systems and their performance as outcome in the context of given contracts (defined by incentives, payment plan, information, and metrics) as a larger multi-disciplinary (financial, reliability, physical) system. By building an integrated model, stakeholders can study the impact of each element of a contract based on different aspects of design and operational decision making.  Two contract engineering case studies were performed to develop this new paradigm.  The first case study was for a torpedo enterprise.  This case study used an affine controller model of an availability contract.   In this case study the system availability and several cost factors were chosen as the parameters that the controller needs to control.  The demand distribution was derived from the reliability of the parts and the controller action orders new parts to support maintenance.  Control action is defined as an affine function in which we are using previous demands to estimate the new order.  In this case, the inventory of torpedoes is managed by a contractor under an availability-based (system-level PBL) contract.  Exercises and deployment require constant servicing of the torpedoes, and during testing, if torpedoes are found to be defective, a complete torpedo is replaced from inventory by the supply contractor. Following testing, the torpedoes are returned to the fleet for use.  When the torpedoes are tested, if they are found to be defective, they are replaced from inventory and the inventory needs to be replenished by the supply contractor.  The case study determined the best availability assessment interval, i.e., the interval that minimizes the total cost of the system and concurrently guarantees that inventory (materiel) availability requirements are met.  We found that the optimal availability assessment interval in the case of low assessment cost saves between 5-8% of the total operation cost to the customer comparing to a quarterly assessment.  In fact, even when there is a complete lack of information about contractor?s cost structure and objectives, and without requiring detailed requirements, the customer can still design a contract that minimizes the total life-cycle cost.    In the second case study, the pricing and ratepayer impact of renewable energy credits was determined.  Price and risk for renewable energy are often balanced using Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). PPAs contain clauses that require the purchase and sale of the energy to fall within contract-specified limits. The challenge is that the price schedule in a PPA is determined using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) provided by the Seller, but the energy delivery limits imposed by the PPA impact the LCOE.  A new cost model was developed to determine the LCOE under a PPA contract and that model was applied to the Maryland ORECs in this grant.  Our analysis of the Maryland ORECs indicated that the OREC price of $131.93/MWh for the combined awards to two wind farms was too low.  Depending on assumptions about how power generated above the OREC defined 2.5% residential consumption cutout can be sold, the price should have been $135.36-$145.02/MWh.  Because of this, Maryland could award more ORECs.  Finally, we were able to provide general policy suggestions for future REC pricing and ratepayer impact based on the results.
