<AbstractNarration>This award supports a dissertation project focused on traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) held by people who live and work along the Yukon River in Alaska.  The researcher is interested in how the knowledge held by local people can improve the decision of fisheries managers.  The project will explore how Federal and State water managers could make better-informed, more relevant management decisions if they included the traditional ecological knowledge held by people who live and subsist along the Yukon River.   The researcher makes a strong argument that this research is an investigation of one of the leading Tribal priorities in the State of Alaska and  that research on indigenous knowledge of fisheries and fish resources could be critical an understanding of the sustainability of livelihoods and lives of not only indigenous populations but all peoples in Alaska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CoPI, student researcher, will do ethnographic research through interviews, participant observations, and open-ended survey methods to gather data on traditional ecological knowledge and local environmental knowledge in three Yukon River Communities.  In addition to exploring the TEK aspect of the research, the project will collect data that will feed into the development of a decision-based support tool and mobile cell phone application (App) that can be used to communicate information among fishers and to resource managers.  In addition, as an indigenous person from a non-Alaskan Tribe, the student researcher has the potential to provide non-local indigenous insight into the issue of fisheries management along the Yukon, and as such,  the project not only adds to our understanding of the application of TEK to environmental management but has the potential to add a decolonized methodology for social science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to identify gaps in communication and working relationships between Alaska Native Fishers and Alaska Department of Fish &amp; Game concerning management of king salmon fish species of the Yukon River.  Forty-eight interviews were conducted with Indigenous Fishers and community members in villages along the Yukon River about their experience and response to management methods.  As a result, findings indicate a loss of cultural and traditional knowledge for Alaskan Natives but specifically the loss of Indigenous Fishers Knowledge is being lost.  As king salmon fishing is limited, the access to interact with this resource and use traditional methods and knowledge is also limited.  As fishing regulation is implemented by Alaska Fish and Game this negatively affects traditional fishing methods for king salmon.  Regulation of king salmon fishing has negative implementations for intergenerational knowledge transmission of Alaska Native Fishers Knowledge to younger generations that then affects culture and connection with the resource.  This project did not find a solution to the problem but did identify that the current methods used to incorporate or capture Indigenous Fishers Knowledge are flawed.  This project suggests, based on interviews and observations, that tactics and methods from participatory mapping should be utilized to overcome this flaw.  This would not only empower Indigenous fishers and tap into their local knowledge but also utilize their Indigenous Fishers Knowledge along with western science methods of data collection.  This project shines a light on areas where the managing entities are negatively impacting traditional knowledge and cultural systems surrounding king salmon.  As a result of this project, a collection of anonymous interviews will be archived with participating tribal entities and a data archive.
