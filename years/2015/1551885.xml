<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to allow students from U.S. universities to participate in the fourteenth meeting of the International Symposium on Ultrafast Intense Laser Science (ISUILS14), to be held on December 9-13, 2015, in Kauai, Hawaii. This Symposium is held in the United States one out of every five years, and offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists from across the United States and the broader international community.  The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in this subdiscipline (atomic, molecular, and optical physics) acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Symposium is on a topic that is receiving particular emphasis this year because of a number of reports, such as (1) "Optics and Photonics: Essential Technologies for Our Nation," from the National Research Council, (2) "Fast-Track Action Committee on Optics and Photonics: Building a Brighter Future with Optics and Photonics," from the National Science and Technology Council, and (3) "Optics and Photonics: Transformative Research Opportunities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences," from the NSF Mathematics and Physical Sciences Advisory Committee. It is also a special year for this topic because 2015 has been designated the International Year of Light by the United Nations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Project Goals:  This award provides travel support for graduate students and postdocs who are US citizens or permanent residents to attend and deliver a poster presentation at the fourteenth meeting of the International Symposium on Ultrafast Intense Laser Science (ISUILS14).  ISUILS is an interdisciplinary, discussion-oriented symposium focusing on current and emerging topics in the area of ultrafast, intense laser science.  Oral presentations are 20 &ndash; 30 min in length and given by invited speakers who are experts in the field.  Each session has a knowledgeable discussion leader whose job is (1) to introduce each talk, providing sufficient background to make the ideas of the session accessible to all attendees and (2) moderates the 40-50 min post-talk discussion, encouraging discourse on the most important and controversial issues raised in the talks.  Lively poster sessions of contributed presentations are another hallmark of ISUILS.  Professionals and students alike can present their most resent results at these sessions.  Young investigators, students, postdocs and assistant professors are eligible to when awards for the best poster presentations.  Finally, the annual young researchers award is another way to encourage and reward participation in this field.   All supported students were encouraged by their participation and inspired to pursue research careers in this subfield.
