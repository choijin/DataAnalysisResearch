<AbstractNarration>This interdisciplinary research project will examine how native and non-native speakers of English adapt to accents, linguistic knowledge, and communication practices that may differ markedly from their own in the context of a large public university.  The project will explore the nature of communications in college classrooms, where much of the instruction (particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields) is provided by instructors who are not native speakers of English.  The project will enhance understanding of basic language representations, processing, and use by native and non-native speakers of English engaged in social interaction.  The project will generate new information and insights regarding the flexible adaptive processes that underlie human communication and language development by addressing issues associated with pronunciation by non-native speakers as well as the nature of mutual intelligibility and adaptation on the part of both native and non-native speakers of a language. The project will inform efforts to facilitate communication between native and non-native speakers of English.  Project findings will be useful for those engaged in developing and implementing programs to improve communications skills of those who will serve as instructors, and they may help improve capabilities of students to better understand those whose native languages differ from their own, thereby improving the students' academic success and preparation to participate in the modern workforce.  While an immediate aim is to enhance communication in the college classroom, project findings will be applicable to any situation in which cross-cultural communication is crucial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will conduct a longitudinal study involving approximately 150 international students newly arrived in the United States and more than 1,000 native-English-speaking American undergraduates.  The project will be grounded in a theoretical framework that views successful communication as fundamentally collaborative.  The goal is to measure, track, and improve not only the international teaching assistants' developing communication skills in English, but also the undergraduates' understanding of and adaptations to foreign-accented English as well as their ability to learn to transfer their experience of one accent to another.  Reflecting the composition of international graduate students at U.S. universities, over half of the international teaching assistants in the study will be native speakers of Chinese, with the rest being native speakers of Korean, Russian, and other Asian and European languages. Multiple methods of analysis will include ethnographic observations and interviews, psycholinguistic and dialog experiments, linguistic analyses of spontaneous and elicited speech, electrophysiology studies of perception, eye tracking studies of language processing, and surveys.  Data will be collected from the same individuals at multiple timescales (over conversations, class sessions, semesters, and international teaching assistants' first two years in the U.S.) and at multiple levels (from pronunciation and perception of phonetic segments, to use of vocabulary and syntax, to discourse cues and strategies, to communicative norms, preferences, and attitudes).  Systematic comparisons will be made in order to learn which kinds of experiences and interactions can lead to enhanced communication between native and non-native English speakers.  The data resulting from this project will provide new opportunities for scientists to examine long-term effects in foreign language learning, language processing, and the development of communicative strategies.  This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.</AbstractNarration>

Methods included longitudinal testing and recordings, surveys, linguistic analyses, behavioral and eye tracking experiments, and ethnographic observations. The project examined (1) the English language development of over 100 non-native-English-speaking ITAs from STEM fields over their first two years in the U.S., (2) the ability of undergraduates who are native speakers of English to adapt to and understand the foreign-accented speech of ITAs, and (3) the comprehension, production, use, and cognitive representation of communicative cues in both native and non-native speakers of English.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The project yielded basic knowledge about speech perception and production, as well as about phonetic categories and lexical representations (held by both native and non-native English speakers) and the processes by which perception adapts to or accommodates foreign accents. Research products and findings are publicly available at &nbsp;<a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ita-grant/">https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ita-grant/</a>, with speech recordings archived at&nbsp;<a href="https://commons.library.stonybrook.edu/language-adaptation/">https://commons.library.stonybrook.edu/language-adaptation/</a>. Available data include ethnographic transcripts as well over 100 hours of recordings of words read aloud, responses to scripted questions, and spontaneous speech in Mandarin and 17 other languages, sampled repeatedly over two years from 68 Mandarin speakers of English and from 46 speakers of other native languages. To our knowledge, this corpus is the only one of its kind. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p> <p>The project addressed IBSS Program criteria, with an interdisciplinary team that integrated research and training in laboratory and statistical methods, ethnography, surveys, and linguistic analysis. Graduate and undergraduate students and faculty from Psychology, Linguistics, Sociology, and Asian &amp; Asian-American Studies gained experience with mixed methods, to converge on an important human challenge, cross-linguistic communication. Halfway through the project, a teacher of English as a second language was recruited to collaborate on a successful intervention. Over half of team members were themselves ITAs or former ITAs; most were women. Community-building was facilitated by hosting the project at Stony Brook University's Center for MIC (Multilingual and Intercultural Communication, &nbsp;<a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/mic/">https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/mic/</a>), and with Lunar New Year's celebrations hosted by a Co-PI for collaborators and ITAs.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Findings</strong></p> <p>Most ITAs' Versant speaking test scores for English showed modest improvement over their first two years in the U.S.&nbsp; Mandarin is the most common first language spoken by Stony Brook University's ITAs; the Mandarin-speaking ITAs in this study arrived with somewhat lower proficiency (Figure, top panel) than did the other ITAS (bottom panel), and their&nbsp;pronunciation sub-scores on Versant (in lavender) started out lower than their other sub-scores (vocabulary, grammar, and fluency) and remained lower over time.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nevertheless, there is reason to be optimistic about communication between native and non-native speakers in STEM education contexts. The project established that audio-visual information helps listeners understand foreign-accented speech, suggesting that students who sit close enough to see lip movements may do better than those farther away. Another finding established that hearing dubbed speech synchronized with an Asian face (compared to with a Caucasian face) does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;make speech sound any more accented (in contrast to 1992 findings that were probably due to demand effects).</p> <p><strong>Intervention</strong>. Fortunately, most listeners can adapt reasonably quickly when exposed to unfamiliar accents. Several kinds of exposure were tested. The intervention that was successful exposed monolingual U.S. undergraduates to brief, meaningful stories read aloud by an ITA. First, the listeners shadowed the story (simultaneously repeating it aloud while listening), then they listened to it silently while seeing a script of the story, and then they shadowed it again. After doing this for only 4 stories, listeners missed significantly fewer words when shadowing brand-new stories; after hearing 7 different stories in this manner, they were more likely to correctly recognize words in the accented speech that sounded like "imposter" words (homonyms unintended by the speaker, e.g., sounding like "sink" instead of the intended word "think"). Ongoing studies will determine why this intervention works, how long it lasts, and how generalizable it is to other speakers and accents.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Conclusions.</strong>&nbsp;Despite having foreign accents, many ITAs are good communicators and excel in the classroom. As measured by a proficiency test, pronunciation appears to be more resistant to improvement than vocabulary, grammar, and fluency. It appears to be easier for native English speakers to adapt to Mandarin-accented English than for speakers of Mandarin-accented English to develop native-like accents. Exposure to and experience with foreign-accented English can be facilitated as a welcome and foundational component of STEM education in globally-engaged university settings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/19/2020<br>      Modified by: Susan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Brennan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1519908/1519908_10383701_1589863996954_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1519908/1519908_10383701_1589863996954_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="English Proficiency Over 2 Years"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1519908/1519908_10383701_1589863996954_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="English Proficiency Over 2 Years"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Versant Scores and Subscores Measured Repeatedly</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jiwon Hwang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Susan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Brennan</div> <div class="imageTitle">English Proficiency Over 2 Years</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
