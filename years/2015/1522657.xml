<AbstractNarration>Computer simulation of physical phenomena is a highly valued tool of practical importance in a wide variety of applications in science and engineering. This project studies two new, promising techniques of carrying out these simulations with highly accurate and more efficient algorithms for a wide range of problems of practical interest. They include many applications to aerospace and mechanics (incompressible fluid flow, subsonic and supersonic flow) as well as to civil engineering (solid structures). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project aims to introduce a systematic way of obtaining new, competitive discontinuous Galerkin and mixed methods that superconverge on unstructured meshes made of elements of arbitrary shape. This will be done for a wide variety of partial differential equations arising in fluid dynamics (including the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations) and continuum mechanics (including the equations of large deformation elasticity), both linear and nonlinear. The project will also consider adjoint-recovery methods that will result in a very efficient way of obtaining more accuracy than previously thought possible from general finite element approximations. By only doubling the computational effort, the order of accuracy of the approximation will be doubled. In particular, the application of this technique to methods satisfying a Galerkin orthogonality property will result in the quadrupling of the order of accuracy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work funded by this proposal is about the devising of better numerical methods and new ways of achieving more accurate approximations more efficiently for several equations modeling physical phenomena of practical interest.   The research carried out in the area of adjoint-recovery methods reduce the cost of computing  approximations of linear and  nonlinear functionals by Galerkin methods by several orders of magnitude.  In fact, by only doubling the  computational effort, the order of accuracy was quadrupled. As a consequence, the use of these new techniques can speed up the computations, for the same accuracy, by several orders of magnitude.  The research carried out in the area of discretization of partial differential equations with Hamiltonian structure provided superconvergent discontinuous Galerkin methods with an energy which does not drift. This is a very important property in many applications including elastodynamics and seismic wave propagation and gives rise to new and more efficient Galerkin methods for linear and nonlinear wave propagation phenomena in which energy conservation is crucial.   The research carried out on the so-called M-decompositions provides a systematic way of obtaining superconvergent HDG and mixed methods for a variety of partial differential equations.

Thanks to this breakthrough, we can now obtain such methods for polygonal and polyhedral elements of any shape-- for a variety of equations including nonlinear problems like the p-Laplacian, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the equations of large deformation elasticity.     The above-described research outcomes will have a beneficial impact on the scientific communities interested in using computational methods for the simulation of phenomena of practical interest.
