<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for graduate students to attend the 44th Annual Conference on Parallel Processing to be held in Beijing, China from September 1-4th, 2015. ICPP is a premier conference in parallel and distributed systems. A committee will be selected to choose the travel awardees according to the following criteria.  The first priority will give to students who are from under-represented groups. The second priority will be given to those who normally could not attend the conference. Besides technical paper presentations, the venue offers a wide range of technical activities including panels, industry presentations, posters, demos, and keynote talks. Attending such high-caliber technical venues is extremely valuable for future researchers. This award will enable the supported attendees to be exposed to the state-of-the-art research in the field, to have the opportunity to interact with peer graduate students, researchers and experts from all over the world, to further gain knowledge that is likely to shape the future of the field.</AbstractNarration>
