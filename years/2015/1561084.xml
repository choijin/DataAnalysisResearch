<AbstractNarration>The Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a large weather system that forms over the Indian Ocean and moves slowly eastward until it dissipates near the middle of the tropical Pacific Ocean.  When it passes a given location, it typically causes a rainy period that lasts 15-30 days that is followed by dry weather, as well as an extended period of strong westerly winds.  The circulations that accompany the MJO go all the way around the world in the tropical atmosphere, and they affect when monsoon rainfall begins in Asia, Australia, and North America, as well as when and where tropical storms and hurricanes form.  Despite its importance to global weather and climate, the MJO has been poorly simulated in climate models for decades, so current predictions of how it will change in the future are unreliable.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientists involved in this project have developed a new kind of weather model that better predicts the behavior of the MJO.  It is referred to as "Lagrangian," because instead of solving equations for atmospheric motions on a grid of points, it tracks air masses as they move around the world. The Lagrangian weather model will be used to study how the MJO will change in the future as the oceans warm, and to better understand how the MJO works, so its representation can be improved in other models as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncertainty about future changes to the MJO represent an important X-factor for climate change.  Preliminary results suggest that the MJO will intensify, become more frequent, and affect a broader region of the tropics as the oceans warm.  Potential impacts include changes to tropical rainfall patterns, altered distributions of tropical storms and hurricanes, and changes in wind patterns that favor more frequent and persistent El Nino-like ocean warming.  This project will also educate two graduate students and several undergraduate students about techniques in modeling atmospheric circulations and about climate dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

Despite it's significance and influence, researchers still have had an inadequate understanding of the physical mechanisms that initiate and control the evolution of the MJO.

A notable exception is the Lagrangian Atmospheric Model (LAM); the LAM is a model that tracks parcels through the atmosphere rather than modeling the properties of a fluid in the grid pattern used in most models.  The LAM can simulate realistic MJOs, but prior to this work, we didn't understand why.  Part of the goals of this project were to understand this, so that other models may benefit.   In order to address the question of why the LAM simulates realistic MJOs, we started with the hypothesis that the MJO responds to large-scale balanced dynamics and moisture quasi-equilibrium.  If convection organizes in response to balanced dynamics, we expect to see evidence that large-scale horizontal rotations in the middle-troposphere will induce changes in the vertical profile of temperature.  These changes increase the atmospheric stability (there is a cooling below the large-scale horizontal rotation, and a warmng above, thus leading to a more stable environment, but still remaining unstable to moist convection).

In the earliest stages of the MJO, the atmosphere is dry, so the upward motion of these parcels serve to moisten the environment.  This pre-moistening fuels upward motion of convecting parcels so they may eventually reach the tropopause (deep convection), where the atmsophere becomes more stable, and represents the point where the atmosphere has the greatest moisture content.  As the convection deepens, the convection mixes with environmental air through a process called entrainment.  Since the convection is deeper, it entrains air from the mid-troposphere that is drier than the surface air.  This reduces the convective strength and results in a more "top-heavy" convective profile (most upward motion is in the upper troposphere).  Throughout the entire  evolutionary process of the convective system, there is a close relationship between the atmsopheric stability and moisture; this relationship is what we refer to as moisture quasi-equilibrium.   In this project, we identified relationships between diagnostic variables that we could easily measure, and we looked for relationships that were consistent with the balanced dynamics hypothesis (for example, a relationship between the middle-tropospheric rotation and changes in the vertical temperature profile; relationships between vertical temperature and moisture, and relationships between these quantities and the vertical shape of the convection).  We first tested these on observational data to see if this hypothesis was consistent with nature.  The diagnostic analysis from the data taken durng the 2011 DYNAMO field campaign was consistent with balanced dynamics and moisture quasi-equilibrium, so we applied the same analysis to the LAM simulations.   For the application to LAM, we conducted two simulations, one that produced a realistic MJO, and one that reduced the environmental entrainment that resulted in a poor MJO simulation.  We applied our diagnostic analysis and found that in the simulation with a realistic MJO, the diagnostic quantities were consistent with balanced dynamics and moisture quasi-equilibrium (similar to the results from the DYNAMO data), while the poor MJO simulation exhibited poor relationships between our diagnostic quantities.  This suggests that the LAM does a good job in simulating the MJO because the physics in the model is consistent with balanced dynamics and moisture quasi-equilibrium.  Perhaps other models could modify model physics to capture these concepts and improve their simulations of the MJO.   In addition to this major outcome, we performed other simulations using a different modeling approach to better understand the sensitivity of convective organization (such as in the MJO) to changes in the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) to represent the impact of warming oceans.  We noted a sensitivity in organization to changes in SST, with stronger convection supported over warmer oceans.
