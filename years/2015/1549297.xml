<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in improving and simplifying weather observations from various platforms, such as an unmanned aircraft, small satellites in orbit, a buoy in the middle of the ocean or from the ground, even in a remote location. The targeted customer for the radiometer receiver is anyone who desires a more detailed, localized, short term forecast. Such customers include meteorological organizations, both private and governmental, operators of renewable energy plants ? onshore and offshore wind farms or solar power plants, future unmanned or robotic aircrafts that observe the atmosphere, military, and others. Sensors built with these receivers can also contribute to remote detection of in-flight icing danger in general aviation. Our sensor will simplify observations from small aircraft, piloted or unmanned, thus allowing new observations of clouds, their water or ice content, and the local thermodynamic status of the atmosphere. Such observations will thus improve scientific understanding of clouds and their representation in climate and Earth system models. More broadly, this project represents a new technological concept of sub terahertz receiver design and assembly. Users of sub terahertz receivers include airport security (body scanners), short range high bit rate communications, industrial testing of paper, polymer, food, pharmaceutical and agriculture, and medical imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the development of a novel, highly integrated, low power consuming, radiometer receiver operating around 183.31 GHz, in the vicinity of a water vapor absorption line. The receiver architecture was chosen to improve radiometer sensitivity, calibration accuracy, and reliability, while keeping its weight, size, and power consumption low. The goal of the effort is to develop a sensor that would enable wide spread weather observations. The receiver would be relatively easy to assemble, repair and its production cost would be low, especially for large quantities. The Phase I project is focused on a feasibility study of the receiver design. The major receiver components will be designed and their performance modelled. The anticipated result is a preliminary design of the whole receiver and characterization of its operational parameters.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this Phase I project was a feasibility study of a design of an integrated radiometer receiver, specifically for UAVs, nano-satellites, and ground based applications where a small, user friendly, accurate and durable devices are required.  We successfully accomplished all of the design goals and a result is a radiometer receiver that is small, light-weight, consumes very little of power, it is applicable to almost any environment around the globe. It will save future customers time and money compared to what is available on the market today.  The integrated 183 GHz radiometer receiver has 5 channels and the following desirable features:  Designed specifically for radiometric applications in environmental remote sensing "Plug and play" architecture, it only needs to connect to an antenna and power and the detectors analog voltages are provided on the output The smallest on the market, very capable with very small power consumption (0.4 W) Direct detect radiometer (no oscillator drift) Two internal calibration points (hot and cold) for continuous gain and offset evaluation No thermal stabilization required Overall weight ~130 g Input via a standard WR5 waveguide flange Operational temperature range -40&deg;C to +50&deg;C To lower the cost, it is designed for mass production   Five radiometric channels were chosen and designed, their parameters are listed as follows, center frequency (GHz), bandwidth (MHz), and radiometer sensitivity for 10 ms integration time:  183.31, 1900, 0.27  185.21, 1900, 0.27  188.16, 4000, 0.19  192.16, 4000, 0.19  196.16, 4000, 0.19  We also simulated the filter frequency drift and found out that for 60&deg;C temperature variations (20&deg;C to -40&deg;, or to +80&deg;C) the center frequency drifts only about ~17 MHz.  During Phase II we are planning to build and test a fully functional prototype.       Last Modified: 08/08/2016       Submitted by: Marian Klein]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
