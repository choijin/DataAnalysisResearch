<AbstractNarration>This workshop builds upon the success of the 2014 CC-NIE Campus Cyberinfrastructure Workshop, providing an opportunity for NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure award recipients to meet in-person, exchange project findings, interact with national cyberinfrastructure experts and collaborate across project areas and project regions. The proposed workshop will be co-located with two other community meetings, the ESnet Site Coordinators Committee (ESCC) meeting and The Quilt Fall Member meeting. The workshop will promote dialogue across a range of important and timely topics in campus networking including the larger context of campus cyberinfrastructure.  Joint programming with the Quilt and ESCC on Day 2 of the workshop will provide an opportunity to develop stronger ties between campus cyberinfrastructure, science driven applications and regional networks as technical and cyberinfrastructure resources.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the exchange project findings, interaction between national cyberinfrastructure experts, collaboration across project areas and project regions that will lead to new ideas, relationships and collaborations associated with an in person workshop.   The broader impact includes the dissemination of workshop information, including the workshop presentations along with a final workshop report to Campus Cyberinfrastructure award participants as well as to the campus and research community in general.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The 2015 CC PI Workshop was held in Austin, TX in September 2015. The meeting was the first to be co-located with the ESnet Site Coordinators Committee (ESCC) and The Quilt Fall meetings, successfully providing an opportunity for interaction between the communities. The 2015 Workshop had over 160 attendees, including 150 PI?s or staff associated with 110 Campus Cyberinfrastructure awards.   The primary objective of the workshop was to promote dialogue within the campus cyberinfrastructure PI community across a range of important and timely topics in campus networking, including the larger context of campus cyberinfrastructure. In addition, the scope and participation in the workshop was expanded to include recipients from all of the Campus Cyberinfrastructure programs as well as the broader community by co-locating the workshop with two other community meetings, the ESCC meeting and The Quilt Fall Member Meeting.   The workshop agenda and associated presentations were designed to provide an overview of the strategic role cyberinfrastructure plays within the campus environment in support of science and engineering research and applications and then provide more detailed information on campus cyberinfrastructure technologies as well as the applications and research supported by those technologies.  Thus, the most visible outcome of the 2015 PI Workshop is the open availability of the workshop agenda, presentations and other supplemental material online as a persistent resource for the project PI?s, their staff and collaborators as well as the broader cyberinfrastructure community. In addition, the exchange of information, project findings and ideas that occurred throughout the formal presentations as well as informal interactions between the workshop attendees allowed the opportunity to create new collaborations, develop new relationship across disciplines and campuses and provide new insight into technologies and solutions for science driven campus cyberinfrastructure. The workshop provided informal training opportunities by exposing the attendees to a broad set of technical topics including science DMZ technologies, end-to-end performance techniques as well as templates and best practices for supporting research projects and applications.               Co-locating the PI workshop with the ESCC and Quilt meetings provided an opportunity to develop strong ties between campus cyberinfrastructure, science driven applications and regional and national cyberinfrastructure resources with the expectation of leading to a broader set of collaborations and lasting impact on national campus cyberinfrastructure and science driven applications. It is expected that the in-depth knowledge exchange between program PIs, campus network leaders will be applied to improved campus network engineering, provide opportunities for supporting science and engineering based research as well as facilitating campus CI support across a disciplines outside the bounds of science and engineering.
