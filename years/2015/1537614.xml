<AbstractNarration>The North Anatolian Fault, a young continental transform fault, splits into several branches and forms a transtensional basin. Most of the strain is associated with the Northern Branch, which created three 1200-m deep basins. It has been proposed that the strain is focusing on the Northern Branch and that the Central and Southern branches are being abandoned. However, recent seafloor data demonstrate continued activity of the Central Branch. The will PI use new data collected in 2013 and 2014 in combination with a large suite of available previous data, to map the stratigraphy and faulting related to the Central Branch of the NAF and extend stratigraphic age model covering the past 0.5 Ma to greater depth and age. These data will be used to investigate two fundamental questions about transform fault systems: 1) what is the interplay between branches as a transform fault system evolves? And 2) how do cumulative slip and pre-existing structures affect the evolution of faults and strain partitioning? The Northern Branch is relatively continuous and single stranded while the Southern Branch is discontinuous and multi-stranded. By contrasting the slip history of these branches, the PIs will resolve whether different accumulated slip can fully account for these different fault properties or whether they are permanently influenced by pre-existing structure. The project will further cement international collaboration with Turkey via shared research and personnel exchanges, including Turkish graduate students. It will also support a female US postdoc and two undergraduate summer interns. Information relevant to seismogenic activity beneath the Marmara Sea is highly societally relevant considering that this seismic gap is home to 25% of Turkey's population and much of its industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A continental transform is expected to originate as a distributed network of small faults with complex geometries that, with continued slip, gradually coalesce and simplify into a through-going fault. The North Anatolian Fault (NAF), a young continental transform, has been proposed as a prime example of this process. In the Marmara Sea, however, the NAF splits into several branches and forms a transtensional basin. Most of the strain is associated with the Northern Branch, which spawned three 1200-m deep basins. It has been proposed that the strain is focusing on the Northern Branch and that the Central and Southern branches are being abandoned. However, recent  seismic and bathymetry data demonstrate continued activity of the Central Branch. These new data collected in 2013 and 2014 image the stratigraphy and numerous individual fault strands on the southern shelf of the Marmara Sea. The PI will use these data, in combination with a large suite of available previous data, to map the stratigraphy and faulting related to the Central Branch of the NAF. The PIs propose to extend our published stratigraphic age model covering the past 0.5 Ma to greater depth and age. Earliest Pliocene fill of Messinian (~5 Ma) erosional valleys dated on land will be projected short distances to our near-shore reflection data to provide a base to the age model. Based on this stratigraphic framework, they will evaluate fault kinematics of many strands over the southern Marmara Sea during the last several million years. Basin modeling will be used to separate the effects of sediment loading, compaction and tectonic subsidence and test the extension estimates. These data will be used to investigate two fundamental questions about transform fault systems: 1) What is the interplay between branches as a transform fault system evolves? And 2) how do cumulative slip and pre-existing structures affect the evolution of faults and strain partitioning? The Northern Branch is relatively continuous and single stranded while the Southern Branch is discontinuous and multi-stranded. By contrasting the slip history of these branches, the PIs will resolve whether different accumulated slip can fully account for these different fault properties or whether they are permanently influenced by pre-existing structure. The project will further cement international collaboration with Turkey via shared research and personnel exchanges, including Turkish graduate students. It will also support a female US postdoc and two undergraduate summer interns. Information relevant to seismogenic activity beneath the Marmara Sea is highly societally relevant considering that this seismic gap is home to 25% of Turkey's population and much of its industry.  The results will also be highly relevant to the southern San Andreas Fault and other similarly multi-stranded transform fault systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  The 1999 earthquakes in Izmit and Ducze, Turkey raised awareness of the seismic hazard along the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) in Turkey.  A strike-slip fault similar to the San Andreas Fault,  the two sides move past each other at almost 1 inch/year (23 mm/year). Most of the NAF ruptured in a series of earthquakes in the 20thcentury culminating in the 1999 earthquakes. The Marmara Sea contains the only part of the fault system that did not rupture and is considered to have a high potential for a future earthquake. However, the NAF splits into several branches in this region. Most of the research effort has focused on the Northern Branch, which carries the most activity and is closest to Istanbul. Some have suggested that it is the only branch that is still active.  We explored the lesser-known Central Branch in the southern part of the Marmara Sea with our Turkish and French colleagues.  Because the water is much shallower there, it is also harder to image the fault.    Intellectual Merit  Over the last decade, we collaborated on a series of research cruises that collected seismic images of the layers of sediment, and faults that cut them below the bottom of the sea.  We also collected detailed bathymetry data. By correlating reflections from sediment layers around the southern Marmara Sea, we were able to determine the history of motion for the many fault strands that form the Central Branch. We find that most of these strands have been active for at least the last half million years, but at a low rate. Some are demonstrably active since the last ice age (18,000 years ago) and many cut the sea floor indicating more recent activity.  Figure 1 shows an example of seismic lines that image a fault both extending to over 1 kilometer below the sea floor as well as causing an offset at the sea floor.   Figure 2 shows a map with our interpretation of the faults in the Marmara Sea, including contributions from many others.  It was constructed using a closely-spaced network of seismic data of different resolutions from multiple surveys similar to the example in Figure 1. In the southern Marmara Sea, we found that the Central Branch is composed of multiple fault strands. We have mapped several long fault zones, such as the Kapidag Fault and the Imrali Ridge Fault (Fig. 2), but we also map numerous scattered small faults that have been active during the last few tens of thousand of years.  This contrasts with the northern Branch (labeled NAF-N) where deformation is mainly focused on a single fault zone that carries about ? of the total motion of all the branches.  The faster motion in the north has led to a simplification of fault zone, while in the south there is still considerable complexity in the fault pattern.    Precision GPS indicates about 18 mm/year on the Northern Branch, focused on the primary fault known as the Main Marmara Fault. However, it also finds about 5 mm/year across the eastern part of the Central Branch.  The multiple faults must split this motion and many may only have rates of 1 or 2 mm/year. Thus while the seismic hazard is much lower, the southern Marmara Sea still has the potential for damaging earthquakes.    Our mapping also included identifying changes in the layers of sediments during glacial sea level cycles.  During these cycles, the Marmara Sea was sometimes connected to the Aegean Sea through the Dardanelles Strait when sea level was higher, such as the present. At times of lower sea level, it was sometimes cut off from the Aegean Sea and became a fresh water lake.  We have worked on integrating our seismic data with sediment core samples and modeling to better understand the changing environment of the Marmara Sea, changes in the sediment deposition patterns, and local changes in sea level.  Broader Impacts  A Brown University undergraduate was a Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) intern as part of the project and completed a senior thesis based on his work with us. Two Turkish professors and one student visit as part of the project. Our collaboration aided a Turkish professor in getting tenure. Multiple Turkish graduate students were involved in the processing and interpretation of the data, in addition to our team.   Our results should have an impact on regional earthquake hazard assessments. It is also providing regional information on the effects of sea level change during past glacial-interglacial cycles. It has provided information related to sedimentation patterns during sea level changes and related to faulting.
