<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project will identify shifts in vegetation and fire regimes related to human settlement and subsistence practices of prehistoric Native American populations in the Finger Lakes region of the state of New York.  The doctoral student will analyze the range of environmental impacts to distinguish various human-caused vegetation and landscape changes from concurrent natural environmental changes.  The project will provide new insights into the chronological development of the vegetation and landscape of the Finger Lakes region as it was subjected to a range of forces associated with both human cultural change and natural environmental change during a critical period of North American prehistory.  The project has important implications for paleoecological research, because it will employ new modeling techniques to investigate prehistoric human-vegetation impacts using a suite of archaeological, ecological, and historical datasets.  The doctoral student will work closely with several local Native American tribes, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations.  The project should enhance understanding of prehistorical environments and the dynamics of change over recent millennia.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focusing on Native American habitation and subsistence will provide new information regarding the nature and magnitude of prehistoric impacts on the forested ecosystems of the northeastern U.S.  The doctoral student will focus on the core question of whether a combination of archaeological and paleoecological data can aid in reconstructing landscape changes related to human activities that predate any historical record.  The student will use an integrated methodology that integrates historical, archaeological, ecological, and geological data sets.  These data sets will be analyzed using multivariate statistical methods and geographic information system-based analyses. He also will develop an ecologically based conceptual model to guide research on prehistoric human impacts.  The model will provide a template that can be used elsewhere in the world to address the relative contributions of landscape change related to natural environmental perturbations and human disturbance.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This doctoral dissertation research investigated complex inter-relationships between vegetation dynamics, the cultural development of prehistoric Native American societies, and natural climate variability over the last 4500 years in upstate New York, USA. On-going debates within the fields of geography, paleoecology, and historical ecology focus on varying interpretations of land-use practices of Native Americans and their associated impacts upon landscapes. Specific topics include assessing the spatial extent and intensity of Native American involvement in maize-based agriculture, silviculture, and use of fire as a landscape management tool in prehistory and during initial European contact. Both regional archaeological records and ethnohistorical accounts have documented that indigenous Native Americans engaged in a diversity of subsistence economies and settlement patterns in eastern North America, however, these lack a long-term landscape perspective only offered by paleoecology. Paleoecology involves the analysis of fossils and sediments extracted by coring wetlands, which serve as proxies of past environmental conditions. Laboratory analysis of proxies from wetlands situated near archaeological sites can provide evidence of prehistoric forest clearance and associated soil erosion, and sometimes agriculture, in addition to signals of paleoclimate fluctuations. Discerning between these signals (land-use vs climate) requires data comparison to those of a &ldquo;control&rdquo; site situated in wilderness that primarily documents paleoclimate trends. This strategy of comparing an &ldquo;anthropopogenic&rdquo; site (a multi-proxy record from a wetland adjacent to Native American settlements) to a &ldquo;paleoclimate&rdquo; site (wetland proxy record from a control site) was employed in this doctoral dissertation research. The proxies analyzed for these two sites included fossil pollen, spores, charcoal, stable carbon isotopes, sedimentology, and sediment magnetic susceptibility; and multiple radiocarbon dates provided chronologies for these records.</p> <p>At the control site, three chronological phases were identified. Phase I (4500 &ndash; 2000 BP [calendar years BP]) was associated with cyclic, centennial-scale variability in the frequency of fire-tolerant and fire-sensitive pollen taxa, low charcoal influx values, and other proxies which together indicated natural variations within a mesic forest ecosystem. Data trends reversed for Phase II (2000 &ndash; 700 BP), with indications of increased fire frequency and greater abundance of fire-tolerant tree species, which were largely attributed to a warming trend that culminated in the Medieval Climate Anomaly [MCA, 1000-600 BP]. However, this control site may also record the onset of Native American influence on upland forests starting as early as ~2000 BP, as evidenced by episodic peaks in stable carbon isotope values (maize being a C<sub>4</sub> plant) &ndash; an interpretation supported by the regional archaeological record. &nbsp;Phase III (700 &ndash; 150 BP) data provide more robust evidence for anthropogenic impacts in the vicinity of the control site. For example, charcoal influx values were substantially higher during Phase III than in previous phases, and these distinct charcoal peaks occurred at the same times that agricultural Iroquoian settlements were occupied within a 20-km radius of the coring site, according to archaeological records. After 700 BP, major compositional turnover of upland forests was followed by expansion of savanna and successional old-field communities related to Iroquoian agricultural and silvicultural activity, probably from more frequent use of fire as a landscape management tool. During this time, the Little Ice Age (LIA, 600-200 BP) climate alone would have favored fire-sensitive, late-successional forest rather than the open-canopy, fire-adapted vegetation (inferred from charcoal, carbon isotope and pollen data) that instead suggest an anthropogenic impact.</p> <p>The other coring site was situated within the Native American activity zone, i.e., close to several Seneca/Iroquoian villages occupied during European contact.
