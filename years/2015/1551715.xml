<AbstractNarration>New econometric models, data visualization techniques and other empirical methods have the potential to improve science policy.    This project organizes a workshop to examine the policy needs of federal agencies, discuss the availability of data, and the role of new methods to enhance the returns to federal investment in science, demonstrate the impact of science funding   and increase the societal and economic benefits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the auspices of National Academies Board on Science, Technology and Economic policy (STEP) this workshop brings together science policy experts from federal agencies with scholars from multiple disciplines to examine the development of new metrics and impact assessment procedures. This workshop has the potential to transform the process of evaluation and impact reporting by federal research managers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine convened a workshop to explore how to assess the social returns to federal investments in the innovation system. This one-day workshop was planned by a stand-alone committee of experts and was held on December 15, 2016, in Washington, DC. A resulting publication, Returns to Federal Investments in the Innovation System: Proceedings of the Workshop&mdash;In Brief provides a summary of the event and is available for free download on the National Academies Press website.  The workshop began with a discussion of the theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence that bear on assessing the returns to federally-funded basic research; data limitations; and potentially fruitful directions for further research.  It next looked at the ways by which federal policies support private-sector innovation, including R&amp;D tax credits, procurement and prize mechanisms, Small Business Innovation Research programs, and public-private venture funds, as well as the patent system. The third panel reviewed the frameworks and empirical evidence regarding the role that public investment in education and infrastructure plays in underpinning the innovation system. The final panel considered evidence that links the innovation process to the distribution of income, and assessed how the social returns to innovation may be perceived in light of such linkages.  The workshop featured leading economists, including Pierre Azoulay of MIT, Ben Jones of Northwestern University, Samuel Kortum of Yale University, Heidi Williams of MIT, and Shane Greenstein of Harvard University.  The keynote was delivered by Jason Furman, then Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.  The workshop discussion and the resulting proceedings summary provide useful reference material for those researching how to better measure the social returns on federal investments in research and how to convey to a policy audience the effects of the federal investments.
