<AbstractNarration>The investigator studies two problems related to behavior of financial markets.  In the first he studies equilibrium in incomplete markets.  The theory of market equilibrium is important because it provides a framework for understanding how prices develop in a market.  Roughly speaking, a market is complete if every agent can trade with every other agent about every possible future state.  The theory for complete markets has been worked out reasonably well, but the equilibrium of incomplete markets is open.  In the second, he examines stochastic control problems that arise in considering how to make optimal investments with a random endowment.  Formation of financial markets is a complex process, but ultimately reliant on fundamental economic principles.  This reliance is what makes it amenable to mathematical analysis and quantitative study.  The benefits of better understanding of how real financial markets come to exist, and how their salient features emerge from the basic building blocks, are multiple.  They range from enhancing our ability to regulate both existing and nascent markets to building tools for prevention of future financial instabilities and crises in the US and worldwide.  Graduate students are included in the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his students study two separate, but related, clusters of problems in mathematical finance and stochastic-control theory.  The first one aims to elucidate the rational agents' optimal response to diverse market structures and the formation of incomplete financial markets.  In addition to the classical, convex- and functional-analytic tools, the investigator's approach rests on stochastic analysis and the theory of backward stochastic differential equations, as well as their relationship with systems of partial differential equations, touching upon topics in Riemannian geometry and non-cooperative game theory.  The second research focus -- centered around a novel class of stochastic control problems termed "weakly constrained" -- is modeled after one of the fundamental questions in mathematical finance, namely the optimal investment problem with a random endowment.  These weakly constrained problems occur naturally and possess intriguing mathematical features, but resist analysis using standard approaches.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project builds on the long-standing fruitful partnership between economics and mathematics and studies the classical "general equilibrium" problem in a contemporary stochastic setting. Its aim was to better understand the circumstances under which it is possible to match the supply and demand under constraints imposed on the structure of the existing financial markets, and under the inherently random nature of the environment.     One of the main results the PI obtained with his collaborators is a mathematical theorem which guarantees the existence of solutions to a class of important equations involving random time evolution of a number of interacting processes. These equations are closely related to asset prices obtained in equilibrium and can be used to deepen our understanding of the structural conditions that lead to stable vs. unstable market conditions.   Several other, less direct areas of applications of mathematics to finance and economics were also a part of the scope of the project. These include applications to stochastic control theory, dynamic programming principle and pricing techniques for contingent claims in financial markets.      The project also benefited several graduate students, who completed their dissertations on various topics related to the project.  The results of the supported research have been presented at numerous meetings, conferences, and workshops, both in the US and internationally, and have been published in top research journals. The PI's service to the scientific community included international conference organization and varied editorial duties.
