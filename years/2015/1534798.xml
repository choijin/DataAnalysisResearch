<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be more effective and efficient use of unstructured data.  Limiting analysis to structured data ignores the massive amount of information in reports, memos, articles, and other written documents.  Workers require information on past work and ongoing projects, best practices, current events and competitor and customer activities.  However, companies with thousands of workers have millions of documents.  It is prohibitively expensive to index them manually so that they can be found, analyzed and acted on.  Moreover, overloaded workers do not have the time or training required to take on the task.  The problem is exacerbated by mergers and acquisitions.  In addition, over years, it is common for companies to accumulate large numbers of duplicate and out-of-date documents that workers do not take the time to rationalize and delete.  The result is inflated storage costs and reduced productivity as workers struggle to find the relevant, up-to-date information.  Inconsistent information governance also puts organizations at risk - litigation (retaining documents without legal or business value), safety (using out-of-date process safety management procedures) and operational (not leveraging best practices and lessons learned across the enterprise and beyond).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the problem that text documents - especially those internal to an organization - are very difficult to locate and analyze unless they are classified and tagged.  But manual classification and tagging are too expensive and inconsistent for large collections.  Large companies store many millions of documents.  And there is even more relevant information on the Web.  The objective of the proposed research to is to provide software assistants that classify documents into pre-specified categories, add tags to describe what each document is about, and the entities named in the documents (e.g., oilfields).  The assistants identify relevant documents and help people to learn of new developments by sending alerts when new documents of interest appear on the web or in the company's computers.  The primary technical result will be a suite of software assistants that companies can adopt singly or as an ensemble to help manage information sustainably.  These assistants build upon the proposed research to develop and integrate novel approaches to unsupervised machine learning, concept identification, and ontology construction.  They will enable companies to overcome major problems, including overload, finding relevant, up-to-date information, analyzing unstructured information, and identifying unneeded documents for elimination.</AbstractNarration>

making it easy to find and analyze information in text documents for decision makers at all levels of operations&nbsp; Under this NSF SBIR Phase-II award, we created software to help managers and workers who suffer from the extremes of either not finding any relevant information at all or being overloaded with irrelevant information.&nbsp; Because our computer programs offer different avenues for finding what individuals are looking for among millions of text documents, users find the software to be both flexible and powerful.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Traditional searching, e.g., in Google, is based on keywords &ndash; the literal words that appear in a document.&nbsp; But this is just a starting place.&nbsp; We have used artificial intelligence to create software with knowledge of many different corporate sectors and topics, e.g., the oil and gas industry or artificial intelligence.&nbsp; Knowledge of a problem area provides additional avenues for homing in on the most relevant information.&nbsp; &shy;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We have developed our own proprietary method of learning from examples that are not already pre-classified using knowledge of a topic to augment statistics.&nbsp; This capability allows us to build new classifiers in a short time, with little time required from experts.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We have also developed our own proprietary method of identifying oil and gas basins, fields, and formations.&nbsp; With supplementary funding for six-months we extended these capabilities to identify named entities, specifically companies, in other topic areas, using other topic-specific knowledge.&nbsp; The language used in the area of oil exploration and production allows us to identify places in a document where these entities are mentioned whether or not they are known or are new discoveries.&nbsp; For example, the Hershey Oil Field in the Permian Basin of Texas is a known field, but we also can identify previously-unknown discoveries.&nbsp;&nbsp; This example also illustrates the need to identify the name &ldquo;Hershey&rdquo; as an oil field or as a chocolate company depending on the context.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>By tracking dozens of publications within one industry sector at a time, the software can provide relevant, up-to-the-minute news as well as reference materials.&nbsp; These articles may be sent to individuals on their own frequency schedule &ndash; e.g., weekly, daily, hourly, or immediately.&nbsp; Individuals can also specify their own particular interests at the moment. &nbsp;In any case, the news stories and research articles are also accumulated in an ever-growing collection of searchable materials.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We are providing these services to the Society for Petroleum Engineers (SPE) and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), at spe.org and aitopics.org.&nbsp; In each case, the software browses many hundreds of publications daily to find and index the relevant ones for the interests of their communities.&nbsp; The software powering these two sites is general enough to power the information engines for other scientific or professional societies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We also provide similar services for corporations desiring to organize their in-house documents more efficiently.&nbsp; For example, we are working with companies who, themselves, have many clients with documentation relating to all of them.&nbsp; Although those records are in computer-readable form, they had only been indexed and organized manually.&nbsp; i2k Connect software reads those text records, indexes them with corporate-specific terms, and provides the means for analyzing their contents.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The software tools we have developed also help large corporations save money as they move millions or tens of millions of documents from their own computers to rented computing services &ldquo;in the cloud&rdquo;.&nbsp; We identify duplicates as we index their materials, so the cost of rented storage can be reduced by 25% or more in a monthly bill in the thousands of dollars.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The attached figures illustrate some of these capabilities in the context of news articles and documents about artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Figs. 1 &amp;
