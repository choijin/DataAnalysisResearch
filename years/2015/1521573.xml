<AbstractNarration>Scientists and engineers in many disciplines, ranging from mechanical or aerospace engineering to chemistry and economics, need to solve large linear systems  of equations. These systems are typically 'sparse' in that most of their entries are zeros. Linear systems that arise from three-dimensional  physical systems are often exceedingly costly to solve by standard direct elimination, also called direct methods. In such cases, iterative methods, which produce a sequence of approximations to the solution, become mandatory. These methods have made important advances in recent years but their lack of robustness when dealing with a variety of real-life problems remains an issue. Recent research on so-called Preconditioned Krylov Subspace Methods has aimed at achieving a good compromise between generality and efficiency by incorporating techniques from different horizons, including multilevel concepts to improve scalability and adopting ideas from direct solution methods to improve robustness. At the same time that these improvements are  being deployed, new demands from challenging applications as well as from the  new computational environments are making obsolete algorithms and computational codes that often took several decades to mature. The aim of this project is to address these new demands and the challenges that have emerged for iterative methods in recent years, as well as to explore other research issues that are of great practical importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore a class of iterative methods for solving linear systems of equations, emphasizing robustness and scalability issues. The starting point of the proposed research is to investigate a new set of Multi-Level Low-Rank (MLR) approximation techniques within Domain-Decomposition  (DD) type methods. MLR preconditioners, especially within the DD framework have a great potential for a number of reasons. First, because they rely on approximate inverses, these methods tend to be far more robust than their Incomplete LU (ILU) counterparts. As such they can be much more effective than existing methods when dealing with highly indefinite linear systems, e.g., those arising from wave scattering simulations. Second, MLRs do not require factorizations and are excellent candidates for high-performance computers, e.g., ones equipped with Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Finally, they are easy to update in that it is inexpensive to augment or refine them in order to improve their accuracy in the situation when their observed performance is not satisfactory. Different ways to define low-rank approximations will be explored that are all rooted in the Domain-Decomposition framework and Schur complement techniques. This project will also continue to explore standard multi-level preconditioners, placing a high emphasis on robustness issues. Finally, other important topics related to the impact of high-performance computing on the one hand and to the development  of effective software on the other will be considered. Among the broader impacts of this research the project highlights the dissemination of computational software and the training of students in an area that is of vital and growing importance. In addition, the PI will continue the practice of freely disseminating articles, books, lecture notes, and MATLAB scripts for educational purposes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The solution of large and sparse linear systems of equations remains an important and active area of research in many scientific and engineering disciplines.  Thisproject addressed the solution of such systems by iterative techniques, i.e., techniques that compute a sequence of approximations that converge to the solution.  Amongstandard iterative methods, those based on a combination of preconditioning and projection on Krylov subspaces are popular due to their excellent compromise betweengenerality and efficiency.  A preconditioner is a process for obtaining inexpensively an approximate solution to the original system.  For example, common preconditioning techniques are those based on Incomplete LU (ILU) factorizations that approximately factor the original matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and anupper triangular matrix U.  These preconditioners tend to work well for linear systems that have large entries on the diagonal (diagonally dominant) but may do poorly forother systems, e.g., systems that are indefinite (i.e., that have eigenvalues on both sides of the imaginary axis). The primary focus of this project has been to developpreconditioners that are robust, i.e., techniques that can deal with highly indefinite or ill-conditioned linear systems.  The research emphasizes 'multilevel techniques'as well as techniques that perform well on high-performance computers.  One of the main contributions of this project has been the development of a class of Multilevel Low-rank (MLR) preconditioners. The initial motivation for this approachwas the attraction of operating with low-rank dense matrices in the preconditioning operations. These lead to dense linear algebra, an attribute that is very appealingwhen solving the related systems on performance on machines equipped with GPUs.  It was later found that the methods in this class have many other attractive features. Forexample, MLR preconditoners are not as sensitive to indefiniteness as ILU-type preconditioners.  Thus, one of the preconditioners developed provided an effective solutiontechniques for highly indefinite linear systems such as those issued from wave propagation phenomena, which are currently among the most difficult to solve by iterativemethods.     The research has unraveled a new approach for developing preconditioning techniques.  Past research has focused on finding an approximate factorization to the originalmatrix, an ILU factorization or an algebraic multigrid technique for example, which is then used as a preconditioner.  Preserving sparsity is a major goal of thesetechniques.  What we have shown is that good approximate inverse methods can be developed provided low-rank approximations are exploited to correct some initialapproximation. In this approach sparsity is no longer the main focus.  Thus, while ILUs are not enough and low-rank approximation techniques by themselves have not beenproven effective, certain combinations of these two completely different methodologies can lead to very efficient solution techniques.  This does not seem to have beenobserved so far.   The broader impacts of the proposal include the dissemination of software and the training of students in an area that is in vital need of growth. In addition, there is aclear potential impact of this line of work in the applications areas.  Good iterative solution techniques are crucial in a wide range of scientific and engineeringdisciplines.  This work may lead the way to alternative techniques for building preconditioners for these iterative solvers that may be far more effective than thosecurrently in use.
