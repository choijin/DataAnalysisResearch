<AbstractNarration>Advances in modern society are increasingly intertwined with those of our communication systems. Everything from entertainment to business to transportation to healthcare itself relies on our ability to communicate efficiently and reliably. With progress in all of these domains come increasing communication demands. The key to meeting those demands is an ever increasing and growing understanding of how to build better communication networks and how to operate the ones that we have more effectively. While much is known about small parts of our communication networks, surprisingly little is known about how to operate the network as a whole more efficiently. This project sets out to tackle that monumental and critical goal, by seeking to uncover the implications of network design choices, understand the commonalities and differences among these implications, and expand the theory and techniques needed both to operate these systems efficiently and to understand the limits of their performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The network information theory literature considers code design and performance limits for communication systems under a wide variety of system models and constraints. While a careful reading of the literature reveals many common tools and strategies, each new problem engenders its own new theory. This work takes a systematic approach towards uncovering the hidden underlying commonalities that connect the solutions of information theoretic problems. Central to this approach are reduction arguments that derive relationships between the solutions to different information theoretic problems. In such, our framework shifts attention from the traditional focus on solving example networks to a focus on building connections between problem solutions. The work is organized in three thrusts. The first examines network modeling assumptions with the goal of determining how much each assumption impacts the information theoretic solvability of networks, distilling out aspects that have little or no impact on solvability, and simplifying broad classes of communication problems down to their essential representative core. The second thrust moves from individual network characteristics to comparisons between characteristics in order to understand the common, unsolved challenges that lie at the heart of a wide range of network information theoretic questions and use these commonalities to develop a taxonomy of problems and solutions. Finally, as the first two thrusts steer  attention towards representative examples and common challenges, existing tools for code design and capacity calculation are enhanced and amplified by applying them to new communication scenarios for which reductive arguments demonstrate a connection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The field of information theory advances our understanding of communication systems and develops future communication technologies.  Progress in the field is typically made by studying small parts or components of existing communication systems to understand how well they would perform if designed in the best possible way and to design practical methods for approaching that best possible performance.   While results on one such component may give insights about another, to a large extent, each new component that we study is essentially a new problem, requiring an entirely new solution.  Since solution to each problem is difficult, progress in the field -- while critical to enabling advances in technology like cell phones, WiFi, and computers -- moves more slowly than we would like.    Motivated by a desire to accelerate progress in this important field and by the goal of looking at communication networks in a comprehensive way, rather than one component at a time, this project aimed to uncover relationships between big questions in information theory.  The goal here is both to understand how solutions derived for one component can be applied to other components and to understand how the big questions about networks are related to each other. Understanding relationships of this type is useful both for deriving the maximum possible benefit from each new advance and for steering research towards problems whose solution would lend insight into the  problems of the greatest combined importance.    One examples of the type of result achieved under this project is the derivation of a proof showing that understanding communication systems in which each message is sent from a single transmitter to a single receiver is sufficient for also understanding communication problems in which messages may be sent to one or many receivers.  That is, the same theory that helps us understand how to get the best possible performance out of a traditional phone network, that is a network in which each call connects a single pair of communicators, immediately tells us how to get the best possible performance out of modern communication networks, which include both traditional point-to-point communication sessions like phone calls and large group communication sessions like live-streamed sports matches and concerts, online gaming sessions, and so on, where many receivers may be interested in receiving the same audio, video, or text.  A second example of the type of results derived in this work demonstrates the importance of a seemingly very simple question about the role of each cable or wire in a large network that includes both "wired" and "wireless" communication. Here wired communication includes communication over a traditional phone line, ethernet cable, or home cable provider while wireless communication refers to communication through the air as with a cell phone.  The question posed is how much the network capability or "capacity" changes when we remove a single cable from a larger network.  For example, we might ask how much the network capacity changes if you unplug a single ethernet cable in your home or office, or your cable service providers unplugs a single link somewhere in its network. It turns out that this seemlngly simple problem is unsolved in general and that its solution would yield solutions to many other questions that appear, at least on their surface, to be unrelated.  Results in this project include both derivation of new connections to this problem and progress on solving these questions -- showing, for example, that adding or removing a single cable can have an impact on the network's capacity that is far greater than the capacity of the cable alone.    Together, these types of results both steer us to the problems of maximal import and work towards finding their solution.
