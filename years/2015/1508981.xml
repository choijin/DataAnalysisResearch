<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Epidemics (whether measles, ebola, or the flu) affect youth, but many of the concepts related to how epidemics work (and how to prevent them) are hard to convey to young learners. This project explores how and whether technology can help youth ages 10-14 years learn about how disease epidemics spread and how to prevent them by participating in and experiencing a virtual epidemic outbreak in a massive online community. The project will also provide data to epidemiologists to help understand how educating kids might change the course of epidemics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses prominent features of virtual worlds--persistence, real time, personal representation, and massive numbers of players--to allow tweens to experience and investigate an epidemic outbreak. A virtual epidemic will be 'unleashed' on a widely used online virtual learning space, Whyville, simulating important aspects of disease including movement of people and contact in social networks, incubation periods, exposure and exposure mitigation, and the utility of presymptomatic testing. Using an innovative combination of observational methods and field experiments, this pilot research will provide insights into how we can design such large-scale online activities to promote individual and community inquiry. The research will explore how public health prevention and protection measures are connected to behavioral changes, conceptual understanding of infection, immunity, and associated social issues. Measures will include youth behaviors online in the virtual world (including chat and logfile analysis, use of the virtual 'protective gear' or 'hand washing' features, and engagement with outbreak-related materials online, including live chats with an epidemiologist.)</AbstractNarration>

We used the data from these players participating in a virtual epidemic to gain insights on (1) how we can design such large-scale online activities to promote individual and community science inquiry and (2) to understand how public health prevention and protection measures are connected to behavioral changes, conceptual understanding of infection and immunity, and associated social issues. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">In 2016, we designed and implemented two strains of a virtual infectious disease and released them into the virtual world of Whyville.net. The design of the virtual epidemic reflected real-life features of infectious viruses that are particularly dangerous in the real world, like Ebola, especially in the proportions of time allotted for the incubation, latent, infectious, &nbsp;and symptomatic &nbsp;periods. The incubation period, i.e. the time between infection and becoming infectious, was intentionally short (days 1-2), while the latent period, i.e. the time between infection and showing &nbsp;symptoms, was long (days 1-5). This allowed the virus to spread quickly as players could be infectious before showing symptoms, unknowingly spreading the virus around the virtual world. We also chose a long infectious period (days 3-9) so that the virus would spread widely, with a symptomatic period (days 6-10) where the ratio of the latent period to symptomatic period was greater than one (in this case 7:5; important from an epidemiological perspective as again, &nbsp;players are infectious longer than they are symptomatic). To begin the epidemic, we infected 100 Whyvillians, a number chosen by the developers of the world based on prior experience with infections, on the first few days of the epidemic and then let the virus run.

We studied several preventive measures that allowed Whyvillians to take action against the epidemic and allowed them to investigate their own infectious status before symptoms showed. As expected, use of preventive &nbsp;measures and checks for infection went up during infection and down in between infectious periods. Our research also demonstrated that the virtual epidemic successfully drew emotional responses and that these emotional responses were linked with actions taken in regard to the disease.
