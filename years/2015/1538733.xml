<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Research Alliance project focuses on the translation and transfer of higher efficiency Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) photovoltaic (PV) technologies that are derived from the expertise and discoveries in advanced materials processing and devices from the Next Generation Photovoltaics Center (NGPV), a NSF funded Industry and University Co-Operative Research Center.  CdTe PV is currently competitive for generating electricity in many parts of the world (e.g. 7-9 cents/kWhr from utility scale projects without subsidy) and the costs are decreasing rapidly. However, the objective of this work is to advance the CdTe technology to the point where solar is a competitive source of energy in all regions for individual home owners and a variety of applications which are now considered too expensive to be done electrically.  To achieve this, the work proposed under this award will enable a significant increase in device efficiency while also addressing manufacturing methods to reduce costs.  This could have a direct impact on further developing the U.S. based CdTe industry with the potential for significant economic growth and job creation.  In addition, results from this research will lead to cost-effective opportunities to displace greenhouse-gas emitting technologies with PV technology and corresponding benefits to the environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovation ecosystem that will be enhanced includes all the leading groups in CdTe PV technology space. The proposed project will be led by Colorado State University (CSU), which has a long history of successful CdTe PV research and is a founding member of the NGPV. The primary research partner and third-party investor will be First Solar, Inc., the largest U.S. manufacturer of solar panels.  CSU will also be joined by the Center for Renewable Energy Systems at Loughborough university in UK (CREST), the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and material supplier 5N Plus.  Students will gain entrepreneurial and technology translation experience through working with industry on their research projects and formal student training in innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology transfer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The project will advance CSU's state-of-the-art deposition systems and pursue two separate routes to higher-efficiency manufacturing-friendly cells.  The first route will be to advance the research on unique device structures to move them to commercialization, and the second will be to develop PV devices with a higher bandgap suitable for multi-junction cells.  In addition, detailed characterization of these advanced devices will be performed. The proposed effort will have a clear line of sight to mass production and has the potential to significantly increase the efficiency of both single-junction and multi-junction CdTe-based solar cells.</AbstractNarration>

Electricity generation by CdTe thin-film photovoltaics (PV) offers a strong potential to address this challenge.This Accelerating Innovation Research Alliance project has significantly advanced the state of the art in  CdTe based photovoltaic (PV).  The research alliance including the Next Generation Photovoltaics Center (NSF I/UCRC) at Colorado State University (CSU), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the Center for Renewable Energy Systems in UK (CREST), First Solar and 5N Plus has effectively collaborated to advance device performance and the fundamental understanding of the technology.    The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is below ~4 cents/kWh from CdTe PV without subsidy and the costs are decreasing while the national average LCOE from all sources is 11 cents/kWh.     Intellectual Merit.   Our Alliance works to impact the PV industry with technologies developments that span across the value chain.  Efforts include basic research (density functional theory or DFT) materials science computational simulation, world record device efficiencies to technologies deployed directly on member company manufacturing lines.   Driven by industry input, our focus over the last two years has been to advance device efficiencies.  With partial support from this project, the efficiency of CdTe PV device was increased to 20.1% on low cost sodalime glass and with process that have a line of sight to mass production. These are the highest efficiency demonstrated on these substrates by any academic institution or national laboratory.  This project developed novel semiconductor alloys, novel processing methods, novel defect-passivation approaches, and novel device structures.  At the same time, understanding of the defects, interfaces, and the device physics of the advanced devices was advanced. In parallel, close coupling with industry continued to disseminate the benefits of the research.     Broader Impacts.   The most significant broader impact is the production of clean energy globally on an unprecedented scale.  This will also provide a major benefit for the U.S. economy and will create thousands of well-paying jobs in the U.S.  This program provides a unique collaborative environment between the PV industry and university researchers that enabled significant advances in PV.  Spearheaded by the CSU the Alliance has been the forefront of the CdTe thin film PV technology.  Aided by their long term collaboration, Alliance  member First Solar, (NASDAQ: FSLR) has recently expanded manufacturing capacity from approximately 2 GW/yr to nearly 6 GW/yr  In addition to driving a clean energy adoption, We continue to aggressively peruse entrepreneurial venture development and technology transfer.  Three foundational technologies have been translated out of our IUCRC Center to industry.   All the results from this project have been broadly disseminated in invited talks, publications, etc. The project has partially supported the graduate education of 6 Ph.D students and 2 M.S students and 16 undergraduate students.
