<AbstractNarration>A better understanding of the full life cycle of star clusters, from birth to death, is important for many areas of astronomy, including the formation and evolution of galaxies, the initial stellar mass function, the fraction of stars forming in clusters, and for understanding whether the conditions for star formation in the early universe when now-ancient globular clusters were young are the same as they are today.  The goal of this program is to shed light on two as-yet poorly understood epochs in the life cycle of a star cluster -- just before they are born and very soon after they form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program supports the training of a postdoctoral researcher. Results from the research done for this project will be used in age-appropriate, hands-on, activities as part of  'Girls in Science', an all-day outreach event aimed to foster middle-school girls' interest in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will study the formation of star clusters, and also their destruction, in nearby galaxies.  Star cluster formation is one of the most fundamental processes in galaxies, and occurs over an incredibly diverse range of environments and physical conditions, far broader than those found in the Milky Way alone.  Clusters are born in the dense parts of giant clouds of molecular gas, and many are subsequently dispersed by several different physical processes.  The goal of this program is to shed light on two as-yet poorly understood epochs in the life cycle of a star cluster -- just before they are born and very soon after they form.  Observations with the National Science Foundation's new Atacama Large Millimeter Array enable direct study of clouds in distant galaxies covering a much wider range of physical conditions than our nearest neighbors.  The properties of these clouds, particularly their mass functions, when compared with those of young star clusters in the same galaxy, provide important clues to understand the efficiency with which stars and clusters form under different physical conditions.  Even as clusters are forming within molecular clouds, the energy and momentum injected by newly born massive stars pushes out left-over interstellar material, which eventually shuts off star formation and leaves many young clusters gravitationally unbound.  Physical constraints on this process are poor, but measurements of the ionized gas both inside and outside of very young clusters using observations with the newly commissioned Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) will distinguish between different predictions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many and probably most stars form in groups and clusters rather thanby themselves.  Evidence indicates that our sun formed as part of a cluster of stars over 4.5 billion years ago, which subsequently dissolved (became gravitationally unbound), leaving the sun to wander alone through the galaxy.  This proposal deals with the physical processes that drive the life cycle of stars (like our sun), fromtheir birth in star clusters which form in dense molecular clumps located within massive clouds of molecular gas, to their subsequent evolution, eventual unbinding, and death. We have spent the last decade studying the star cluster populations ina variety of nearby galaxies using observations taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.  For these observations, we have found that the ageand mass distributions of clusters in these galaxies have surprising and unexpected regularities.  These studies help trace the evolutionof the clusters after their birth, but cannot say much about the birth process itself. Far less is known about the earliest phases of cluster formation because we know far less about the distribution and properties of the molecular gas out of which they form.  However, with the new Atacama Large Millimeter Array or ALMA operating at full power, we are now able to study the molecular gas at physical scales approaching those of clusters in galaxies outside of the Milky Way.  We have studied the star cluster and molecular cloud mass distributions for 6 galaxies, and find some intriguing results.  The shapes of the mass functions of the molecular clouds are similar to, although possibly slightlysteeper than (has more lower mass clouds compared to higher mass clouds), those of the clusters which form out of them.  This is somewhat surprising, because previous studies of very nearby galaxies suggested that molecular clouds have mass distributions that are slightly shallower than those of the clusters.  This result indicates that the efficiency with which clusters form out of molecular cloudsdoes not dependt strongly on the initial mass of the clouds. We have also determined the mass-radius relation and mass function of dense clumps (within molecular clouds) in the Large Magellanic Cloud, only the 2nd galaxy after the Milky Way where this has been done.  Molecular clumps have physical sizes which are comparable to those ofclusters, suggesting these are the sites where clusters actually form.We have found that the mass-radius relation of LMC clumps are quite similar to those in the Milky Way, and that the mass function of the clumps has a shape that is very similar to that of young star clusters, again suggesting that the cluster formation efficiency is approximately independent of the initial mass of the clumps.
