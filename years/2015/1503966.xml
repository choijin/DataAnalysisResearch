<AbstractNarration>Arctic snow and ice form an integral part of the climate system.  They have undergone unprecedented changes within the past decade.  Initial studies on the potential remote and larger scale influences of their variability have often been inconclusive and even contradictory.  In a recent review article, the principal investigators (PIs) of this proposal hypothesized that sea ice and snow cover can combine to force large-scale atmospheric variability.  This project focuses on analyzing reanalysis datasets and model output from targeted numerical modeling experiments in order to understand the physical pathways linking sea ice and snow cover variability with atmospheric climate variability.  This variability may, in turn, influence mid-latitude weather on seasonal time scales.  Understanding such processes is anticipated to improve weather prediction on similar time scales, with consequent benefits to the energy, farming, and reinsurance industries, amongst others.  The project will contribute to STEM manpower development through providing support for the training of a graduate student, entrainment of undergraduate students into scientific research, and development of a short course of climate prediction. Finally, the project will promote international collaboration with a German research institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prescribed sea ice and snow cover perturbation experiments with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) will lead to a quantitative assessment of the physical pathways between sea ice, snow cover and the initiation and maintenance of atmospheric variability, particularly in winter, that cannot be accomplished using statistical analysis alone.  The use of a high-top model, which has only recently become available, to study the influence of sea ice and snow cover on the hemispheric winter circulation is novel to this proposal.  In parallel, the PIs will collaborate with colleagues running similar experiments with ECHAM6.  They will further analyze reanalysis atmospheric data, to test hypotheses about the combined role of sea ice and snow cover in climate variability learned from the model output.  The proposed project will analyze the combined impact of sea ice and snow cover anomalies on atmospheric climate variability.  This will improve understanding of the atmospheric response associated with changes in sea ice and snow cover, and lead to a quantitative assessment of the links between high-latitude and lower-latitude climates as well as enable improved climate predictions.  The proposed research focuses specifically on the combined role of sea ice and snow cover in the initiation and maintenance of the dominant mode of high-latitude atmospheric variability, i.e. the annular mode.  Modulation of the annular mode is hypothesized to be a key physical mechanism for climate feedback in high latitudes and is the dominant mode of variability in the mid-latitudes including the industrial centers of the United States, Europe and Asia.  The conceptual framework developed in this project will be applied in an operational seasonal forecast model at the end of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is convincing scientific evidence that the Earth is warming as a result of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations from anthropogenic activities. The Arctic region exhibits amplified signs of this warming, particularly the rapidly declining sea ice extent in summer and early fall. A decrease in sea ice further feedbacks on the Arctic atmosphere resulting in amplified warming of the region.  The decrease in Arctic snow cover has been at least as dramatic as the decrease in Arctic sea ice cover further amplifying the warming in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.     Coincident with amplified Arctic warming has been an observed increase in extreme weather.  A recent topic of scientific inquiry and debate is whether the increased extreme weather and AA may be physically linked. Because of the disruptive and costly impacts on society and ecosystems of extreme weather events, this potential linkage has garnered a great deal of interest by the media, public, business leaders and policymakers.     Our project studying the relationship between variability in snow cover and sea ice and its relationship with Northern Hemisphere weather is very timely.  Our study as well as many others show a significant relationship between sea ice and snow cover extent and winter climate anomalies across the Northern Hemisphere.  We found that the wintertime circulation covaries strongly with October hemispheric snow cover and November sea ice extent variability, particularly in the Arctic Barents-Kara (BK) Seas. However, Arctic snow cover and sea ice influences interact with the large-scale atmosphere differently through the cold season.     A second study supports that ENSO influences mid-latitude weather in the North Pacific sector but is less clear in the North Atlantic sector.  In contrast, the analysis supports that Arctic influence is symmetric about the hemisphere.  Furthermore, decadal trends better match variability in the Arctic and are associated with low sea ice and high snow cover than tropical variability.  We further found that in the mid-latitudes, temperature variability has increased over the period of amplified Arctic warming contrary to expectations.  This analysis supports the idea that temperature swings across the mid-latitudes have become more extreme, popularly referred to as "weather whiplash."    Much of our previous work linking Eurasian snow cover and Arctic sea ice with winter weather involves a pathway through the polar vortex.  We have argued that increasing snow cover and declining Arctic sea ice cover favor a weak polar vortex.  During the period of amplified Arctic warming Eurasian snow cover has increased and Arctic sea ice has declined.  Using machine learning, we show that over the last 37 years, the frequency of weak vortex states in mid to late winter (January and February) has increased which was accompanied by subsequent cold extremes in the mid-latitudes. Most of the mid-latitude cooling in the era of Arctic amplification, i.e. since 1990, is explained by the increased frequency of weak polar vortex states.    Finally, we are studying the relationship between Arctic warming and severe winter weather across the mid-latitudes in general and across the United States in particular.  Using a recently developed index of severe winter weather, we show that the occurrence of severe winter weather in the United States is significantly related to anomalies in pan-Arctic circualtion anomalies: as the Arctic transitions from a relatively cold state to a warmer one, the frequency of severe winter weather in mid-latitudes increases through the transition.  We also found that heavy snowfalls have been increasing in the Northeastern US in the period of amplified Arctic warming.
