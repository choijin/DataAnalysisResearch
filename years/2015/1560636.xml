<AbstractNarration>Project description for general audience:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The global community is currently experiencing unprecedented levels of forced migration; 59.5 million individuals around the world have been displaced involuntarily owing to conflict, human rights violations, and other forms of persecution. This research project examines how the local, host population is affected by an influx of refugees, specifically with regards to host citizens' national identity, demand for state-provided public goods and services, and preferences over immigration policies. The research examines whether or not refugees may strengthen nearby native citizens' national identity and solidarity. It involves a survey with citizen respondents in Tanzania, a country with an extensive history of hosting various refugee groups. This survey will compare attitudes and behaviors of citizens living in refugee-hosting districts to those in similar districts without refugees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technical description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do refugees impact their local, host environments? This research project theorizes that the exogenous shock of forced migration may have unintended yet positive consequences for nationalism and nation-building in the host country. Refugees may strengthen nearby native citizens' nationalism as national identity is the obvious point of difference between natives and refugees. Additionally, the influx of international and government aid into refugee camps often stands in contrast to the lack of local public goods in nearby host communities. Refugees, by challenging national borders and highlighting inequalities in welfare, can inadvertently spur host citizens to rally around their national identity and better cooperate in providing and demanding for public goods and services. The survey randomly varies the level of salience of refugees and uses new methods to measure the complex dimensions of national identity and migrant threat.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A common claim about contemporary African politics is that citizens feel low attachment to their nation relative to subnational identities such as ethnicity. Consequently, low nationalism is implicated in an array of problems in sub-Saharan Africa, such as poor public goods provision and government accountability.</p> <p>How do refugees impact the social and political identities and preferences of host citizens? This project examines how the presence of refugees impacts local citizens' attachment to their national identity. It first theorizes that the influx and settlement of refugees make salient for citizens the negative consequences (real or perceived) of their nation-state's weak borders, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where territorial borders were artificially created and difficult to defend. Therefore, citizens feel compelled to turn to other national boundaries of exclusion, which may be social and symbolic, such as heightening their attachment to national identity (Hypothesis 1). Second, this project theorizes that increased national attachment, operating through anti-migrant sentiment, may have downstream consequences of citizens uniting to better provide public goods for their fellow citizens (Hypothesis 2).</p> <p>Using an original geo-coded survey experiment, as well as elite interviews and village focus groups, this project finds that the presence of refugees substantially increases local citizens&rsquo; attachment to their national identity and decreases their attachment to ethnic identities. However, this increased national attachment does not necessarily translate into greater participation in public goods cooperation. These findings call into question whether increased nationalism, especially the type generated from anti-migrant attitudes, leads to better development outcomes in Africa.</p> <p>Due to its peacefulness relative to neighboring countries, the porous nature of its borders, and its pan-African inclusiveness, Figure 1 shows that Tanzania has hosted numerous refugee populations, including a recent massive influx of over 130,000 Burundians starting in April 2015. These refugees are hosted at the Nyarugusu refugee camp located in Kigoma region. This camp was established in 1996 and as of mid-2016 housed approximately 200,000 refugees, mostly Congolese and Burundian refugees.</p> <p>To measure how these refugee populations affect local citizens, the primary data for this project is a geo-coded survey experiment conducted from May-August 2016 with 2027 citizen respondents, randomly chosen from across the six districts in Kigoma, western Tanzania using a multi-stage stratified sampling process. Figure 2 shows the map of the survey site and where citizen respondents are located with respect to the refugee camp.</p> <p>The main analysis compares attitudes and behaviors of a) citizen respondents living nearer versus farther from the main refugee camp in the region, Nyarugusu, and b) respondents randomly given factual information on refugees in their country within the survey. Specifically, the three informational treatments within the survey, called &ldquo;Refugee-Info,&rdquo; &ldquo;Refugee-AidInfo,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Refugee-ConflictInfo,&rdquo; give general population information on the refugees at Nyarugusu camp, additional information about the aid that refugees receive, and additional information about the conflict which displaced the refugees, respectively.</p> <p>The main outcomes of interest are respondents' attachment to their national identity relative to their ethnic group, regional, East African, pan-African, and unique, personal identities. The behavioral outcomes of the survey measure respondents' i) willingness to contribute to a public good, a national education fund, for fellow Tanzanian families and ii) willingness send an SMS to make a complaint about public goods provision to their local government. Lastly, the survey examines the types of migrant threat that may explain anti-refugee attitudes in local citizens.&nbsp;</p> <p>For Hypothesis 1, Figure 3 shows that across survey informational treatment groups, citizens living closest to the refugee camp feel greater attachment to their national identity compared to citizens living farther away. Additionally, giving citizens information about refugees and the aid they receive increases these effects on national identity, but giving information about the conflict which displaced the refugees decreases these effects. Figure 4 shows that across survey treatment groups, citizens living closest to the refugee camp feel decreased attachment to their ethnic identity compared to citizens living farther away. Giving citizens information about refugees and the aid they receive decreases these effects on ethnic identity, but giving information about the conflict which displaced the refugees increases these effects.</p> <p>Hypothesis 2 asks whether refugee settlement can not only drive citizens to feel more national but also have unexpected downstream consequences for public good provision. However, Figures 5 and 6 show that citizens near the refugee camp are no more likely to contribute more to a national education fund or send an SMS complaint to their local government.</p> <p>Ultimately, prior social science research shows that social diversity and prosocial behaviors are often negatively associated. These findings confirm that willingness to be active citizens in pro-social ways may not be able to overcome anti-social, exclusionary attitudes against migrants.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Yang-Yang&nbsp;Zhou</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560636/1560636_10413328_1498844925458_KigomaSurveySite-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560636/1560636_10413328_1498844925458_KigomaSurveySite-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 2.
