<AbstractNarration>Under the European colonial institutions of slavery and indenture, hundreds of thousands of migrant laborers were displaced across the globe. The expansion of plantation agriculture and such massive labor migrations were critical to the development of global economic networks, while on the local level labor diasporas resulted in the emergence of new creolized cultures. Since major movements of people across the globe for economic reasons continue today understanding long term processes involved is of contemporary relevance. This comparative study contextualizes slave and post-slave experiences within an indentured labor regime that overlapped and replaced it. Archaeology's material and spatial nature is well suited to investigate both the daily practices and experiences of laborers, as well as the larger regional networks of which plantations were a part. This project will extend the scope of current research on and among migrant and diaspora populations, considering how choice in migration and perceptions of one's mobility influence ongoing identity practices. Engaging with transnational studies will provide a new model for archaeologists examining such populations, contribute to our understanding of the historical and material implications of labor migrations, and illuminate where and how global capitalism developed in the Indian Ocean region. This research will take place in Bras d'Eau National Park, an 18th-19th-century sugar plantation on the island of Mauritius. As part of the first large-scale investigation into an Indian Ocean plantation site, this project will add tangible heritage value to the Bras d'Eau National Park, and introduce archaeology to the Mauritian public. Mauritian students studying history and heritage and park personnel will participate in fieldwork and artifact analysis as a means to build local infrastructure and knowledge. Such exposure will increase public scientific literacy and engagement by educating about the archaeological process, and the potential of archaeological sites on Mauritius to shed light on hidden aspects of the island's past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Julia Jong Haines, under supervision of Dr. Adria LaViolette, University of Virginia, will investigate how enslaved and indentured laborers' materials and spaces reflect different social organizations and practices and how they changed over time. Were the daily lives of enslaved (mostly SE African) and indentured (mostly South Asian) laborers markedly different? What difference did laborers' homelands make in diaspora cultural practices? How were laborers engaged in local and global trade and exchange networks, and did they maintain ties to their homelands? Data and materials collected through archaeological survey, excavations, and documentary archival and oral historical research will be used to compare laborers' daily life consumption patterns that indicate foodways, personal and religious practices, domestic architecture and spatial arrangements, and participation in domestic and international economies. Engaging with both well-established creolization models and recent transnational labor migration studies, this study will determine to what degree different laborers practiced creolized identities and maintained ties to homelands while also creating new creolized practices. Untangling the complexities of creation and expression in daily life among Bras d'Eau's diverse population, this project will contribute to Mauritian heritage, and comparative archaeologies of diaspora contexts.</AbstractNarration>

Mauritius sits approximately 900 km east of Madagascar in the southwest Indian Ocean, and became the &ldquo;key to the Indian Ocean&rdquo; for European imperial powers in the mid-1700s. In 1834, a time when the island was becoming a major center of industrial sugar production, the British abolished slavery across their empire. Estate owners needed a new reliable source of labor. In Mauritius, this resulted in some 450,000 indentured laborers coming to the island, primarily from India, between 1835-1910. Building on archaeological studies on colonial entanglements predominantly in the Atlantic world, this Indian Ocean case study provides an important comparative example of European and southern hemisphere interactions.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From July 2015 to November 2016, fieldwork and public outreach was conducted using the varied methods of historical archaeology. The project brought together multiple lines of evidence including archival data, the mapping of archaeological landscapes, excavation, and artifact and botanical analysis. The landscape of the Bras d&rsquo;Eau plantation was analyzed through archaeological and archival lenses, both of which provide an enduring record of meaningful actions in the past: the desires, agency and experiences of both estate managers and laborers. Bras d&rsquo;Eau was a working farm and sugar plantation that operated from 1786 to 1868, located on the northeast coast of Mauritius. The largest archaeological features in the park are the c. 27 km of roads that crisscross the property. The roads divided the estate into field blocks, and would have facilitated the movement of plantation products to the mill, the railroad that was eventually constructed, or the coast for transport to the main international shipping ports. Eight hectares of ruins were uncovered and mapped in Bras d&rsquo;Eau (see Fig. 1).

Within the centralized area, the industrial work-spaces related to the functioning of the plantation were distinctly separated from the dwelling area for laborers. Laborers were all concentrated in a single area, essentially forming a village in close quarters. The laborers&rsquo; quarter consisted of four rows of parallel barracks-style housing, constructed and organized by estate management, and individual houses scattered between the barracks built by laborers themselves. Through excavations in the laborers&rsquo; housing we discovered artifacts of local and foreign origins that indentured laborers consumed.
