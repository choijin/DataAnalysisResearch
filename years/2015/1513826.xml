<AbstractNarration>The nascent Science of Security (SoS) seeks to develop the principles with which to understand how computing systems are architected, built, used, and maintained with a view to understanding and addressing security challenges systematically across their life cycle.  This workshop will help further research in the field.  HotSoS is a follow-on to the NSF/NSA sponsored Science of Security Community meeting held in conjunction with the 2012 SaTC Principal Investigators meeting.  In the first year as a separate event, HotSos 2014 had 150 attendees.  For the 2015 event, the PI anticipates 150-200 attendees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the travel grant program is to encourage participation in HotSoS by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Availability of student travel grants is publicized through the website and announcements, with particular encouragement for women and underrepresented groups to apply. Preference for awards is given to full-time students with limited other means to support their participation, with priority given to students who are presenting papers at HotSoS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2015 Symposium and Bootcamp on the Science of Security (HotSoS) was held April 21-22 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign National Center for Supercomputing Applications.  This third annual conference brought together researchers from numerous disciplines seeking a methodical, rigorous scientific approach to identifying and removing cyber threats. Part of the Science of Security effort, the HotSoS goal is to understand how computing systems are designed, built, used, and maintained with an understanding of their security issues and challenges.  It seeks not only to put scientific rigor into research, but also to identify the scientific value and underpinnings of cybersecurity.  David Nicol, Director of the Illinois Trust Institute and co-PI for the Illinois Science of Security Lablet, was conference chair.  Introducing the event, he called for participants to interact and share ideas, thoughts, and questions about the nature of security and the nascent science that is emerging. Kathy Bogner, Intelligence Community Coordinator for Cybersecurity Research, represented the NSA sponsor and welcomed the group, noting the governmentÃ†s long term interest and commitment to their work.   She challenged them to continue to address cybersecurity using strong scientific principles and methods and to share the fruits of that work.  She cited the numbers of universities and individual collaborators engaged in Science of Security research as an indication of activity and growth in the field.   Three experts in the field of the Science of Security gave keynote addresses. Tutorials and a workshop were conducted with concurrent paper presentations.  Five tutorials covered social network analysis; human behavior; policy-governed secure collaboration, security-metrics-driven evaluation, design, development and deployment; and resilient architectures.  The workshop focused on analyzing papers from the security literature to determine how completely authors describe their research methods.    Thirteen researchers from the United Kingdom and the United States presented individual papers on studies about signal intelligence analyst tasks, detecting abnormal user behavior, tracing cyber-attack analysis processes, vulnerability prediction models, preemptive intrusion detection, enabling forensics, global malware encounters, workflow resiliency, sanctions, password policies, resource-bounded systems integrity assurance, active cyber defense and science of trust.   NSF provided a travel grant for students attendees of the symposium. The grant covered hotel rooms and conference meals for 15 graduate students.
