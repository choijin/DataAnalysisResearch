<AbstractNarration>KAUST-NSF Research Conference on Electronic Materials, Devices and Systems for&lt;br/&gt;a  Sustainable Future&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronics has played a big role in shaping our lives around the globe in the areas of communications, healthcare, safety, energy and transportation.  At present times, one of the biggest priorities should be in refocusing our scientific research on a sustainable future, finding technological fixes to environment degradation, reduction of poverty, access to clean water, healthcare and energy for all.  Electronic materials and devices are finding increasing applications in systems that pertain to a sustainable and interconnected world making a difference in the world and improving people's everyday lives. It is important for scientists and engineers all across the globe to share their research, discovery and dissemination of practices and strategies in these areas and promote involvement of young bright minds.  This proposal intends to achieve these goals by organizing a conference at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia on March 14-16, 2016.  The invited speakers will constitute an international body of luminaries in these fields. The outcomes envisioned are: a) Establishing a culture of sustainability-focused high-tech research; b) Attracting bright young minds from all over the world for exchange of ideas; c) Promoting science-engineering education and research through collaboration; d) Encouraging participation and contribution of women in science and engineering; e) Promoting science, technology, engineering and math among the K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support the participation of six excellent junior faculty members, researchers, postdocs and graduating students to the KAUST-NSF Research Conference on Electronic Materials, Devices and Systems for A Sustainable Future to be held in March 2016 at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.  The proposed symposium will gather world leading researchers, mid-career and rising stars, and the KAUST research community to exchange ideas and to foster a collaborative platform to pursue fundamental and applied research in the area of electronic devices, materials and systems focusing on sustainable future.  The objective and goal of this conference is to highlight and to bridge the gap between the complementary growth of electronics and information technology and to explore what more can be done to use such pervasive technologies for a sustainable future. Disciplines   like (i) Chemical and Biological Science and Engineering; (ii) Environmental Science and Engineering; (iii) Marine Science; (iv) Electrical and Computer Engineering; and (v) Material Science and Engineering will be covered. Sensors, smart devices, energy harvesting, storage, and cyber-physical systems will be some of the important topics that are planned to be discussed in the conference.</AbstractNarration>
