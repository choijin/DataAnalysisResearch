<AbstractNarration>The conference entitled "Summer School on Moduli Problems in Symplectic Geometry" will take place at the IHES (Institute des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques) in Bures-sur-Yvette, France from July 6-17, 2015. The conference website is located at https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=585. This conference will provide PhD students, postdocs, and young researchers with an overview of the most recent technology in symplectic geometry, as well as faciliate collaborations to further develop this technology. This grant will provide travel funding for young US researchers lacking other federal support, with an emphasis on members of underrepresented groups, to attend this conference. This will enable the next generation of US researchers to keep up with the latest developments and stay at the forefront of symplectic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic geometry has made enormous advances since the introduction of (pseudo)holomorphic curves by Gromov in 1985. However in order to use holomorphic curves in symplectic geometry, a substantial amount of analysis is needed to regularize the moduli spaces of holomorphic curves. In the 80's and 90's these moduli spaces were regularized using geometric perturbation techniques. However since then, symplectic geometry has moved beyond the scope of problems to which geometric perturbation techniques are applicable, leaving a serious gap in the foundations of the subject. Perhaps the most successful and promising technology for filling this gap is the polyfold theory of Hofer, Wysocki and Zehnder. The conference has two main goals. The first goal is to educate a large audience in polyfold theory, in order to enable more researchers to begin developing and using these new techniques. The second goal is to connect the abstract perturbations of polyfolds to the classical geometric perturbations in order to facilitate computations of invariants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Symplectic geometry is the fundamental geometry underlying classical mechanics. It is related to physical questions such as: Is the solar system stable? How can one send a space mission to Mars most efficiently?   In the last three decades, major breakthroughs have been made in symplectic geometry using a new technique, namely studying moduli spaces of holomorphic curves, and this has led to much better understanding of dynamics. However, in recent years, the moduli space technology has run into a kind of barrier, due to difficulties with "transversality", and new mathematical foundations are required to make further progress. The most promising such new foundation is the theory of "polyfolds". However the theory of polyfolds is extremely complex and technical, and until recently was not so well understood by workers in symplectic geometry.   In July 2015, a workshop was held at the IHES (Institute des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques) near Paris, France, in order to clarify the limits of classical methods for dealing with transversality, and to explain to a broader audience how polyfold theory can be used to go beyond these limits. This grant provided full or partial funding for 33 US-based participants to attend the workshop. All of these funded participants were graduate students or postdocs, and 14 were women or members of underrepresented groups.   As a result of this grant, these 33 young US mathematicians were able to keep up with the latest developments in symplectic geometry, and to bring their acquired knowledge back to a broad swathe of US universities. Another outcome of the grant is that an archive of videos from the workshop was posted on youtube, linked from the conference website https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/585/ so that other mathematicians who could not attend the workshop can at least view the main discussions that took place.
