<AbstractNarration>This project studies the security of representative personalized services, such as search engines, news aggregators, and on-line targeted advertising, and identifies vulnerabilities in service components that can be exploited by pollution attacks to deliver contents intended by attackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also develops defense-in-depth countermeasures against pollution attacks. These include new server-side mechanisms to prevent the various cross-site-request-forgery schemes that allow an attacker to insert actions. The defense mechanisms also include a distributed data collection, measurement and analysis framework to detect anomalies in browsing behaviors and information contents that are indicative of pollution of user profiles or population preferences. The new information analysis techniques use machine learning and natural language processing to identify differences (e.g., missing information) that are significant or important to a user. The project also develops tools to alert users and guide them to understand and repair profiles, and studies regulatory models to incentivize the industry to adopt a more transparent practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops an evaluation framework to facilitate the development and adoption of technologies. The evaluation plan includes user studies involving real, diverse user groups on the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To transition technologies to practice, this project makes the tools freely available, and deploys data collection and measurement systems on the Internet. This project also educates users about pollution attacks and engages with users to improve the usability of the tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The underlying algorithms of Internet information services rely on inputs from the open environment, the Internet, that provides opportunities for attackers to compromise the integrity of input data and affect the output. Indeed, new attacks are emerging in which attackers are polluting users? individual profiles or generating large-scale user behaviors and hence fake preferences to affect the information contents delivered to users. These are serious threats to our society, for example, with falsified information served to users they can compromise the integrity of e-commerce and even our political process.  The EPICA project studied the security of representative personalized services, such as Google Search, news aggregators, and on-line targeted advertising, and identified vulnerabilities in service components that can be exploited by pollution attacks to deliver contents intended by attackers. The EPICA project also developed defense-in-depth countermeasures against pollution attacks. These include new server-side mechanisms to prevent the various cross-site-request-forgery schemes that allow an attacker to insert actions, a distributed data collection, measurement and analysis framework to detect anomalies in browsing behaviors and information contents that are indicative of pollution of user profiles or population preferences, and tools to allow users to protect privacy when browsing the Web or using IoT devices.  The main research activities and resulting technologies and findings from Illinois efforts on this project are:  Our work in social engineering sheds light on the ability of users to evaluate security and privacy risks. For example, users who plugged in dropped USB drives did not belong to a unique subpopulation&mdash;they are neither technically incompetent relative to their peers nor particularly risk loving compared to the general population. Instead, we found that many of the users believe their computers will protect them and they are either not aware of or are more tolerant of the actual risks of plugging in a USB drive. This evidence is a reminder to the security community that less technical attacks, including social engineering as well as information manipulation, remain a real-world threat and that we have yet to understand how to successfully defend against them. Our work points a need for better understanding the dynamics of these attacks as well as, develop better technical defenses against them, and learn how to effectively teach end users about these risks.   We have also enhanced our understanding of how complex websites, such as news sites, are composed and operate. For example, we found that websites load nearly double the number of dependencies than five years ago and that only a negligible number of sites remain altogether dependency-free. Worryingly, one third of the top million sites serve implicitly-trusted, unknown content from ad networks and other third parties&mdash; drastically increasing these sites? attack surface. Not only does this tangle of dependencies introduce a host of security and privacy concerns, but the increased complexity is blocking websites from migrating to HTTPS with nearly one quarter of HTTP sites are blocked from upgrading to HTTPS. These findings motivated future research on security and privacy solutions for the web, prompted service providers to migrate to HTTPS, and encouraged developers to consider the implications of serving third-party content.  Finally, our work in investigating the security and privacy issues of IoT serendipitously allowed us to perform the most comprehensive analysis of IoT threats to date. The Mirai botnet, composed primarily of embedded and IoT devices, took the Internet by storm in late 2016 when it overwhelmed several high-profile targets with massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Through our network measurements, we investigated the precipitous rise of Mirai and the fragile IoT ecosystem it has subverted. We find Mirai?s emergence was primarily based on the absence of security best practices in the IoT space, which resulted in a fragile environment ripe for abuse. As the IoT domain continues to expand and evolve, this work documenting Mirai has served as a call to arms for industrial, academic, and government stakeholders concerned about the security, privacy, and safety of an IoT-enabled world.  This project has resulted in several papers published in the top security and networking conferences. Many information manipulation attacks can be abstracted as integrity properties of systems. Therefore, the principles, techniques, and systems on detecting and mitigating information manipulation developed in this project contribute to the important research areas of networking and distributed systems security.  The results from this project have been integrated into security curriculum at UIUC.  For example, our USB work and IoT work are now taught in both the undergraduate and graduate-level Network Security course. Several Ph.D.and Masters students have worked this project; in particular, two had completed their master thesis research in this project and are now at Apple and Microsoft.
