<AbstractNarration>This award supports the investigation of a novel sensing principle for estimation of positions of ferromagnetic objects through a combination of nature-inspired ideas. The spatial separation of identical sensors for enhanced sensory perception (e.g. dual eyes and ears in animals and humans) will be exploited along with the inherent magnetic fields of objects for determining their position as moving objects. The new sensing principle will enable non-contact measurement of position without requiring the placement of any sensors or sensing components on the ferrous object. Moving ferromagnetic objects such as cars, pistons, spool valves and a large variety of moving components in various machines have magnetic fields which vary as a function of the position around the object.  The spatial variation of an object's magnetic field as a function of position, the measurement of magnetic field at a few discrete spatially separated locations and the use of novel estimation algorithms yield accurate estimation of the position of the monitored objects, with no pre-calibration required. This technology would have extensive applications in automotive, industrial and off-road vehicle domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to exploit the "inherent" magnetic fields of common ferromagnetic objects, a number of technical challenges need to be addressed.  These include unknown magnetic field parameters, the need to design nonlinear observers and the need for estimation techniques that can account for constraints on states and parameters.  These challenges are addressed by using dual sensors with a known separation distance between them and by formulating rigorous observer design methods for nonlinear systems.  The use of redundant sensors enables observability and enables estimation of both parameters and states without requiring pre-calibration. The design of nonlinear observers provides global guarantees of stability, is computationally efficient, elegant, and yields faster convergence.  Constraints on states or parameters, and transient errors due to unexpected magnetic disturbances, are addressed using a moving horizon estimation method in which known bounds are imposed using a constrained optimization formulation.  Major project tasks include analytical study of nonlinear observer design methods, development of disturbance rejection techniques, and implementation of constraint imposition techniques. These will be applied for position estimation for a free-piston engine, a hydraulic cylinder, and an automotive imminent collision detection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed fundamental observer design results for nonlinear dynamic systems.  This included the development of observer design methods for systems with nonlinear output equations which have received very little attention in literature.  It also included the development of systematic algorithms for solutions to bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs) which can be very useful in observer design in order to ensure that multiple stability and performance criteria are simultaneously satisfied.  A fairly general technique for solving bilinear matrix inequalities using convex-concave decomposition and a numerical sequential LMI approach was developed in the project. Three different applications, from three very different domains, were studied to explore the benefits of observer design using spatially separated redundant sensors. The applications studied included magnetic position estimation in linear actuators, active noise cancellation in a stethoscope for auscultation in a noisy Black Hawk medical evacuation helicopter, and tire deflection in an automotive suspension application with unknown road disturbance inputs.  The common theme in all three applications was the use of dual sensors that measure the same type of variable but were separated in spatial location.  The early work done in this project on linear position estimation (using magnetic sensors and nonlinear observer design algorithms) eventually led to a novel idea for a fundamentally new position sensor based on use of an electromagnet and a passive mu-metal film on the moving object.  The advantages of the new sensor include its immunity to disturbances from ferromagnetic objects due to use of a high frequency alternating magnetic field, inexpensive design, and non-contacting operation.  The products from the project include a large number of journal publications and conference presentations, and one patent application. The research team plans to further pursue commercialization of the technology that has been patented.  The broader impacts of the project include the partial support of one post-doctoral fellow, two doctoral students, one undergraduate student and two high school students through project internships. Both high school interns subsequently chose to pursue engineering majors at prominent universities (Caltech and Stanford).
