<AbstractNarration>The Physics REU Site at AAMU is a 10-week summer program that provides research opportunities to 24 talented undergraduate students from institutions with limited or no access to basic research in science and engineering. The project broadens the participation of members of groups that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, especially women. The program attracts physics undergraduates from minority serving institutions with limited opportunities to be involved in active research. The participants will gain experience in technical writing and presenting their research work to a variety of audiences, including dissemination of their results in local, regional, and national scientific conferences focused on undergraduate research and publishing in refereed journals. By training undergraduates in research, the goal is to produce skillful professionals who will contribute to the technological advancement and economic development of the nation.  Through this program participants will be able to enhance their professional and personal portfolio by making unique advancements in experimental design, instrumentation, data acquisition and analysis, as well as engaging in a hands-on research experience with state-of-the-art equipment. Participating students will be actively engaged in cutting-edge research under the direct supervision of dedicated faculty mentors throughout the completion of self-contained ten-week projects in a collaborative research environment. Each participant will have an individual research project funded by an external funding agency with one-on-one mentoring from a faculty member through individual guidance as well as ample interactions with graduate students. The projects will include frontier research in Materials Science, Optics, Bio-photonics, Space Science, and Nanotechnology. The primary goal of the program is to increase the students' knowledge, skills, and communication capabilities in different areas of physics; inspiring them to pursue graduate work in STEM fields, where the underrepresentation of women and minorities is particularly acute. Exposure to a dynamic and diverse research in physics enhances the REU participants' understanding of scientific research and broadens their perspective on related professional careers in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

A range of recruitment strategies for minority and female students resulted in 427 applications for 29 funded spots. The participating students had diverse demographics - 83% African American, 7% Caucasian, 10% Asian American, 55% female, and 38% 1st generation college student. Nearly sixty percent of the participants came from institutions with limited research facilities. Each student worked with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group. REU students attended weekly presentations by University faculty, speakers from NASA and other local scientists, tours of University research facilities and other extracurricular activities. Participating in this intense and individualized environment significantly advanced these students' intellectual development and professional preparation.  Students participated in synergistic meetings and workshops that assisted their development as researchers, improving their technical writing and presentation skills, exposed them to technical research projects, and expanded their knowledge of graduate programs and the process of applying for advanced degrees. Students presented their research to a gathering of STEM faculty, graduate students, and other invited scholars. The program concluded with each student submitting a report on her/his research project and on his/her research experiences. REU students co-authored fourteen articles which were published in refereed scientific journals and made fifteen presentations at state and national meetings. Students were strongly encouraged to continue their projects and to present their results at national student and professional conferences.   To evaluate the impact of the program on students, each participant filled out pre- and post-program surveys, and participated in an individual exit interview.  Students stated that they definitely gained important lab skills, learned new research techniques, and gained more confidence in their research abilities.
