<AbstractNarration>It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this grant is to measure the energy of particles produced at small scattering angles from collisions of atomic nuclei at high energies, carried out at the Brookhaven National Lab using the PHENIX particle detector.  These measurements will help to understand the new state of matter, a plasma of quarks, that is formed from such collisions.  In particular, the results of this measurement are expected to probe the initial conditions of quarks and other strongly-interacting particles in the nucleus before the collision.  In recent years, we have learned that the initial conditions of the quarks before the collision result in hot-spots within the quark-gluon plasma, and how these hot-spots spread their energy within the plasma provides information on this new state of matter. It is worth noting that this research program is carried out at an undergraduate institution, Muhlenberg College, and is a highlight of the Physics Department. Most of the physics majors have participated in it by the time of their graduation. Furthermore, almost all of the participants have chosen to continue in STEM fields after graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theorists have suggested that measurements of transverse energy are a barometer of a state of saturated plasma. Both studies of existing data from a relativistic heavy ion collisions (RHIC) experiment, called the beam energy scan, by the PHENIX Collaboration and work on transverse energy in the forward and backward kinematic regions are testing gluon-saturation models in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions.  To date, transverse energy in the forward and backward kinematic regions has not been reported. Associated with regions of higher net baryon chemical potential on the phase diagram of nuclear matter, these measurements, along with existing transverse energy measurements at central rapidity for a variety of colliding systems and beam energies, provide new insight into the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary investigator (PI) and Muhlenberg College students have participated in research in nuclear physics. Two topics have been investigated, one in the subfield of ultra-relativistic heavy ion physics, which is the study of nuclear matter under extreme conditions (such as those that existed microseconds after the big bang), and the other in the area of ?spin? physics, which is the study of the source of the intrinsic angular momentum of the proton, a building block for all the atoms of the periodic table.  Since 2009, 42 Muhlenberg College undergraduate students have engaged in 52 summer research opportunities, most of which included eight week stints at Brookhaven National Laboratory working with the PHENIX collaboration (an international group of scientists and engineers) which built, operated, and analyzes data from a detector located on the ring of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Many of these students have presented their results at the American Physical Society Division of Nuclear Physics Fall Meeting Conference Experience for Undergraduates poster sessions.  In addition to helping with data-taking, the Muhlenberg group helped to assemble a detector subsystem consisting of resistive plate chambers that contributed to a measurement providing insight into the ?spin? contribution from so-called sea quarks inside the proton. Technically speaking, this is referred to as a measurement of and longitudinal single spin asymmetry AL for forward W?&rarr;&mu;?&nu;   production in polarized  collisions at  = 510 GeV.  In the area of ultra-relativistic heavy ion physics, analysis by the Muhlenberg group of the energy flowing perpendicular to the beamline from particles traveling close to it, i.e., transverse energy in the forward/backward kinematic regions in collisions of large nuclei (such as gold) is ongoing. An understanding of the transverse energy for particles moving close to the beamline enhances our overall understanding of the matter created in these collisions.  Another area supported by this award involved working with high school students in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania on topics in experimental nuclear and particle physics and mentoring them in the PA Junior Academy of Science (PJAS) competitions.  Finally, this award has supported the development of and activities for a low cost muon telescope that undergraduate students can assemble and use in advanced laboratory experiments, enhancing the affordability of nuclear and particle physics experiments in undergraduate teaching labs throughout the country.
