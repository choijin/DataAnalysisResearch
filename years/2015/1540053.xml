<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds to partially support the 18th annual Conference Experience for Undergraduates (CEU), which is held as part of the Fall Meeting of the APS Division of Nuclear Physics. This year's meeting will be held October 28 - 31, 2015, in Santa Fe, NM. The CEU is a natural venue for students who have had an undergraduate research experience to present the results of their work and interact with other students as well as faculty and senior researchers. The CEU has been immensely successful in fostering this interaction, which helps students to have a broad introduction and exposure to research across nuclear physics, and to enable senior researchers to get to know some of the junior future leaders. Partial support will be provided for approximately 32 undergraduate students, out of a planned total of 150.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this grant was to provide travel and lodging  assistance to approximately 32 undergraduate students from around the  nation to participate in the 2015 Conference Experience for  Undergraduates.  CEU15 was held in October 2015 in conjunction with the  joint fall meeting of the Division of Nuclear Physics of the American  Physical Society, in Santa Fe, NM.  A  total of 152 undergraduate students from across the US participated  in CEU15, and events specifically arranged for them included a research  poster session, two nuclear physics seminars, a graduate school fair,  and a social gathering.  Travel award decisions were made on the basis  of project merit, and students submitted a research abstract and a  personal contribution statement in order to be considered.  A team of 10  DNP members served on the review committee, and their recommendations  were used to determine the awards distribution.  Students  benefit from interacting with professionals in the field of nuclear  physics, and several report on being favorably motivated to consider  pursuing an advanced degree in nuclear physics, more so than before they  attended the conference.   Members of the DNP were very supportive of  the undergraduates' presence at the meeting, and several spent time  engaging students in conversation and recruiting them for their graduate  physics programs.
