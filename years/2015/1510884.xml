<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1510884&lt;br/&gt;PI: Hu, David&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eyes of flying insects have soft hairs distributed across their surfaces that keep the eyes clean of airborne particles.  The air flow past the hairs reduces the tendency of airborne particles to deposit on the eye, and the hairs can trap and remove airborne particles before they contact the eye.  This project will study these two characteristics of the insect eye and use the findings to develop a synthetic self-cleaning surface.  The synthetic surface will use fine polymer bristles to mimic the insect's hairs and carry out the self-cleaning functions.  The results of this research could be applied to design and fabricate self-cleaning sensors, solar cells, lenses and other devices.  The team will incorporate their research into an educational module titled "Our Hairy World," which will enable students to understand how engineers and scientists can use results from biology to improve technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project comprises a series of experiments and numerical simulations to explore how the bristles covering insect eyes divert incoming airflows to reduce airborne particle deposition and how the release of stored elastic energy during insect grooming flicks off particles from the bristles.  The interdisciplinary research team will measure the geometry and spacing of bristles in a range of insect eye sizes, fabricate bristled surfaces using soft polymers, conduct computer simulations of flow through bristle arrays, measure the rate of particle deposition on insect eyes and onto synthetic bristled surfaces, and quantify particle removal during insect grooming and replicate this function in a polymeric bristle seeded with iron particles for magnetic activation.  Results of the project will be useful in improved design of microelectronics and other small-scale device components.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    In this award, we studied how aerosol particles attach to insect surfaces.  Aerosol particles such as dust and pollen are common in the air, yet how insects deal with them when they land on their surfaces remains unknown.  For the model organisms of this study, we used both moths and bees because they are frequently found cleaning their bodies using automated grooming motions.  Our study consisted of measuring the geometry of the hairy structures on these animals and then building mimics to study how aerosols deposited on them.  Moths are quite successful insects and account for 160,000 species worldwide.  The male moths must locate female moths using just their antenna.  We measured the antenna geometry of over 49 species of male moths, and found that they all have hierarchal branching structure similar to a pine tree.  The branching helps increase the effective length of antenna, similar to a fractal.  An antenna of a moth ooks just 1 cm long, but actually packs an effective length of 30 cm if you add up all the parts.   We focused our study on the angle of branching.  We used a wind tunnel to build miniature antenna and subjected them to particles.  This experiment is similar to sticking your arm out a car window. How many particles do you expect to catch with your arm?  You would think that sticking your arm perpendicular to the window would be best because that provides the most surface area.  However, we found that 45 degrees is best for catching particle.  This is because particle streamlines will bend as they travel around the antenna, increasing the time of contact and the number of particles that can diffuse to the surface.  In our study of moths, we also 3D printed the first at-scale moth antenna.  Our next study will be on making the synthetic antenna have sensing capability.  For broader impacts, our 3D printed moth antenna received news media attention because it demonstrates how 3D printing can be used as a new manufacturing tool to make parts inspired by insects.  Media websites and journal article that cite the work are from 3D printing industry and biology alike.  The graduate student and undergraduate who were funded by this study won poster and presentation awards at on-campus and national conferences.  We also hosted elementary students on campus for "Our Hairy World" an event to learn about 3D printing can be used to build moth antenna.
