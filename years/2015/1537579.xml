<AbstractNarration>Copepods are ubiquitous animals in marine environments and play a critically-important function in the food web of the world's oceans. The ability of a copepod to sense fluid motion provides an advantage for critical survival tactics such as finding food, finding mates, and avoiding predators. This project will examine the capability of copepods to detect turbulent flow. A turbulent-like flow will be mimicked in a laboratory aquarium as a small vortex (i.e., swirling motion like a tornado), and copepod swimming behavior will be observed in and around the vortex. The goal is to understand the variations in the sensory ecology of three species of copepods with three representative sensor arrays to better explain their temporal and spatial distribution in the ocean in response to turbulence conditions. The project also has a strong education and outreach plan. It will provide interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students in fields such as engineering, biology, and computational sciences.  Further, research results will provide context for planned outreach efforts to educate the general public at local high schools and aquariums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will deconstruct the turbulence-copepod interaction by performing detailed kinematics analysis of swimming in three species of copepods in and around a laboratory realization of a Burgers' vortex that mimics in situ turbulent vortices in the dissipation range of scales. The goal is to test the hypothesis that the copepods Acartia tonsa, Temora longicornis, and Calanus finmarchicus detect hydrodynamic cues related to vortices in turbulent flows and actively respond via changes in swimming kinematics. Using a custom designed and calibrated apparatus, a turbulent-like vortex will be created in the laboratory. By holding the turbulent vortex stable in space, cameras will be focused on a small region of the feature to record the animal behavior relative to well-quantified flow characteristics. The approach has the advantage of eliminating the time-varying and stochastic nature of turbulent flows that make such mechanistic understanding so challenging to achieve. Hypotheses will address questions about the influence of swimming style, setal array architecture, and the interaction of chemical and hydrodynamical cues on the turbulence-copepod interaction. Specifically, the investigators will examine how copepod species with different sensory structures and swimming orientation respond to a stable well-defined laboratory stimulus to determine how copepods exploit the shape and orientation of turbulent features. The species of copepods chosen for this work provide a range of sensory architectures, swimming orientations, sizes, and mate tracking abilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Copepods are the most abundant multicellular animals on the planet.  They play important roles in the transfer of organic matter from primary producers to higher trophic levels including marine mammals such as whales and commercially important species such as finfish (cod) and lobsters. An important aspect of their availability to larger organisms is that they aggregate, forming densities that are much higher than the average concentrations found in the surrounding waters.  These patches form feeding "hotspots" that are crucial to the success of most fish and mammal species. The mechanisms for spatial aggregations of zooplankton are still poorly understood and remain a central issue in marine ecology. Understanding the fluid features and sensory cues that promote aggregation was the focus of this work.  At the scale of the copepod, the fine-scale flow features caused by turbulence forms the topography of the copepods environment. By deconstructing the response of copepods to turbulence we pursued a mechanistic understanding of copepod behavioral changes in and around turbulent flow features. The approach was novel because as part of this work we created a small turbulent feature (Burger’s Vortex) that could be held steady in space and time and rotate relative to gravity.  Using this tool, we investigated the effects of turbulence on swimming characteristics, escape behaviors and aggregation of copepods in or around the features.  This work was done using animals of different sizes, with different swimming patterns and different antennule architectures to determine how copepods exploit the shape and orientation of turbulent features.  What we found from this study.  1)     Copepods detect and respond to the turbulent features. Changes in their swimming characteristics help to maintain them in the vortex and provides a clear mechanism for how these small animals aggregate in response to flow.  This has 2 important implications.   In nature this provides short lived patches of copepods that serve as local "hotspots" for feeding by copepod predators. In aquaculture this provides a mechanism for aggregating live prey to enhance the feeding rates of culture fish.   2)     In this proposal we investigated the characteristics of the sensory system of different copepod species. To date, we are generating data sets for 3 species. The data is being arranged such that the 3D coordinates for each sensor morphology can be inserted into the fluid dynamics of the Burger’s Vortex (characterizing specific flow conditions) to determine the force and duration (work) acting on each seta.   3)     Modeling results from this project has changed how the community models seta in flow fields.

Broader Impacts   The success of this project relied on complementary expertise in the areas of: sensory ecology, biological/physical interactions, and turbulence mechanics.
