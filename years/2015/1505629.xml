<AbstractNarration>Gravitational waves (GWs), distortions of the geometry and space and time predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, provide a new window on the universe, allowing us to supplement the range of information available from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, for example, from optical and radio observations, from data from cosmic rays and from neutrino measurements.  Tthe Laser Interferometry Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) has recently been upgraded to its advanced configuration, with an increased sensitivity which should provide the first direct GW detection in the near future.  This project will involve faculty and students of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), who will analyze data from LIGO in the quest for that first detection and the resulting groundbreaking expansion of our knowledge of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we will analyze LIGO data to look for signals from two types of sources: rapidly rotating neutron stars (extremely dense objects more massive than the Sun and the size of a city, spinning tens to hundreds of times every second), and binary systems of black holes in the last seconds of the breakdown of their orbits due to GW emission.  We will carry out a search for GWs from the low-mass X-ray binary Scorpius X-1 using a cross-correlation technique which was recently shown in a mock data challenge to be the most sensitive search method currently implemented for this target.  We will also refine and implement a method to estimate the parameters of compact binary systems using numerical simulations, furthering the synergy between the numerical relativity and data analysis communities.  In addition to the search for GWs, visualizations will be produced of gravitational-wave propagation and detection which will aid the general public's understanding of the science done by LIGO.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were to develop and apply methods to search  for gravitational waves (GWs, distortions of spacetime, travelling at  the speed of light, which are predicted by Einstein's General  Relativity) with advanced gravitational wave detectors.  The initial  LIGO and Virgo detectors ended their runs in 2010 and 2012, and the  Advanced LIGO detector began its first observing run in September 2015.   The award also supported the partcipation of faculty and student  scientists in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC); the PI (Prof.  John Whelan) heads the LSC group at Rochester Institute of Technology  and plays a key role on several committees important to the science and  communication of the LSC.  Important outcomes of the award:  LIGO made the first direct detections of GWs, from the binary black hole mergers GW150914, GW151226, and GW170104.  (Further analyses are under internal review as of the end of the grant period.)  Co-PI Richard O'Shaughnessy and graduate student Jacob Lange developed and applied a method to compare the GW observations directly to numerical simulations, allowing the system parameters to be inferred without the use of approximate waveforms. A major objective of the project was the search for  gravitational waves from a spinning neutron star in a low-mass X-ray  binary system, specifically Scorpius X-1.  (The gravitational waves in  this case come not from the orbit of the neutron star, but from the fact  that it's deformed and spinning.)  This is one of the most promising  continuous GW sources, with a predicted signal strength that may be  within the reach of advanced detectors.  Graduate student  Yuanhao Zhang and PI Whelan led a search for GWs from Sco X-1 in data from LIGO's first observing run.  The results improved on the best initial LIGO results by a factor of 7, and are close to the most optimistic expected signal strengths at some frequencies. PI Whelan laid the groundwork for a mock data challenge (MDC) to evaluate the performance of Sco X-1 searches in the presence of irregularities in both the noise and signal, and to probe the sensitivity to signals of realistic amplitude.  (Zhang and Whelan's search was the most sensitive in a previous MDC which included stronger signals and more idealized data.)   Broader impacts of the award included career development for graduate students  Zhang (who completed his PhD and began a postdoctoral research position at a Max Planck Institute in Germany) and Lange, and public  dissemination of gravitational wave science, especially after GW150914 and subsequenrt dectections.
