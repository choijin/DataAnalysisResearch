<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Yale University, the University of Florida, and Cornell University to advance content provision and development of the existing prototype Map of Life platform. Knowledge about the geographic occurrence of species is at the heart of much of ecology, evolution and conservation, and of tremendous societal importance. While digital species distribution products exist, they remain un-integrated and cannot serve critical societal needs. The Map of Life platform was developed to begin to solve this need. A key goal of this project is to use novel approaches to mobilize and integrate diverse types of data such that their collective strengths overcome individual weaknesses. Specifically, this project will combine, on a single website, a variety of distribution data types from many different sources, range products that integrate these, deductively and inductively modeled predictions, and reports about the spatial and environmental knowledgebase for species.  When completed, users from across a broad spectrum, from researchers with published data to citizen scientists, will be able to upload data, edit input or output and directly improve or comment on maps, iteratively leading to improved species distribution knowledge. Users will be able to directly query or download any redistributable content. Map of Life will thus facilitate a dramatically improved and rigorous accounting of the spatial context of species in science and will likely benefit scientists across the biological, environmental and social sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given that species range maps are one of the most commonly used and familiar information products in biology, the potential broader impacts and benefits of Map of Life to society are remarkable. Species distribution knowledge ties to one of the greatest challenges of our time: explaining the links between biodiversity, ecosystems and human health, and how ongoing global environmental changes are impacting our natural heritage and capital. Opportunity abounds for strong educational uses of the Map of Life infrastructure.  An exciting step will be the production of video tutorials covering how Map of Life works and how it can serve an important role in biodiversity knowledge creation, along with explaining core concepts about species ranges, biodiversity, and how to measure its change. Such videos are scalable means to reach large audiences and will be coordinated through the PIs and their institutional outreach programs.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Map of Life (MOL) is a web-based means to discover where species are found on the planet based on multiple different sources of data, and create needed summaries and integration or those species-level data for science and policy value.  This tool, which has been persistently available since 2012, can be used by anyone via a web or mobile client to find out information about over 100,000 species distributed across the world and any citizen of the US can use it to localize species in their surrounding region.  Map of Life provides a growing toolkit not just of species distribution information but also summary products usable for a broad range of stakeholders who need information for scientific questions and societal issues.  NSF Advances in Biological Informatics support has directly led to the folllowing enhancements.  1) A simple means for users to upload data in many formats, ranging from sightings during travel to more formal surveys that are often performed by scientits and trained amateurs; 2)  Map of Life has improved it taxonomic backbone and significantly grown the number of groups with high quality data.  This significant effort makes Map of Life better able to reach larger communities and provides means to work across them to support shared needs.  3) Map of Life has prototyped and delivered new place-based information that directly connects to national, regional and local scale needs.  This has included tools and metrics that report needed information about national level efforts to mobilize species occurrence records from global-scale resources such as GBIF.  At the more local scale, MOL has partnered with parks to help them share natural history knowledge more fully.  4) Map of Life has also dramatically extended views and facets of summary biodiversity, beyond simple richness and regional species list tools, including several rarity and endemism measures usable for better understanding biodiversity hotspots.    MOL continues to facilitate dramatically improved and rigorous accounting of the spatial context of species in science, with benefit broadly in the biological, environmental and social sciences and for citizens of the United States.  MOL efforts at University of Florida has supported training for postdoctoral students and for undergraduates and supports collaborations between informaticians and ecologists needed for next generation science and technology outcomes.
