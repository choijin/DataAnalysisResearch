<AbstractNarration>In order to develop the next generation of clean and efficient vehicle engines and power-generating combustors, engineers need the next generation of computational modeling tools. Accurately describing the chemistry of conventional and alternative liquid transportation fuels is vital to predict harmful emission levels and other important quantities, but the high computational cost of detailed models for chemistry poses a significant barrier to use by designers. In order to use such accurate models, software is needed that can efficiently handle chemistry in practical simulations. This collaborative project aims to develop such tools, employing the computational power of modern parallelized central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). In addition to helping designers create clean and efficient engine technology, the advances made in this project are widely applicable to other computational modeling problems including astrophysics, nuclear reactions, atmospheric chemistry, biochemical networks, and even cardiac electrophysiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed effort is to develop software elements specifically targeted at co-processing on GPUs, CPUs, and other many-core accelerator devices to reduce the computational cost of using detailed chemistry and enable high-fidelity yet affordable reactive-flow simulations. This will be achieved by (1) developing and comparing chemical kinetics integration algorithms for parallel operation on CPUs and GPUs/accelerators, (2) developing a method for detecting local stiffness due to chemical kinetics and adaptively selecting the most efficient solver based on available hardware, (3) implementing a computational cell clustering strategy to group similar spatial locations, (4) demonstrating the improved performance offered by these software elements using commercial and open-source computational fluid dynamics codes for modeling reactive flows, and (5) designing a portable and sustainable software library based on the above software elements, including building a community of users. The result of this program will be an open source software library that significantly decreases the cost of using detailed, accurate chemistry in realistic combustion simulations; the success of the program will be determined based on achieving order-of-magnitude performance improvement or better.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>To improve the efficiency and lower emissions of next generation combustion devices, designers have had to move beyond traditional operating regimes. In order to rapidly assess and refine new combustion concepts, high fidelity chemical kinetic modeling is required in reactive flow simulations used in the design process. Unfortunately, the large size and high computational cost of the chemical kinetic models relevant to transportation and energy generation fuels poses a significant challenge to detailed simulations of realistic combustion processes (e.g., internal combustion engines). The advent of single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) and related single instruction, multiple thread (SIMT) processors as found on modern central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) provides a promising way to accelerate the solutions of the chemical kinetic models in these combustion simulations. This work has focused on developing solvers specifically for these high-performance computing processors that are capable of efficiently solving sets of coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). First, we developed a code generator capable of evaluating the chemical kinetic source terms and analytical Jacobian for SIMD/SIMT devices; these are evaluated repeatedly by stiff ODE solvers and as such an efficient implementation of each is critical. Further, the use of an analytical Jacobian can greatly reduce the computational cost of some classes of ODE solvers. Next, we developed stiff ODE integration techniques for both SIMD and SIMT devices, demonstrating significant speedups over existing methods. In addition, the same solvers can be applied to similar high-cost computational modeling techniques in a wide range of scientific fields, e.g., astrophysics, nuclear physics, control theory, atmospheric chemistry, etc. Finally, the developed methods were coupled to the open-source reactive-flow code, OpenFOAM, and used to accelerate the simulation of a standard combustion validation case by over an order of magnitude. The tools developed in this project were all released as open-source codes, and are freely available to the public.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/04/2019<br>      Modified by: Chih-Jen&nbsp;Sung</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1534688/1534688_10383057_1567650718914_Image-1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1534688/1534688_10383057_1567650718914_Image-1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1534688/1534688_10383057_1567650718914_Image-1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Size of chemical kinetic models used in realistic modeling by the year they were created ? models for next generation fuels (e.g., bio-diesels) can consist of thousands or even tens of thousands of species, imposing significant computational cost.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nick Curtis/Chih-Jen Sung</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Chih-Jen&nbsp;Sung</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1534688/1534688_10383057_1567651436668_Image-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1534688/1534688_10383057_1567651436668_Image-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1534688/1534688_10383057_1567651436668_Image-2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">While combustion device flow timescales may be on the order of milliseconds&#8210;seconds, the lifetime of some chemical species may be measured in nanoseconds or less.
