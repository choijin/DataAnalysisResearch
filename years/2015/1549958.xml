<AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial funding for a special Symposium to be held in conjunction with the International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Expo, November 13-19, 2015, in Houston, Texas. The overall event, the ASME Annual Congress, is organized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and is perhaps the foremost conference covering the broad range of fields that comprise mechanical engineering: applied mechanics, thermal and fluid systems, heat transfer, materials engineering, engineering design, energy, manufacturing, and engineering education. This Track is focused on Advances in Multidisciplinary Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium on Advances in Multidisciplinary Engineering will highlight the importance of the multidisciplinary approach in engineering research, design, and education.  The symposium will focus on Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Tribology, Cutting Tools and Machining, Polymer Processing, Design Theory, Complexity Theory and Multidisciplinary Engineering Education. A diverse and international group of individuals from academia and industry will participate in the panel discussions to identify future challenges and research needs from both industrial and academic perspectives.  Papers will be published on the DVD issued by the ASME and included, along with the summary recommendations of two discussion panels and the abstracts of the presentations that do not include full manuscripts, in the printed proceedings.</AbstractNarration>

The published proceedings include the panel summaries as guidelines for future research and education in Multidisciplinary Engineering with a broad potential impact for the society as a whole.
