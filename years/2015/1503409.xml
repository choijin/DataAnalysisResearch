<AbstractNarration>1506883&lt;br/&gt;Peccia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AEESP Proposal and Career Workshop: Environmental Engineering and Science: At the Nexus; &lt;br/&gt;Location: Yale University, CT; &lt;br/&gt;Date: June 13-16,2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AEESP Research and Education Conference is the flagship event for members of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP). The main purpose of the conference is to exchange information on novel research and educational activities. This conference also serves as a venue for professional networking, and the preparation of early-career faculty and students. The 2015 AEESP Research and Education Conference was awarded to Yale University in New Haven, CT. The Conference will be held June 13, 14, 15 and 16, 2015. The conference attendance of ~450 people is expected, including 250 graduate student attendees. The conference aims to increase participation through incorporation of professional practitioners in workshop activities, holding workshops for traditional undergraduate institutions, conducting a workshop session to promote U.S.-China collaborations, publishing selected research presentations in the Journal of Environmental Engineering Science. A post-conference report that contains highlights and findings from the Conference will be published in the quarterly AEESP newsletter and will be disseminated through other appropriate channels (web site, e-mail distribution). We will strive to obtain a balance of male and female participants as workshop organizers and panelists and invited NSF CAREER workshop attendees. Plenary sessions will have a significantly stronger education component, while keynote speakers will focus on broadening the fields impact. Workshops specifically target graduate student and junior faculty development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference theme is: "Environment Engineering: At the Nexus" and reflects the growing recognition that a narrow focus on individual environmental problems may lead to solutions with unintended consequences, causing other environmental problems. To address these themes, this conference starts with a Grand Opportunities workshop to identify and present challenges and opportunities in Environmental Engineering for the 21st century. In addition to faculty and student development, the Sunday workshops and panels focus on teaching methods and international collaboration required to meet these challenges. Plenary lectures and conference sessions will provide a dedicated forum for environmental scientists and engineers to develop and share cutting edge research and new environmental engineering approaches.</AbstractNarration>
