<AbstractNarration>African American male students' stories of mathematics success are critically needed in the research literature, and it is important to gain insights from African American male science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors to improve efforts to recruit, retain, and graduate these students. Furthermore, African American male students' STEM career decisions can provide insights concerning persistence and career trajectories in STEM fields. This project awarded to a CAREER scholar has the goal to understand, synthesize, document, and highlight the mathematics experiences and career decisions of forty African American male STEM majors. Additionally, an African American Male Mathematics Network (AAMMN) will be established to influence and capitalize on students' mathematical strengths, and this network will serve as a national model for other stakeholders with similar research and education goals. The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program is a National Science Foundation-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.  This award is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program.  ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is guided by three goals: 1) to identify and examine the experiences, barriers and successes  of African American male STEM majors; 2) to broaden the participation of African American male students in mathematics; and 3) to disseminate the results broadly. Critical Race Theory and the Socio-Ecological Outcome Model are used as the theoretical framework to conduct this research. The study employs qualitative methods such as a pre-survey, an interview, and artifacts to examine the nuances of African American men's mathematics experiences and career decisions. The intellectual distinction of this work lies in its anti-deficit perspective and thus will add to the body of research highlighting the strengths of this population. The forty students who will be selected for the study will come from Clark Atlanta University, Georgia State University, Georgia Tech, and Morehouse College. This work is exemplary in integrating research and education. A graduate capstone course will be developed, students are involved in the research, and an African American Male Mathematics Network will be created. The findings from this project will make a significant contribution to the field by providing a nuanced understanding, interpretation, and analysis of African American male STEM majors' mathematics experiences and career decisions to inform national strategies, policies, interventions, and initiatives for African American male students.</AbstractNarration>
