<AbstractNarration>Travel support for trainees to attend the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) is provided. PSB is one of the leading Bioinformatics conferences, especially for students. PSB has a program of cutting-edge topics, many of which are emerging in their respective field. This leads to an exciting and innovative series of presentations. PSB also includes several interactive sessions including poster sessions, discussion sessions, and most meals together. Due to the size of this meeting (between 200-300 participants), this makes it a perfect venue for young scientists to network and really interact with the field leaders. PSB brings together the outstanding science in many subdisciplines of Biocomputing. This results in the conference being an excellent learning event for all participants. However, for the students, they are able to learn about these rich, diverse areas from the experts, ask questions, and potentially discuss the downstream projects that may result in which they can participate. Previous student attendees indicate that it is one of the best for learning a broad range of important and complementary topics in bioinformatics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal was requested to support travel for scientists to attend the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB).  PSB is one of the leading Bioinformatics conferences, especially for trainees.  PSB has a call for proposals each year, which leads to a program of cutting-edge topics, many of which are emerging in their respective field.  This leads to an exciting and innovative series of presentations which can be very motivating and inspiring for young scientists.  PSB also includes several interactive sessions including poster sessions, discussion sessions, and most meals together.  Due to the size of this meeting (between 200-300 participants), this makes it a perfect venue for young scientists to network and really interact with the field leaders.    Especially for junior scientists, securing funds to attend scientific conferences can sometimes be a challenge.  Thus, we wanted to offer travel awards for junior scientists who submitted papers/abstracts to the conference so that they are able to attend and present/participate in person.  We successfully awards travel funds to ten scientists, all of whom were able to present at the 2016 PSB meeting because of these travel funds.  Their presentations were excellent and they were active participants in the conference.  This award led to a very successful experience for this set of ten scientists.
