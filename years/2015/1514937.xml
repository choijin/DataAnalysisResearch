<AbstractNarration>Antennas operating near or inside the human body are important for a number of applications, including healthcare. Implantable medical devices such as cardiac pacemakers and retinal implants are a growing feature of modern healthcare, and implantable antennas for these devices are necessary to monitor battery level and device health, to upload and download data used in patient monitoring, and more. This project will create a UHF RFID tag antenna that can be inserted under the skin for a permanent application. Ultra High Frequency (UHF) RFID tag antennas are printed using conductive ink and have found increased applications due to advantages such as minimal cost, low maintenance, good tag read range, and ability to operate without an integrated battery. Despite their potential use in long-term patient monitoring and wireless biometric tracking there is limited research on UHF RFID for insertion in high-loss human body environments.   This research will greatly benefit from procedures already in place at Dr. You Chung Chung's antenna lab at Daegu University in Daegu, Korea. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will use HFSS electromagnetic simulation software to adapt existing slotline antennas from the High Frequency (HF) range to the UHF range. Slotline antennas are easy to parameterize and fabricate for RFID use. Promising simulation designs will be fabricated using conductive inks such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Fabricated antenna designs will be tested using available Network Analyzer equipment and liquids that simulate the electromagnetic environment of the human body. Overall, this research will contribute to implantable antenna research. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with National Research Foundation of Korea.</AbstractNarration>

The RFID tag was constructed from both conductive ink and aluminum foil tape and laminated in a thin layer (0.1mm) of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) creating a biocompatible coating so that the tag can be inserted under the skin. Measurements show read range near 1m for both ink and aluminum foil antenna, and simulation results also suggest minimal difference in operation between the antennas.  Intellectual Merit  This work serves to advances the RFID antenna community by adding to the UHF body of work in on body and in-body applications. This work also validates the design as a promising shape for antenna impedance matching inside the body.  In addition, electrical characterization of the ink used in this project advances the PIs dissertation.  The PI is working a dissertation involving antennas constructed from conductive inks, and this work shows promising similarities between conductive ink antennas and antennas made from solid metallic sheets.  Broader Impacts  Implantable RFID tags show especially great promise for use in the healthcare industry. Implantable RFID tags may be used for real-time, continuous monitoring of vital body signals. This work contributes to the existing literature by showing the feasibilities of inserting a thin antenna under the skin for a more permanent application.  In addition, this work promoted collaboration between Daegu University in Korea and the University of Utah and the United States. During this collaboration the PI developed many strong academic relationships that may be leveraged in the future for additional antenna design projects.
