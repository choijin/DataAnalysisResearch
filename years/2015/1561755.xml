<AbstractNarration>This project is part of a summer field study to gain a better understanding of reactive chemistry in the atmosphere of a forested environment. In this project, the exchange of nitrogen compounds at the leaf-level will be investigated to better predict the production of ozone, secondary organic aerosols and the cycling of nitrogen between the atmosphere and the biosphere. Improving the understanding of reactive chemistry in forest environments will improve projections of how future changes in forest succession and climate might affect the future composition of the atmosphere.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of this study are to: (1) determine leaf exchanges of NO, NO2, NOy, and ozone for the dominant tree species at the University of Michigan Biological Station's (UMBS) Program for Research on Oxidants: PHotochemistry, Emissions, and Transport (PROPHET) site; (2) determine the dependency of the leaf-level gas exchanges on the physiological and environmental factors including photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, light, temperature, and humidity; (3) determine the dependency of the leaf-level gas exchanges on the ambient NOx and ozone mixing ratio; (4) Investigate potential connections between leaf-level NOx exchanges and emission of biogenic volatile organic carbon; (5) re-examine nocturnal and daytime below-canopy turbulent transport representation in the Multi-layer Canopy Chemical Exchange (MLC-CHEM) model using high resolution temperature gradient measurements; and (6) incorporate, revisit, and further improve the modeling of the UMBS forest oxidation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Trees are like humans and other living things on earth - they breathe. And they don?t just breathe in and out carbon dioxide and oxygen. They pick up pollutants or chemically reactive gas molecules in the air too. Atmospheric scientists want to know how much or how efficiently forests absorb those trace components in the air. Trees cover nearly 30% of the earth?s land surface and 34% of the land area in the US. It is important to understand their impact on the atmospheric composition. For this project, we went to a forest located at the lower peninsula of Michigan to learn how different trees there absorb nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), nitric oxide (NO), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), which are air pollutants as well as some of the most important reactants leading to a myriad of chemical reactions in the atmosphere.</p> <p>We made two types of measurementst. One of them was a continuous, around the clock, measurement of the vertical profile of each of those trace gases for the whole month of July 2016. In other words, we measured the ambient air concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, and ozone at different heights from near the ground to above the tree canopy. We learned about how these components are distributed through the canopy, and how their distributions change throughout the day, and from day to day. For the other measurement, we made an enclosure around a branch of four dominant tree species in the forest, <em>Pinus strobus</em> (white pine), <em>Acer rubrum</em> (red maple), <em>Populus grandidentata</em> (bigtooth aspen), and <em>Quercus rubra</em> (red oak). The enclosure was transparent ? sunlight for photosynthesis could go through. We also set up a steady air flow through the enclosure. We then mixed in known amounts of NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, or O<sub>3</sub> into the air flow, with the concentrations at different levels, but within the range of what is present in the forest air. We continuously monitored the concentrations before and after the enclosure. By measuring how much the concentration changed after the air flowed through the enclosure, we learned how much of the trace components was absorbed by the leaves. We also measured how much the air humidity changed inside the enclosure. This is because when leaves breathe, or exchange gas, they breathe through the small pores in the leaf surface ? stomata (<em>stoma for singular</em>). When the stomata are open, water escapes from inside the leaves to the air and increases the moisture content of the air. We get a measurement on the degree of the stomata openness, called stomatal conductance, from knowing how much the humidity of the air increased.</p> <p>From the enclosure measurement, we found that different tree species have different capacity to absorb NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. This capacity is also tightly correlated to the stomatal openness, which means the rate of removal of NO<sub>2</sub> can be predicted from the measured stomatal conductance. Bigtooth aspen is the most efficient - it can remove NO<sub>2</sub> from the air roughly three times faster than white pine and red maple, and five times faster than red oak. The absorption of ozone also follows this pattern. But it appears NO is not absorbed by the plants. The rate of NO<sub>2</sub> removal from the air also goes through a diurnal cycle: it is at the lowest or near zero at night and gradually increases from sunrise to noon before it goes down again, mapping the plant leaf responses to the sunlight level through the day.</p> <p>For the vertical profile, we compared our measurements with model-simulated results. The trace gas concentration vertical profile is determined by many factors, including the sources of NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, and O<sub>3</sub>, and the processes that remove them, one of which is removal by the leaves. Additionally, mixing by the wind affects how much of these gases are at different heights in the forest. The model is a computation tool that includes mathematical formulas for these factors based on what we know, and how well we know about them in theory or empirically. The enclosure measurement, in this case, provided a better understanding of one of the important factors, the results of which we can use to improve the model. Our initial comparison of the measured and simulated results agreed well sometimes but not at other times. We are sorting through the differences to understand what may have caused the disagreements. Through this work, we hope to understand better how NO<sub>2</sub>, NO and O<sub>3</sub> are processed in the forest from leaf-scale to canopy-scale, and how this may affect the amounts of these gases on a larger scale beyond the forest canopy.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/12/2019<br>      Modified by: Detlev&nbsp;Helmig</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561755/1561755_10420279_1560120933511_20160803_203423--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561755/1561755_10420279_1560120933511_20160803_203423--rgov-800width.jpg" title="PROPHET Tower at UMBS"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1561755/1561755_10420279_1560120933511_20160803_203423--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="PROPHET Tower at UMBS"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The canopy access tower at the PHotochemistry, Emissions, and Transport (PROPHET) research site at the University of Michigan Biological Station.
