<AbstractNarration>The importance of field-based learning experiences in geoscience education is well-documented. However, learning in the field is not entirely accessible for students with physical disabilities. This collaborative project will engage students with disabilities (SWD) in authentic field experiences via a peer instruction approach that pairs SWD with more physically capable students in collaborative field-based exercises. The overarching philosophy is that partnerships of students with diverse physical abilities, as well as student-instructor pairs, constitute a collective set of human senses and perspectives that can be as effective as individuals with no physical limitations. Outcomes from this work should apply to a wide variety of barriers to onsite field investigations that SWD and others may face during the course of their geoscience careers. This work is anticipated to increase the probability of retaining and graduating geoscience SWD and other collaborating students, and encourage and empower them to pursue geoscience careers, thereby broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigators at James Madison University (JMU) are collaborating with colleagues at the University of Cinncinatti, Old Dominion University, and Central Connecticut State University to pilot and test innovative approaches for enabling SWD to gain meaningful exposure to field-based activities relevant to the geosciences.  The project is designed to work with two cohorts of undergraduate geoscience students: one with mobility disabilities (SWD) and another without. Students (primarily sophomores) are being recruited from a national pool of undergraduate geoscience majors.  Students from each cohort are paired in a variety of field experiences, and collaborate both on-site in the field and through remote connections. Field data collection and analyses occurs in real-time via web-linked tablets and other interactive mobile devices. Real-time video and audio communication, both student-student and student-faculty, are facilitated through cutting-edge wearable technologies. The field program incorporates a range of experiences that are traditionally included within an undergraduate geoscience curriculum. These include: day-long field trips that focus on a specific set of field skills, such as generating strip logs for stratigraphic analyses; measuring structural orientations using a geologic compass; and, mineralogical and petrologic analyses using a hand lens. Field experiences in the second year of the project are focused on more advanced, multi-day exercises that require student teams to synthesize geologic field data collected into maps and reports that summarize the tectonic history of a region. Assessment of project activities by an external evaluator is being used to inform continuous improvements to the project design; summative evaluation and synthesis of the impacts of the project are expected to contribute to the evidence base regarding best practices for working with SWD in field settings.  Results and experiences from this project are being disseminated via presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and a capstone field trip for geoscience students, faculty, and professionals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goals of the project were to:  1. Engage students with mobility disabilities (SWD) in authentic field experiences via a instructional approach that pairs SWD with peers without disabilities in collaborative field-based exercises; and  2. Increase engagement and retention of SWD in the geosciences by instilling confidence in their ability to do authentic field research. In order to realize these goals, the project staff recruited a cohort of 12 geology undergraduate students, half of whom were students with mobility disabilities and half without disabilities.  These students participated in two multiple-day field experiences, one in Arizona and a second in Ireland.  These students were grouped in dyads, each with a student with a disability and another without.  In supporting these students? field learning activities, a variety of digital technologies, including devices and field-oriented software were employed.  These included iPads, cameras, drones, and field-portable networks to link devices and share data and video within student groups.  These same techniques were also employed in accessible field trips offered at Geological Society of America annual meetings in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Major outcomes of the GEOPATHS project: Although the content of the field experiences was geoscience, the primary focus of the project was not about providing geology content to the students.  As they were at a range of different points in their geologic education, the major point of the project was less about providing geologic content knowledge and more focus on overcoming physical and social barriers experienced by students with disabilities that would otherwise prevent them from advancing in their geology education or geology career.  Three strong themes emerged over the course of the project:  The importance of the social engagement when integrating technology to support virtual access.  When introducing new technologies into a novel educational setting, such as new field site, students needed sufficient time to not only learn how to use the technology, but also how to interact with each other in the use of that technology.  This is a process that requires budgeting more time that would otherwise be expected, and completing this process is a prerequisite to students advancing in content knowledge. You cannot separate student access from social engagement.     A strong evaluation of the different types of technologies used and the effective use of each in the field to support student engagement and collaboration.   Throughout the program, a variety of technologies were employed.  Through the publications and presentations that resulted from this program, the limits of the utility of these technologies are discussed.  In particular, the set-up and support costs as compared to the benefits were considered, as was the relative adaptability of those technologies to new settings.  In fact, what was learned allowed students in unrelated programs to be included in the learning process even when the physical barriers and true physical abilities of the students were not known in advance.      Long-term, lasting impact on was realized in each of the participants.  Each of the students who participated in the project came with a strong interest in the geosciences, but also believed that their capacity to work in the field was limited by their mobility disabilities, which would also impact their education.  Through this program, students learned that there were advances in digital technology that, when appropriately employed, could be used to bypass their physical and perceived barriers to learning.  Part of the conditions that supported their renewed beliefs were the socialization and collaborative activities in the field learning environment, both with student peers without disabilities and with dedicated and supportive instructors.  Students came to realize that not only was field research within their reach, but also that they could pursue graduate school and careers in the geosciences.  The outcomes of this project continue to be employed well beyond the two major field experiences.  Accessible field trips were provided at the Geological Society of America Annual Meeting in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, attracting sufficient interest and participant numbers to continue the practice at future meetings.  These field trips served as additional dissemination of project outcomes to a broader audience.  Not only did these trips support the active participation of project participants and additional students with disabilities, it also included geoscience faculty who participated in these trips to learn the outcomes of the project as best practices for designing inclusive field experiences for students with mobility disabilities. There is also sufficient interest in extending the work of this project to students with disabilities beyond mobility, with every prospect of similar success.  Finally, it is clear that a broadened understanding of the use of digital field technologies in overcoming barriers to field geology learning can have a broader impact in addressing events such as the modification or cancellation of traditional field courses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
