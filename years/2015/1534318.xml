<AbstractNarration>Human language as it is produced and understood is full of errors: people make speech errors, they make typographical errors when typing / texting, and there is often background noise that makes it impossible to perceive words accurately.  Given the noisy nature of human language in practice, it is surprising that people can understand one another so well. The question of how people can communicate given noise is not yet solved, and is the focus of our work. Understanding how humans can understand noisy language is critical for two reasons. First, language technologies must be capable of processing noisy language input: translation services need to account for errors in the text being translated; search engines need to process noisily-generated web content. Evidence concerning how humans understand language in noise can lead to improvements in the design of language technologies. In addition, until dialogue systems can produce coherent language responses--likely decades away--any practical application of such systems must be designed with an understanding of how humans deal with noisy or confusing language input. Second, on the clinical side, understanding how humans understand language which might contain errors will provide insights into language comprehension disorders. Recent research has shown that individuals with aphasia appear to assume the presence of more errors in the input than healthy participants, and thus show stronger reliance on their prior beliefs about the world when interpreting language. Applications of this work may lead to more efficient diagnosis and treatment options for such patients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the proposed research are two-fold.  First, the researchers will investigate noise in the process of language comprehension, where noise falls into three categories (a) deletions, such that the listener / reader might miss something that was intended; (b) insertions, such that the producer might accidentally insert something; and (c) swaps, such that the producer might accidentally switch elements in the stream.  Second, the researchers will investigate an information-theoretic approach to memory in sentence production, where memory is a source of potential errors in language use.  Recent human vision research suggests that memory capacity is best modeled as a limitation on the complexity of the representations, in terms of information-theoretic units called "bits".  Simple representations require very few bits of information, but complex representations require many. The proposed research extends this idea to language, such that high-frequency words and phrases such as "the boy sees the girl" should be stored easily in memory, while less frequent components such as "the woman who the man met was tall" should be difficult to store in memory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There were two primary outcomes from this project:   First, we investigated aspects of how human language is comprehended and produced with a focus on the possibility of noise in both the comprehension and production process, because people both make lots of speech / writing errors and they misunderstand what people are saying / writing.  One fascinating result is that people are sensitive to the type of errors that another language producer is making, and they adjust their comprehension process accordingly.  For example, if the person you are talking with happens to delete or transpose a lot of words, you will subconsciously adjust your interpretation of what they say accordingly.   Second, we investigated how thinking about language as communication has impacts on the development of dictionaries across languages.  In particular, we used an information theoretic approach to investigate whether dictionaries for color words across languages might be explained in information theoretic terms.  The number of color terms varies drastically across languages: some hunter-gatherer cultures have only 2 or 3 color words (corresponding to black, white, and red), whereas inndustiralized cultures have 11 or more terms that everyone knows (e.g., black, white, red, yellow, green, blue, purple, orange, brown, pink, and grey in English).  Yet despite these differences, certain terms (e.g., red) are prevalent, which has been attributed to perceptual salience. Our work provided evidence for an alternative hypothesis: The use of color terms may depend on communicative needs. Across languages, from the hunter-gatherer Tsimane’ people of the Amazon to students in Boston, warm colors are communicated more efficiently than cool colors, taking fewer "bits" of information to pass the same concept. This cross-linguistic pattern reflects the color statistics of the world: Objects (what we talk about) are typically warm-colored, and backgrounds are cool-colored. Communicative needs also explain why the number of color terms varies across languages: Cultures vary in how useful color is.
