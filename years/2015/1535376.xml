<AbstractNarration>This award will help support student attendance at the 2015 Computational Complexity Conference (CCC) that will take place June 17th to June 19th, 2015 in Portland, Oregon, USA, as part of the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC 2015). CCC is the premier annual conference devoted to research in computational complexity theory. The conference aims to foster research in all areas of computational complexity theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints, and the mathematical aspects with close connections to such a study. The conference will have approximately thirty high quality presentations in a single-track session over 3 days. The field of computational complexity is a vibrant one, with high participation rates from young researchers, and many papers with student authors. For these student authors and student attendees, the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide partial support to approximately ten students, partly defraying the cost of registration, travel, and lodging.  In selecting students for a travel allowance, efforts will be made to support students from under-represented groups and geographically diverse areas.</AbstractNarration>

A small portion of the grant was also used to partially cover the travel expenses of two graduate students in US universities to attend the 2016 Computational Complexity Conference that was held from May 29-June 1, 2016 in Tokyo, Japan.  The travel award aimed to support students from a geographically diverse area, support underrepresented groups, support students who would not be able to attend without receiving support, and support students with a promising future in computational complexity theory.  The financial support provided by the grant was crucial in enabling these very promising students to participate in, and in most cases present talks at, one of the premier conferences dedicated to the highest quality research in computational complexity. This conference offers one of the key opportunities in the field to network with other researchers and keep up on current research.
