<AbstractNarration>This project will provide support for participants, especially junior researchers, in the conference "Waves, Spectral Theory, and Applications" in Princeton, NJ from September 10-11, 2015. This conference will bring together experts in both the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and cutting edge applications, which are dramatically impacted by the study of waves and spectral theory in nonlinear science. The models to be discussed at the conference have applications to the studies of graphene, nonlinear optics, neuroscience, large quantum systems, and the formation of topological states.   Such states are ideal for the transfer or storage of energy or information. Another important set of mathematical problems concerns the issues for design of metamaterials. Metamaterials are composites that include nano-size microstructures. In some regimes these materials exhibit properties not achievable in naturally occurring materials. For example, it is possible to manufacture a metamaterial with negative index or reflection that allows one to "cloak" objects, making them invisible.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on the issues of spectral theory and nonlinear dynamics that are instrumental for understanding the behavior of nonlinear bound states interacting with various types of potentials. Another focus of the conference is on the metameterials-related problems that lie outside the realm of standard homogenization theory as well as to problems concerning non-elliptic limits of families of elliptic problems.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award resulted in a highly successful 3 day workshop being held October 20-22, 2017 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The workshop was attended by graduate students, postdocs, early career mathematicians and established researchers.  There were 10 talks, 6 directed open problem sessions and a poster session.   The talks were given by a mixture of senior researchers and young mathematicians on current topics in applied PDE. Talk topics included degenerate dispersive models, stability theory, adiabatic limits for wave packets, diffusive models from social science, quasilinear PDEs in fluids and relativity, obstacle scattering, and more.     The break-out sessions covered highly active topics currently under investigation including Quantum Graphs, Maslov Indices in PDE, Random Schr&ouml;dinger operators, PT symmetric problems in physics, microlocal methods for wave equations and modified energy methods in quasilinear PDE.  Each topic was presented by an expert in the area and featured 2-hour long discussions of open problems, as well as important techniques and intuition.  Most were very directed towards graduate students, featuring a presentation of a toy problem and some lecture notes.  Two included more collaborative discussions amongst active researchers in the field.   The poster session featured posters to highlight graduate student research presented by Rachael Keller of Columbia on dispersion surfaces for square lattice potentials, Paul Cornwell of UNC on the Maslov Index in stability theory, and Jacob Shapiro of Purdue on scattering theory for the wave equation.   The workshop served to highlight active research areas, fascilitate research collaborations and pass on ideas/techniques to a new generation of applied mathematicians.    More information including talk abstracts can be found on the conference web-page:  http://pde.unc.edu/waves-spectral-theory-and-applications-part-2/          Last Modified: 01/03/2018       Submitted by: Jeremy L Marzuola]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
