<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry is supporting Professor Todd Emrick of the University of Massachusetts Amherst to combine state-of-the-art elements of chemistry and nanoscale science to produce advanced structures, such as electronic devices, that aim to to be smaller, faster, more sensitive, more efficient, and more reliable than those on the market today.  For example, polymers and inorganic nanoparticles, once considered separate topics, are blended in this work to make "hybrid structures", each component interacting with the other to produce striking effects.  Professor Emrick's group synthesizes polymers ("soft materials") that markedly influence the surface electronic properties of metals (i.e., "hard materials") onto which they are coated.  This ability of soft materials to dramatically change the properties of the materials they contact has profound implications for improving the efficiency of numerous devices, including solar cells that collect charge and generate power more efficiently than conventional structures.  This project additionally seeks to understand how polymers interact with structures emerging from the latest developments in two-dimensional materials, including those composed of ultrathin layers of carbon, metals, and other elements.  The project includes the participation of undergraduate researchers seeking to gain their first laboratory experience, and involves the development of "NanoDays" discussions for middle school and high school students, intended to convey the excitement of nanoscale chemistry to the next generation of researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the project is engaged in the synthesis of new functional polymer platforms for integration into nanoscale assemblies and hybrid materials structures. The polymers of interest are prepared and used for surface functionalization of metals and 2-D materials, including: 1) polymers with pendent dipoles, and 2) functional polymers tailored for interactions with 2-D nanoscale structures.  The dipole-inducing groups fixed pendent to the polymer chains include zwitterionic substituents (hydrophilic dipoles), with preliminary results describing the impact of conjugated polymer zwitterions on metals, producing polymer solar cells with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the effect of the polymers on high work function metal electrodes.  These results translate to functionalized 2-D nanostructures, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), ultimately seeking polymer chemistry-enabled device enhancement.  New synthetic zwitterionic polymers will delineate the effect of the pendent zwitterionic groups on underlying substrates, as distinct from polymer backbone characteristics, by comparing aromatic and aliphatic polymers having zwitterionic pendent groups. Augmenting the polymer zwitterions is a sulfur-rich polymer platform aimed to tailor electronic properties and result in novel architectures with improved device metrics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF-supported project enabled the discovery of new fundamental chemistry in the areas of polymers and nanoscale materials, and specifically supported the study of the impact of combining such materials into "nanocomposite" and thin film structures.  The Intellectual Merit of this project focused on improving the basic scientific understanding that is needed to advance technologies in the areas of flexible electronics, displays, and solar cells, and as such this project produced novel synthetic polymers and studied their influence on electronic properties when combined with metals and semiconductors.  A considerable breadth of achievements resulted from this work, ranging from high efficiency solar cell devices to light-responsive nanocomposite gels.  Several results were enabled by NSF support of the synthesis of new organic compounds (i.e., monomers) that were used in polymerization chemistry, ultimately affording novel electronically active polymers which were then used as thin films in devices, such as solar cells.  The Broader Impact of the project included efforts to involve a diverse breadth of researchers and to convey project results to the University community and general public.  Participation of undergraduate and high school researchers, working alongside experienced graduate students and postdoctoral associates, created a productive working team atmosphere that contributed to the scientific maturation of the less experienced researchers and provided mentoring opportunties for the more experienced participants.  Involving the participants in radio shows and community events contributed to dissemination of the research to a wide audience, reaching beyond the technical scientific contributions (i.e., scientific publications in technical journals) themselves.
