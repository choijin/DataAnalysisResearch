<AbstractNarration>Progress in medicine, science, and engineering -- as in essentially all areas of human endeavor -- increasingly depends on network access to very large data sets (billions to trillions of bytes) containing information such as scientific measurements, monitoring information, images, videos, simulation results, etc.  The number of researchers working with, transferring, and sharing very large data sets is growing at an alarming rate.  Although network transmission speeds are rapidly increasing, devices deployed in the middle of the network for security and management purposes -- e.g., firewalls, intrusion detectors, and the like -- create major bottlenecks that prevent researchers from being able to quickly move these large files between laboratories, high-performance computing sites, and storage facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically, network designers have addressed this problem by creating and maintaining a special "Science DMZ" network that provided a "fast lane", bypassing performance-limiting security devices thanks to the trusted nature of the users and applications connected to the Science DMZ.  Today, however, the growing number and variety of users who need high-performance data transfer makes it increasingly difficult to maintain such a separate infrastructure.  This project is developing ways to provide trusted users on the normal (campus) network with dynamic access to such fast lanes by authenticating them on-the-fly, determining the nature of their data transfer, and whether it should be allowed or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project leverages emerging Software-Defined Networking (SDN) capabilities to single out individual data flows for specialized treatment in the network.  Using the SDN infrastructure already deployed on campus, the project is developing new control software and protocols that enable trusted users to authenticate themselves to the network and set up network connections free from middlebox interference while still enforcing middlebox security functionality for normal campus traffic.  The ability of trusted users to create such fast lanes -- as opposed to (only) network administrators -- will enable future networks to handle the rapidly growing number of big data users.</AbstractNarration>

We designed and implemented a new campus network framework based on software defined networking techniques that enables authorized researchers -- particularly those transferring large data sets (a.k.a., big data) -- to establish VIP Lanes that bypasses performance-limiting middleboxes, significantly reducing the time required to transmit large amounts of data.  A trusted user with the need to transfer large amounts of data can be identified as an authorized user and registered in the VIP Lanes system. When a user requests a VIP Lane for one of their network transmissions, the VIP Lanes system verifies that the user is an authorized VIP Lanes user, checks to see if they have the right to create the requested VIP Lane -- even authorized users can only create VIP Lanes between a predefined set of computers -- and then computes a middlebox-free path that takes advantage of the campus SDN network, installing SDN rules in the switches along a VIP Lane path that bypasses the campus' policy-enforcing, but performance-limiting, middleboxes.  Working with the University of Kentucky Information Technology Services group, we deployed the VIP Lanes system on the University of Kentucky campus network, covering many of the networks where large data transfers are required by researchers.  In addition to deploying SDN capable switches throughout the campus network, we also deployed wireless access points capable of intercepting and rerouting trusted VIP Lane traffic around middleboxes.  We helped researchers across the campus use VIP Lanes in their research, significantly reducing their time needed to transfer data across campus or to the cloud. Two big data transfer tasks commonly requested by researchers were (1) the ability to move data to/from Google Drive, and (2) to move data to/from our high performance computing (HPC) systems.  As a result, researchers have been able to move hundreds of terabytes of data to Google drive and to our local HPC storage systems.  The system has been highly effective, with researchers transferring data more than an order of magnitude faster than non-VIP Lane transmissions.  We presented and published our work in several conferences and workshops, with many institutions expressing interest in establishing similar high performance data transmission systems on their campuses.  The project served as a valuable learning experience for all the team members involved, providing them with insights into the capabilities and drawbacks of existing SDN technologies as well as research experience designing, implementing, deploying and evaluating new network architectures, and supporting the University's research community.
