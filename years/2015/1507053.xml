<AbstractNarration>Nuclei are the basic building blocks of matter. The entire Universe is composed of nuclei and understanding their properties allows us a glimpse into how the Universe transformed itself to support life. One way to study the properties of nuclei is by exciting and de-exciting the nuclear system. This research focuses on analyzing the lifetimes of the quantum states in deformed nuclei. This project will also contribute to training the next generation of scientists by actively engaging undergraduate students in research at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse (UW-L).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of low-lying excitations, K&lt; = 0+ bands in deformed nuclei remain enigmatic in the  eld. This project focuses on the search for vibrational excitations in deformed nuclei. The UW-L Nuclear Science Group has recently measured the lifetimes of states in 162Dy during the period of the grant, the group will analyze the results and interpret the implications the measurements. The UW-L Nuclear Science Group will also conduct detector work during the academic year in a small local laboratory. The results will be broadly disseminated through publications and conference presentations by the PI and undergraduate researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project had two main objectives. The first, to address one of the major goals of the Low Energy subprogram, to develop a "comprehensive description of nuclei across the entire nuclear chart" and to contribute to one of the overarching questions associated with science, "What is the origin of simple patters in complex nuclei?". The second objective was to train the next generation of scientists by actively engaging undergraduate students in research at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse (UWL).  Nuclei are the basic building blocks of matter. The entire Universe is composed of nuclei and understanding their properties allows us a glimpse into how the Universe transformed itself to support life. One way to study the properties of nuclei is by exciting and de-exciting the nuclear system. This research focused on analyzing the lifetimes of the quantum states in deformed nuclei. This resulted in multiple conference presentations, peer reviewed journal articles, and collaborations by the Principle Investigator and undergraduate students.  Six undergraduate students and one graduate student were supported by this one year grant. Upon graduation, students joined the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) workforce or are now pursuing advance degrees in nuclear physics, engineering, medical physics, or have found positions in STEM fields.
