<AbstractNarration>This award will support a series of workshops focused on connecting the Water Indigenous Network (WIN) of the US North West Coastal Tribes and Alaska Native communities with the Yakut and Evenk Peoples who reside in the Sakha Republic of Russia along the Lena River.   The Lena River is the 11th longest river in the world, has the 9th largest watershed, and provides fresh water to the Arctic Ocean. WIN scientists are creating a program by which global watersheds can be monitored year round by local people, something not possible by field scientists because most can only visit their research sites in the summer season for a few weeks. WIN will train local people in scientific methodologies for monitoring the health and production of the Lena River Watershed. Local monitoring will provide data on one of the world?s largest watersheds; information critical to understanding the Arctic Ocean ecosystem and how it is changing.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with scientists from Oregon Health and Science Universities Science and Technology Center for Coastal Margin Observation and Prediction (CMOP) and the Woods Hole Research Center, with this award WIN will organize workshops among the Yakut and Evenk Peoples to bring scientists and indigenous communities together to explore issues that affect indigenous people?s knowledge and culture along the world?s rivers.  The workshops will include training in GIS Mapping of watersheds, digital database construction and archiving, video documentation, photo documentation, water quality sampling protocols and techniques, and traditional knowledge story telling and documentation.  The workshops will also give the WIN team the opportunity to meet with local and regional leaders and government representatives to gain their support for local participation in network activities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project, WIN - Water Indigenous Network (Federal Award ID 1542208) not only achieved all of its goals, but went way above and beyond, driven by the thirst for engagement of the Indigenous participants. Beginning with a workshop held in Yakutsk, Sakha Republic, this project expanded to a series of workshops spread over three trips to the Sakha Republic, connection to Indigenous groups on the Kola Peninsula presentations in Umea, Sweden and a Keynote address at the U.N. World Day of the Indigenous Peoples celebration. Further, it facilitated an invitation form the UNDP and the American Museum of Natural History to participate in planning the Global Bio-cultural Diversity Summit. Amazing!</p> <p>Let me explain. The concept of WIN is to understand water health on a global basis through the perspective of the Indigenous&nbsp;People and traditional knowledge working with contemporary science to blend the two ways of knowing to increase the overall understanding of the planet. The first series of workshops held in Yakutsk during the summer of 2016 was enthusiastically attended by Indigenous cultures that traveled from the furthest reaches of the Sakha, some traveling hundreds of miles. People from the Evenk, Even, Dolgan, Yukaghir, Yakut, and Chukchi cultures arrived full of enthusiasm to engage with us in collaboration for understanding and a better planet. This series of workshops included both the natural sciences hosted by Melnikov Permafrost Institute and social sciences hosted by Institute of the Humanities and the Indigneous Peoples of the North. In addition, we conducted our &ldquo;Virtual Campfires&rdquo; (video teleconference) to invite water quality experts to share methods and techniques. Through these Virtual Campfires and Power point presentations we introduced the assembled group to Tribes and cultures in North America, a fascinating exchange. Further, we were welcomed to conduct non-direct Indigenous Knowledge interviews with community Elders and youth. A social/cultural highlight of this trip was when our entire Team was invited to the Flowers on the Tundra Celebration as honored guests. This is a yearly celebration that is attended by thousands of People from the Sakha to welcome summer and the sun back into their lives. An additional highlight was the introduction to the Lena River pictographs by our Indigenous colleagues. These pictographs are a cultural treasure and we have been inspired to strategize on how best to document them (more on this below). These workshops inspired a second and third trip to Russia to hold additional workshops as well as expanding to meetings with the Shirshov Institute - Russian Academy of Science to establish collaborations. The second trip expanded the workshop agendas and was the catalyst of a journey to the Kola Peninsula, Murmansk Oblast, at the suggestion of the workshop participants. This was undertaken to meet with the Nenets, Sami, and Komi People to include them in the Network.</p> <p>The second trip was conducted during the winter in February. Once again participants traveled from all around the Sakha to Yakutsk and filled the meetings to capacity. During these meetings and gatherings we worked as a group to expand the knowledge exchange and collaborations. We were able to increase the scientific and cultural exchange through focused presentations and &ldquo;Virtual Campfires&rdquo;. Leaving Yakutsk we traveled to the community of Lovozero on the Kola Peninsula. Spending several days meeting with our new friends from the Nenets, Sami, and Komi People discussing their thoughts, needs and desire to participate in the network we&rsquo;re establishing. This trip led to trip 3.</p> <p>The third trip was an extraordinary event! During trip 2 we were invited to be Keynote speakers at the U.N World Day of the Indigenous Peoples in August. We agreed. Extraordinary might be an underestimate. Many, many people from all of the cultures of the Sakha and beyond traveled to Yakutsk for a full day of celebration. In addition to the celebration we held a training in the utilization of 3D visualization and augmented reality equipment and techniques. We also introduced the concept of using LIDAR to document the Lena pictographs and this was well received. We were guided to some of the very remote pictographs on the Lena River in the region surrounding the Lena Pillars to test the idea. The results were encouraging and we are planning to return.</p> <p>The excitement continued when we were invited to present and hold a planning workshop at the International Congress for Arctic Social Sciences in Umea, Sweden. This meeting has inspired a larger look at the research needs of the Indigenous of the Arctic as described by the People themselves. Our Network participants have been invited to help plan and attend the U.N. sponsored Global Summit on Bio-cultural Diversity planed for the Spring of 2018. &nbsp;</p> <p>This has been an incredible project! The Team extended the project through careful expenditure of the funds allowing us to realize a maximum impact.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/11/2017<br>      Modified by: Jonathan&nbsp;Waterhouse</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542208/1542208_10407751_1507674648293_FullSizeRender--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542208/1542208_10407751_1507674648293_FullSizeRender--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Evenk Shaman"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542208/1542208_10407751_1507674648293_FullSizeRender--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Evenk Shaman"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Shaman blessing the Flowers on the Tundra Celebration in the Sakha Republic, Russian Federation</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mary Marshall</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;Waterhouse</div> <div class="imageTitle">Evenk Shaman</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542208/1542208_10407751_1507676569879_unnamed(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542208/1542208_10407751_1507676569879_unnamed(1)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Indigenous Culture and Water Meeting"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542208/1542208_10407751_1507676569879_unnamed(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Indigenous Culture and Water Meeting"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Some of the participants in an Indigenous gathering that focused on Culture and Water</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mary Marshall</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;Waterhouse</div> <div class="imageTitle">Indigenous Culture and Water Meeting</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542208/1542208_10407751_1507695262098_Russiaaritcle1(17)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542208/1542208_10407751_1507695262098_Russiaaritcle1(17)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Yakut newspaper article"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542208/1542208_10407751_1507695262098_Russiaaritcle1(17)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Yakut newspaper article"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This article is a feature on our work with the Indigenous People of the Sakha Republic</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mary Marshall</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;Waterhouse</div> <div class="imageTitle">Yakut newspaper article</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542208/1542208_10407751_1507696796337_Russiaarticle2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542208/1542208_10407751_1507696796337_Russiaarticle2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Article in Yakutsk newspaper - Indigenous Peoples Day"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542208/1542208_10407751_1507696796337_Russiaarticle2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Article in Yakutsk newspaper - Indigenous Peoples Day"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is a feature article in the Yakutsk newspaper about the U.N.
