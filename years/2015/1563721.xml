<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to investigate the fundamental mechanisms by which adult stem cells translate hydrostatic pressure into a biological signal that produces cartilage matrix.  Hydrostatic pressure is the primary manner that loads are carried in cartilage and has been shown to enhance the matrix production of cartilaginous cells.  However, surprisingly little is currently known about how hydrostatic pressure induces these cellular changes.  Studies conducted under this award will investigate the roles of calcium signaling, cytoskeletal components, and integrin binding in translating the mechanical signal to a biological one.  In particular, how these three elements interact in the translation of hydrostatic pressure will be determined.  The research will use pharmacological inhibitors, shRNA and live cell imaging to investigate the mechanobiology of this dominant loading modality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, these studies will establish a framework for understanding how calcium signaling, the cytoskeleton and integrin binding cooperate to induce adult stem cells to produce cartilage matrix as a response to hydrostatic pressure.  Advancing our understanding of the mechanical regulation of cartilage matrix production may lead to the development of improved therapeutic interventions and tissue engineering strategies to treat the debilitating cartilage defects that eventually progress to arthritis.   In addition to its potential impact on cartilage tissue regeneration, the work will be applicable to related tissues such as the meniscus and the intervertebral disc, where the majority of loading in vivo is also supported by hydrostatic pressure. Finally, the project includes an outreach plan in conjunction with a local high school to introduce students to cell-based therapies, bioengineering and laboratory research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research objective of this award was to investigate the processes by which adult stem cells translate hydrostatic pressure, a specific type of mechanical load, into a biological signal that produces cartilage matrix.  Hydrostatic pressure is the primary mechanical load-bearing mechanism in cartilage.  Although hydrostatic pressure has been shown to enhance the cartilage matrix production of a variety of cells, surprisingly little was known about how this process occurs. Advancing our understanding of how mechanical loads regulate cartilage formation has the potential to lead to improved therapies for preventing or treating arthritis.   One of the main biochemical pathways that was studied was the calcium ion signaling pathway.  Using pharmacological inhibitors, we determined that calcium ion signaling is necessary for the translation of the mechanical signal to a beneficial biologic response, and we identified some specific signaling molecules that are involved.  Additionally, we found that calcium ion signaling is initiated by the purinergic pathway, in which adenosine triphosphate is released from the cell via hemichannels and binds to cell-membrane receptors, and that this mechanism is also required for hydrostatic pressure to enhance cartilage matrix production.   We also investigated the role of the vimentin network, a component of the cytoskeleton, in the deformability of cells.  In this study, the expression of vimentin was suppressed with short hairpin RNA. This decreased the amount of vimentin in the cells for an extended period of time, allowing us to study its effect.  The loss of vimentin induced changes in cell deformability, but also caused alterations in other components of the cytoskeleton.  Changes in the structure of newly formed cartilage were also observed with these cells.  Finally, we identified additional signaling molecules that may be involved in the transduction of the mechanical load that will form the basis for future projects.  Collectively, these studies help explain the process by which mechanical loading is beneficial to cartilage, and suggests a number of potential targets to improve cartilage therapies and treatments.
