<AbstractNarration>The team will perform numerous state-of-the-art simulations of galaxy clusters spanning a large range in&lt;br/&gt;mass. The simulations will incorporate observationally-constrained&lt;br/&gt;models for feedback from star formation and supermassive black holes,&lt;br/&gt;along with a novel treatment of chemical evolution. The&lt;br/&gt;aims are twofold: (1) Establish a unified description for the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of the galaxies, the supermassive black holes, and the hot&lt;br/&gt;tenuous gas within the clusters; (2) Determine the key observable&lt;br/&gt;signatures that constrain the interplay between the processes of&lt;br/&gt;galaxy feedback and the growth of structure in the Universe. These&lt;br/&gt;efforts constitute a self-consistent, holistic approach to feedback that will be able to account for multifaceted&lt;br/&gt;properties observed across all mass scales. The team will continue its&lt;br/&gt;involvement in an established, successful STEM program. The research&lt;br/&gt;will increase the physical realism of the simulations, increasing the&lt;br/&gt;appeal of the image products released to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many galaxies are found in groups that contain hundreds to thousands of galaxies. The largest of these groups are called galaxy clusters. Besides the galaxies these galaxy clusters contain a lot of gas. The gas weighs about 10 times more than the all the galaxies combined.  This gas is also very hot and makes x-rays that can be seen using special cameras on satellites. One way that we study how galaxy clusters are born and change is by making pretend clusters inside of very large computers. When we do this we try to include all the important science laws of the Universe. But because computers are not powerful enough we cannot include  all the important things the way that they really work. That means that we have to include some things using other made up rules.  One example is that when galaxies form some of the gas turns into stars but most of it does not. We think that when stars form from gas they also make a lot of the other gas leave the galaxy as a wind. No one knows exactly how this works but different groups of people make up different rules to make this happen. The same rules are needed when one studies galaxy clusters. In this work we invent rules that can make galaxies that look like galaxies  in the real Universe and then we make pretend galaxy clusters in a computer  using those same rules.  We then compare those pretend galaxy clusters to real galaxy clusters.  We compare their x-rays and their galaxies. We find that we can make galaxy clusters that are similar to real clusters but that exactly how the pretend clusters looks changes a lot if we change the made up rules just a little bit.
