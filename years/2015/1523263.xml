<AbstractNarration>1523263 (Chertow)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is in partial support of the fourth Symposium on Industrial Ecology for Young Professionals (SIEYP IV), to be held in Surrey, UK on July 11, 2015. SIEYP IV is to be held in connection and immediately following the biannual International Society for Industrial Ecology (ISIE) conference, and is planned, organized, and attended by students and young professionals. It aims at promoting communication among graduate students and post-doctoral researchers in industrial ecology (IE) about their research, ideas, and experiences. This project is organized by the Student Chapter of the International Society for Industrial Ecology in an effort to encourage and financially support participation by U.S.-based students and post-doctoral researchers in the symposium and the ISIE 2015 Conference immediately preceding it. Members of groups underrepresented in IE are especially encouraged to apply. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The symposium will enable young professionals from around the world to establish an international network of industrial ecology researchers for ongoing exchange and future collaborations in topics such as life cycle assessment, industrial symbiosis, eco-design, material flow and stock analysis, environmentally extended input output analysis, and sustainable consumption. The theme of SIEYP IV will be "Envisioning Future Agendas in Industrial Ecology". During the past decades, industrial ecology has developed and matured in terms of its knowledge structure and content, theoretical foundations, analytical methods and tools, and its applications in real-world practices. It is thus the right time to ask where the discipline has been and where it is going, in order to drive it towards an unfolding new era. SIEYP IV will provide this opportunity for international students and young professionals- the next generation of industrial ecologists- to share and learn from each other, collectively reflecting upon the evolution of the discipline and envisioning its future agendas. It echoes the theme and focus of the ISIE 2015 Conference, which is aimed at "Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology".</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes and Conclusions  SIEYP IV was designed to provide a specialized opportunity to young professionals of Industrial Ecology (IE). Each year, many students express interest in participating in IE conferences. However, the number of IE conferences is very limited and young researchers often do not get the opportunity to present their research or cannot attend without receiving financial support for their travel expenses. SIEYP IV, dedicated to young researchers, provided them the rare opportunity for presentations, interactive focus groups, as well as for meeting senior researchers and industrial professionals in the field of IE. The symposium was the first opportunity for some new members to meet their peers in the field and introduce themselves, their work, and their visions. The 2015 SIEYP was unique inasmuch as it was motivated by the International Society for Industrial Ecology (ISIE) conference theme, it was the first following the formal integration of the formerly-named Student Chapter into the ISIE in 2014, and explicitly engaged students as stakeholders to the field of which they make up an important component-- including as future leaders.  Visions for the future of Industrial Ecology were formulated by an international group of almost 100 student and early career researchers and are planned to be published.
