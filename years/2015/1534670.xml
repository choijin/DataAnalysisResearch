<AbstractNarration>The aerosol-cloud-interaction (ACI) is one of the largest uncertainties of all known climate forcing mechanisms.  In the nutshell, the ACI is ultimately determined by the responses of cloud properties to variations in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) whose knowledge is thus the key to understanding the ACI.  Due to the impracticability of making large-scale continuous observations of CCN, the more readily measured aerosol optical quantities, such as aerosol optical depth (AOD), have been widely used as a proxy for CCN in ACI studies even though both properties represent different aspects of aerosols.  On the other hand, the two properties are affected by aerosol size distribution and chemical composition, so are linked to a certain degree.  In the first phase of this study funded by the NSF, the relationship between AOD and CCN with a focus on the influences of aerosol physical properties and ambient meteorology has been exploited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aerosol-cloud-interaction (ACI) is one of the largest uncertainties of all known climate forcing mechanisms.  In the nutshell, the ACI is ultimately determined by the responses of cloud properties to variations in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) whose knowledge is thus the key to understanding the ACI.  Due to the impracticability of making large-scale continuous observations of CCN, the more readily measured aerosol optical quantities, such as aerosol optical depth (AOD), have been widely used as a proxy for CCN in ACI studies even though both properties represent different aspects of aerosols.  On the other hand, the two properties are affected by aerosol size distribution and chemical composition, so are linked to a certain degree.  In the first phase of this study funded by the NSF, the relationship between AOD and CCN with a focus on the influences of aerosol physical properties and ambient meteorology has been exploited. This study will continue the pursuit but focus on investigating the effects of aerosol composition and hygroscopicity on the estimation of the ACI, estimating and reducing uncertainties due to the use of such relationships by means of both observations and modeling.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;1. A comprehensive analysis on the responses of cloud microphysical properties to aerosol optical, chemical, and hygroscopic properties will help gain deeper insights into the mechanisms behind the aerosol indirect effect.&lt;br/&gt;2. Accounting for the effects will help identify and quantify a bias in the estimate of the aerosol indirect effects by the conventional approach using ground or satellite measurements of AOD as a proxy for CCN to obtain better estimate of the ACI for different types of aerosols under diverse meteorological conditions.&lt;br/&gt;3. Modeling helps explain the mechanisms behind how cloud microphysical properties respond to aerosol composition/hygroscopicity by accounting for the influence of dynamic and thermodynamic conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;1. With an improved knowledge and understanding of the influence of aerosol chemical composition and/or hygroscopicity on cloud microphysical properties, the mechanism of aerosol indirect effect will be better understood. This will help narrow the large range of uncertainties as identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports.&lt;br/&gt;2. The research will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in measuring aerosols, retrieving cloud properties, data analysis, and modeling.&lt;br/&gt;3. The study will have an immediate impact on the teaching of cloud physics, atmospheric chemistry, climate, and environmental courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is a no-cost extention of the project during which we have finished the following study:  Liu, J., Z. Li, 2019, Aerosol properties and their influences on low warm clouds during the two-column aerosol project, Atmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 1-15, doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-9515-2019.     Twelve months of measurements collected during the Two-Column Aerosol Project field campaign at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, which started in the summer of 2012, were used to investigate aerosol physical, optical, and chemical properties, and their influences on the dependence of cloud development on thermodynamic (i.e., lower tropospheric stability, LTS) conditions. Relationships between aerosol loading and cloud properties under different dominant air-mass conditions and the magnitude of the first indirect effect (FIE), as well as the sensitivity of the FIE to different aerosol compositions, are examined. The seasonal variation in aerosol number concentration (Na) was not consistent with variations in aerosol optical properties (i.e., scattering coefficient, &sigma;s, and columnar aerosol optical depth), suggesting that a greater number of small particles with little optical sensitivity were present. Strong surface winds generally resulted in small &sigma;s and a little contribution of fine particles to the total scattering extinction, but resulted in large Na. Organics were found to have a large contribution to small particle sizes. This contribution decreased during the particle growth period. Under low aerosol loading conditions, the liquid water path (LWP) and droplet effective radius (DER) significantly increased with increasing LTS, but under high aerosol loading conditions, LWP and DER changed little, indicating that aerosols significantly weakened the dependence of cloud development on LTS. The reduction in LWP and DER from low to high aerosol loading conditions was greater in stable environments, suggesting that clouds under stable conditions are more susceptible to aerosol perturbations than those under more unstable conditions. High aerosol loading weakened the increase in DER as LWP increased and strengthened the increase in cloud optical depth (COD) with increasing LWP, resulting in changes in the interdependence of cloud properties. Under both continental and marine air-mass conditions, high aerosol loading can significantly increase COD and decrease LWP and DER, narrowing their distributions. Magnitudes of the FIE estimated under continental air-mass conditions ranged from 0.07&plusmn;0.03 to 0.26&plusmn;0.09 with a mean value of 0.16&plusmn;0.03 and showed an increasing trend as LWP increased. The calculated FIE values for aerosols with a low mass of organics are greater than those for aerosols with a high mass of organics . This implies that clouds over regions dominated by aerosol particles containing mostly inorganics are more susceptible to aerosol perturbations, resulting in larger climate forcing, than clouds over regions dominated by organic aerosol particles.
