<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Texas A&amp;M University at Corpus Christi will acquire a capillary electrophoresis instrument for teaching and research. Capillary electrophoresis is an ion separation technique which can analyze a solution of two or more components. It uses small chromatography columns (so called capillary tubes) and a voltage difference (electrophoresis) to effect the separation. It is effective at analyzing very small charged samples. This instrument will be used by undergraduate students in their research. It will be used in laboratory courses to train students in a technique often used in DNA, forensic and environmental analysis laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research especially in areas such as (a) gaining insight into factors responsible for chiral recognition with media specifically designed for use in chiral separations; (b) developing charged bipyridinium and extended bipyridinium based detergents to be evaluated as pseudostationary phases in micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC); and (c) examining major ion and metal transport in ground and surface water interactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Project Outcomes can be divided into two main categories: the impact funding of this grant has had on the students and on impact of the research on scientific knowledge.  The impact on the students can be best described by the research opportunities that have been provided them by the NSF through funding of this grant and the NSF funded research grants that have utilized the instrument purchased through this MRI grant.  This experience has resulted in 4 published manuscripts and 12 presentations at national conference and one regional conference.  The research has provided students opportunities that would not have otherwise been given to them. Of the 10 students listed in the participant section of this report, 6 are currently grad students who conducted undergrad research here.  Of the remaining 4, two are no longer conducting undergrad research but are still students here at TAMUCC and the other two plan to go to grad school.  So 8 out of 10 of the undergrad students associated with this grant are either in grad school or plan to attend grad school.   It is unclear what the plans of the other two are.           From a scientific perspective, the research that this grant has enabled has, as mentioned above,   resulted in 4 published manuscripts and 12 presentations at national conference and one regional conference.  More importantly, the acquisition of the capillary electrophoresis has enabled the research associated with two funded NSF research grants.  That research is part of an ongoing, long-term multi-faceted study focusing on development of structure-based predictive tools for investigating and elucidating the factors responsible for (a) self-assembly, (b) function, (c) higher ordered structure and (d) molecular recognition of amino acid based macromolecular assemblies.  The ultimate goal is to build a database of quantitative structure-enantioselective retention relationships that can be utilized to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different chiral selectors in capillary electrophoretic separation techniques.  While a significant amount of work has been done with chiral stationary phases utilized in HPLC, very little work has been done with pseudostationary phases utilized in capillary electrophoretic techniques.  In addition, since enantiorecognition of the systems under study are amino acids, the knowledge gained from these studies will be potentially transferable to other amino acid based systems such as proteins.    The Project Outcomes can be divided into two main categories: the impact funding of this grant has had on the        Last Modified: 11/30/2018       Submitted by: Eugene J Billiot]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
