<AbstractNarration>This project aims to develop 200-400 year-long tree-ring chronologies from the Amazon Basin to extend the short instrumental record of precipitation and streamflow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amazon River discharge, the largest on Earth, is modulated in part by ocean-atmospheric forcing from the tropical Atlantic and Pacific. Amazon discharge has been monitored since 1902 and appears to have entered a new regime of amplified hydrological variability. The recent divergence in minimum and maximum flows has no precedent in the short instrumental record. The cause of this intensified hydrological cycle over Amazonia is not known, but may arise from deforestation or moisture advection changes associated with the observed warming of the tropical North Atlantic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A severe decline in annual precipitation is predicted for the mid-21st century over most of Amazonia based on CMIP5 climate model ensemble simulations under business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions and land cover changes.  How unprecedented the recent and predicted hydroclimatic changes might be in the context of natural climate variability during the late Holocene cannot be determined empirically from the few short and spatially discontinuous instrumental observations from the Amazon Basin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tree-ring reconstructions have provided well-dated spatially distributed estimates of past megadroughts and pluvials needed for verifying model simulations of the dynamics responsible for decadal moisture regimes over North America and Asia.  However, the most biodiverse forest ecosystems in the world, the forests of Amazonia, have not produced freely available multi-century tree-ring chronologies useful for exact dating or climate reconstruction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the absence of a cold winter dormant season, most tropical tree species do not produce anatomically distinctive annual growth rings and therefore cannot be used for routine dendrochronology.  However, strong environmental rhythms do exist in some tropical forests and can induce annual tree-ring formation in a few native species.  These annual changes include the profound precipitation seasonality and prolonged flood pulse of lowland forests in the central, eastern, and southern Amazon. Colleagues on the research team have proven that annual rings exist in Macrolobium acaciifolium in these inundation forests and have demonstrated their potential value for hydroclimatic applications. Annual rings have also been proven in Bertholletia excelsa, Cedrella fissilis, C. odorata, and Centrolobium microchaete from seasonally dry upland forests of Brazil and eastern Bolivia, and ring width and oxygen isotope chronologies derived from them are related to large-scale climate variability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use new tree-ring chronologies to develop gridded regional moisture reconstructions, to frame the most extreme pre-instrumental and modern droughts in the context of climate change using CMIP5 ensemble simulations of the past millennium and the 21st century, and to explore the stability of ocean-atmospheric forcing of climate over Amazonia.&lt;br/&gt;The project will also leverage research resources and unite students and investigators from the United States, Brazil, Bolivia, and Argentina in the application of dendroclimatology to select tropical hardwoods in Amazonia. An international collaboration of climatologists, dendrochronologists, and forest scientists has been organized with the expertise required to solve the complexities involved in the exact tree-ring dating of tropical hardwoods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Amazon River is by far the largest river on earth.  It is larger than the combined discharge of the next six largest rivers in the world, two of which are tributaries to the Amazon.  The biome in the Amazon watershed is referred to as Amazonia and is home to the greatest florescence of life on earth.  One tenth of all species on the planet are found in Amazonia, including 3,000 species of freshwater fishes and at least 6,700 species of trees, compared with only 1,000 tree species native to the United States and Canada.  Species that are entirely new to science are discovered every year.  In fact, scientists estimate that there may actually be 16,000 tree species present in the unexplored Amazon.  This means that nearly 10,000 species of trees are still unknown to science in this watershed and many of them only exist on a few acres in these stunningly diverse forests.               Human activity is changing Amazonia.  The frequency of extreme drought and record flooding have both increased in the Amazon during the last 40-years, with major environmental and socioeconomic impacts.  Because instrumental rainfall and stream flow records are short in the remote Amazon, it is unclear if the recent droughts and floods are part of some naturally recurring climate cycles or if they are due to deforestation or climate change.  The University of Arkansas Tree-Ring Laboratory, with funding from the National Science Foundation, is working with colleagues at the Federal University of Lavras and the National Institute for Amazon Research in Brazil, and the Institute of Snow Science, Glaciology, and Environmental Science in Argentina to use tree rings to better understand climate variability and change in Amazonia.  The annual growth rings in trees can provide "proxy" or substitute records of rainfall during the centuries before modern meteorologists began measuring precipitation.  Small cores are extracted harmlessly from living trees, cross sections are cut from dead logs, and the tree rings can be dated to the exact calendar year when they were formed.               We have discovered tropical hardwood trees in the Rio Paru drainage of the eastern Amazon that live for 200- to 300-years and have distinctive annual growth rings that are highly correlated with rainfall.  The Rio Paru watershed is part of a huge area of pristine forests in the eastern Amazon that is nearly the size of California and contains the tallest trees in all of Amazonia.  Cedrela odorata trees have been used to develop long tree-ring chronologies and rainfall reconstructions that reveal many drought and wetness extremes, and interesting 30- to 40-year long episodes that were either relatively wet or relatively dry.  These "multi-decadal regimes" appear to be natural and may be responsible for some of the increase in drought and flood extremes recently witnessed in the Amazon.               We have also discovered that rainfall and tree growth extremes in the eastern Amazon are correlated with precipitation and tree growth anomalies of opposite sign in mid-latitude North and South America.  Consequently, when you have drought and poor tree growth in the Amazon, you also tend to have wetness and abundant tree growth in the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Patagonia.  So years of extreme rainfall and forest growth in the eastern Amazon resonate across the entire Western Hemisphere, orchestrated primarily by the El Nino/Southern Oscillation.  The new Cedrela chronologies from the Amazon, when compared with the hundreds of tree ring chronologies in temperate North and South America, document this Pan American resonance of climate and ecosystem extremes in the centuries before widespread deforestation or human caused climate change.  The long climate history written in the growth rings of old Cedrela trees in Amazonia will surely be important to the sustainability of the biome.
