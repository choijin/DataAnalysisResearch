<AbstractNarration>A non-technical description of the project, which explains the project's significance and importance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Channeled Scablands of Washington and Oregon are spectacular landmarks of geology. They were formed at the end of the last ice age when Glacial Lake Missoula breached its dam and a catastrophic flood carved the landscape as the water made its way to the Columbia River. Recent investigations have shown there was more than one flood episode; this project will use new dating techniques to provide a closer constraint on the ages and number of flood events. The project will then use these results in conjunction with a hydraulic model to evaluate the size and duration of these flood events and the effects on the landscape. The results could be used to examine the impact of large floods on topography in other parts of the world. The project will support the education of a female PhD student from an underrepresented group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A technical description of the project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By establishing the age of landscape development in this region, the new sampling sites strategically located to address a number of specific questions related to flood history that can be assessed with the proposed modeling scenarios, including: (1) How much of the landscape is the product of waning stages of one large flood versus of multiple-age floods? (2) How does the timing of advance and retreat the ice relate to ages of flood events? (3) Are all present flood landscapes related to the draining of glacial Lake Missoula? This new geochronology will indicate a variety of different flow paths taken by different-aged late Pleistocene mega-floods, different inundation levels for various flow events, and possibly even different source regions for generating the flows. To evaluate the implications of these anticipated results, a model will calculate time-varying topography resulting from glacial isostatic adjustment from the adjacent  ice sheet, and then use a hydraulic model which solves the full two-dimensional, depth-averaged momentum and continuity equations for free-surface flow.</AbstractNarration>
