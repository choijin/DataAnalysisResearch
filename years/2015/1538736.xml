<AbstractNarration>This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) collaborative research award supports fundamental research on an emerging welding technology - impact welding - to join material combinations that are otherwise difficult to join. Research will focus on aluminum-steel welds because there are diverse and important commercial needs in joining these metals.  Both base metals are well characterized and the development of robust aluminum-steel unions can reduce automobile mass. Lighter cars use less fuel and emit less carbon to the atmosphere. Research results will enable wider application of this technology in important industries including automotive, aerospace, and medical devices. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Traditional welding processes melt both metals to be joined and the molten mixing can result in brittle intermetallic compounds, rendering the joints unsuitable for most structural applications.  Impact welds can be strong and tough and are created in the solid state by a high-speed (typically 200-700 m/s) oblique collision between two metal surfaces. The objectives of this research are:  1) to understand how the thickness of the flyer plate (and therefore its total kinetic energy) affects the structure of the interface that is formed, 2) to understand the real-time evolution of strain, temperature and morphology of the interface during the impact welding process and 3) relate the deformation history to the final structure and properties of the weld.  Unique tools are used to study aluminum-steel impacts from flyer thicknesses of 25 Âµm to 25 mm.  Laser impact welding and explosive welding are used for the thinnest and thickest flyers, respectively, while vaporizing foil actuator welding will be used to accelerate flyers of several intermediate thicknesses.  Photonic Doppler velocimetry will enable detailed measurements of collision speed and angle.  Finite element models based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian methods will be developed for these problems. Their validity will be tested by metallographic examination of welded structures and comparison of these to simulation. These models will be used to understand the complex dynamic development of material strains, temperatures and structures and on a wide range of length scales.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Welding metals by impact offers a method to create strong welds (true metallic bonding) between advanced or dissimilar metal pairs without any far-field heating or heat input. This can provide remarkable advantages as the structure is not softened or distorted by heat, coatings over most of the area can remain intact and a true metallurgical bond can remain.  Further, in recent years there have been remarkable advances in developing practical processes to practice impact welding in conventional laboratory or manufacturing settings.    This program provided an experimentally based understanding of how the critical impact welding parameters (impact, speed, angle and the previously unexplored role of component dimensions) affect the structure of the impact-derived weld.  The approach most commonly used in this program is shown in Figure 1 and employs a vaporizing foil actuator (a thin piece of aluminum foil that is turned to aluminum vapor by a very fast high-current electrical discharge) to accelerate a flyer plate into a target.  As the line of impact moves from center to the edges, the impact speed decreases and impact angle increases. These factors are well-known to affect the development of impact welds.  This program likely represented the first time that this collision angle was measured during the process.  This was done using multi-point photonic Doppler velocimetry.    These experimentally measured boundary conditions are used to inform simulations of the welding process.  This adds to an emerging body of work that shows that multiple modeling approaches can capture the salient features of impact welding including morphology development, interface pressures, levels of deformation (strain) and temperatures.  This comparison is illustrated in Figure 2.  One area of focus in this work, that has been barely explored in the past, is the critical role of the thickness of the flyer and target.  These were systematically varied both in the Ohio State Laboratory as well as in experiments carried out by Nobel Clad, our GOALI partner, as shown in Figure 3.  This shows that as the flyer thickness increases the amount of heat input and melting at the interface of dissimilar metals increases.  This understanding is essential in practicing impact welding over the range of thicknesses that may be encountered in industries varying from the medical to petrochemical industry.    The high levels of strain, strain rate high temperature and rapid cooling rate produce a wide array of microstructural features as shown in Figure 5.  These microstructural features affect the strength and damage tolerance of the joined structure.  Generally, welds based on heating or melting have weakened "Heat Affected Zones" but in the case of "Impact Affected Zones" the regions ae often stronger and harder than the base metal.  This impact welding technoloy offers new possibilities in the fabrication of high strength structures.    This project has demonstrable achievements in improving the way impact welding is thought about and helps develop fundamentally-based engineering design methods.  Further, the training of students and collaborators of many types has aided the dissemination and application of these impact welding methods, which can aid in the construction of stronger, lighter and more robust mechanical structures of various sizes and configurations.  These tools will help tomorrow's designers.           Last Modified: 12/06/2019       Submitted by: Glenn S Daehn]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
