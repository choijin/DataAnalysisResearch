<AbstractNarration>Women of color in STEM disciplines at HBCUs often have a series of needs which, when met, have a positive impact on professional development and career advancement. Such faculty teach 3-4 courses per semester at a minority serving institution (or primarily undergraduate institution), or are a minority within their department and, therefore, tend to have high student advising/mentoring demands; or are early career faculty who may have difficulty negotiating the competing demands of teaching, service, and research.  They may even be mid-career faculty who are seeking to develop a steady track record of contribution to the discipline; and faculty who need coaching to navigate the campus climate while maintaining a solid record of research and make progress toward tenure and promotion. Currently, these needs are not being met fully at most institutions. When they are partially met it is through faculty development efforts that are often not discipline specific or are through an individual scholar's search for a career mentor or collaborator who may or may not be in the scholar's field of study.  The overall purpose of this proposal is to provide summer writing retreats with online intellectual community follow-up services to the higher education community to increase scholarly productivity and career advancement of women of color in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines while also being applicable to diverse scholars in other disciplines, especially those from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building from the knowledge gained from a previously funded research project, this team proposes to explore the feasibility of commercializing the following scholarly productivity resources: (1) a one week, in-residence Summer Writing Retreat; (2) a nine-week online service featuring access to accountability coaches and STEM consultants to facilitate completion of the summer writing project; and (3) an online academic year follow-up resource which includes expanded access to scholarly writing productivity tools such as peer writing groups, facilitated career advancement discussion groups, research and scholarly agenda planning tools, daily writing plans, and peer productivity partners.  The products provided will increase the scholarly productivity of individual faculty consumers while also supporting institutional consumers in the acquisition of a heightened awareness of the types of coaching, accountability, and collaboration that are necessary to recruit, retain, and support other underrepresented populations in their advancement in STEM academic careers.</AbstractNarration>

In keeping with these goals and objectives, the Advancing STARS Team engaged in extensive customer discovery interviews and ongoing development of a minimum viable product based on feedback from interviewees, which included: faculty, department chairs, assistant and associate deans, deans, provosts, vice presidents of research and academic affairs, as well as chancellors and presidents of universities.  The main outcomes of these interviews and the Team's participation included the following:  A revised minimum viable product: The focus of the proposed writing retreat service shifted from writing journal articles to a focus on developing competitive grant proposals. A renewed focus on the target population:  The initial plan was to focus on faculty at minority serving institutions.  The interviews revealed that although the service would be useful to faculty at other institutions, the need for support in developing competitive grant proposals for external funding was probably greatest among underrepresented groups doing innovative research and teaching at minority serving institutions. A core set of lessons learned about grant development at minority serving institutions, which culminated in a submission to the NSF White House Committee on HBCUs.  The group was interested in better understanding how federal programs might support increased submissions of competitive grant proposals from minority serving institutions.  A professionally developed suite of marketing and promotional materials:  Based on the lessons learned from the customer discovery interviews, a professional set of marketing materials was created to visually capture the essence of the Advancing STARS start-up.  The materials included a full color brochure with writing retreat services described, letterhead/envelopes, a website, half-page push card/flyer, social media tools, and business cards. Ongoing exploration of the Writing Retreat Service through related National Science Foundation Grants: Partnerships for Learning and Adaptation Network: Expanding the Network of STEM Scholars, which offers the writing retreat in partnership and collaboration with six minority serving institutions.  Two multi-institutional writing retreats have been hosted which have used the I-Corps L writing retreat core service model.
