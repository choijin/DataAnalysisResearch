<AbstractNarration>The General Theory of Relativity discovered by Einstein tells us that the familiar, everyday force of gravity is a manifestation of something much stranger: the bending of the geometry of space-time by matter. Among the key predictions of the theory is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. When the Advanced Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) reaches designed sensitivity as scheduled, the burst of radiation that may become the first detection of gravitational waves is already closer to the Earth than the closest star, Alfa Centauri. The gravitational waves in this first detection, and others following soon after, were very likely produced during the merger of binary systems involving black holes and/or neutron stars. There is realistic optimism that, at the turn of the decade, enough of these and other sources will be observed to state with confidence that proper observational gravitational wave physics has arrived. This will of course depend on having in place exquisite interferometric engineering, clever analysis of extremely noisy data, and state of the art source modeling. Regarding the latter, it is imperative to continue exploiting the tools of numerical relativity to model not only as many gravitational wave source scenarios as possible, but also to improve the physics content captured by the simulations. The science in this project supports directly this enterprise, namely numerical relativity modeling to enhance our understanding of sources of gravitational radiation and of gravitational phenomena driving electromagnetic signatures.  The proposed research will have an impact beyond the confines of gravitational wave physics and numerical relativity.  Achieving success in the multi-messenger, computing, and data-analytics projects in this project necessitates an interdisciplinary environment reaching across astrophysics, computing science and even engineering. The Center for Relativistic Astrophysics at Georgia Tech will be capable of providing such an environment since its mission is to foster research and education linking high-energy astrophysics, astro-particle physics, cosmology and gravitational wave physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research focused on the computational modeling of  black holes and neutron stars as sources of gravitational radiation. The proposal considers several projects that involve astrophysics with a common denominator  -- the crucial role played by dynamical gravity and the curvature of space-time. The astrophysical phenomena in these projects arise from a marriage between general relativistic gravitation and complex multi-physics involving fluid flows, electromagnetic fields, radiation transport and realistic equations of state. The effort also aims at enhancing our comprehensive  understanding  of astrophysical phenomena beyond what gravitational waves alone will be able to tell,  in other words, electromagnetic and gravitational wave phenomena leading to multi-messenger observations.  The research is organized into two areas: 1) Compact object binaries and a sandbox of simulation data; and 2) Tidal stellar disruptions by massive black holes. The proposed work will give postdocs and students the opportunity to interact with researchers in computing science and engineering, to develop and implement numerical algorithms for magneto-hydrodynamics, work with large data sets and to participate in a variety of outreach activities. The experience gained in high performance computing, optimization, data analytics, and software engineering will further the careers of young researchers participating in the effort, acquiring valuable skills that are in demand in a broad range of professions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the four fundamental interactions that govern our understanding of the universe is gravity.   The ability of scientists to probe the role of gravity in the universe has fundamentally changed with the first detection of gravitational waves.  Gravitational waves are oscillations in the structure of space that are caused by non-uniform accelerating mass.   The strongest sources of gravitational waves comes from the collision of black holes.  The NSF funded LIGO detector has observed the gravitational waves emitted by black holes colliding.  This grant supports the efforts to detect and interpret the gravitational wave observations.    The intellectual merit of the work supported by the grant supported several areas of interest.   One of the main goals were to provide and use a sandbox of gravitational waves from the black hole collisions.  These waveforms are found by solving Einstein's equations using computational techniques that allow the solutions to reach the non-linear regime of gravity.  The waveforms were then used in several impactful works.   These works include finding a new method of measuring how much the black-hole remnant that is the survivor of the black hole collision is spinning.  The work also identified a means to measure the speed along the line of site for that remnant black hole.   In addition, the work made progress in the pursuit of observing the first intermediate mass black holes.  The resulting gravitational waves were also used in collaboration with other numerical relativity teams to help prepare for the continued detection of black hole binaries by the NSF observatory, LIGO.  The second main goal of this grant was to study neutron stars.  A new method of specifying initial data was completed with this grant and published.    The broader impacts of this grant impacted people in STEM and technology.  The grant supported two PhD students, one female, and several undergraduate students (one female) many of whom are currently in graduate school in STEM fields.  The grant also provides the scientific community with waveform products, these are publicly available on the web.
