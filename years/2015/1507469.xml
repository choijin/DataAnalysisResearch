<AbstractNarration>1507469(Meneveau)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to discover new fundamental phenomena in turbulent flow by generating new high fidelity data and by making these new data available to the whole scientific community of the Nation.  Basic features of turbulence that depend on the multiple time and length scales observed in turbulent flows will be explored, and software tools that enable such analysis will be developed and offered to the research community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lagrangian chaos and transition to turbulence will be studied using datasets arising from massive computer simulations that are ingested into web-accessible, open numerical laboratories. It is known that the transition to turbulence occurs through a sequence of phenomena characterized by high spatio-temporal complexity. However, very little is known about how Lagrangian chaos manifests itself at the multiple scales of turbulence, and how transitional behavior of turbulence may be better characterized. Turbulence also is known to contain vortical structures at the smallest scales, and at large-scales.  This project aims to answer fundamental questions about the hierarchical organization of vortical structures at multiple scales and their relationship to the energy cascade.  The co-PIs have developed an open, computational data-enabled turbulence laboratory where the entire space-time data is available to the wider research community. The project will further develop multiscale versions of the 4D flow datasets, effectively adding a 5th dimension (scale) to the data.  While the currently available resource at Johns Hopkins is focused on isotropic turbulence, the proposed effort will extend the data to other more complex cases than isotropic turbulence, like channel flow data.  Availability of data and availability of analysis tools will enable a step change in turbulence research, possibly transforming the way researchers work in this area by democratizing access to high-quality simulation data. Educational modules, mostly based on Matlab, will also allow students to query simulation datasets in unprecedented detail.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this project a new paradigm for computational science has been developed and applied to fluid turbulence: the notion of open numerical laboratories. The basic idea of the project was to develop tools and methods that allow anyone with an internet connection to access the results from massive state-of-the-art simulations of high Reynolds number turbulent flows, and to use these methods to advance science. In the past, access to large computational data was highly restrictive: users had to download flat files form some servers, figure out their format, and typically have to use massive parallel computing facilities for further analysis. In the approach pursued in this project, users of the open numerical laboratory simply specify positions and times at which data are desired, and a Web Services enabled database returns field variables (e.g. fluid velocity and pressure) at the desired points and times. The ability to very efficiently return data at such &ldquo;virtual sensor&rdquo; locations is a distinguishing feature of the system.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this project, several technical developments took place than enable such a system to function more effectively, and the system was used by team members to answer several fundamental questions in turbulence.&nbsp;</p> <p>Technical developments included implementation of a new FileDB system. In the past, data sets from simulations had to undergo a lengthy ingest process into the database. With FileDB, the data are stored on a series of flat files on the regular file system. The database opens the files only when data are required. This method has greatly accelerated the speed at which we can create new databases for new flows, and it has been applied in this project to create a new transitional turbulent boundary layer database (see Figure 1).&nbsp;Also, a distributed parallel analysis methodology was developed to detect extreme events during simulation on for next generation HPC architectures. Another development was to build&nbsp;a task-parallel&nbsp;Lagrangian Particle Tracking approach for the channel flow database. Users specify initial positions and time, and a final time, and the database computes the Lagrangian fluid trajectory and final positions that are returned to the user. For channel flow in the presence of walls, several technical details had to be surmounted to implement this new tool. This tool was used to evaluate, for the first time, finite time Lyapunov exponent statistics in channel flow (see Figure 2). Moreover, using insights from the isotropic turbulence database, a new model for pressure Hessian (the tensor consisting of all second order derivatives of the pressure) was developed, including a multiple-time scale version of the model. We also were able to measure the statistics of velocity gradients in isotropic turbulence at all scales from the viscous to the integral scale. The results will be useful to better quantify the results from Large Eddy Simulations since now we know what statistics to expect at various scales.&nbsp;</p> <p>Further analysis shed new light on geometry and scaling laws of excursion and iso-sets in isotropic turbulence, specifically that correlation functions of these excursion sets display clear power-law behavior in the inertial range (see Figure 3). Further theoretical work assisted by JHTDB led to a novel Lagrangian fluctuation-dissipation theorem and new insights on spontaneous stochasticity in turbulence (see Figure 4). Finally, a new method to apply machine learning to the problem of identifying the turbulent-boundary-layer interface in a transitional flow was developed.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p> <p>The data have been used in over 150 peer-reviewed journal publications on turbulence from authors world-wide, including in premier journals such as Nature, Science and PNAS.
