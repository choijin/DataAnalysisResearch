<AbstractNarration>The ages of stars are notoriously difficult to determine, and our current inability to measure stellar ages is severely limiting our progress in many areas of astrophysics. For example, the age of a star is the age of its planets, and we must know the age in order to evaluate the likelihood that a given planet has conditions favorable to life. This work advances our understanding of observable proxies for age, namely a star's rotation and magnetic activity, so that we can eventually use these to obtain ages for stars less massive than the Sun. It will also support a hands-on teacher-training program that seeds and supports astronomy clubs at public schools around New York City. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existence of an age-rotation-activity relation (ARAR) has been known for 40 years now, generating hope that measurements of rotation or activity could be used to obtain the ages of isolated field stars. This project will improve the empirical calibration of the ARAR by using observations of stars in open clusters. These stars' well-defined ages make them valuable targets for measuring rotation periods and indicators of magnetic activity such as H-alpha and X-ray luminosities. The goal of the project is to complete a sensitive, unbiased survey of rotation and magnetic activity in the Hyades and Praesepe, two key, nearby 600-Myr-old clusters. New observations will be used to test the relationship between rotation and activity in a mass-independent manner. This will help  calibrate the low-mass ARAR beyond 100 Myr.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A star's age is one of its most fundamental parameters, but it is notoriously difficult to measure directly. In order to obtain reliable stellar ages, one approach has been to identify observational proxies for age, such as the rotation rate of a star or its levels of magnetic activity, which are known to decline over time. Unfortunately, however, the exact dependence of rotation or activity on age is still unknown for the vast majority of stars, and in particular for stars less massive than the Sun.

Open clusters are fundamental laboratories for calibrating the relationship between stellar age and rotation because their member stars were all born at the same time and have similar compositions; furthermore, there are reliable, independent ways of establishing how old open clusters are (these two clusters are about 600 million years old, and so we sometimes treated them as one cluster, nicknamed HyPra).</p> <p>The main results of our efforts in the Hyades were that we measured rotation periods for fully convective stars in the Hyades for the first time, thereby extending our picture of the rotational behavior of stars in this cluster down to the lowest masses. An examination of the binary information available for the Hyades also allowed us to refine our analysis of the mass-period distribution its members, and in particular to determine that most of the fast rotating stars in the cluster that are *not* fully convective appear to be binaries. Both of these results have a major impact on tests of theoretical models for rotational evolution, as those models try to replicate the distribution in mass-period space of stars of a given age (see figures). Anchoring the models with the fully convective stars on one hand, and acknowledging the role of binarity in biasing (some of) the distribution to faster rotation periods on the other, is essential to correctly calibrating the models.</p> <p>The main results of our efforts in Praesepe&nbsp;were that&nbsp;we measured rotation periods for nearly 700 Praesepe members, thereby providing as full a description of the mass-period distribution for stars across a wide range of masses as is available for any cluster. We also investigated the impact of binaries on the mass-period distribution, finding here again that a significant fraction of the rapidly rotation, non-convective stars are binaries. However, unlike in the Hyades, the information available about binary status for stars in Praesepe is sparse.
