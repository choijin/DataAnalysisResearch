<AbstractNarration>This collaboration among five diverse institutions will build and nurture a community of faculty committed to integrating computation in undergraduate physics courses.  Although computational methods are important in physics research, they are scarce in the undergraduate physics curriculum. This project will address this need through faculty development workshops, a post-workshop support system, and a community building research project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on developing transportable, adaptable, and sustainable methods for infusing an instructional strategy into the undergraduate physics curriculum. It will place computer-based, algorithmic problem solving in a position that is coequal to traditional mathematical and experimental methods.  Participants will develop computational exercises to be integrated into their physics courses at the workshops, and later will receive support to ensure that the integration of their developed materials into their courses is successful.  Faculty ownership will be emphasized in the participants' development activities and is essential for transportability and sustainability. The project will conduct a thorough research study of the effectiveness of the community building approach, as well as the degree to which integration of computation into undergraduate physics courses has increased. It will serve as a case-study informing the literature on change in higher education practices. This research component and its dissemination plan will ensure that the community will continue to grow not only in membership, but also in the large-scale assessment and implementation of best practices.  When the computational materials developed are used in physics classrooms, STEM student learning across the country will be enhanced.</AbstractNarration>

Through this grant, the PICUP has moved from a burgeoning informal group of physicists with experience in intertwining computational activities in undergraduate physics courses, to a well- known community of physics faculty that are committed to positively enhancing the undergraduate STEM curriculum nation-wide. We have greatly exceeded the impact of initially proposed work by recruiting and supporting more than three times the originally proposed number of faculty through an expansion of our week-long summer faculty development workshops, and a modification of our efforts to include departmental and regional workshops. We have directly impacted more than 800 physics faculty from a diversity of physics departments across the country through various workshops conducted over the past 4 years. Through the post-workshop commitment to supporting participants, and the associated research and evaluation efforts, we have maintained mutually supportive relationships with most of our workshop alumni. We find that most have indeed made sigificant efforts to include computational activities in their courses.   The project included informing faculty about effective, tested ways to integrate computational activities into their courses, and offering continuing, post-workshop support for their curriculum-changing efforts; a repository of educational materials, to which over 1,300 Verfied Educators have requested access; the establishment of a peer review process for the repository of educational mateials as well as the development of a rubric and procedure for reviewers; and the results of the community-building research project: how faculty come into the community of those teaching computation, what faculty roles develop in that community, and how faculty take up those different roles. The grant also supported research that has revealed critical principles that can be applied towards fostering communities focused on instructional change leading to several research publications.
