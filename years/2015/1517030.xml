<AbstractNarration>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) has been building a global network of fully automated, or robotic, telescopes, called "Skynet".  Skynet is capable of controlling scores of telescopes simultaneously, including most commercially available small-telescope hardware, and now numbers 20 telescopes spanning Chile, Australia, the United States, and Italy. Skynet fulfills both research and education missions, for tens of thousands of users -- including professionals and students of all ages, graduate school through elementary school.  Skynet's user community consists of UNC-CH, 13 regional undergraduate institutions including three minority-serving institutions, and UNC-CH's Morehead Planetarium and Science Center. Partnerships with many other institutions, nationally and internationally, produce additional high-impact, small-telescope science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program directly supports Skynet's senior systems engineer to  (1) continue to integrate new instruments and new telescopes into Skynet; (2) continue to develop Skynet's telescope control and web-based, dynamic queue-scheduling software; and (3) continue to develop Afterglow, which is easy-to-learn and easy-to-use, but publication quality, web-based data reduction and analysis software integrated into Skynet's database.  These efforts will significantly impact UNC-CH's ability to study gamma-ray bursts, but more importantly, they will significantly impact research and research training that is being carried out across Skynet's larger, and rapidly growing, user community, on transient and time-variable phenomena in general.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ OVERVIEW:  The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) began building "Skynet" and "PROMPT" in 2004.  Skynet is sophisticated telescope control and queue scheduling software.  Skynet enables telescopes to function either individually or as an integrated whole, even if at multiple sites, all controlled through a single, web-based user interface.  Skynet is capable of controlling scores of telescopes simultaneously, including most commercially available small-telescope hardware.  The Skynet Robotic Telescope Network consists of both UNC-CH and non-UNC-CH telescopes, and now spans four continents and five countries.     PROMPT is a subset of the Skynet Robotic Telescope Network, consisting of our highest-quality telescopes at our highest-quality sites.  Currently, PROMPT consists of:  (1) three 16-inch, three 24-inch, and one 32-inch diameter telescopes at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO); and (2) four 17-inch diameter telescopes at Siding Spring Observatory (SSO) in eastern Australia.     We have continued significant upgrades to Skynet?s software capabilities, and have completed significant upgrades to PROMPT?s hardware capabilities, including:  (1) relocating two now unused 16-inch diameter telescopes to geographically advantageous, and dark, sites, in western Australia and mid-latitude Alberta, Canada; and (2) commissioning and integration into Skynet of a robotic polarimeter that we have designed, built, and deployed on one of our 24-inch diameter telescopes at CTIO.     INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Originally built to carry out simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) &ndash; deaths of massive stars and births of black holes &ndash; when only tens of seconds old, PROMPT?s mission has expanded significantly.  PROMPT, and to an increasing extent Skynet?s non-PROMPT telescopes as well, now serve a rapidly growing state, national, and international user community as a broad-based platform for small-telescope science.     In addition to being used to study GRBs, PROMPT, often in campaigns with other optical and radio telescopes around the world, and also with space telescopes, is being used to study blazars, supernovae, novae, pulsating white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs, polars, a wide variety of variable stars, a wide variety of binary stars, exoplanetary systems, trans-Neptunian objects and Centaurs, asteroids, and near-Earth objects.  Over the past 11 years, but mostly over the past 6 &ndash; 7 years, Skynet observations have resulted in over 90 journal articles, including four in Nature and one in Science, with another approximately dozen submitted or in preparation across the network.  Furthermore, these publications have been of increasingly high impact, now resulting in nearly 2,200 citations, with nearly 2,000 of these in refereed publications.     PROMPT has been incredibly productive, especially at our older, more-established CTIO site.  However, our users have also been limited in significant ways.  We have now upgraded the size and field of view of many of our telescopes.  By continuing to upgrade Skynet?s software, and specifically its telescope control software, and by continuing to expand PROMPT?s geographic distribution and instrumentation capabilities, our users are able to better capitalize on integrated observing modes that are already built into Skynet?s scheduling software.     BROADER IMPACTS:  PROMPT is used by professional astronomers, students of all ages &ndash; graduate through elementary &ndash; and members of the general public across North Carolina, the United States, and the world for a wide array of research, research training, and education and public engagement (EPE) efforts.  PROMPT?s user community consists of UNC-CH, 13 regional undergraduate institutions, including three minority-serving institutions, Morehead Planetarium and Science Center, and many other institutions, nationally and internationally, that we have partnered with to produce additional high-impact, small-telescope science.  Many of our research and research-training users are from smaller institutions without a comparable instrument &ndash; some do not even have a campus telescope.  However, leveraged by PROMPT, our users have forged partnerships with users of other optical and radio telescopes around the world, and also of space telescopes.
