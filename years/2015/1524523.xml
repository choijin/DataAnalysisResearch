<AbstractNarration>Revised Title: Collaborative Research: Functional evolution of the mammalian backbone: insights from the forerunners of mammals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mammals are known for their great range of locomotor behaviors, including unique gaits such as galloping and bounding. These gaits are made possible by the subdivision of the backbone into two distinct regions: the thoracic region, which bears ribs and aids in breathing; and the lumbar region, which is ribless, highly mobile and functions in locomotion. Combined, these two sections of the backbone allow mammals to breathe and move simultaneously, permitting the use of high speed gaits for prolonged periods of time. But, how did this key mammalian trait evolve? Using cutting-edge 3D technology, along with the rich fossil record of mammals and their ancestors, this research will trace the origin and evolution of the mammalian backbone and its link with the development of mammal-specific locomotor behaviors. The work will deepen our understanding of the history of a key characteristic of mammals and part of the skeleton that is of great medical importance. Dissemination of the research will occur via two primary outlets. First, a series of educational online videos will be produced by the award-winning YouTube channel "The Brain Scoop". The series will include three episodes documenting different stages of the research project in a fun and engaging way, with the core aim to encourage an increased interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) topics among teenagers and young adults. Second, the "The Brain Scoop" series will be used as the foundation for an 'Experience Box' in the Field Museum's N. W. Harris Learning Collection. The box will be available for K-12 educators to borrow and use in their classrooms, and will include replica specimens and activities related to each episode that are directly tied to Next Generation Science Standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mammals are known for their great range of locomotor behaviors, including unique asymmetric gaits such as galloping and bounding. Asymmetric gaits are made possible by the subdivision of the dorsal vertebral column (the area between the pectoral and pelvic girdles) into two morphologically and functionally distinct regions. Anteriorly, the thoracic region bears ribs and is specialized for respiration, whereas posteriorly the dorsoventrally mobile lumbar region functions in locomotion. Combined, the regionalized dorsal vertebrae allow mammals to breathe and move simultaneously, permitting the use of high speed gaits for prolonged periods of time. But, how did this key mammalian trait evolve? Modern species provide little information for examining this fundamental evolutionary question, as they all possess distinct thoracic and lumbar regions. However, the clade to which mammals belong, Synapsida, has a rich fossil record that provides a detailed view of the origin and evolution of mammals. Using cutting-edge morphometric, biomechanical, and 3D digital modeling techniques, this project takes a deep-time approach to examine function of the vertebral column in fossil synapsids, and to trace the origin and evolution of the thoracolumbar region and dorsoventral mobility. Four synergistic approaches will be utilized: 1) morphometric data will be used to examine the degree of morphofunctional regionalization of the dorsal vertebral column in modern tetrapods and fossil synapsids; 2) ex vivo bending experiments will be conducted on the vertebral columns of modern tetrapods bracketing the synapsid-mammal transition to determine the link between form and function; 3) novel virtual bending experiments will be carried out on 3D digital models of fossil synapsid vertebral columns to determine their propensity for movement; and 4) the data will be synthesized within a strict phylogenetic context to reconstruct the origin and evolution of the thoracolumbar region and dorsoventral mobility.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The spine resembles a series of beads on a string, with each bead corresponding to a single bone - a vertebra. In most four-legged animals, like lizards, the vertebrae all look and function the same. But mammal backbones are different. Vertebrae in different sections or regions of the spine - like the neck, thorax, and lower back - take on very different shapes. They function separately and so can adapt to different ways of life, like running, flying, digging, and climbing. While mammal backbones are very specialized, the regions which underlie them were thought to be very ancient, dating back to the earliest land animals. Mammals were just making the most of the existing anatomical blueprint. Reconstructing the evolution of the mammal spine is, however, difficult using only modern animals. To test whether mammal spine regions are an ancient evolutionary feature requires an analysis of the fossil record.</p> <p>But, studying fossils is challenging. Fossils are by their nature uncommon and finding whole extinct animals with all 25 plus vertebrae in place is extremely rare. To tackle this problem, museum collections from around the world were scoured for the most perfectly preserved fossils, which lived some 320 million years ago. To gain access to the anatomy hidden in stone, the fossils were scanned using X-ray computed tomography, vertebrae were made into three-dimensional digital models, and dozens of measurements taken. Over a thousand vertebrae were studied - including those from extinct animals, as well as living mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. To interpret the data collected, a series of statistical methods were developed to calculate the number of regions in the spine of each animal studied. If vertebral regions had remained unchanging through evolution, as hypothesized, the same number of regions were expected in the extinct mammal forerunners as are present in mammals today. This wasn't the case.</p> <p>The earliest mammal relatives had fewer regions than living mammals - three in total. Around 270 million years ago, a new region evolved in close proximity to the shoulder blades, accompanying dramatic changes in the forelimbs of animals known as non-mammalian therapsids. Those simultaneous changes likely occurred in conjunction with changes in how the animals walked and ran. Later, another region emerged in the ancestor of modern mammals near the pelvis - presumably as a result to changes in the genetic blueprint for laying out spine regions early in development. Importantly, it is this last region, the ribless lumbar region, that appears to be most adaptable: of all the vertebrae - from head to tail - the lumbar vertebrae have evolved the fastest in mammals and display the greatest variation in their anatomy and function. Thus, this last step in mammal spine evolution seems to be the most important in generating the enormous ecologically diversity that characterizes living mammals today.</p> <p>To disseminate this research to a broad public audience, a series of online videos entitled <em>Harvard Adventures!</em> were developed in collaboration with the YouTube channel <em>The Brain Scoop</em>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL8_5VpX9TxrP35cKyS8M6GVykLkb9BrW">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL8_5VpX9TxrP35cKyS8M6GVykLkb9BrW</a>. <em>The Brain Scoop</em> aims to increase scientific literacy and critical thinking skills by encouraging audience members to become engaged in all aspects of natural history, and presents topics in an informal, highly engaging way.
