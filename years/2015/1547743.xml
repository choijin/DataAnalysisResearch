<AbstractNarration>Recent developments in software for solving nonlinear polynomial systems may provide many scientists and engineers the tools needed to solve key problems in their research. To facilitate the training necessary to make best use of these powerful tools, the PIs will run a workshop May 23-25, 2016 at the University of Notre Dame. In addition to training, the workshop will also provide cross-fertilization between the mathematical sciences and other areas of science and engineering by bringing together a diverse group of researchers and software developers to exchange both knowledge and challenges. These interactions will spur practical research in applications while highlighting needs for future algorithm development. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Since they arise in many areas of science and engineering, several approaches have been developed for solving polynomial systems. The software package Bertini, which is being redeveloped in C++ and Python for modularity and scriptability, implements key numerical algebraic geometric algorithms for solving and manipulating polynomial systems.  This workshop will bring together a wide range of computational scientists and practitioners to discuss recent progress and current challenges in software, algorithms, and applications of numerical algebraic geometry. This interdisciplinary workshop will include small group discussions, hands-on demonstrations of Bertini, and sessions focused on developing Bertini modules related to participants' particular interests.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was used to partially support many early career researchers (graduate students, postdocs, and researchers without federal funding) to attend two meetings held at the University of Notre Dame: "Workshop on Software and Applications of Numerical Algebraic Geometry" (May 23-25, 2016) and "Polynomials, Kinematics, and Robotics" (June 507, 2017).   The 2016 workshop taught the attendees about the basics of numerical algebraic geometry so that they can use these tools in their own research.  This workshop also described using numerical algebraic geometry to solve several applications from robotics, kinematics, and chemical engineering.  This workshop included software demonstrations so that the attendees can understand some of the tools available in numerical algebraic geometry as well as an open problem session.  One of the open problems presented was the robotics synthesis problem for three-revolute spatial chains for body guidance, which has since been solved as a result of this workshop.  The 2017 conference included speakers who discussed the history of the development of numerical algebraic geometry, current successes in robotics and kinematics, and future research challenges.   A poster presentation allowed many early career researchers to share their research with the participants of the conference.  All participants received a 3D printed algebraic surface for their participation, with the top two posters receiving larger 3D printed algebraic surfaces for their accomplishments.  The intellectual merits lie in the expanded knowledge of addressing the fundamental topic of solving nonlinear polynomial systems of equations. By bringing together a diverse group of participants to exchange both knowledge and challenges, these events spurred practical research in applications while also highlighting immediate needs for research in algorithm development.
