<AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The political durability and economic accomplishments of authoritarian regimes under the single-party government have long interested social scientists and policymakers, especially since these regimes lack the liberal institutionalism that scholars typically associate with development and good governance. This project seeks to cast a new perspective on single-party government resilience by probing the informal dimension of the system. More specifically, it focuses on how networks of patron-client relations structure political interactions among party elites and shape the broader patterns of political and economic development at both the national and subnational levels.  Contrary to the conventional wisdom that views informal, clientelistic relations as primarily a cause for corruption, political instability and economic decay, this project argues that they actually contribute to the single-party government's resilience by serving as a key organizational mechanism that mobilizes, incentivizes, and coordinates actors in a system where the formal institutions are poorly equipped to perform such functions. Using China as the case of interest, this project contributes to a growing body of research on the role of informal institutions in political and economic governance. The project also offers new data and methods for reconstructing the social world of Chinese political elites since the 1990s. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to cast a new perspective on single-party government resilience by probing the informal dimension of the system. The research project seeks to systematically measure the presence of informal networks among Chinese elites and evaluate their impacts on the following four dimensions: (1) political institutionalization, (2) economic development, (3) policy implementation, and (4) anticorruption enforcement. The main quantitative evidence is drawn from an original biographical database of over 4,000 politicians at city, provincial, and national levels since early 1990s. The project develops new automated algorithms for identifying patron-client ties by linking lower-level officials with political superiors who oversaw their major promotions in the past, and leverages carefully chosen natural experiments to estimate the causal effects of informal networks. To supplement the quantitative analyses, the PI will also conduct in-depth interviews with serving and retired officials in both central and local governments, and collects additional historical and archival materials during his fieldwork in China.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The main output of the project was the co-PI (Junyan Jiang)'s dissertation, Fragmented Unity: Patronage Politics and Authoritarian Resilience in China. Departing from the prevailing view of the literature that authoritarian regimes extend their longevity primarily by revamping their institutions to mimic (although imperfectly) their democratic counterparts, the dissertation offers an alternative perspective for understanding the the political durability of China, the largest authoritarian country in the world, by tracing its roots to the enduring and informal aspect of the system. Focusing on the intra-elite patron-client networks, the dissertation argues that, contrary to the conventional view that they are merely a symptom of backward and corrupt patrimonial regimes, these informal networks make important contributions to the stability and effectiveness of the regime by fostering trust and cooperation among political actors in an environment where credibility is usually in short supply.

Since the seminal work of Geddes (1999); Geddes (2003), a burgeoning line of research has examined how authoritarian regimes create and adapt formal institutions to address both sources of threats and to sustain intra-elite cooperation.

However, there is still a dearth of research on the role of informal institutions in autocratic systems, despite a general consensus that the most important rules of politics in those systems are still largely unwritten.
