<AbstractNarration>With this EAGER award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professors William Dichtel and Damian Helbling of Cornell University to develop a porous polymer derived from cornstarch that rapidly removes organic pollutants from water. The first polymer derived from this approach shows rapid pollutant uptake and can be regenerated and reused under more mild conditions than activated carbons. The project focuses on studying the fundamental processes by which contaminants bind to the polymer at environmentally relevant concentrations as well as further improving the polymer's properties. In this way, it addresses critical issues associated with water contamination that represents an important challenge relevant to the food-energy-water nexus. The broader impacts of the work include the societal benefit of new water purification technologies as well as a planned effort to remove pesticides from water sources contaminated by agricultural runoff in a developing country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on new porous polymers based on cyclodextrin monomers. Preliminary experiments demonstrated the promise of this approach but focused on relatively high concentrations of target pollutants. The removal of a larger number of organic micropollutants are being evaluated at environmentally relevant concentrations. Kinetic and thermodynamic binding parameters for the removal of individual compounds and compound mixtures by the cyclodextrin polymer are being compared to those of various activated carbons. These studies inform parallel efforts to change the polymer structure to vary its uptake properties and improve its surface area and control particle size. Finally, a sustainability analysis of the monomers and manufacture of the polymer is underway, so as to evaluate the inputs associated with manufacturing this material as an additional metric of its potential utility.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project resulted in major developments of porous cyclodextrin polymers as materials that can remove trace organic pollutants, such as pharmaceutical agents, pesticides, and industrial chemicals.   The project led to the following major outcomes:  We found that our cyclodextrin polymers rapidly remove pollutants, with a selectivity for positively charged pollutants. We also showed that naturally occuring organic matter found in ground water does not interfere with our polymer, whereas it does interfere with the performance of competing materials such as activated carbons. These positive attributes suggest that our polymerscould be a suitable alternative to AC with potential applications like batch adsorption contactor processes followed by ultrafiltration or filtration-type column treatment.  Our polymer has a high affinity for positively charged MPs, and moderate affinity for neutral and negatively charged MPs. This is likely the result of attractive interactions with negatively charged groups in the polymer.   We also developed a procedure for using the polymer for the effective concentration of pollutants from dilute water streams. Such methods are used commonly to detect and quantify pollutants, and our polymers may find a use for this purpose in industrial and analytical laboratories.  We developed an effective method to remove pollutants from the polymer under mild conditions, which allows the polymer to be reused.  Binding data for nearly 100 pollutants were used to develop predictive models of pollutant uptake for our polymer and activated carbon. These models also give insight into the mechanism of pollutant uptake and will inform the design of new polymers.  We developed an improved understanding of the formation of our polymers and identified a previously unknown side-reaction that impacts polymer performance and manufacturability.  The connection between phenolate binding groups and a selectivity for cationic micropollutants suggests future designs of cyclodextrin polymers with cationic groups incorporated to target anionic MPs.  The Broader Impacts of this project were:  Knowledge gained from these studies has informed the preparation and performance of a novel adsorbent to address the major societal challenge of organic pollutants in waste water resources.  This knowledge base has greatly aided in the commercialization potential of these materials, which are necessary to address the micropollutant problem and will contribute jobs and economic development within the United States. These polymers are currently being commercialized by a startup company.  The project supported outstanding scientific training for two graduate students, one in chemistry and the other in environmental engineering. Both students have had opportunities to communicate their results through scientific publications and conferences, and are well prepared for scientific and engineering careers.
