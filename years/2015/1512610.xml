<AbstractNarration>1512610&lt;br/&gt;Xu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern indoor environments contain a vast array of manufactured products, many of which emit toxic contaminants that can harm children. Of special concern are crib mattresses, as infants spend most of their time sleeping, with their breathing zone and skin in close proximity to, or touching, the source, and thus are likely to be exposed to elevated concentrations of released chemicals, including organophosphates and phthalates. Although the adverse health effects associated with exposure to these semi-volatile organic compounds have been extensively demonstrated, accurate evaluation of infants' exposure and the subsequent health effect remain hamstrung by a poor understanding of the emission and fate of these semi-volatile organic compounds in sleep microenvironments. The goal of this research is to explicitly elucidate the fundamental mechanisms governing emission, transport, and infants' exposure associated with organophosphates and phthalates in sleep microenvironments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that govern the release of organophosphates and phthalates from crib mattresses and incorporate these mechanisms into a new transport and exposure model. The PI will be the first to develop a general and rapid method for measuring key parameters that control semi-volatile organic emissions, which is urgently needed for rapid screening of products for semi-volatile organic additives that are most harmful to children's health. The PI will also accurately measure semi-volatile organic gas/particle partitioning using an innovative direct approach. This research will, for the first time, connect the mechanistic understanding of emissions to the previously-overlooked strong sorption by airborne particles, bedding materials, and skin, and to the subsequent impacts on inhalation and dermal exposures. It will significantly advance the ability to predict emission, fate and transport, and exposures for a range of chemicals in sleep microenvironments and other similar microenvironments (e.g., infants' incubators), which have not been extensively researched with respect to exposure to toxic chemicals. The specific research objectives are to: 1) develop a novel, rapid method to characterize the emissions of organophosphates and phthalates from crib mattresses; 2) determine the sorptive interactions of the target semi-volatile organic compounds with particles and surfaces (e.g., bedding and clothing) through systematic laboratory studies; 3) develop an innovative combined emission, transport, and exposure model to predict the spatial and temporal distributions of pollutants in the vicinity of sleeping infants and subsequent exposures; and 4) conduct a series of controlled tests in a room-sized chamber with a breathing, thermal manikin of an infant to validate the model and to investigate the influences of various environmental factors on infants' exposures. The project will benefit from collaboration with the Children's Environmental Health Institute, with commitment for co-organizing a symposium that will involve the transfer of the project findings to a large base of health researchers and practitioners.</AbstractNarration>

Sixty percent of the covers contained a total plasticizer content of over 9% by weight.  Nine of the 20 covers contained either bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) or diisononyl phthalate (DINP).  In contrast, phthalate alternatives, including diisononyl 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (DINCH) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) isophthalate (iso-DEHP), were the most frequently identified plasticizers in crib mattresses manufactured after the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) went into effect.  Flame retardants, including pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE) congeners and triphenyl phosphate (TPP), and unreacted isocyanates (NCO) were also identified in crib mattresses with polyurethane foam.    Small-scale chamber experiments were conducted to determine the area-specific emission rates (SERs) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a collection of twenty new and used crib mattresses.  All mattress samples were found to emit VOCs and the mean values of total VOC (TVOC) SERs were 56 &mu;g/m2h at 23&deg;C and 139 &mu;g/m2h at 36&deg;C.  TVOC SERs were greater for new mattresses compared to used ones and were influenced by the type of foam material and the presence of mattress cover layer.  A variety of VOCs were identified, with polyurethane foam releasing a greater diversity of VOCs compared to polyester foam.  Large-scale chamber experiments were conducted with an infant thermal manikin.  TVOC concentrations sampled in the breathing zone and interior pore air of the crib mattress foam were found to be greater than the bulk room air by factors in the range of 1.8 to 2.4 and 7.5 to 21, respectively.  The results suggest that crib mattresses are an important source of VOCs and infant exposure to VOCs are possibly elevated in their sleep microenvironments.

Both material-phase concentrations (C0) and the gas-phase concentrations in equilibrium with the material-phase (y0) were measured for SVOCs such as phthalate, phthalate alternatives, and organophosphates.  Independently measured or calculated parameters were used to validate a SVOCs emission model, with excellent agreement between model predictions and the observed chamber concentrations in gas and stainless steel phases.  With the knowledge of y0 and emission mechanisms, infant exposure to phthalates from tested products was assessed with a fate and transport model developed.
