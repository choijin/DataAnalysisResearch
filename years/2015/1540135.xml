<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the 28th Pacific Northwest Numerical Analysis Seminar (PNWNAS), held at Western Washington University, October 17, 2015. As an annual event for the past twenty-seven years, PNWNAS has become one of the primary means for local research groups in numerical computation to engage in scientific exchanges. With invited speakers from industry, government, and academia, PNWNAS 2015 will help keep its participants abreast of recent developments in the field of computational mathematics and numerical analysis, hence fostering research interactions and further promoting mathematical innovation regionally as well as globally. One of the invited lectures will be a designated public presentation accessible to a broader audience on a subject of public interest, such as modeling in the social sciences. This will benefit both the scientific community and the general public in Bellingham. This award will encourage and support the involvement of traditionally underrepresented groups by providing some exclusive financial support for them. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;A broad range of interdisciplinary research topics will be covered, including mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of large-scale complex systems in applied fields, such as biology, chemical engineering, fluid mechanics, medical science, and materials science.  Topics will also include numerical linear algebra, multi-scale modeling and simulation, stochastic processes, inverse problems, and image processing. Poster sessions presented mainly by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will provide early-stage researchers with an opportunity to showcase their academic achievements. The goals of PNWNAS 2015 include: to foster the scientific interaction of computational mathematics groups from academia, industry, and government agencies working in a broad range of science and technology; to promote mathematical innovation regionally as well as globally; to facilitate interactions that potentially lead to regional employment and internship opportunities for postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates; and to attract prospective students into the Pacific Northwest's higher education programs in computational and applied mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

Summary</strong></p> <p>The 28<sup>th</sup> Annual Pacific Northwest Numerical Analysis Seminar (PNWNAS) was held at WWU on October 17, 2015. Around 55 registered scientists and more than 10 on-site participants, from over 14 universities and 4 companies, attended. The program began with a welcome remark by Tjalling Ypma, followed by a series of eight invited presentations, with talk videos available on the conference website. &nbsp;Poster sessions were also held in the middle of both morning and afternoon during coffee breaks. The talks showcased the interaction of computational mathematics with a broad range of science and technology including biological modeling, bio-fluid dynamics of locomotion, stochastic and deterministic climate modeling, scripted geometry processing for manufacturing, as well as simulation of blast-induced blood-brain barrier disruption. All in all, the conference was a great success.</p> <p><strong>1. Background</strong></p> <p>PNWNAS is a recurring conference series (<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/pnwnas/">http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/pnwnas/</a>), annually held in a northwestern state of the United States (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon or Washington) or the neighboring Canadian province, British Columbia. It brings in computational experts and numerical analysts from various scientific and engineering disciplines of academia, government and industry scattered across the Pacific Northwest. PNWNAS has been an annual event since 1987, held on a Saturday each fall.</p> <p>This was the fifth time for the Department of Mathematics at WWU to host PNWNAS, which definitely provided an excellent opportunity for both our faculty and students to further explore practical and timely research topics in numerical analysis and computational mathematics.
