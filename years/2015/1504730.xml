<AbstractNarration>First year students who are not ready for calculus represent a group of college students at high risk of leaving engineering.  These students join an academic institution not only with weak math skills, but they also are less exposed to engineering upon entrance, in comparison with calculus ready students.  This lack of engagement in engineering lead to confusion, frustration, and a loss of interest in engineering.  This project supports an engineering track for those students that are not calculus ready but are interested in engineering.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves the development and implementation of a course to teach engineering concepts to first year engineering students who are not yet ready for calculus, while reinforcing critical thinking skills. The course will assist these students in their preparation for calculus by reinforcing concepts needed to succeed in math.  The long term goal of this project is to decrease attrition and to increase the critical thinking skills of these engineering students.  Another goal of the project is to promote the development of an engineering identity in first time engineering students.  A mixed-methods approach will be used to assess the development of critical thinking skills and an engineering identity in students enrolled in the course.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Critical thinking, defined as self-directed and self-corrected thinking, is considered an essential skill for student success in college. This project involved the development of a course to introduce critical thinking skills to first year non-calculus ready engineering students.  The course introduces students to elements of thought, intellectual standards, intellectual traits, and arguments, among other topics.  A math recitation was incorporated into the course to strengthen students' algebraic knowledge and to assist students in the development of their math thinking skills. The study assessed the effect of the course on students' math grades, cumulative GPA, persistence in engineering, and assessed the effect of the course on students' critical thinking skills. Non-calculus ready first year engineering students enrolled in the course showed increases in critical thinking scores and math proficiency as indicated by their Critical Thinking Assessment Test (CAT) scores, pre-and post- math assessments, and final grade in their math course.  In comparison to students not enrolled in the course, a higher percentage of the students enrolled in the course obtained A in their algebra course, persisted in engineering, and were able to progress to a higher level math course. The results from this study were published in four (4) conference proceedings from the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference.  This research work was also disseminated at the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers annual conference and at several ASEE regional conferences.
