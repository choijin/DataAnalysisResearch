<AbstractNarration>The Computational Cybersecurity in Compromised Environments (C3E) is a community of interest that has annually gathered, since its inception in 2009, to address some of the most arduous challenges of cybersecurity. Through these annual workshops and planning meetings, C3E provides a forum for multi-disciplinary researchers from the top academic, industry, and government to discuss innovative approaches to the cybersecurity challenges facing our Nation.   This year the challenge will be related to cyber deterrence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant will support an estimated ten travelers to the 2015 C3E workshops. The results of these workshops will be widely disseminated in the open literature, including on the CPS-VO web portal. Additionally, this workshop and its challenge problems will create excellent opportunity for students to engage with leaders in the field in the context of unsolved problems.</AbstractNarration>
