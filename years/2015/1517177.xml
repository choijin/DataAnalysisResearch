<AbstractNarration>The coolest stars and brown dwarfs, with mass less than 10% that of the Sun, compose the majority population in the Milky Way Galaxy.  It is not yet clear how these objects were formed. An accurate measurement of the fraction of low-mass stars that are actually systems of two or more stars can constrain or rule out several currently proposed theories. The proposal team has developed a method to identify short-period, low-mass multiple systems. They will determine the low-mass multiple frequency, and for some binary systems they will measure their orbital properties and masses. The program will specifically engage students historically underrepresented in science fields. Analysis tools will be constructed in a manner that facilitates participation by high school and undergraduate research students in stellar research, with a focus on engaging students from historically underrepresented groups in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program's primary goal is to measure the very low mass (M &lt; 0.1 Msun) binary fraction by determining a volume-limited and bias-corrected multiplicity fraction of "spectral blend" binaries, systems identified by their combined-light spectroscopy. It involves four primary investigations: (1) a near-infrared spectral survey of M7-L5 dwarfs within 25 pc of the Sun, (2) analysis of these spectra to identify and characterize blended light pairs; (3) numerical simulations to determine the selection function and its dependence on population age and mass distributions; and (4) multi-component radial and astrometric monitoring observations, with full orbital coverage of five previously identified binaries, to measure orbits, individual component masses and spin-orbit alignment.  The data collected and analysis tools developed in this program willm be made publicly available through the SpeX Prism Library and Virtual Observatory frameworks for scientific investigations by the larger community.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Grant 1517177, &ldquo;A Survey of Nearby Very Low Mass Star-Brown Dwarf Spectral Binaries&rdquo;, aimed to quantify the multiplicity fraction of the lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs through a population of binaries known as &ldquo;spectral binaries&rdquo;. The multiplicity fraction is a key statistic for star and brown dwarf formation theories, which differ in their predictions of the frequency and composition of multiple systems. Spectral binaries are unresolved systems identified by their peculiar infrared spectra, the result of the blending of light of binary components that differ in temperature and atmospheric composition. By using these systems, we are able to avoid selection biases inherent to direct imaging or radial velocity monitoring which may have resulted in an undercounting of binary systems in previous studies. The primary outcomes of this work that address its intellectual merit include the construction of the largest volume-complete (to 25 pc) spectral survey of low-temperature stars and brown dwarfs (spanning spectral types M7-L5). This survey was used to quantify not only the incidence of spectral binaries, but also other rare classes of low-temperature stars such as unusually red/blue L dwarfs, young brown dwarfs with low surface gravities, and metal-poor stars. We also made an improved measurement of the local number density of these low-temperature stars and brown dwarfs, (12.6&plusmn;0.6) x 10<sup>-3</sup> pc<sup>-3</sup>, implying an overall population of roughly 800 M7-L5 dwarfs within 25 pc of the Sun. We identified four (4) previously undiscovered spectral binaries in our search, including one young system that appears to be composed of two planetary-mass objects. To confirm our spectral binary candidates and measure their physical properties, we developed new techniques in determining precision component radial velocities from high-resolution, low signal-to-noise infrared spectra of late-type dwarfs; very high precision astrometry in wide-field imaging; and orbit modeling routines that use mixed measurements (imaging, radial velocity, astrometry). These developments allowed us to measure the orbits and component masses of seven (7) very low mass binary systems: one (1) by radial velocity variability alone, two (2) by astrometric variability alone, and four (4) by mixed measurements. One of these systems is a young (40 Myr) eclipsing brown dwarf binary, only the second such system to be discovered to date and a critical benchmark for structural models of brown dwarfs. Finally, we developed comprehensive population simulations to assess the properties and selection biases for the spectral binary population we investigated. These simulations include the effects of brown dwarf evolution and varying assumptions on the mass, age, and mass ratio distributions of the underlying population. Using these simulations in conjunction with our sample statistics, we found a higher, but statistically equivalent, binary fraction from spectral binaries as compared to that inferred from resolved imaging samples, although the statistics in our sample are small and require an expanded volume to make a critical test. The primary outcomes of this work that addresses its broader impact include the public dissemination of over 1000 near-infrared spectra accumulated in the investigation, as well as associated analysis tools, through the publicly-available <em>splat</em> code (<a href="https://github.com/aburgasser/splat">https://github.com/aburgasser/splat</a>). We have also released the forward modeling code for near-infrared spectra through the publicly-available <em>smart</em> code (<a href="https://github.com/chihchunhsu/smart">https://github.com/chihchunhsu/smart</a>). The research activities of this program were also conducted in part by over two dozen undergraduate researchers, the majority from underserved communities, who also received training in preparation for advanced study and STEM careers.
