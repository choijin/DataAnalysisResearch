<AbstractNarration>One of the most rapid ways climate warming could alter the carbon balance of high northern latitude conifer forests and peatlands is through more intense wildfires. Most of the carbon that can burn occurs in thick soil layers often hundreds to thousands of years old that are a legacy of past wildfires, and combustion of these layers accounts for the largest source of carbon released during fires. In the summer of 2014, wildfires burned 3.4 million hectares of forested lands of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, eight times greater than the average annual area burned, and twice as much area as burned in United States wildfires that year. This project will study the impacts of these fires on the combustion of legacy carbon. Researchers will also join a rapid-response Canadian team to greatly facilitate access via floatplane and helicopter, and to gain access to geospatial data. Results will be shared with land and fire managers in collaboration with the NWT Division of Forestry and the Alaska Fire Science Symposium and through a winter webinar. The project will also provide new international research experience for a PI, postdoctoral researcher and undergraduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop a mechanistic understanding of fire characteristics that control legacy carbon loss in these ecosystems. More intense fires result in deeper burning and ultimately determine whether more intense fires will accelerate climate warming via the carbon cycle, as has been proposed. They also could rapidly shift ecosystems across a threshold from net accumulation of carbon from the atmosphere over multiple fire cycles to net loss. High fire intensity across large and varied landscapes and multiple, spatially independent fire scars will enable a study design with replicate natural fire severity gradients across key landscape positions. A novel application of radiocarbon dating will be combined with widely used and scalable metrics of organic matter combustion to quantify the magnitude of legacy carbon loss on a site-specific basis. Permanent plots will be established for long-term monitoring of permafrost and vegetation, key controls over the carbon cycle in this biome. An early campaign will enable the best estimates of site-specific carbon emissions, legacy losses, initial subsidence of permafrost and ensuing changes in site drainage, and dispersal of semi-serotinous seeds. This research will contribute to emerging ecosystem theory on cross-time scale linkages and interactions and the role these may play in the resilience or vulnerability of ecosystem processes to shifting disturbance regimes.</AbstractNarration>

This is eight times greater than average annual area burned in the NWT, and twice as much area as burned in United States wildfires in 2014. This record wildfire year offered an ideal opportunity to study the impacts of high intensity fire in northern ecosystems.  With funding from the NSF RAPID program, we worked with Canadian collaborators to establish a network of &gt;250 field sites near Yellowknife, Canada, where we measured the amount and age of carbon combusted during the fire and evaluated fire impacts on vegetation, soils and permafrost&mdash;ground that has been frozen for more than a year.  Boreal fires burn deeply into organic soils, releasing carbon and other pollutants to the atmosphere, so one of our primary objectives was to understand the patterns of deep burning across the landscape.  We wanted to know which areas were most vulnerable to deep burning, and which areas were resistant to deep burning.  We also wanted to understand how old the soil carbon was that burned.  If young (&lt;50 year old) soil carbon burned, then it could be replaced as the ecosystem recovers from fire, offering no net contribution to climate warming.  But if old (100 to 1,000 year old) soil carbon burned, it will not be replaced and will contribute strongly to climate warming.  During this project, we developed new regional calibrations for estimating depth of soil burning and amount of carbon and nitrogen emitted during fire.  We collected over 5,000 soil samples and used these to develop models of carbon and nitrogen concentration with depth.  Across our sites, carbon emissions were about 3.9 kg C per unit burned area, an amount almost 50% larger than emissions from the 2004 record fire year in Alaskan boreal forests.  We learned that mid-slope, moist but not wet, areas of the landscape were most vulnerable to deep burning and contributed the most to emissions across the burned landscape.  Dry hilltops burned intensely but didn?t have much soil carbon to burn.  Wetlands, on the other hand, had lots of soil carbon but were too wet to burn deeply.  We have not yet finished our measurements of the age of carbon burned; samples are now at the UC-Irvine accelerator mass spectrometer facility waiting to be run.  We plan to finish this last analysis of age by December 2017.  This project?s Intellectual Merit resides in the development of a new, regional calibration for estimating carbon emissions from boreal forests, in new insights into the vulnerability of boreal ecosystems to deep burning, and in new understanding of old carbon loss and feedbacks to climate warming.
