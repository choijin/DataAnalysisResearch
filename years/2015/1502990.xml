<AbstractNarration>This project's goal is to conduct high-resolution synchronously coupled transient simulations of the last interglacial period (LIG) using a coupled ocean-atmosphere-ice sheet model (Community Earth System Model) in order to provide a consistent physical framework to investigate the mechanisms behind the higher sea level and the potential ~2 degrees Celsius atmospheric warming during the LIG.  With both transient and sensitivity simulations of the LIG, the research team aims to systematically investigate the response of climate and the Greenland ice sheet to variations in Earth's orbital configuration, greenhouse gas concentrations, meridional ocean heat transport associated with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and vegetation feedbacks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By comparing these simulations of the LIG with proxy data from published studies and a new data compilation that captures temporal and spatial temperature variability, the researchers plan to address the following fundamental questions about the LIG: 1) What climate feedbacks are responsible for the up to ~2 degree Celsius reconstructed warming during the LIG with respect to the pre-industrial period; 2) How much did the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) contribute to global sea level rise above present day during the LIG; and 3) How well can the coupled ocean atmosphere-ice sheet model simulate abrupt climate change during major climate transitions, such as the last glacial inception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports an early career scientist, developing high-resolution climate model output that could serve the wider science community, and engagement of the broader civil society in science-based education outreach</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The last interglaciation (LIG, 129 to 116 thousand years ago) was the most recent time in Earth?s history when global mean sea level was 6-9 m higher than it is at present. However, understanding why LIG global mean sea level may have been 6-9 m higher than present has proven particularly challenging, because the CO2 concentration during the LIG was at the similar level as in the pre-industrial time (~280 ppm). In addition, the current state-of-the-art global climate models have not produced a warmer climate during the LIG despite data reconstructions of the LIG suggest that the global mean temperature might be significantly warmer at the LIG due to the Earth?s orbital configuration that led to the much higher summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere.      Because of the reliance of global climate models for the future climate projections, the contribution to the improvement of climate models constitutes an important impact that is relevant for the entire society. For this NSF-supported project, we conducted the first simulation of the global climate evolution surrounding the last interglacial and glacial inception, which provides the physical framework for testing different mechanisms for the higher temperature/sea level during the last interglacial and abrupt climate changes during last glacial inception. Transient simulations of the last interglaciation and the last glacial inception are of particular significance to the climate community because they provide the best opportunity for model-data comparison and their bearing on providing a physical explanation for understanding reconstructed global temperature and sea level changes. Our project produced the following four major findings:     1.         We compiled the first comprehensive and robust reconstructions of regional and global SSTs during the LIG and constrained peak LIG SSTs to be ~0.5&plusmn;0.3&deg;C higher relative to the 1870-1889 mean, or the same within error as the 1995-2014 mean, highlighting the possibility that current warming may have committed the Earth to an equilibrium sea-level rise of 6-9 m.     2.         Our transient simulation of the last interglacial and last glacial inception suggests that both the higher global sea surface temperature and the rapid glacial inception can be attributed to the higher sensitivity of polar temperature response to insolation forcing.      3.         The rapid glacial inception results from the positive feedbacks between the northward oceanic heat transport associated with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the sea-ice expansion in the Labrador Sea associated with the expansion of Northern Hemispheric snow cover due to the Milankovitch solar forcing. The lead-lag analysis shows the expansion of sea ice is faster and leads the AMOC during the rapid glacial inception, suggesting that the solar forcing is the ultimate cause of the rapid last glacial inception.     4.         The subsurface oceanic warming associated with the reduction of AMOC during the penultimate deglaciation played a dominant role in the melting of both the Northern Hemisphere and Western Antarctic Ice Sheets and resulted in the higher-than-present-day global sea level in the last interglacial, highlighting the possibility that current subsurface warming observed around the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet might accelerate the its melting in the coming decades.
