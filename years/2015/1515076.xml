<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this project is to understand how non-coding RNA molecules help the embryos of animals establish an anterior end (or head) and a posterior end (or tail) during development.  Recently, non-coding RNA molecules (called non-coding because they do not code for proteins) have been implicated in this developmental process.  This project aims to discover how a non-coding RNA called 7SK helps control anterior development.  The results will be important for the fundamental understanding of how animals develop, and may find future applications in nanotechnology.  The project will involve the training of junior scientists at the post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long non-coding RNAs have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression, but how they function is still a mystery.  Here, an unusual non-coding RNA polymerase III transcript called 7SK RNA and its key regulator, the Bin3 RNA methyltransferase (called MePCE in mammals), will be studied.  7SK RNA is conserved from yeast to humans and plays critical roles in both transcription and translation.  Bin3 seems to have co-evolved with 7SK RNA and methylates its 5'-y-phosphate.  Bin3 was discovered in Drosophila melanogaster where it is required for proper anterior-posterior embryo development.  The mechanism is not known.  The proposed experiments will: (1) test the model that methylation of 7SK RNA by Bin3 is important for Bicoid-dependent repression of caudal mRNA translation; (2) determine the step in translation at which the Bin3-7SK-RNA complex exerts it regulatory effect; (3) determine whether Bin3 targets other non-coding RNAs for 5'-y-methylation and whether it represses translation of other mRNAs.  The results will help in determining exactly how embryo development is controlled by non-coding RNAs in Drosophila and provide a model for how the Bin3-7SK-RNA complex works in other eukaryotic organisms.  The integrated approach will combine genetics, biochemistry, bioinformatics and computational prediction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Post-transcriptional regulation by the Bin3-7SK RNA complex  Personnel:  SUNY-Upstate Medical University, Professor,  (20% effort on this project).  Directed project.  Mentored all personnel involved in this project (also engaged in teaching and mentoring Ph.D. students in the department).  Presented findings at national and international scientific conferences.  Will be publishing results in peer-reviewed journals in the next year.    SUNY-Upstate Medical University, Postdoctoral Fellow, full time research (100% effort on this project, 5/2016-7/2019).  Carried out all experimental work.  Presented findings at national and international scientific conferences.  Co-mentored undergraduate students.    Syracuse University, Undergraduate Biology Major (Academic year, 2016-2017), employed as a work study student, carrying out general laboratory duties.  Skidmore College, Undergraduate Biology Major (Summer, 2018).  Participated in SUNY-Upstate Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program (SURF).  Conducted recombinant DNA experiments.  Our laboratory studies the molecular mechanisms by which cells divide and multicellular organisms develop from embryos into adults.  In particular, we focus on multiple aspects of gene regulation, that is, how genes are switched on and off in different cell types, and how the genetic program that directs gene regulation drives embryonic development.  For this project, we focused on a gene that encodes an enzyme that chemically modifies RNA in cells.  This enzyme, which we discovered in the genetic model organism, Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) is called Bin3 (for Bicoid-interacting protein #3).  Bin3 has a direct counterpart in humans called MePCE (for methyl-phosphate capping enzyme).  These enzymes put a "methyl" chemical group directly on the end of certain key RNAs, such as 7SK RNA.  This methyl group protects 7SK RNA from degradation, so that it can carry out its normal function, which is to act as a scaffolding molecule to control the ability to switch on/off genes.  Our goal was to understand what Bin3 does in Drosophila development as a model of how it might work in all organisms, including humans.   Toward this end we:  1. Used CRISPR technology to tag the Bin3 gene in flies so that we could track the Bin3 enzyme?s location in cells and to identify what other molecules it interacts with to carry out its normal function.  Using this CRISPR-tagged gene, we identified where Bin3 is located in embryos (somatic cells) and even earlier in ovaries (somatic and germline cells), within females.  Using this CRISPR-tagged gene, we attempted to identify new RNA targets, but were not successful.  However, we confirmed in living organisms that Bin3 interacts with 7SK RNA, something that was previously shown only in laboratory cell culture dishes.    2. Using flies that carried mutations in the Bin3 gene, we examined what the effect the loss of Bin3 had on different stages of the developmental life cycle of the fly.  We found the following:  When Bin3 was mutated, 7SK RNA was degraded in all cells in which Bin3 is normally present (both embryos and ovaries).  This shows that Bin3?s molecular role in living organisms is to stabilize 7SK RNA during development.  Surprisingly, even though Bin3 is present in ovaries, Bin3 mutants have normal looking ovaries, suggesting its absence is tolerated (perhaps there is a redundant function), and its active role is likely later in development.  Bin3 mutants displayed interesting phenotypes (wings held out inappropriately and inability to climb upwards, which flies normally do).  These phenotypes are indicative of neuromuscular defects.  It is interesting to note that, in humans, a mutation in MePCE (the Bin3 equivalent) has been implicated in a neurodevelopmental disorder.  Further study of  Bin3 mutants in flies may allow us to further understand the molecular cause of the human disorder. During the course of analyzing Bin3 mutants we discovered a second uncharacterized mutation, genetically linked to Bin3 (i.e. close by in the chromosome), that causes defects in ovary morphogenesis that appears to be due to inability of cells to migrate.   Note that cell migration is a hallmark of cancer metastasis.  Determining what exact gene causes these defects will be important for understanding pathways that control cell migration.    3.  During the course of this work we created a large collection of genetically engineered flies that will enable future studies aimed at understanding the role of RNA modifying enzymes in specifying cell types that form neural and muscular tissues.    The Broader Impacts of our work include the introduction of two undergraduate students to laboratory-based research, and the extensive training and mentoring of a postdoctoral fellow, who should be now ready to take on the rigors of an academic research faculty position.
