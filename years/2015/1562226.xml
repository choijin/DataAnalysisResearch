<AbstractNarration>Superhard, wear resistant materials are widely used by the automotive, aerospace, oil and gas, and any manufacturing industry that relies on drilling, cutting, and grinding. Yet, the synthesis of most materials employed for these applications, such as polycrystalline diamond, require high temperatures and extreme pressures, which escalates their cost. A class of materials known as transition metal borides are more easily processed making them viable alternatives; however, they contain expensive and exceedingly scarce metals. This award supports the fundamental research necessary to discover new, low-cost synthetic processes for novel superhard, wear resistant materials that incorporate earth-abundant elements. Achieving these research goals will require the integration of materials engineering, chemistry, computational physics, and data mining. This coordinated approach will not only lead to higher performance materials but it also has the potential to transform many manufacturing processes by replacing current systems with sustainable, cost-effective alternatives. Further, this award will be used to teach undergraduate and graduate students how to address materials design problems through a multi-disciplinary, holistic picture that includes both performance and resource considerations. Teaching the next generation of STEM students how fundamental chemical research can lead to applied materials engineering is essential for global competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;Â &lt;br/&gt;The development of earth-abundant, superhard materials will employ informatics and computation to screen ternary intermetallic boride and carbide phase space. In combination, this approach will guide the experimental identification of novel crystal structures with outstanding mechanical properties. The research team will develop energy efficient microwave heating, induction heating, and solution-based synthesis to overcome the conventional high temperatures and pressures required to prepare these materials. Additionally, novel mechanochemical experiments using in-situ nanoindentation coupled with IR spectroscopy, in conjunction with first principles electronic structure theory, will establish the fundamental mechanisms of mechanical deformation. These experiments will serve to validate the computationally screened compounds as well as reveal opportunities to optimize chemical bonding interactions further enhancing the mechanical response. The result will inform the future advancement of engineering materials by producing a methodological framework to understand the mechanics of disparate classes of complex inorganic solids.</AbstractNarration>

Some of the best superhard materials on the market today are things like diamond or cubic boron nitride. The challenge with these materials is their high cost due to extreme synthesis conditions. New, low-cost superhard materials would be an enormous breakthrough for society.</p> <p>In this collaborative NSF project, a team of researchers from the University of Utah and the University of Houston set out to discover new sustainable superhard materials using machine learning as the guiding principle. In this approach, the researchers began by compiling data and training machine learning models on this data. Trained models were able to predict incompressibility and rigidity which stood as proxies for the more difficult to predict material hardness. Because these are machine learning predictions instead of first principles calculations the predictions can be done incredibly quickly. The team was able to make predictions for over 100,000 compounds in ~30 seconds. The team then assessed the predictions and identified compounds of interest which satisfied both performance and sustainability criteria (Figure 1).</p> <p>Materials were then synthesized and confirmed to be pure prior to hardness measurements (Figure 2). The machine learning approach to superhard material discovery was confirmed as both materials were experimentally found to have a hardness exceeding 40GPa at low indentation loads (Figure 3). Since the model had technically predicted incompressibility and rigidity as proxies, the researchers then set out to validate the incompressibility prediction itself through diamond anvil experiments where the samples are analyzed as they are squeezed to extreme pressures inside a diamond anvil. Not only was the incompressibility confirmed, but the researchers also observed that mechanical deformation seemed to occur along certain directions in the crystal. In fact, one of the compounds was shown to be not only superhard, but also bordering on ductile (Figure 4). The coexistence of these two properties was inexplicable.</p> <p>The researchers then turned to first principles calculations in order to simulate deformation of these crystals. Their goal was to understand why certain directions were more prone to deformation than others. They found that the structure was connected by strong two-dimensional nets of boron-boron bonds. Simulations showed that these nets were able to stretch by splitting into pairs of boron-boron bonds which explained the never-before-observed ductility in these compounds (Figure 5). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to the demonstration of a new paradigm for materials discovery, two new superhard materials, and a chemical understanding of the unusual properties, the project also had significant impacts on work force and community development and training. The project trained two graduate students and six undergraduates including 3 underrepresented minorities. Students received unique training in both data science as well as experimental synthesis and materials characterization. The team also held annual workshops for machine learning in materials science that attracted ~130 participants from across industry, academia, and national laboratories for hands-on tutorials for best practices in applying data science to materials research (Figure 6).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Taylor&nbsp;D&nbsp;Sparks</p> </div> <div
