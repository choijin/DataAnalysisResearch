<AbstractNarration>UC Santa Barbara doctoral candidate Jessika Akmenkalns, supervised by Dr. Stuart Tyson Smith, will conduct research on how cross-cultural interactions and colonialism transformed cultural identities in hinterland communities in ancient Nubia (northern Sudan) between 2500 and 1000 BC.  Archaeology provides a unique window through which researchers and the general public alike can come to understand how colonialism and long-term struggles for political and economic power affect the daily lives of individuals and groups, both locally and on a broad regional scale. This research is particularly relevant in today's global political climate, in which ethnic, religious, and national identities bear significant impact on access to land, resources, and opportunities.  This project will contribute to a better understanding of these issues on a broad scale because investigations of colonialism crosscut the social sciences, including anthropology, sociology, history, geography, economics, and political science.  In addition, the project will provide university students with educational opportunities and scientific training, and the field and laboratory experience gained on the project will fulfill students' degree requirements.  The data collected as part of this research will form the basis of Ms. Akmenkalns' doctoral dissertation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous research on cross-cultural interactions has focused on large, urban populations, or it has focused on the strategies of colonizing powers.  While it is certainly important to examine how such interactions impact major centers and powerful political entities, it is also essential to investigate how rural communities experience changing power structures and how they construct their community identities in opposition to those of foreign cultural groups.  The following research questions guide this project:  1) What was the extent of Egyptian presence or influence in rural Nubia before and during Egyptian conquest of the region?  2) What was the importance of local and foreign cultural traditions in expressing cultural identity before and during the Egyptian conquest?  3) What differences, if any, were present in elite vs. non-elite and urban vs. rural expressions of cultural identity in the region?  To answer these questions, this project will employ archaeological excavations at the sites of Hannek and Abu Fatima, which are located in the hinterlands of the ancient kingdom of Kerma in northern Sudan.  Researchers will investigate the remains of houses, public buildings, and tombs to examine ancient diet and health, as well as the production and use of pottery, tools, jewelry, and architecture.  These artifact types are useful in understanding cultural identities because they are integral to daily life and the routine behaviors that structure those identities.  Archaeologists will perform preliminary analysis on artifacts and samples during the excavation season, followed by additional in-depth analyses that will be performed in US laboratories, to include radiocarbon dating, ceramic and stone tool classification, and the analysis of dietary samples such as animal and plant remains.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to investigate the ways that cross-cultural interactions and colonialism transformed cultural identities in rural communities in ancient Nubia (northern Sudan) between 2500 and 1000 BC.  Specifically, our research focuses on interactions between the ancient Egyptian state and the Nubian kingdom of Kerma.  This period in Nubian history is characterized by stages of political unrest in which both states vied for control of the region, with Kerma ruling for approximately 1,000 years before ultimately falling to five centuries of Egyptian colonial rule.  Through the analysis of settlement and cemetery architecture, pottery, chipped stone, food remains, burial style, and personal items at two sites within the Kerma hinterlands, this project has revealed a strong adherence to local Nubian traditions, even in the wake of an Egyptian colonial presence.  In January, February, and March of 2016, the co-PI (under the PI?s supervision) conducted excavations at the ancient Nubian sites of Hannek, a settlement, and Abu Fatima, a cemetery.  Together with a team of local workers, graduate students, Sudanese antiquities inspectors, and other project staff, a series of domestic and tomb structures at the two sites were identified, excavated, documented, and mapped. These efforts resulted in the identification of not only these architectural features, but also a wide range of pottery, tools, food remains, jewelry, clothing, and personal accessories that together speak volumes about life in the Kerma hinterlands.  These artifacts, along with a set of radiocarbon dates, indicate that both sites were in use before, during, and after Egyptian colonial rule in Nubia.  Such depth of time provides a lens through which we can better view how cultural identities can change&mdash;or remain constant&mdash;as a result of trade, exchange, warfare, and other types of interaction.  The results of this research have been presented at public lectures and professional conferences, has formed the basis of the co-PI?s doctoral dissertation, and will eventually be adapted as a series of articles in scholarly journals.  In addition, this project has provided educational opportunities for university students, in both field and laboratory settings.  Investigations at Hannek and Abu Fatima indicate that life (and death) in the Kerma hinterlands was quite different from that of their neighboring urban populations, and even from that of other hinterland groups. At the urban centers of Kerma and Sai, and at the rural site of Gism el-Arba?a, the archaeological evidence shows the predominance of Kerma objects and traditions in the earliest phases of the Kerma period.  With the onset of Egyptian colonialism, however, local culture at these centers was largely eliminated and replaced by Egyptian traditions.  In contrast, at Hannek and Abu Fatima, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the populations of these communities largely maintained their Kerma lifeways, not only throughout the earlier part of the Kerma period, but also at the end of Kerma rule and continuing throughout the Egyptian occupation of Nubia.  However, the persistence of local cultural identity did not involve a total rejection of Egyptian culture.  Not only did those at Hannek and Abu Fatima have access to Egyptian imports, they also chose to incorporate a small set of Egyptian objects into local practices.  This suggests that within these two rural communities, individuals were not obligated to consume Egyptian goods but instead chose to import them.  In doing so, rural Nubians altered their ways of life with respect to both everyday and ritual practices, creating lasting effects on identity.  This is not to suggest that by using a small selection of Egyptian objects these individuals viewed themselves as Egyptian.  However, they may certainly have changed, over time, what it meant to be ?Kerman.?  Regionally, therefore, this project contributes an understanding of the ways cultural identities are created and negotiated in hinterland communities.  To date, most of the research in this region has been conducted primarily at the urban centers of Sai and Kerma, with only a few investigations of smaller settlements in the Kerma domain.  Analysis of the data collected at Hannek and Abu Fatima thus provides a greater understanding of Kerman cultural identity and insight into the possible differences in the expression of cultural identity across socioeconomic groups in colonial contexts.  On a broader scale, our research highlights that both urban and rural dwellers can play significant roles in regional politics and economic networks. The project also demonstrates that no two communities experience or participate in the colonial process in exactly the same way. Rather, individual communities&mdash;and indeed individual persons&mdash;engage with larger sociopolitical processes in unique and often very different ways.  Finally, through its theoretical focus, the project stands to contribute to other related disciplines such as cultural and biological anthropology, sociology, demography, geography, economics, political science, and history.
