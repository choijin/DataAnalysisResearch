<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Vanderwal of the Department of Chemistry at UC Irvine develop innovative designs for the assembly of structurally complex naturally occurring structures. The underlying theme of the work is the strategic use of inexpensive and readily available molecular building blocks to arrive at the complex architectures of the targeted natural products in as few chemical operations as possible. In so doing, existing synthetic methods are pushed to their limits by their use in very challenging contexts, and novel chemical reactivity is uncovered and utilized. The results of these studies positively impact any area of applied science that benefits from chemical synthesis, including pharmaceutical development, materials science, and more. This grant also supports outreach activities to middle school students from underserved communities to engage in scientific experiments on-campus, and simultaneously learn about the college experience.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is the development of several strategies for the rapid buildup of the molecular architectures of four different types of complex natural products. The Himbert intramolecular arene/allene cycloaddition reaction and the resulting strain-driven rearrangement of the cycloadducts, transformations that have both previously been carefully investigated in these laboratories, are being leveraged in a concise synthesis of a small family of alkaloids. A combination of an arene-terminated cation-pi cyclization, a bioinspired A-ring cleavage, and a cycloaddition of a novel cumulene equivalent Diels-Alder dienophile set the stage for a rapid synthesis of a complex diterpenoid. An underutilized heterocycle annulation is leveraged to synthesize a structurally unique antibiotic alkaloid. Finally, either a concise and unusual but potentially biogenetically relevant route or a more conventional approach facilitate the first synthesis in an unusual family of complex alkaloids. The broader impacts of this work include the exceptional research training for undergraduate and graduate students. This grant also supports the UCI-LEAPS program that brings in local middle school students for day-long experiences in university chemistry and physics laboratories.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With the support of this research grant from the NSF, my research group has advanced several projects in the synthesis of complex natural products, heterocyclic chemistry, and interrogation of biosynthesis mechanisms. First, we completed our studies on the conversion of Strychnos-type alkaloids (that include the famous toxin strychnine) into the alsmaphorazine alkaloids by a route that mirrors a new biosynthetic proposal that my group proposed. These results not only allowed us to make an alsmaphorazine alkaloid for the first time, but also shed light on the biosynthetic interconversion of different alkaloid families. Second, we investigated the use of oxetane-based chemical probes to interrogate how polyketide synthase enzymes make carbon-carbon bonds. In the process, we discovered a rearrangement of certain oxetanes (four-membered ring oxygen heterocycles) into furans and pyrroles, a reaction type that is likely to be useful for medicinal chemistry. Further, we generated an oxetane-based surrogate for malonyl-coA, and co-crystallized it with the polyketide synthase enzyme DpsC, from which we learned about the way in which the enzyme binds its substrates for productive reactivity. Third, we completed syntheses of two antimalarial isocyanoterpene natural products: pustulosaisonitrile-1 was made using modern methods for asymmetric catalysis in order to disambiguate a structural puzzle, and diisocyanoadociane was made via classical organic chemistry methods, but in a sequence that was much shorter than previous syntheses by other groups. Fourth, we investigated a cascade approach to the antitumor diterpenoid crotogoudin.

Finally, we investigated the use of a chlorine atom as a single-atom auxiliary to control the outcome of a bioinspired polyene cyclization in the context of the synthesis of the potent protein synthesis inhibitor haterumaimide J.
