<AbstractNarration>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most powerful tools available for biomedical imaging today. This is especially true when paired with contrast enhancement agents. Although current FDA approved contrast enhancement agents are sufficient, they are far from optimal. This project will focus on identifying the key variables contributing to contrast enhancement and exploiting this information to develop highly efficient, completely optimized MRI contrast agents. Optimizing such materials will reduce agent dosage and increase accuracy of MRI scans. This work will be done in collaboration with Dr. Tim St. Pierre, a leading authority in the field of biomagnetics, at the University of Western Australia in Perth Australia. Dr. St. Pierre's lab is one of two places in the world that possess such a diverse set of magnetic instrumentation, this will allow for the full characterization and investigation of the contrast enhancement materials in question. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Investigations  in  contrast  enhancement  physics will be done using an MRI active nanoparticle complex that can be accurately varied in size and composition. This investigation will determine optimal parameters for novel contrast agents effectively lowering dose and toxicity while increasing contrast. Once ideal parameters are attained, core shell particles that combine both longitudinal and transverse relaxation agents (T1 and T2 respectively) will be synthesized in accordance with optimization data. The dual mode agents will allow for the reduction in noise and misinterpretation due to artifacts appearing in weighted scans, as well as reducing the amount of contrast required for a normal procedure. The bimodal nature of the particles will allow the subtraction of such artifacts seen by a single weighted scan using the combined contrast to determine artifact enhancement and eliminate it.  The dual contrast complex will also enhance the understanding of the contrast mechanism, and how changes in local field influence the relaxation times measured in MRI. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This study on the optimization of dual mode MRI contrast agents has yielded a great amount of information both in regards to the behavior of coupled contrast systems as well as the mechanism by which they behave. The goal was to evaluate the influence of coupling a magnetic nanoparticle, in this case magnetite, and a gadolinium (Gd) ion chelate by independently varying one of three variables. These variables include: the magnetic particle core size, the spacer length between the nanoparticle and the Gd, and the magnetic field dependence.&nbsp; Nanoparticle core sizes investigated were 15, 20, 25 and 30nm, the spacer which was composed of a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) brush were 5,000 Mw, 7,500 Mw, and 17,000 Mw, and the fields investigated were 10, 20, 40 and 60 MHz. Each sample was evaluated for its relaxivity by measuring the relaxation times, both longitudinal and transverse, at multiple concentrations to get a relaxivity per concentration value. A few general trends were seen from the data. The most prominent was that as the particle size got smaller and the spacer length grew, there was more effect from the coupled Gd. This is important as it demonstrates the possibility to tune the complexes for maximized output. The working hypothesis as of right now is that the magnetic field from the particle swamps out any contribution from Gd when it is close to the particle. Calculations to find the exact radius that the Gd must be from a particle of a particular size are still being done. This phenomena is important to understand when discussing coupled contrast agents to enhance their relaxivity. This realization provides a path for a much more focused plan for further investigation into coupled agents and will lead to a secondary optimization step. This will include further controlling the size, spacer length and actual Gd loading. Secondly, it was observed that attaching multiple Gd moieties to a single molecule enhanced the relaxivity of that molecule significantly. This was in agreement with literature and has led to the development of a new project investigating the effects of molecular size and Gd loading. This is another important area as higher relaxivity means lower doses of the potentially toxic Gd contrast agent can be used in a clinical setting. To further reduce the concentration of Gd needed for clinical scans, the molecular size of the whole complex is being investigated. The size of the molecule influences its tumbling rate in solution which changes the way it acts within a specific magnetic field. This will be used to optimize the specific agent for a given MRI field and can further reduce the amount of Gd needed to enhance the MRI. Overall this work will greatly benefit the MRI community, in particular the groups investigating novel contrast agents for MRI.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/16/2016<br>      Modified by: Benjamin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Fellows</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
