<AbstractNarration>The capacity for life-long learning is critical for success in engineering practice.  Metacognition, defined as thinking about thinking, is key to the development of life-long learning, yet is rarely directly addressed in engineering education.  This project is designed to (1) understand the metacognitive skills developed during preparation of engineering students in a problem-based learning (PBL) program, and (2) understand if this preparation helps students in transitioning to the workforce. Project investigators are studying students and graduates of the Iron Range Engineering (IRE) program, an innovative PBL program that integrates metacognition instruction with engineering content. The IRE program offers a unique setting for studying developing metacognitive skills in engineering students who, as part of their curriculum, solve ill-structured, real-world problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, project investigators are interviewing students, recent graduates who are working as engineers, and employers of IRE graduates.  In addition, two questionnaires and a think-aloud protocol will be administered to measure students' use of metacognition.  The think-aloud protocol involves recording what students say as they solve an engineering design problem. These instruments will provide the team with rich information about the students' use of metacognition. The model of engineering metacognition developed as part of this project will make a significant contribution to engineering education.  If the explicit metacognitive instruction used by the IRE program provides success in developing metacognitive capacity, and that capacity is applicable in the workplace, these instructional activities could be used as a model for engineering educators to improve the readiness of students to be flexible, independent, and life-long learners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ability to be a life-long learner has never before been as necessary to our population.  Newly hired workers are expected to be productive from the get-go; workers move between jobs and institutions, frequently requiring that they can learn the new job responsibilities quickly and effectively; and because of the fast pace of growth in technologies, workers need to be able to learn new tools and processes to take advantage of efficiencies and improvements.      Our research studied two skills necessary for life-long learning -- self-directed learning and metacognition. Self-directed learning is the ability to metacognitively monitor and control one’s cognitions to achieve specific learning goals.  Metacognition is essentially being aware and thinking about how one thinks. When one thinks metacognitively, that person can evaluate what learning strategies worked well and what didn’t; thus, metacognition can support more effective self-directed learning.  We studied these skills in the context of an innovative engineering program in Northern Minnesota, Iron Range Engineering, that has their students learn engineering skills, not in a classroom, but in the context of solving real engineering problems from local industry.  Approximately 20 students from the Iron Range Engineering program participated in beginning and end-of-program interviews during which they were asked about the conceptions of metacognition and self-directed learning and how they would use those skills in engineering problem solving.  Twelve of these students also completed beginning and end-of-program think-aloud engineering problem solving during which they were asked to solve an engineering design problem and vocalize their thought processes during the problem solving. Interviews and problem solving sessions were transcribed and coded for evidence of metacognition and self-directed learning.  Our results showed the following:  Over half of the learners showed more complex understandings of metacognition and self-directed learning in the end-of-program interviews as compared to the beginning of the program.  These results included   o   Describing ways of doing self-directed learning that included evaluating their learning strategies.  o   Application of these skills in their CO-OP and internship positions.  o   Recognition of knowing what they don’t know, but also the ability to address this lack of knowledge.  Results from think-alouds showed   o   Greater sustained use of engineering knowledge when solving the post problem;  o   Increased metacognitive monitoring occurring before and after the use of engineering knowledge on the post problem.  o   Greater elaboration of solutions on the post problem.    o   Increased metacognitive monitoring before and after providing solutions on the post problem.  o   Greater use of metacognitive knowledge of strategies on the post problem.   Our results show evidence that the tactics being used at Iron Range Engineering hold promise and should be considered for inclusion in more traditional engineering programs.  These tactics include:  Include self-directed learning and metacognition as explicit competencies of engineering programs. Provide direct instruction on self-directed learning and metacognitive tactics. Introduce simple tools (e.g., Excel sheets to log self-directed learning activities and then evaluating these strategies later; tools for time management; external feedback and coaching on learning strategies) to learners. Require students to produce evidence of tracking and evaluation of self-directed learning activities as part of meeting program competencies.    Our research has implications not only for colleges, but any type of learning or training programs &ndash; as all types of workers face the aforementioned challenges of frequently being able to adapt to new jobs, institutions or job requirements in order to be effective and competitive in our global working environments.  Additionally, given the promise of these tactics, these types of low-tech and low-cost strategies can be introduced in K-12 settings.
