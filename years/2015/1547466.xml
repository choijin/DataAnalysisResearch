<AbstractNarration>This project brings together four investigators who identified an opportunity to bridge their disparate fields (gait analysis, body sensor networks, low power RF circuits, and gerontology) in order to address an extremely important health care problem of fall prevention. Their combined expertise addresses the following scientific objectives: (1) explore on-node signal processing and low power RF transceivers to balance energy consumption and mobility analysis fidelity in wireless on-body inertial sensing, (2) identify the minimal set of on-body sensor locations to provide high-quality mobility analysis, (3) determine the appropriate algorithms to identify fall prone individuals in controlled in- and out-of-lab data collections to assess the external influences of context and activities, and (4) validate the TEMPO-based data collection and processing algorithms in a naturalistic HFC living environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project enables a new paradigm in elderly patient care to target fall prevention interventions to high fall risk individuals before fall incidents occur, preserving patient's health and quality of life while reducing health care costs. In addition, the above described fundamental scientific objectives apply in the broader application of energy efficient BSNs in a variety of application domains. The education and outreach plans focus on crossing the disciplinary divide between technology and health care, using hands-on public demonstrations, undergraduate laboratory modules, and multi-disciplinary videoconferencing graduate seminar courses to attract and develop leaders who can address the tremendous challenges that face the health care industry in the coming decades.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ While many interventions have been developed to reduce falls in the elderly population, their cost and invasiveness make it impractical and undesirable to target all members of a high fall risk population. Instead, interventions must be targeted to high fall risk individuals, thus requiring techniques for accurate fall risk assessment. Such assessments are traditionally done by doctors during periodic patient visits, but mobility impairment and its associated increased fall risk can often be subtle and easily missed from visual inspection alone. As a result, doctors are increasingly referring elderly patients to optoelectronic motion capture gait laboratories, which provide high-precision mobility analysis, but this method is cumbersome and impractical for the large (and ever increasing) number of elderly persons. In addition, both of these methods can only be performed periodically, which is insufficient given that the time between the onset of impaired mobility and a fall event can be short. Early detection of impaired mobility and increased fall risk are thus critical to timely interventions prior to falling episodes.  This project addressed the fundamental scientific issues associated with using wearable sensors for non-intrusive, remote mobility analysis and fall risk assessment.  Real-world data was collected among community dwelling older adults to drive the development of body sensor network platforms using inertial measurement units (IMU).  Development of computational methods utilizing nonlinear dynamics to assess mobility/stability decrements utilizing an IMU was completed and validated and, has been converted and deployed to the public as an iPhone application.  This will enable a new paradigm in elderly patient care to target fall prevention interventions to high fall risk individuals before fall incidents occur, preserving patient?s health and quality of life while reducing health care costs.  This research provides a research platform that can be used by other parties for a wide variety of non-invasive motion-capture studies. Also, we have introduced students to the interdisciplinary aspects of this project, explaining the challenges and opportunities associated with portable, non-invasive, high-precision motion capture for fall risk assessment and other healthcare and medical research applications.
