<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) materials that can be thinned down to atomically thin sheets represent the ultimate in miniaturization while displaying unique physical and chemical properties.  Varying how the atoms are arranged will allow further control of the physical and chemical properties, but has been difficult to achieve in a systematic way.  With the recent discovery of a 2D form of silicon dioxide (SiO2), new possibilities for single sheet materials have arisen.  The flexibility of the linkages between the SiO2 building blocks provides a pathway to realize atomic arrangements hypothesized for 2D materials, but thus far not realized in a controlled way.  The ability to substitute a wide range of elements for Si in SiO2 networks further offers the opportunity to control chemical properties and induce new structures.  This project integrates theory and experiment to develop rules for controlling how the SiO2 building blocks organize to form structures.  The theory identifies combinations of dopants and growth conditions most likely to produce unique structures, while the experiments are directed towards realizing the materials and characterizing their local structural and chemical properties.  With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the goals are to understand how the properties of the building blocks along with applied external stresses dictate the atomic arrangement of 2D materials, and thus their functional properties.  Applications enabled by control of two-dimensional silicon dioxide structures include highly efficient, atomically thin membranes for separating molecules based on their size, controlled-thickness insulating layers for assembling electronic and optical devices by stacking different atomic sheets, and model catalysts.  The results will be integrated into course material starting at the high school level where the graphical nature of images of the atomic structures provide an engaging introduction to the differences between crystals and glasses and the interrelationships between processing, structure, and properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The recent discovery of 2D SiO2 bilayers created new possibilities for single sheet van der Waals materials. The open structure and high stability provides opportunities to design the ultimate membrane for molecular separations, while the flexibility of the network links can lead to a rich structural chemistry that may allow structures postulated for other tri-coordinated networks to be realized. First principles theory will be used to identify combinations of strain, dopant, dopant concentration, and coverage that provide a large energetic push away from the hexagonal six-membered ring structures favored for pure, unstrained 2D SiO2. The target structures will be synthesized using molecular beam epitaxy and characterized using scanning probe microscopy (SPM).  Initial experiments will inform the level of theory needed to accurately model the system (e.g., the treatment of bilayer-substrate interactions), thereby providing a feedback mechanism to improve the predictive capabilities of the modeling. Scanning probe methods will be employed that combine tunneling and force measurements to yield the positions of surface Si, O, and dopant atoms and force and tunneling spectra above every atom.  This extensive information together with theory will reveal how strain due to lattice mismatch and doping is relaxed, which in turn influences the chemical interactions of the bilayer with its surroundings.  By combining theory with state-of-the-art SPM this project will yield a fundamental understanding of the roles played by network flexibility, strain, surface and interfacial tensions, and dopant properties in determining the diversity of 2D structures that can be achieved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in two-dimensional (2D) layered materials in which the atomic layers interact with one another and the surrounding environment only through weak, non-chemical forces. The interest stems from both practical and fundamental considerations.  The former centers around the potential ease of creating atomically thin materials and devices, while the latter focuses on how materials change when their thickness is reduced to their ultimate limit.  Despite this interest, the 2D materials that have been studied have been known to display the requisite layered structures for a long time, centuries for the most common material, graphene, atomic sheets of graphite.  This project focused on a new 2D form of silica that is only stable as a single atomic sheet and has the potential to form a plethora of structures; the chemistry of silica and related silicates displays a richness rivaling that of organic chemistry.  The project objectives were: to determine ways to direct the 2D material structure; answer fundamental questions about our ability to control the 2D phases that form; identify other materials that may be uniquely stable as single atomic layers; and uncover pathways to make large amounts of 2D atomic layers inexpensively.  The approach involved a close collaboration between theory which identified viable methods to control the formation and structure of the 2D atomic layers and experiment to implement refine and test these methods.              The specific major activities of the project included: 1) theoretical evaluation of the use of strain, i.e., stretching, and substituting other atoms for silicon to direct the structure; 2) development of thin film solid solution epitaxial alloys that allow the amount of applied strain to be precisely set without altering the chemical interactions between the 2D material and its growth support; 3) identification of a new 2D nickel silicate in a unique structure not seen in bulk materials; 4) experimental determination of how much a growth substrate can stretch a 2D material; 5) theory guided development of a method to select between the formation of competing 2D material phases; 6) theoretical identification of other materials that can form a 2D structure analogous to the one formed by silica that also do not form bulk layered structures; and 7) development of an inexpensive, scalable atomic layer deposition (ALD) approach for making 2D silica and potentially related materials.              The intellectual merit of the research was far reaching.  This was most apparent in the general trends revealed by the work that transcends the specific materials classes.  For example, although intuitively one would expect it to be easier to stretch a material that strongly chemically interacts with its growth substrate than a 2D layer that does not, the results revealed that it was not the overall strength of the substrate-2D layer interaction that was important in determining the maximum strain, but rather the sensitivity of the interaction to how the atoms align at the 2D layer-growth substrate interface.  This led to the unexpected finding that more strain could be applied to a weakly interacting layer than one strongly chemically bound to the growth substrate.  A second example was the identification of a ‘sweet spot’ in the size of the atoms that favors 2D structures analogous to that of 2D silica.  This allows screening for candidate materials based on known properties rather than time- and labor-intensive detailed theoretical calculations.               The broader impact of the project stemmed from both the scientific and technological advances it afforded as well as the education and training opportunities it provided.  An example of the former was the transition of the formation of 2D silica atomic layers from requiring specialized research equipment operation under ultra-high vacuum, to an industry standard ALD method in which the key annealing step in the material’s formation could even be carried out under atmospheric pressure.  Moreover, the finding that the number of ALD cycles required to form the material could be precisely determined from the material’s atomic structure, suggests an approach broadly applicable to synthesizing 2D materials.              The bulk of the work was carried out by a diverse group of a postdoc and graduate and undergraduate students.  The students’ disciplinary background ranged from chemical engineering to materials science to applied physics and to physics and spanned experiment and theory. This multi-disciplinary environment prepared all to work at the cutting edge of materials design where the multi-dimensional nature of the problem inherently requires continual iteration between researchers with different academic expertise. The joint mentorship of the students by PIs expert in both experiment and theory greatly broadened their knowledge and interest in materials chemistry and physics. For the five undergraduates who worked on the project the emphasis was on providing state-of-the-art research experiences for students either from undergraduate-only institutions or from under-represented groups. The experience inspired two of the students to enroll in PhD programs.          Last Modified: 01/21/2020       Submitted by: Eric I Altman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
