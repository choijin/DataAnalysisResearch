<AbstractNarration>In the era of "big data" and "cloud computing", it is critically important that we are able to protect sensitive data, and prevent it from being leaked. The goal of this project is to explore a new kind of attack, called data timing attacks, which circumvents known defenses, and allows adversaries to exfiltrate private information from web browsers and privacy preserving databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates not only how prevalent data timing attacks are, but also how to prevent them. By developing techniques for understanding and mitigating data timing attacks, this project will provide better guarantees about the security of widely used software like web browsers, web servers, and databases, yielding safer and more secure systems for end-users. Finally, the project will elucidate what best programming practices should be taught to the next generation of programmers, so they can develop safe and secure software.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project aimed to investigate and devise mitigations for a new class of security vulnerabilities that arise due to the difference in execution time of various primitive operations on modern architectures.    The project had several significant outcomes, both in the discovery of new classes of attacks (IEEE Security and Privacy 2015, USENIX Security 2017) and inventing principled defenses to mitigate them, via compiler code transformations (CCS 2018), formal verification of hardware (USENIX Security 2019), or programming language support for writing constant time code (PLDI 2019).    The goals took on an extra urgency with the discovery of various speculation-related attacks like Spectre and Meltdown. In response to these, we helped develop new formal foundations preventing timing channels in the presence of speculation (PLDI 2020), and compiler analyses to eliminate speculation based leaks (POPL 2021). The project has already had significant real world impact, affecting the design of programming languages, modern web browsers, and hardware. Many of the timing-related vulnerabilities were reported to web browser developers; Mozilla deemed CVE-2017-5407, a "high" impact security vulnerability, and patched it in Firefox 52. Several groups have started follow up work investigating data timing channels, and we are looking to integrate our results into mainstream browsers like Firefox, which will let millions of users benefit from increased privacy. The new "FuzzyFox" JavaScript timers invented in this project have influenced work by several groups leading to follow on designs, via run-time or architectural mechanisms. The libfixedtimefixedpoint library developed as part of this project and released as open source has been used in research systems from other groups as a building block providing side-channel resistant arithmetic, including DOVE (NDSS 2019) and Hermetic (UPenn tech report 2019). Finally, hardware designers, e.g. at ARM are designing modern processors to so that they are capable of   "performing both normal and subnormal arithmetic at full speed, avoiding subnormal penalties ... and the associated security vulnerabilities [4][5]"   - David Lutz, ARM's chief floating point architect in  "ARM Floating Point 2019: Latency, Area, Power" IEEE ARITH 2019 The IODINE and XENON tools developed in this project will help ensure that these designs indeed plug data and other timing channels.
