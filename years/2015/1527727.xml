<AbstractNarration>Given the need to achieve higher performance without driving up energy consumption, most chip manufacturers have shifted to multicore architectures, especially heterogeneous ones. Among heterogeneous processing elements, graphic processing units (GPUs) have seen wide-spread use. GPUs have the power to enable orders of magnitude faster execution of many applications. Thus, they are becoming increasingly applicable for general-purpose systems. Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to reliably adopt GPUs in many safety-critical systems that require predictable real-time correctness, one of the most important tenets in certification required for such systems. A key example is the advanced automotive system where timeliness of computations is an essential requirement of correctness due to the interaction with the physical world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to ensure predictable real-time correctness in current GPU-enabled systems, through (i) developing new real-time resource allocation methods that can be applied in GPU-enabled systems, where a number of difficult analysis issues due to the problem of co-scheduling CPU and GPU resources and several GPU-specific constraints will be addressed, and (ii) building an open-source ecosystem of predictably managing GPU resources in the operating system. These efforts will pave the way to utilizing GPUs in a predictable manner and benefit many applications and systems in which real-time constraints exist, such as automated automobiles and medical instrumentation. The successful completion of this work will enable powerful GPU computing capability. In safety-critical systems  which usually require certification, this work will help enable such systems equipped with GPUs to be certifiable.</AbstractNarration>

This methodology is powerful in making judicious coordinated decisions on allocating CPU and GPU resources to satisfy applications' timing requirements. A set of new runtime scheduling and timing validation techniques, for maximizing the utilization of CPUs and GPUs in supporting workloads with self-suspension behaviors with analytically guaranteed real-time correctness. A stochastic scheduling framework for GPU-enabled systems with probabilistic timing guarantees, which can handle the variable execution time experienced by workloads that are executed on GPU. An analysis technique that handles the parallelism characteristic seen in many GPU-accelerated workloads. A system-level solution that enable efficient preemptive execution on GPU. A new technique to support GPU computing result reuse through exploring potential data/computation redundancy, which improves throughput, latency, and energy efficiency of GPGPU computing. A systemic framework for accelerating DNN (deep neural networks) based workloads in autonomous driving systems with guaranteed timing predictability and improved overall concurrency and throughput performance. A timing-predictable energy optimization framework for DNN-driven autonomous driving system, which guarantees timing correctness with significantly improved energy efficiency.  In the end, this project trained and educated 4 graduates and 2 high school students, and produced 2 Ph.D. dissertations (one in Summer 2018 and another in Fall 2018) and 2 Masters Thesis.
