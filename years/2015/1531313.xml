<AbstractNarration>1531313&lt;br/&gt;Parsekian &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding from this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant will enable an early career investigator to acquire a wireline, borehole nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) well logging tool to be used for investigations of subsurface hydrologic properties.  NMR spectroscopy is sensitive to Hydrogen nuclei and has long been used for hydrocarbon exploration.  The proposed NMR instrument is designed to fit into standard groundwater wells and is tuned to pick up the resonant frequencies specific to Hydrogen nuclei.  The borehole NMR instrument would become part of the Facility for Imaging of the Near &amp; Subsurface Environment (FINSE), an established Instrument facility at UW managed by trained staff and would support the field analytical capabilities of the Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics (WyCEHG), a center of excellence in hydro geophysics funded by NSF/EPSCoR.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NMR well logging tool will offer greatly improved spatial ( &lt; 0.5 m) and temporal resolution of subsurface hydrological parameters over conventional methods that typically aggregate subsurface hydrological observations over 10s of meters so the knowledge gained has the potential to be transformative and therefore supports NSF mission of promoting the progress of science..  The investigators intend to deploy the NMR tool for studies in vadose zone hydrology of interest to Critical Zone Observatories supported by NSF Division of Earth Sciences and studies of permafrost in the high Arctic; the instrument will be useful for groundwater resource assessment thus promoting the national welfare.  The instrument will support hands on experiential learning by students using the NMR tool for studies of regional interest thereby fostering their future employability in fields that routinely engage in subsurface hydrologic studies, another aspect of the proposal that is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the national welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
