<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 14-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world's major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in this Collaborative Research Action, the partner agencies have provided support for research projects that utilize existing Arctic observing systems, datasets and models to evaluate key sustainability challenges and opportunities in the Arctic region, to innovate new sustainability science theory and approaches to these challenges and opportunities, and support decision-making towards a sustainable Arctic environment.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and end users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RACArctic (Resilience and adaptive capacity of arctic marine systems under a changing climate) project will bring together a team of natural and social scientists from the US, Japan, and Norway to investigate stressors and futures of fisheries-impacted marine ecosystems in the north.  Through a synthesis of available observations, including information from fisheries managers and subsistence harvesters, the team will assess the effects of physical drivers and human pressures on marine ecosystems and key fish populations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific.  Best practices for fisheries management in these sectors will be developed from the available management frameworks taking into account not only physical-biological relationships but the adaptive capacity of fish stocks, the integrated ecosystem, and the socio-economic needs of fisheries-dependent communities in the Subarctic-Arctic transition zone.  This comparative analysis will connect with a breadth of stakeholders through a series of workshops and provide use-inspired results through collaboration with fisheries management councils.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the RACArctic project were to examine the potential effects of climate change on Arctic marine ecosystems, and to look at ways in which Arctic communities would be able to respond- to have resilience to the expected changes.  The approach was to hold a series of workshops and meetings to both learn what "stake holders" need from scientists, and workshops in which we examined the science to see where science and policy may intersect. We used a comparative approach, with focus on Japanese, US and Norwegian needs and science.  To accomplish these goals, 1) we held international, interdisciplinary workshops with both scientists and community (industry) representatives; 2) we are producing a special volume or section of the ICES Journal of Marine Science to communicate our results to the scientific community; 3) we will produce a brochure or flyer to apprise the public of our findings.  The RACArctic program held three international, inter-disciplinary workshops, one in Japan, one in Alaska, and one in Norway.  The first was held in Japan.  The Japanese hosts conducted a preliminary meeting in which the community members were given the opportunity to discuss what was needed from them.  The larger, international workshop was held a few weeks later and involved talks by industry representatives, government administrators and a cross-section of international scientists.  The workshop was held over two days, the first being devoted to the presentations by the industry representatives, government regulators and scientists, and the second to discussions among the scientists about what had been learned and how the scientists might contribute. Surprisingly and of great benefit, a number of the most engaged industry participants and government regulators also attended the second day of discussions.  The community participants were primarily from two sectors, the wholesale food industry and the commercial shipping industry.  The food industry participants focused on the reliability of the sourcing of seafood products from the eastern Bering Sea and the Aleutian Islands, whereas the representatives of the shipping industries focused on the need for both short term (a few days to weeks) and long term (years to tens of years) data on weather and ice conditions on the potential routes to Europe in the Arctic Ocean. Their needs for short term data focused on directing the navigation of ships, while the long term needs were for developing the infrastructure and resources for supporting trade. The discussion with stakeholders was covered by simultaneous translation, and a transcript of the discussions was made.  The second workshop was held in Juneau, Alaska, and was attended by both members of industry and by the international scientific community.  A day was spent with presentations by both members of the fishing industry and by the scientific community.  Discussion in this workshop focused on the eastern Bering Sea and how its fishery resources might be impacted by climate change.  Also discussed were issues concerning how to manage fisheries in a time of rapid change when many of the management policies and regulations in place tacitly assume a stable ocean ecosystem.  The issue of the potential for conflict between the assumed reality of a stable ecosystem and the emerging reality of climate change was discussed at length.  Although no conclusions were reached, this was an instructive beginning to a conversation that will need to be continued for some time.  Recent, major aberrations in the climate of the eastern Bering Sea, and in particular the loss of sea ice over the past two winters, has emphasized the urgency of resolving these issues.  The third international workshop was held in Tromso, Norway.  The expectation was that, in addition to the interdisciplinary group of scientists attending, there would also be a number of representatives of the offshore oil and gas industry, and of the fishing industry operating in the Barents Sea. At the "last minute", the Norwegian Ministry of the Environment called a meeting on the Barents Sea that our invitees were required to attend. The change happened sufficiently close to the scheduled time of the RACArctcic Workshop, that we were obliged to proceed with no community representatives present. The meeting was, even so, quite useful, as we spent most of the available time discussing what we had learned, and outlining several papers that are to be a special section in the ICES Journal of Marine Science.  The workshops increased communication between scientists and stakeholders in both Japan and the United States. The USA meeting in Juneau, Alaska, involved discussions with a number of individuals connected with fisheries in Alaska and their management in a time of rapid climate change. These discussions were attended by individuals connected to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, the group that manages fisheries in Federal waters off Alaska, and the North Pacific Research Board, which funds many applied, fisheries related, projects in Alaska.
