<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image acquisition.  SEM is critical in nearly all fields that require characterization of solid materials, in particular, semiconductor and electronics manufacturing, nanotechnology and life sciences.  Resolution, and reducing beam size, has almost always been the driving factor in SEM development, but recently, the limits of beam size are making further progress increasingly expensive.  The approach being developed in this project has the potential to enhance resolution, and/or increase throughput, without expensive hardware modifications would be valuable in a variety of fields and application and make electron microscopy more affordable and accessible for a wider range of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop an image reconstruction product that will either improve the resolution of an image taken by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) or enable faster, high resolution image acquisition.  The innovation builds on developments in other fields such as medical imaging, surveillance and astronomy to perform software-based image restoration (deconvolution) in the presence of noise.  Critical to this effort is the development of an algorithm to determine the spatial distribution of the electrons in the probe striking a sample (the point spread function).  The objectives of this project are to develop suitable references, explore the boundaries of this approach on low-end SEMs and evaluate the value proposition of the approach for high-end SEMs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to conduct research leading to the development of a product that would improve the resolution and quality of  scanning electron microscope (SEM) images.  Prior to the SBIR support our company, Nanojehm Inc., successfully demonstrated that the methods we used could result in significant image improvements for thermionic source SEM images, but the process was complex, slow, and could lead to some  image artifacts.  As a result of the research under the grant we developed a prototype of a product that dramatically reduced the speed of the overall process from more than an hour to a few minutes for data collection and a few seconds for data processing as facilitated by a very simple user interface.  This was the result of a combination of new software, a specially designed workstation (The Aura), and an entirely new way of taking a calibration image from our specially designed standard. We also demonstrated that our newest method could work for Schottky and cold field emission in addition to thermionic source SEMs.  Over the course of this research we addressed a number of concerns that included how to compensate for image drift and contamination, how to better understand the role played by image noise, and how to eliminate artifacts such as surface mottling in restored images. Additionally, we were able to develop a very effective procedure for determining the spatial distribution of electrons in a focused beam, known as the point spread function (PSF).  Based on discussions with many potential users it became evident that this capability itself would be of great value to both instrument developers and users as a metric to aid in instrument performance optimization and as a means to monitor sustained performance.  In summary we have found that our method is now useful for a range of samples encountered in many different fields as well as for a variety of different instrument types and operating conditions.  We have also identified many areas for further improvement that will be explored in future research.       Last Modified: 07/01/2016       Submitted by: Yukun Han]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
