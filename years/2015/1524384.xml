<AbstractNarration>This proposed work uses new instrumental techniques to measure daughter radionuclides of short-lived and naturally extinct radioactive isotopes of Samarium (Sm) and Hafnium (Hf) to understand formation of the Earth?s early continental crust. The work will examine 4.4 billion-year-old components contained within 3.8-4 billion-year-old host rocks and zircon minerals of the Acasta Gneiss Complex in the Slave Craton of northern Canada, the oldest known body of rock on Earth. Understanding of the formation of the early Earth has broad implications for the breadth of Earth Sciences, ranging from inferring the origin of life to understanding the formation of economic mineral deposits, especially those originating only in older Earth crust or mantle (such as the diamond deposits in northern Canada). When Earth differentiation led to the formation of continental crust is a fundamental problem in understanding planetary evolution of the highest order. The work would primarily be done by a promising, early-career post-doc under the mentorship of the two PI?s at an institution renowned for both analytical innovation and excellence as well as the training of young geochemists who have typically go on to highly productive careers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Continents are a unique feature on Earth compared to any other terrestrial planet.&nbsp; Their high elevation over the ocean floor is due primarily to their distinctly silica-rich, or granitic, average composition compared to the denser, magnesium-rich basaltic rocks of the oceanic crust.&nbsp; Besides providing a dry surface for land-based life to evolve, the composition of continents and their presence above sea level likely moderates Earth?s climate by providing a draw-down of atmospheric carbon-dioxide concentrations via rock weathering.&nbsp; The mechanism of continent formation in the modern world is well connected with regions where surface tectonic plates are sinking back into Earth?s interior, called subduction zones, a component of the plate tectonic cycle on Earth.&nbsp;
