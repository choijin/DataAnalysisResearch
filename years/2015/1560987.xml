<AbstractNarration>Inpatient surgical care largely relies on teamwork. A single patient will see many doctors and other care providers over the course of pre- and postoperative care. The surgery itself also involves multiple surgeons and other caregivers.  The relationships that develop as physicians work together during the surgical care process create teamwork networks that have important implications for the quality and efficiency of care. This research will observe and interview physicians, nurses, and other caregivers about their work and the treatment decisions that they make around inpatient surgical procedures. This information will be used to systematically examine how collaborative networks evolve and change in hospitals. This research will inform efforts to improve the quality and reduce the costs of surgical care while providing new insights into important social science questions about how these kinds of networks form and grow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last two decades social scientific research on networks has undergone a dramatic transformation as new data and methods have enabled a shift toward dynamic analysis. At the same time, work in the fields of organizational theory, economic, and cultural sociology has emphasized the contingent and situational nature of relationships, structures, and their effects. While networks of various sorts have been shown to influence individual and collective outcomes in a wide range of substantive areas, the linkages between micro network dynamics, macro network structures, and their effects have yet to be fully specified. This research will take important steps toward explaining the formation and effects of a substantively important class of networks by examining the ways in which organizational arrangements, individual choices, and existing relationships shape physicians' treatment decisions and ultimately the health of larger patient populations in individual hospitals and broader healthcare markets. This mechanism-based approach to understanding how physician relationships form, reproduce, and change in particular organizations and treatment situations integrates work on the collective dynamics of large-scale networks with theories that emphasize the organizational and institutional contexts in which relationships emerge, gain meaning, and exert their effects.  The theoretically anchored, observational, and interview-based field work that we propose herein seeks to clarify the complicated processes by which networks evolve while identifying specific mechanisms, scope conditions, and contingencies that span individual preferences, structural pressures, and organizational constraints or opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Surgery is a team sport.  Much research has shown that the way collaboration networks connect surgical teams has important implications for both the cost and quality of health care. When teams of caregivers are less well connected to and experienced with each other, coordinating complicated work can be difficult and the chances of mistakes increase.  But researchers know relatively little about how precisely the choices of caregivers, patients and administrators shape those networks. Without that knowledge it would be very difficult to intervene to shape collaboration patterns in a way that might improve surgical outcomes and lower surgical costs.   This project used over 200 hours of observation and more than 100 interviews with patients and providers to understand how the organization of clinical work shapes collaboration among surgeons, other physicians, nurses, physicians assistants and other healthcare providers.  We focuseed on two types of surgery, prostatectomy (a treament for prostate cancer) and cardiac bypass surgery (typically a response to a heard attack).   While the clinics we study do have a formal process for assigning patients to surgeons, we found that most patient referrals occurred through a more complicated, informal process that relied on doctor?s prior collaborations, their relationships with advanced care providers such as physician?s assistants, and sometimes on patient preferences.  These findings offer new insights about how surgical care networks form, who gets left out and how hospital administrators and policy-makers might go about changing them to increase the quality and decrease the cost of care.
