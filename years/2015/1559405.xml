<AbstractNarration>This project uses a unique approach to measure the effects of changes in real estate values on household expenditures.  For most homeowners, their house is their single largest financial asset.  Economic theory predicts that changes in house values should result in changes in consumption; if the value of your house has increased, you are richer and presumably would consider an increase in spending.  However, identifying the size of this effect is complicated.  Both house values and household consumption are also affected by a number of other factors.  For example, easy credit may increase both housing prices and consumption. The challenge is magnified because we have limited data on consumption at the level of individual households.  This project uses a 'natural experiment' approach.  The economists will look at housing prices in a residential area of Connecticut that was directly affected by an event that was not predicted.  This is an exogenous shock to housing values. Using information on spending by individual households inside and outside of the affected area, the researchers hope to identify the structural component associated with changes in house prices. Better understanding of the relationship between house prices and household expenditures will allow investors and policymakers to better judge the future effects of housing market fluctuations on the macroeconomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is identification of the structural relationship between house price and household expenditures by combining a natural experiment with credit bureau data on credit card purchases. The data includes information on housing prices and housing characteristics on a parcel-by-parcel basis for all parcels located in four Connecticut towns: Newton, Monroe, Oxford, and Southbury.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Like in many other counties, housing is a large component of total household net worth in the United States. Although house prices and consumer expenditure are correlated, identifying the structural component in this relationship, from housing wealth to household expenditures, is difficult since both variables are driven by many of the same common factors, such as credit market conditions, income, policy shocks, or even in changes in preferences. Resolving this identification problem continues to remain a major challenge for studies that use both aggregate as well as individual-level data. The challenge is magnified by the lack of reliable data on consumption at an individual level. In this project we offer a framework that meets the identification and data challenges head on. Central to the research design is the information that the Sandy Hook school attendance Zone (in Connecticut) experienced a large and exogenous shock to house prices following the shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary school on December 14, 2012. The research combines this exogenous shock with information on spending by individual households in and outside the catchment area to identify the housing wealth &ndash; household expenditure relationship. The results, suggest that the marginal propensity to consume from a $1 change in housing wealth is about 10-14 cents. However, household demographics are key to understanding the magnitude of these effects. We find no evidence that changes in housing wealth affect behavior of young (18-30) or old (65+) consumers; instead, the effect is driven entirely by the 30-65 cohort. Consistent with these results, we find that lower income households, who are more-often renters, are short in housing, while higher-income households react positively to changes in housing wealth.
