<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program is supporting Professor Luping Yu at the University of Chicago to develop a series of new compounds with laddered structures connected via fused rings.  These semiconductor compounds may find uses in electronic and optic applications ranging from solar cells to molecular electronic components. The research involves development of new synthetic approaches, structural characterization, and physical measurements and enriches our understanding of the chemistry and physics of semiconducting organic materials and of organic/polymer chemistry.  This interdisciplinary project integrates chemistry, material science and computation to generate new research directions and synthetic strategies for a new class of compounds.  Students and postdoctoral associates receive interdisciplinary training and learn the skills necessary to face future scientific challenges.  Underrepresented minority students are recruited and encouraged to pursue scientific careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a series of new ladder conjugated oligomers based on thienobenzothiophene and its analogs.  The synthetic approach is a versatile route to preparing a series of well-defined ladder oligomers which are a new class of semiconducting molecules for various electro-optic applications ranging from photovoltaic solar cells to molecular electronics. Several research efforts are undertaken including: synthesis of new ladder oligomers with different electronic and structural features, structural characterization, syntheses of block copolymers for supramolecular assembly, and exploration of the electro-optic properties of these new systems.  Conjugated ladder oligomers have not been fully investigated due to the lack of a feasible synthetic approach to soluble molecules.  A new class of "perfect" ladder oligomers obtained from this project may be soluble, allowing detailed characterization both in solution and in the solid state.  The knowledge gained from these studies may enrich understanding of structure-property relationships of conjugated systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Final outcomes report:  In the past four years, we have accomplished our proposed golas and beyond.  The following is the summary of our accomplishments.  A series of ladder-type thienoacenes based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (BDT) have been synthesized and characterized.  They exhibit high two photon absorption parameters. They are shown to exhibit one of the highest conductance in single molecular scale, with decay constant as small as 0.047. Synthesized a series of soluble ladder-type molecules with well-defined structures based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b&prime;]dithiophene (BDT) as a donor unit and benzothiadiazole/benzoselenadiazole as acceptors. Investigated the FET properties of these D-A-D ladder oligomers.   Synthesized several ladder-type A-D-A oligomers, consisted of thienoacene derivatives (Dn) as the donor (D) and perylene diimide (PDI) as the acceptor (A).  The molecules exhibit enhanced stability and two photo absorption properties.  These ladder type molecules were investigated as electron acceptors in non-fullerene organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). Succeeded in recruiting minority undergraduate students (3) and female high school students (3), all of them moved on to advanced studies.  The program offered as a platform for training short term international visiting students (5). The project offered excellent opportunities for postdoctoral training (2).  One of them assumed academic position as assistant Professors. Six research Articles and 1 Review articles made possible by this grant. Two theses defended by graduate students working on this grant. This work helped financial support from Samsung Electronic Company.                 Last Modified: 08/13/2019       Submitted by: Luping Yu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
