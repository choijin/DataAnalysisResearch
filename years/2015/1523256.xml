<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1523256&lt;br/&gt;Westerhoff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Conference:  Environmental Nanotechnology: Gordon Research Center and Gordon Research Seminar, June 20-21, 2015, Mount Snow Resort, West Dover, Vermont&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 assessment by the Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology of the National Nanotechnology Initiative determined a critical turning point has been reached in which the industrial and academic communities must transition toward facilitating commercialization. This must be done through partnerships between public and private sectors. The Gordon Research Conference on Environmental Nanotechnology is an ideal venue for this nucleation and building of such partnerships, as participants include researchers and practitioners from academia, government, non-profit, and industrial sectors. The conference brings together academic, government, and industrial scientists from around the world. The goal of this third Gordon Research Conference on Environmental Nanotechnology is to address the safe implementation of nanotechnology in commercial, industrial and environmental applications. This will be the first year that an associated Graduate Research Seminar will be held. The Gordon Research Conference will be June 21 - 26, 2015 and the Gordon Research Seminar will be held immediately before the Conference, June 20 - 21, 2015, they both will take place at the Mount Snow Resort, West Dover, Vermont. The greater scientific community will derive benefit through the collaborations and networks resulting from this conference. In addition, this third meeting will provide support for graduate students and post docs to present their research, to interact with established researchers, faculty, and industrial representatives, and to communicate the importance of their research to a broad audience. The 2015 Environmental Nanotechnology Gordon Research Seminar will focus on cutting edge methods used to synthesize ENMs to promote their positive benefits to society while keeping in mind their safe design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique aspects of the conference lies in the exchange of ideas, analytical methods and experimental approaches that balance the beneficial aspects of nanotechnology against their potential adverse risk to the humans and the environment. In this new area of commercialization of nano-enabled devices and technology, the planned Gordon Research Conference program will frame the discussion around considerations for safe synthesis, manufacturing, and disposal of products. Additionally, topics will explore the newest developments in the use of engineered nanomaterials in the fields of water, air, and soil treatment, considering the potential for intentional or unintentional exposure by humans and the ecosystem and pose.</AbstractNarration>
