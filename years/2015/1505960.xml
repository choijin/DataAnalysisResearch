<AbstractNarration>When a massive star reaches the end of its life, the core of the star collapses, producing a supernova.  While visually spectacular, less than 1% of the energy in the supernova is released as visible light or as kinetic energy in the surrounding environment.  Most of the energy from the supernova is released in neutrinos, which are small particles that only interact weakly with matter.  The neutrino emission from a supernova precedes the emission of visible light by a few minutes up to many hours.  Detecting the first neutrinos from a supernova therefore provides an early alert to trigger further observations.  The SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS) is a network of neutrino detectors around the world designed to provide automated early alerts for supernovae in our galaxy.  While rare, a galactic supernova would provide a unique opportunity to study the physics of core-collapse supernova, as well as the properties of neutrinos.  The early alerts from SNEWS will enable observations of the earliest phases of the supernova for physicists and astronomers around the world.  The SNEWS project works to engage amateur astronomers, who may play an important role in optical observations of supernova, and to involve them in the science of supernova.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SNEWS involves neutrino detectors around the world: Super-K, Large Volume Detector, IceCube, Borexino, KAMLand, and Daya Bay.  If any of the participating experiments finds a burst of events, it sends a datagram to the central SNEWS computer located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, with a backup located in Bologna.  If a coincidence is found within 10 seconds, a supernova alert will be sent out.  SNEWS has been operational since 1998, and has been running in a fully-automated mode since 2005 with near-100% up-time. This award will provide funds to maintain the SNEWS system, support undergraduate researchers participating in the project, and expand connections to the astronomical community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Collaborative Research award to PIs Scholberg (Duke) and Habig (Duluth) supported the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS)  system.  This coincidence network allows neutrino experiments around  the world to rapidly send a "hey, there might have been a supernova just  now" alert to SNEWS, without having to have a human double-check it.   This is because SNEWS will send an alert out to the world only if two  different experiments both see what looks like a burst of neutrinos that  might have originated in a core-collapse supernova in our galaxy,  allowing the alert to get out quickly in an automated fashion.  Such supernova in our galaxy are rare: estimates are several per century.   Neutrinos escape the star promptly when the iron core of a supergiant   star burns out and collapses to a neutron star, but the resulting   shockwave can take hours to reach the surface of the star and start the   electromagnetic fireworks.  An early alert of such a supernova will be  important for getting the best information from such a rate event: with  modern multi-bandwidth telescopes to see through any intervening dust,  it will be a ringside seat to one of the most energetic events in all of  astrophysics.   There are seven experiments around the world which contribute to the SNEWS coincidence alarm: Super-K (Japan), LVD (Italy), Ice Cube (South Pole),  KamLAND (Japan),  Borexino (Italy) Daya Bay (China), and HALO (Canada).  Three more (NOvA, XENON1t, and KM3Net) are preparing to  contribute, and NOvA, XENON1t, and the LIGO gravitational wave  experiment will use a SNEWS alert to ensure they save data from a  potential supernova.  The GCN network will distribute any alarm to the  astronomical community for rapid followups, and anyone can subscribe to a  mailing list to get an email when SNEWS when a galactic supernova  eventually happens: if you're interested, go to http://snews.bnl.gov and add yourself to the list.  SNEWS  has been running for almost two decades.  In that time, the  astronomical community has really embraced Multi-Messanger Astronomy,  and rapid followups on transients has solved a number of long-standing  astrophysical questions.  With that in mind, SNEWS is currently working  on a "SNEWS2.0"  upgrade which will use more information from the participating  experiments to improve sensitivity and provide more testing  opportunities.
