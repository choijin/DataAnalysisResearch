<AbstractNarration>This project plans to hold a workshop between U.S. and Japan researchers on the subject of windstorm hazard reduction on critical infrastructure.  The objectives of the workshop are to evaluate accomplishments of the past in the two countries and to move forward in identifying collaborative projects in changing environment. During the past five years there have been progress in wind hazard research in both countries, namely computational wind engineering in Japan and experimental research facilities in the U.S. This workshop is critical because researchers of the two countries can learn from the complementary research subject areas of the wind hazard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held at Yokohama National University in Japan during the month of May 2016. Twelve to fifteen persons will be invited from the U.S. researchers and equal number from Japan to participate in the workshop. The proceedings of the workshop will be open to other interested individuals. The program of three days will include brief presentations, panel discussions, and one-half day visit to a site of implementation of wind engineering. Engineering and scientific practices can be improved through international exchanges of technical data/information, researchers and research equipment.</AbstractNarration>
