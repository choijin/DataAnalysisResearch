<AbstractNarration>With this award supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF), and EPSCoR programs, Professor Brenton DeBoef from University of Rhode Island and colleagues William Euler, Jimmie Oxley, Brett Lucht and Geoffrey Bothun will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. This spectrometer will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate and graduate students. Additional broader impacts of the proposed instrument will be realized by the hands-on training of advanced chemistry students in the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation, the continued growth of chemistry-related research and education at URI, and the outreach between URI Chemistry and its community, including the hosting of an annual, state-wide High School Chemistry contest, and an annual Chemistry Camp for junior high girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) understanding regioselective oxidative cross-coupling via C?H activation; (b) studying cryptophane-derived molecular probes for hyperpolarized Xenon-129 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (c) discovering new and sensitive methods for the detection of explosives using fluorescence spectroscopy; (d) developing a better understanding of reactions in lithium batteries; (e) investigating organocatalytic ring-opening polymerization (ROP) processes; (f) studying Clostridium pasteurianum adaptation during crude glycerol fermentation; (g) investigating interactions between engineered nanoparticles and biological membranes; and (h) synthesizing organic macrocycles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funds from this award were used in December of 2016 to purchase a Bruker 400 MHz NMR instrument, and it was installed in the new Beaupre Center for Chemistry and Forensic Chemistry at the University of Rhode Island (URI).  Approximately 100 faculty members, postdocs, and both graduate and undergraduate students have used the instrument.  The instrument is used daily by numerous researchers, and time on the instrument is managed by an online system.    The spectrometer that was funded by this MRI award is instrumental in the accomplishment of numerous projects at URI that have high intellectual merit (e.g. the development of new lithium ion battery electrolytes, the analysis of energetic materials, the synthesis of new chemical probes, and the development of novel polymeric materials.)  The broader impact of this award is its direct use in the training of over one hundred undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in the department of chemistry.  Additionally, the acquisition of this instrument indirectly has benefitted over one thousand undergraduates at URI by freeing up the other instruments at URI so they can be dedicated for use in the teaching laboratory courses.  In summary, the acquisition of this instrument has catalyzed the research and educational environments in the Department of Chemistry at URI.
