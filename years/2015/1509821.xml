<AbstractNarration>This NSF RAPID project will contribute to the development of new biomanufacturing processes for proteins used in the treatment of Ebola that will dramatically increase the production capacity during the current crisis.  Currently, antibodies against Ebola (the ZMapp antibodies) are produced in a relative of the tobacco plant.  Antibody production in the whole plant is relatively slow. In the proposed work, investigators will move production from the whole plant into plant cells that can then be grown in large fermenters, much like other biopharmaceutical products.  By optimizing the manufacturing conditions, the investigators believe that they can obtain a 100 fold increase in productivity for the same mass of plant material.  The work will contribute to the Nation's ability to respond to other global health crises in the future by creating new biomanufacturing platforms and the capacity to rapidly increase production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:  This NSF Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will support the development of a new biomanufacturing process for the mixture of three monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp) that has been used to successfully treat patients infected with the Ebola virus.  Currently, ZMapp is produced in Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana) in whole plants using vacuum agroinfiltration.  This mode of production is dependent upon transient agroinfiltration of indoor or greenhouse grown plants, and is severely limited in production capacity relative to traditional stainless steel fermenter types of biomanufacturing processes.  However, production of the ZMapp antibodies in more traditional hosts such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) had led to less effective monoclonal antibodies (lower survival rates and higher doses needed in animal studies) compared to the N. benthamiana produced antibodies.  The researchers in this project will develop methods for large-scale suspension culture production of ZMapp antibodies from N. benthamiana cells.  These methods will employ novel techniques for culturing agroinfiltrated plant cells in batch and semi-continuous modes. The work performed will enable the rapid production of the antibodies in the same types of large-scale facilities available for other biotherapeutics, while retaining the desirable antibody properties associated with proteins produced from N. benthamiana.  The project is appropriate for the RAPID mechanism based on the urgency of need to develop scalable biomanufacturing methods to produce Ebola therapeutics that are already known to be effective.  The project will contribute to our understanding and ability to design new biomanufacturing platforms that use plant cells, and enable the advance of synthetic biology in plant cells.  Beyond the Ebola crisis, this work should help develop capacity for rapid biomanufacturing in response to future threats to global health.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ZMapp, a mixture of three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) produced transiently in Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana, a relative of tobacco) whole plants using vacuum agroinfiltration, has shown promise as a post-exposure Ebola therapy in animal studies as well as in humans.  However, current biomanufacturing infrastructure for ZMapp production using transient agroinfiltration of indoor or greenhouse-grown plants is limited while traditional biomanufacturing capacity using mammalian cell cultures in stainless steel bioreactors is much larger.  In this project, our goal was to develop an analogous transient process to produce ZMapp mAbs using N. benthamiana plant cell suspension cultures, rather than vacuum agroinfiltration of whole plants, to enable the use of bioreactor-based cGMP biomanufacturing capacity while maintaining production speed, product efficacy and minimizing the dosage required.  In this project we designed genes for the heavy chain and light chain of all 3 ZMapp monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), codon optimized them for expression in N. benthamiana, had them synthesized and cloned into the plant viral expression vector.  We also determined media composition for callus generation and maintenance and suspension cultures of mutant &Delta;XTFT N. benthamiana and characterized the growth kinetics for plant cell suspension cultures derived from this callus.  In addition, a highly expressing and easily detected/purified model protein (CMG2-Fc) was used in the development of co-cultivation conditions for transient expression of recombinant proteins in the (?FTXT) N. benthamiana plant cell suspension cultures.  Downstream processing was established using the C2G4-UCD mAb and we verified that the purified monoclonal antibody was intact and fully assembled.  A general mathematical model was developed to model the 3 phase (plant cell growth, co-cultivation with recombinant agrobacteria and mAb production) batch production of mAbs using transient agroinfiltration of plant cell suspension cultures and identify key bioprocess parameters for optimization of productivity.  Finally, we developed bioprocessing methods (agrobacteria to biomass loading, co-cultivation conditions, and timing of addition of the recombinant agrobacteria to the plant cell culture, etc.) for transient production of the CMG2-Fc protein in N. benthamiana plant cell suspension cultures which can be adapted for the ZMAPP mAbs.   In this work we developed a novel transgenic host plant cell line (?FTXT N. benthamiana) that lacks the plant-specific xylose and fucose glycans, as well as culture conditions for initiation, maintenance and suspension culture of this line.  This is a significant contribution to the plant cell culture field within bioprocess engineering since this cell line may be useful for production of many recombinant proteins, particularly glycoproteins for human therapeutic applications.  We have also demonstrated proof of concept for transient agroinfiltration processes that utilize plant cell suspension cultures.  This will impact the bioprocess engineering field by providing a new production platform for recombinant protein production that could lower cost and allow more rapid production in response to global health crisis.  Development of transient co-cultivation processes will also open up new opportunities for synthetic biology in plants since different recombinant agrobacteria can be rapidly generated, mixed and co-cultivated with plant cells to transiently implement novel pathways in plant cells.
