<AbstractNarration>The 73rd Device Research Conference (DRC) has a University setting and will take place at the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio from June 21 to 24, 2015.  Topics to be addressed include biological devices, emerging Electronic device materials (graphene, MoS2), devices for energy scavenging power, memory, nanoscale applications, including Terahertz and spin-based approaches.  The Conference seeks financial support to support student participation.  It has a strong tradition of student involvement, with strong student attendance to its short courses, poster session and oral presentations. The DRC also has a tradition of offering discounted student registration fees, not only for general attendance but also for its short courses, in order to encourage student participation and attendance from additional students who are not presenting an abstract. Support will allow offering 50% discount for student registration to the general conference and the day-long short course "Devices Beyond CMOS",held just prior to the beginning of the conference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 73rd Device Research Conference was held on the campus of the Ohio State University form June 21-24, 2015.  The technical program of the conference consisted of 15 invited talks and 110 contributed presentations.  The important topics that comprised the program included  Power and wide bandgap; Spin, Magneto, Ferro devics; Emerging wide-bandgap devices; and Optoelectronics.  The DRC has a strong tradition of student involvement, with strong student attendance to its short courses, poster sessions, and oral presentations.  It also has a strong tradition of attendance by graduate students, and the DRC committee recognized this by offering student travel support and Best Student Paper Awards.  The technical program provided student participation with the oportunity to gain exposure to new materials and devices, their basic physics, and their engineering applications.  As an addional benefit, the DRC is coordinated with the Electronic Materials Conference, held the second half of the week of DRC.  This recognizes the strong interaction between device and electronic materials research and provides for fruitful exchange of information between attendees of both conferences.   The conference proceedings are available online through the IEEEXplore which makes them accessible world-wide.  The DRC committee is grateful for the funding provided by the National Science Foundation which supported student travel.       Last Modified: 01/30/2016       Submitted by: J.
