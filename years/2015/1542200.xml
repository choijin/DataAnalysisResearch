<AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial support for a conference on "Mathematics and Mechanics in the 22nd Century: Seven Decades and Counting..." to be held October 23-25, 2015, in Eugene, Oregon. The interaction between mathematics and mechanics, with ensuing applications to materials science and biology, will be the central theme of the conference. The grant will support travel expenses of young scientists to participate in the conference and present a poster in the blitz and exhibit sessions. The late 1940s saw the beginning of new trends in the development of a continuum theory of complex materials and the foundation of theories that bridge continuum mechanics and molecular and atomic structure. These new areas of inquiry were catalytic to the development of new mathematical and mechanics theories at the basis of design of new materials and devices, with applications from medicine to advanced manufacturing. The conference has two main goals. First, it will explore recent developments and new trends and will identify prospects for future research on nonlinear materials, devices, biological modeling, and related mathematical and computational ideas and tools. The interdisciplinary school of scientists at the forefront of such developments during the last seven decades has mentored and produced new generations of outstanding scientists, which include a large number of women, who have themselves reached leadership roles in the field. Thus, another main goal of the conference is to discuss mentoring strategies for future generations to ensure the continued scientific and human development success and to reach out to members of underrepresented groups.  The participants will explore tools to overcome the challenges of an incipient career in interdisciplinary research and identify new educational demands.  Another organizational task will be identifying an academically diverse pool of junior researchers across the USA and oversees, with a very strong presence of women and members of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonlinear elasticity emerged in the mathematical community as a result of the works by Ericksen and Rivlin, from the late 1940s to 1960s. This initiated a golden period of research in the calculus of variations and partial differential equations, from the points of view of both analysis and geometry. These developments also lead to outstanding success in the field of complex materials, such as the theories of phase transformations in crystals, shape memory alloys, ferroelectric and magnetic materials, composites, and liquid crystals. While the selection of conference speakers is made in connection with these themes of research, the emphasis will be placed on new and prospective mathematical and materials developments and applications. These will include topics on materials research leading to new sources of clean energy, as well as new mathematical tools to understand and compute defects in liquid crystals and ensuing applications to electrolytic transport, and mechanical studies of viruses towards research on antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The conference also envisions a scientific panel on strategies for new materials development, accompanying mathematical tools, and interdisciplinary and educational challenges.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of the NSF grant was to provide travel support to approximately 30 junior scientists to participate in the workshop on Mathematics and Mechanics in the 22nd Century: Seven Decades and Counting&hellip; The workshop  celebrated seven decades of accomplishments in  interacting fields of  Mathematics and Mechanics, highlighting applications to Materials Sciences and Biology.  The workshop took place at the Valley River Inn, Hotel and Conference Center,  Eugene, Oregon, on the dates of October 23-25, 2015.  It gathered four academic generations of researchers representing a wide variety of fields in the materials sciences, mechanics, engineering and mathematics, working in academic institutions, industry and national laboratories.  The workshop was attended by approximately seventy five scientists with a large participation, approximately forty two,  from those in the junior stages of their careers:  graduates students, postdoctoral fellows and assistant professors. The outcomes successfully met the intended goals from multiple directions.  The intellectual merits were realized by the presentation and discussion of a broad  selection of state-of-the-art themes in mathematics, mechanics and, their materials and biological applications, by fifteen world leading experts in the field. These including representatives from world renowned institutions, such as the University of Oxford,  the California Institute of Technology and  the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.  Applications to renewable energy, microfluidic devices and mathematical tools to understand living systems were part of the topics presented.  The broader impacts were also met from several points of view.    Although  the NSF funding was planned to support the travel expenses of about  thirty young researchers to attend the meeting, in fact, forty two  were fully supported. This was achieved by combining the NSF funding  with  funds from several academic institutions and organizations.  Also,  very motivated graduate students agreed in sharing living quarters  to help defray costs.    The  intended networking between young scientist participants and senior  ones was achieved by vivid and extended discussions that followed  the forty two blitz presentations, and a poster session that was the  center stage of the meeting.    The  workshop had a participation of  women and minorities  above  30%   of the total attendance.    Other  planned activities resulted from that workshop, showing the   positive cultural impact of the workshop in the community.    An  article by M.Carme Calderer and Richard James published in the SIAM  News in April 1, 2016, highlighted  current and future perspectives  of the themes of mathematics and mechanics, and their potential  impact in new energy materials.    The  need to explore the design and modeling of devices for renewable  energies, supported by the seven decades of research, motivated the  organization of a special, six months program, in energy conversion,  to take place at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications,  during the spring semester of 2018.
