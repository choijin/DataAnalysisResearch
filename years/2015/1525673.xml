<AbstractNarration>In an effort to address the national need to improve student learning in chemistry, this IUSE: EHR project will adapt the Emporium Learning model, which has led to increased retention for students through early mathematics courses and first-year chemistry courses.  This pedagogy replaces the traditional classroom with a learning center featuring interactive software and on-site, personalized assistance from instructors.  The project will expand on a pilot study that resulted in higher grades in the first semester of general chemistry for Emporium students (40% made a grade of A) compared to students in traditional courses (5% made a grade of A) at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NC A&amp;T).  The impact of this curriculum will also be studied at North Carolina Central University, another Historically Black institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After an initial assessment, the PI team will identify core concepts and algorithmic skills in general chemistry that each student must master.  The Emporium students will then be provided with the results of this assessment.  During class time they will use an online system to consider examples and do practice problems in modules covering topics that they have not mastered, with immediate instructor feedback.  This project will investigate whether or not the Emporium model will improve students' deeper learning in gateway chemistry courses.  Student in Emporium courses and in traditional courses will take common exams, including standardized pre-and post-course tests, and provide feedback through surveys.   Formative evaluation will serve to uncover unexpected barriers and identify changes and improvements that should be implemented.  Summative evaluation will provide information about whether the intended outcomes have been achieved and what, if any, unintended outcomes have resulted from the project.  The results of this work, including learning materials will be disseminated through a digital newsletter to other Historically Black institutions and propagated through annual Emporium Learning faculty workshops hosted at NC A&amp;T.  Results will also be presented at national and regional meetings of the American Chemical Society and be submitted to the Journal of Chemical Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  We designed an emporium model for general chemistry with the following activities:      Develop and implement an emporium model for general chemistry at NCAT.  Compare and assess the emporium model for general chemistry with the traditional general chemistry model for improved learning outcomes.   Disseminate and improve the Model through publications, bimonthly group meetings, and a yearly faculty development workshop.            The research question that we sought to answer is can an emporium framework that focuses on algorithmic and conceptual components as well as immediate feedback and just in time teaching improve students’ deeper learning in general chemistry?   The National Center for Academic Transformation the Emporium Model (2013) must employ a combination of and interaction among ten required elements to be successful (NCAT Essential Elements of the Emporium Model). An adapted emporium model should include key core aspects to provide gains in student learning demonstrated in math and reduction in institutional costs.  Redesign the whole course sequence and establish greater course consistency. Require active learning and ensure that students are "doing" [math or chemistry].  Integrate technology using a computer lab or computer classroom using commercial instructional software. Modularize course materials and course structure.  Require mastery learning. Build in ongoing assessment, and prompt (automated) feedback.  Provide one-on-one, on-demand assistance from highly trained personnel.  Ensure sufficient time on task. Monitor student progress and intervene when necessary. Measure learning, completion, and cost.   The Chemistry Emporium model was adapted to be similar to the true emporium with a few changes. Due to scheduling restriction of the emporium laboratory, there was an inability to offer 24/7 access to the emporium.

The hybrid approach required the week to be partially split between time in the emporium and in a more traditional classroom setting.
