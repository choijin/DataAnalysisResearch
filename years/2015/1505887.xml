<AbstractNarration>The study of fundamental symmetries in the field of nuclear physics explores the nature of the matter, energy, and forces that define the universe and that have allowed stars, planets, and life to emerge and flourish.  This award will support the PI and undergraduate students to work on two experiments that will further our understanding of that universe.  The first experiment, called MuSun, addresses one of the most important limitations of calculations related to the proton-proton fusion process that releases most of the energy in stars like the Sun.  It will provide data that will calibrate the least precise parts of these calculations and can also be applied to other important nuclear reactions.  The second, known as the Muon g-2 experiment, tests our Standard Model of particles and their interactions.  While this model has been remarkably successful, it is not complete.  The previous generation of this experiment uncovered a strong hint of a discrepancy between its measurement and the Standard Model's prediction; the new experiment will probe it with enough precision to potentially claim a discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will have opportunities to carry out guided research related to the larger physics goals, to work at major research facilities, and to attend conferences and collaboration meetings.  This grant will provide opportunities to involve and support a talented and diverse group of science students that includes women, members of underrepresented ethnic groups, and first-generation college students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MuSun measures the rate of muon capture in deuterium, a fundamental two-nucleon process that provides a calibration of effective field theories of weak interactions in light nuclei.  The muon capture process studied by the MuSun experiment is analogous to reactions that include proton-proton fusion and the deuteron breakup reactions that were used to detect neutrinos at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory.  The MuSun result will dramatically improve the precision of the low-energy constants describing two-nucleon terms in chiral effective field theories that describe these reactions. The Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab will be the group's primary focus for this grant period. This experiment measures the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon by observing the rate of spin precession of a muon beam as it circulates in a precisely shimmed storage ring magnet. The spin polarization precesses because of coupling to virtual particles, including all of the particles described by the Standard Model and potentially any new, as-yet-undiscovered particles and interactions that are beyond it. The Regis group will be responsible for the implementation, installation, commissioning, and analysis for the fiber harp beam monitors and entrance counters for this experiment.  The measurement clearly has the potential to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model.  When the existing precision of 0.5 parts per million from the Brookhaven National Laboratory experiment is compared with modern Standard Model calculations, there is a discrepancy of more than three standard deviations; the probability of a fluctuation at this level by chance is less than one in a thousand.  As the precision of the experiment reaches its 0.14 part-per-million goal, the discrepancy could exceed the discovery threshold of five standard deviations.  Such a finding could represent the discovery of supersymmetry, new gauge bosons such as dark photons, or other new particles or interactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Muon g-2 Experiment at Fermilab has now been constructed and commissioned, and the scientific collaboration is beginning to analyze a first set of physics data that was collected in spring 2018.  The experiment stores subatomic particles known as muons in a strong magnetic field, which causes them to circulate around, following nearly circular paths.  The data will allow us to determine the rate at which the muons also rotate about their own axes in this magnetic field.  The rotation occurs as a result of their interactions with virtual particles of all kinds, both those that are already known and potentially those that are still unknown.  A previous experiment provided a strong hint that muons probably rotate slightly faster than the current Standard Model of particle physics would predict.  If this indication turns out to be true, it could represent an indirect discovery of an as-yet-unknown particle or physical process, and thereby provide a gateway to a new Standard Model.  The new Muon g-2 experiment has already observed almost twice as many muons as its predecessor, with several years of data collection remaining in the future, and should be able to make a more conclusive statement soon.  With support from this grant, the Regis University group refurbished, tested, and maintained a set of beam monitoring detectors for the Muon g-2 experiment. Known as "fiber harps," they can be inserted into the muon beam to directly measure its profile.   They rely on thin (0.5 mm diameter) scintillating plastic fibers that produce pulses of light as muons pass through.  The fiber harps are able to observe how the motion of the beam evolves over time after it is injected into the muon storage ring magnet.  The beam oscillates back and forth around a central orbit because of the electric fields that are used to confine and focus it.  The fiber harps provided direct measurements of the amplitude and frequency of these oscillations, which need to be understood well in order to minimize the systematic error that they introduce into the extraction of the muon rotation frequency.   The Regis group's work included mechanical repairs as well as replacement of the optical fibers inside the detectors.  It also included the development and implementation of new electronic systems to record the light signals and to control the motion of the detectors in and out of the beam.  The Regis group tested a fiber harp at the End Station Test Beam facility at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in preparation for the final installation at Fermilab.  In addition, the Regis group has led an effort to characterize the quality of each data file that is collected in the experiment.  Because the conditions of the data collection were not always perfectly stable, it was necessary to develop and apply methods to choose useful subsets of the data that were taken under consistent conditions.  This grant also allowed the Regis group to participate in the final production data collection run for another experiment, MuSun, which was conducted at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), near Z&uuml;rich, Switzerland.  The analysis of the data from this experiment is still in progress; it is expected to provide a measurement that will calibrate calculations of nuclear processes such as the fusion of protons into helium.   In the final running period for MuSun, the Regis group's most significant responsibility was to test, calibrate, and install a set of neutron detectors.  Much of the work required for all of these projects was done by undergraduate students, providing excellent opportunities for hands-on practical training.  A total of nine students participated in the project.  Two of them have traveled to work at the Paul Scherrer Institute for several weeks, three to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and seven to Fermilab.  Many of the participants are first-generation college students; three are from demographic groups that are under-represented in science.  Two students presented posters on their research at professional conferences.  In addition, the group conducted outreach activities at public open houses and summer science day camps.
