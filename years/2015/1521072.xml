<AbstractNarration>Many natural history museums in the US and around the world harbor large and invaluable research collections of biological specimens. These collections form an archive of much of the world's known biodiversity. This archive is already used as an indispensable resource for many different purposes related to research in biology and conservation. This award will support a number of activities, including workshops that will explore a novel use of natural history collections as a resource for engineering innovation. The rationale behind this endeavor is that the world's biodiversity represents the outcomes of evolution, a process that shares many similarities with engineering optimization, but has been operating on a vast scale in terms of time, space, and the number of different species and individuals involved. Since no human engineering effort can come close to the time and spatial scales of biological evolution, biodiversity can be seen as a precious natural resource for optimizing knowledge that could have a major impact on technology development, finding solutions to major engineering challenges, and stimulating economic activity through innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve its goal of starting a viable process towards utilizing natural history collection as a resource for innovation, the set of activities supported by this award will bring together researchers from very different backgrounds to plan a strategy for a path forward. The first year-long activity will start with preparatory meetings by a core team to carefully craft an agenda so that a large interdisciplinary workshop on the topic can be productive and result in tangible outcomes. After this main workshop, a team of authors will continue to meet and digest the results of the main workshop into two sets of publications, one set aimed at the scientific/engineering community and the other at the general public. The first set of publications will be aimed at giving scientists and engineers from diverse backgrounds specific suggestions as to how natural history collections could be leveraged for engineering innovation. These publication will also outline the pertinent challenges as well as potential solution strategies in as much technical detail as possible. The second set of publications will be aimed at providing policy makers and the general public a well-justified outline of the  innovative and economic potential of natural history collections as well as estimates for the effort that would be required to realize this potential.  The outcomes of the project will be archived on the website of the Center for Bioinspired Science and Technology at Virginia Tech (http://bist.centers.vt.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><pre>Bioinspiration, i.e., taking insights from the function of biological systems as a source for novel engineering concept is already a very successful field of engineering that has resulted in products such as Velcro, the optical computer mouse, self-cleaning surface coatings, and displays that can operate in bright daylight .  Despite these impressive successes, bioinspiration has realized only a tiny fraction of its potential so far. The reason is that engineers looking for inspiration from biological systems have only considered a tiny fraction of the worlds biodiversity so far and most the work in the area is based on far less than 100 biological species. In contrast to this, the world's biodiversity has been estimated at about 8.7 million species (not counting bacteria and viruses). This shows that the functional solutions contained in the world's biodiversity are a vastly underused natural resource that has been mined not anywhere the extent to which, e.g., fossil fuels have been mined.  Developments in three different areas of science and engineering could converge in the foreseeable future to radically change this situation and transform bioinspiration from a "handicraft" to a mature and highly efficient engineering discipline.  Natural history collections such as that of the Smithsonian's have been assembled over more than 100 years and by now are estimated to contain between 1 and 2 billion of curated items worldwide. Hence, these collections provide a great opportunity to look for biological solutions that are relevant to technology in an efficient manner. This is aided by an ongoing trend towards digitizations of these collections, where digital representations of specimens are produced that range from photographic images to detailed three-dimensional computer models. With increasing automation, the pace of digitization is picking up and can be expected to provide bioinspiration researchers with unprecedented amounts of quantitative data on biological form. At the same time, computer methods to predict function from form, e.g., the aerodynamic properties of a bird from its shape, are getting ever more sophisticated and powerful. This will allow engineers to predict functional properties across large ensembles of species for which digital models of the body shapes are available. Making sense of this data will be enabled by the ongoing progress in data sciences that is being fueled by large amounts of data being available on the Internet. The same machine-learning techniques could be adapted to hunt for new engineering solutions among digital data from natural history collections.  Such a large-scale engineering analysis of the world's know biodiversity would transform bioinspiration and with it could also transform the human economy into a nature-based knowledge economy in a similar way has efficient mining and use of coal and iron ore were drivers behind the industrial revolution.  A workshop sponsored by the NSF and hosted by the Smithsonian's National Museum for Natural History has explored the relationships between these fields and has come up with suggestions on how to utilize these emerging 21st century opportunities for the development of a bioinspired knowledge economy. The results have been submitted to the world's leading bioinspiration scientific journal and will also be disseminated through popular media.</pre> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/01/2018<br>      Modified by: Rolf&nbsp;Mueller</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
