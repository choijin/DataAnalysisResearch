<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on the origins and development of coastal foraging and the impact that these foods may have had on human cognitive and behavioral evolution during the time of the origins of the modern human lineage. The project is inherently interdisciplinary, combining research in archaeological, paleobotanical, paleoecological, geochronological, and geological sciences. It is of scientific importance because coastal foods, like shellfish, are an important source of daily nutrients for people today that promotes and maintains prenatal health and juvenile and adult cognitive development and maintenance. The Cape coast of South Africa is also one of the hypothesized origin locations of the modern human lineage and researchers have hypothesized if the influx of nutrient-rich foods into early modern human diets there was linked to their burgeoning cognitive evolution or if the consumption of these foods influenced their cognitive development directly? This project is the first to specifically explore the long-term effects of eating sea foods by studying archaeological sites and paleoenvironments in Pondoland (Eastern Cape Province), South Africa, a unique area where the coastline is hypothesized to have remained the same throughout the last 400,000 years. The researchers will use state-of-the-art methods to excavate archaeological sites in coastal zones and analyze their stratigraphy, marine and terrestrial animal remains, plant remains, and geochronological dating. These interdisciplinary records will be used to test long-standing questions about when, where, and how coastal foraging developed within the local paleoenvironmental context to better understand the broader impact that coastal foods had on modern human origins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has numerous broader impacts. It will provide a long-term evolutionary perspective on the consumption of foods with high concentrations of brain-specific nutrients. These foods, which include shellfish, may be linked to human cognitive and behavioral evolution, but they are also promoted today to ensure the health and wellbeing of contemporary people. In this way, the research will also contribute towards current debates within dietary theory about proper nutrition and lean-protein foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids. The research will also contribute towards a broader understanding of paleoenvironments across the South African Cape coast and the human response to climatic change during glacial and interglacial periods.  Besides coastal resources, Pondoland's indigenous vegetation is also ancient, highly productive, and tightly packed into a narrow coastal zone.  Each vegetation type hosts diverse plant and animal species that would have contributed to the daily survival of early modern humans and this research will contribute towards a wider understanding of the ecological and environmental history of tropical areas. This project also brings together a diverse team of researchers from South Africa, Germany, Spain, Australia and the United States. It draws upon each individuals wider network of professional collaborations, linking numerous other nationalities and research specializations to promote a robust multidisciplinary and international research collaboration between US researchers and students and numerous other international research centers.</AbstractNarration>

The research is important to people living today because shellfish are known to be high in many nutrients that promote and maintain prenatal health and juvenile and adult cognitive development, but the long-term effects of shellfish-rich diets over generations are less well known. Many researchers have even questioned if the influx of nutrient-rich foods into early modern human diets was linked to their burgeoning cognitive evolution or if the consumption of these foods influenced their cognitive development directly?  Our research project was the first to specifically target areas where sea level and coastline changes would not have been a major influence on hunter-gatherer access to coastal resources, which would have allowed continuous records of coastal foraging to build up over long periods of time. The P5 Project brought together specialists in archaeological, malacology, paleobotany, ethnobotany, paleoecology, geochronology, and the geological sciences to explore the long-term history of coastal foraging at several archaeological sites in Pondoland (Eastern Cape Province), South Africa.  Our team conducted a major field research trip from September-November, 2015.  We spent 4 weeks in the field and tested four archaeological sites.  We used modern archaeological and survey methods to record each site and the archaeological deposits in minute detail.  At the site of Four Falls (C4NE-1) within the Mkambati Nature Reserve, excavations revealed a stratified archaeological deposit &gt;70 cm deep that is likely much deeper and older.  A 1 m x 3 m excavation trench was made at the site of Msikaba (B4NW-1) to study the ancient land surfaces preserved within the dune that contain Early Stone Age and Middle Stone Age artifacts.  We also uncovered a previously unrecognized archaeological deposit containing a dense Middle Stone Age occupation surface complete with refitting stone artifacts. At the site of Waterfall Bluff (A2SE-1) we conducted two initial 50cm x 50cm test excavations that were expanded to over 4 meters in length in 2016, exposing a dense and unique stratified sequence of coastal foraging during the Middle to Early Holocene and likely earlier.  Our initial radiocarbon dates and analyses from some of these deposits indicate that we have encountered rare deposits that are poorly known across South Africa.  These findings include rare and exceptional plant preservation, which will enable our team to develop a very detailed understand of the local paleoenvironments and paleoclimates.  At present, studies are underway on the stone artifacts, shellfish, sediment micromorphology, sediment geochemistry, plant leaf waxes and isotopes, plant pollen, plant phytoliths, and preserved plant remains.  Publications of these analysis in peer-reviewed journals will commence in a timely manner once the analyses are completed. Our team partnered with the East London Museum where we have developed our research laboratory.  We have also worked closely with local amaPondo community leaders to recruit and train local individuals in modern archaeological methodology in their native language, isiXhosa.  We have also fostered a strong working relationships with the local amaPondo communities by visiting them on a regular basis and giving talks in isiXhosa to explain what we are doing and finding and what are our research questions.  We are now working with a South African NGO to translate our scientific publications into isiXhosa.  Our project has provided the first detailed information about the prehistory of eastern Pondoland during the middle and early Holocene, at least, as well as key information about paleoenvironments and paleoclimates.  We have completed all of the objectives which we laid out in the NSF project proposal and then some. This is noteworthy because prior to our research, the only published study of prehistoric human occupation in eastern Pondoland pre-dating the Iron Age dated from the 1930?s.  Almost nothing was known about the people who had lived in the area before 5,000 years ago and especially during the very important time period of modern human evolution.  Our research now fills in a key gap within South Africa?s archaeological record and we have uncovered a rich history of human occupation that is unique in many ways and will allow other researchers a more comprehensive understand of early modern human hunter-gatherer behavior and adaptations. Pondoland also is the first, and so far only, location under detailed study where the unique offshore topography prevented major coastline changes, thereby enabling scientists to compare human behavior in coastal contexts over long spans of time, and during peak glacial periods.  Our study set out in part to show that Pondoland could provide these long-term and continuous records and based on our current results, we have demonstrated proof of concept.  Future research in the area and at the same archaeological sites is therefore currently being developed.        Last Modified: 03/06/2017       Submitted by: Erich C Fisher]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
