<AbstractNarration>Much research has been carried out to produce nanoparticles of various materials due to excellent mechanical, chemical, electrical, and optical properties of nanoparticles.  However, it is difficult to deposit and transform nanoparticles into large two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures, such as thin films and discrete arrays, in a controlled manner.  This award supports fundamental research to enable a new additive manufacturing process to deposit nanoparticles into thin films or discrete nanodot arrays (a nanodot is a cluster of nanoparticles). The new process is versatile and scalable, and uses less materials and energy.  It can promote roll-to-roll manufacturing of a variety of energy and electronic devices such as conformal solar cells, sensors, and actuators.  It can also be used to fabricate masks for nanolithography, nanopillar arrays for photonic crystals, and nanodot arrays for plasmonic surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new additive manufacturing process involves injecting silicon nanoparticles (contained inside electric field-driven water droplets) into a hollow laser beam. The size of nanoparticles ranges from 5 to 100 nm. The laser beam will heat the droplets, causing the water to evaporate and the nanoparticles to sinter and form microlayers on flexible substrates such as polyimide plastic (Kapton) or stainless steel foil. For this process to work, the laser beam needs to be focused so that its diameter is smaller than its wavelength. The droplet will serve as both a nanoparticle carrier, and a superlens that focuses a laser beam to subwavelength diameters. The dropsize has to be within an upper and lower critical limit. The first research objective is to determine these limits, and will be achieved through laser beam propagation modeling and droplet deposition experiments. The model involves numerical solution of Maxwell equations, and the solution yields the two limits. Several dropsizes will be chosen within these limits to conduct experiments. The size and feed rate of droplets will be measured using high speed photography; particle concentration using colloidal testing meter; the laser power, diameter, and pulse repetition rate using laser beam analyzer; the speed and temperature of substrate using substrate feed controller and thermography respectively. The grain size of the microlayer (determined by process variables) affects the electrical conductivity of the microlayer. The second research objective is to establish the relationship between the grain size and conductivity. It will be achieved by measuring the grain size using atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and the conductivity using four-probe technique.</AbstractNarration>

Controlling dry nanoparticles is, therefore, difficult for transporting and depositing them into large two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures, such as thin films or discrete nanodot arrays (a nanodot is a cluster of nanoparticles), to harness the novel properties of nanoparticles.  The NSF award supported fundamental research on a new additive manufacturing method, Nanoparticle Electrospray Laser Deposition (NELD) process, to deposit nanoparticles into thin films or discrete nanodot arrays. This new process is versatile and scalable, and uses less materials and energy.  It can promote roll-to-roll manufacturing of a variety of energy and electronic devices such as conformal solar cells, sensors, and actuators.  It can also be used to fabricate masks for nanolithography, nanopillar arrays for photonic crystals, nanodot arrays for plasmonic surfaces, bioprinting, drug discovery and encapsulation for drug delivery.     Lasers provide a unique means of modifying materials due to inherent rapid heating and fast cooling in laser-material interactions, resulting in thermal stresses and nonequilibrium phases.  The NELD process will, therefore, yield thin films or nanodots of different properties under different processing conditions.  This process is illustrated in Fig. 1, showing a syringe pump, a capillary tube and electrodes that deliver an aqueous colloidal suspension of nanoparticles to the substrate in the form of droplets.  Low and high viscosity suspensions of Si, Ge, Ag, SiC and ZnO nanoparticles were studied to delineate different modes of droplet formation and the microdripping mode was found to generate stable, uniform microdroplets of diameter 36.3&plusmn;9.3 mm.  Each microdroplet serves the dual role as a nanoparticle carrier to the substrate and as a superlens for focusing the laser beam to subwavelength diameters on the substrate surface.   This dual role of microdroplets enables to produce nanostructrues.  A Gaussian Nd:YAG laser of wavelength l=1064 nm was transformed into  a hollow beam using a hollow parabolic mirror (Figure 1) that refocused the beam near the substrate surface for evaporating the water droplet and simultaneously sintering the nanoparticles to form microlayers of nanoparticles on the substrate.  This technology is versatile because the nanoparticles of various substances including biomaterials can be utilized to produce different types of structures. NELD has the advantage of delivering nanoparticles and avoids melting or excessive heating of the non-printed regions.     The microdroplets were found to focus the laser beam to subwavelength diameters.    When the microdroplets were created using just de-ionized water containing no nanoparticles, the resulting water microdroplets produced tiny holes of remarkably small diameters (l/10) that were much smaller than what had been previously observed in the literature.  On the other hand, when the microdroplets were created using nanoparticle suspension, the nanoparticles were deposited in the form of subwavelength (l/2) nanodots.  These subwavelength features were found to occur over a certain range of the process parameters.   Outside of this process parameter range, microlayers of nanoparticles were deposited on rigid substrates such as silicon wafers and on flexible substrates such as paper card and polyimide (kapton) film.  The insets in Fig. 1 shows a silver thin film deposited on a paper card and a ZnO microdot on 125 mm thick kapton.  Each microlayer was built by depositing multiple layers of nanoparticles on top of one another. This transformative NELD technology has broader impacts in additive manufacturing for numerous applications as stated earlier.     The advantage of nonequilibrium heating in the NELD process was observed by comparing the morphological and electrical properties of Ag microlayers deposited on Si wafers by the NELD and a conventional Furnace Heat Treatment (FHT) methods.  The FHT samples were prepared by drop casting silicon wafers in silver nanoparticle suspensions and sintering the resulting microlayers in a furnace for similar time and temperature experienced by the NELD samples.  Both NELD and FHT processes exhibit similar trend in the surface morphology, electrical resistivity, and chemical composition when the laser power increases for NELD or the temperature increases in FHT. The NELD samples, however, exhibit lower resistivity than the FHT samples since the grain size is larger and the concentrations of the impurities are lower in the NELD samples than in the FHT samples.  This unique characteristic may be attributed to the deposition mechanisms: (i) The NELD and FHT processes involve nonequilibrium and equilibrium heatings respectively, and (ii)  One line at a time is deposited in the NELD process to produce the microlayer and, therefore, the impurities can diffuse out efficiently since each line has small width and thickness and is heated multiple times by the laser. In the FHT process, the microlayer is produced in a single step and, therefore, the impurities cannot diffuse out efficiently due to large width and thickness of each microlayer.
