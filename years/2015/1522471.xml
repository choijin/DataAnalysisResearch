<AbstractNarration>Eigenvalue problems for differential operators naturally arise in the study of vibrations in membranes and solids, fluid-solid interactions, and photonic crystals, and they also often play an important role in the practical analysis of many other time-dependent phenomena, such as acoustic or electromagnetic scattering. For many problems of interest, it is necessary to have provably efficient and robust means of estimating the error in computed approximations, as well as algorithms that can use this information to intelligently improve the approximations. This project concerns theoretical and algorithmic development of eigenvalue error estimates and self-adaptive methods for three computational approaches that promise to broaden the scope of available tools for addressing these challenging problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI considers eigenvalue problems arising from second-order, linear, differential operators that are not necessarily self-adjoint, and which may have continuous components in their spectrum. The proposed work includes the development of a posteriori eigenvalue/eigenspace error estimates that are robust in the presence of repeated or tightly-clustered discrete eigenvalues---even if they are near components of the essential spectrum. Three broad classes of discretizations will be considered: penalty-based Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methods, and so-called Implicit Element methods, which include variations on Virtual Element (VEM) methods and Boundary-Element-Based Finite Element (BEM-FEM) methods. In each case, the project will provide a posteriori error estimates that are cluster-robust in the sense that are insensitive to distances between true eigenvalues within the cluster that one is approximating, but instead depend on the relative distance between this cluster and the rest of the spectrum. In the case of DG methods, the PI expects to produce at least one provably-convergent, high-order adaptive method. In the case of implicit elements, he will first produce a high-order source-problem solver that is competitive with VEM and BEM-FEM, develop corresponding a posteriori error estimates, and then extend the approach to eigenvalue problems. In the case of DPG methods, he plans to exploit the fact that, with these techniques, indefinite source problems can be treated in a computational way that only involves self-adjoint and positive definite systems, and use this to derive a FEAST-like algorithm for computing large spectral clusters and/or clusters higher in the spectrum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes for Grant 1522471 "Cluster-Robust Estimates for Galerkin and Petrov-Galerkin Discretizations of Elliptic Eigenvalue Problems"     Eigenvalue problems for differential operators naturally arise in the study of vibrations in membranes and solids, fluid-solid interactions, photonic crystals, and also often play an important role in the practical analysis of many other time-dependent phenomena, such as acoustic or electromagnetic scattering.  The project concerned the development and analysis algorithms for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a broad class of differential operators, with emphasis given to efficient and reliable (computable) estimates of errors made in the approximation.   Providing such error estimates in the case of repeated, or tightly-clustered, eigenvalues is a challenge that we have directly addressed in two of the six published papers supported by this grant.  Three further papers supported by the grant, one that is currently in review and two others that are expected to be submitted either before Christmas or early in the next year, also address clustered eigenvalues.  Two of these papers use a new class of algorithms that we believe is particularly well-suited to their treatment, and we have made code based on these algorithms publicly available, and have advertised it at national and international conferences and workshops.    Two of the six published papers supported by this grant focus on error estimation more generally, developing analytical and computational techniques that can be applied to eigenvalue problems (and are used for this purpose in one of the soon-to-be-submitted papers mentioned above), but will also be of use more broadly.The remaining two published papers concern the development of new discretization techniques.  Again, these techniques will be used for eigenvalue computations (involving more sophisticated models), but will be used more broadly as well.  This work has been presented in ten invited presentations, at national and international universities, conferences and workshops.  It has also led to the training of:  ** Two undergraduates, one who has completed his Honor's research project and is now pursuing a PhD, and another who is now working on her Honor's research project.  ** Three Master's students, one who completed her degree last Spring.  We have published a paper (counted above) in a prestigious journal with one of the other Master's students, and are working on a second paper with him.  ** One PhD student, who has already contributed to the code discussed above, and whose dissertation will be directly related to the topics of this grant.  A second PhD student, who joined our program this year, intends to do her dissertation with me, building on some of the work done with these students to tackle eigenvalue-related problems coming from chemistry applications.
