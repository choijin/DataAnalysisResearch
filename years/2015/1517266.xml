<AbstractNarration>The chromosomes of eukaryotes contain tightly packed regions known as heterochromatin.  Genes in these regions are typically silenced; however, some genes in heterochromatic regions are actively expressed.  The aim of this project is to address this long-standing and important question in the field of gene regulation: what is the mechanism that allows certain genes located in heterochromatic regions to be expressed?  This work is a collaborative effort with the students and faculty of the Genomics Education Partnership. Undergraduate students from over 60 colleges and universities will analyze heterochromatic DNA sequences in the fourth chromosome of several fruit fly species. The goal of this work is to identify potential regulatory motifs for gene expression in heterochromatic DNA. This process will allow the students to develop basic bioinformatics skills, participate in genomics research, and be contributors (and co-authors) on the resulting publications.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fourth chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster, with a 30% repeat density, is largely heterochromatic; as illustrated by the variegating phenotype of an hsp70-white reporter gene at most insertion sites on the fourth chromosome.  This silencing appears to be due to packaging in a heterochromatic form.  While high levels of HP1a and H3K9me2/3 are found across the body of fourth chromosome genes, their transcription start sites (TSSs) consistently show depletion of these silencing marks.  This project hase identified a "landing pad" site (a MiMIC line) on the fourth chromosome where an inserted hsp70-white transgene gives a variegated phenotype, while a fourth chromosome gene (Rad23) tagged with a fluorescent marker shows full expression.  Gene fragments between these constructs will be swapped to determine what features of the fourth chromosome gene drive full expression in this heterochromatic environment, with an initial focus on the region around the TSS.  The goal of this project is to determine the sequence elements necessary and sufficient to drive full expression of hsp70-white at this chromatin site, and conversely those changes that would result in variegation of Rad23 (Elements involved in transcription elongation may prove to be as important as the TSS, and will not be neglected).  Key motifs identified by the bioinformatics approach will be tested in this system, and vice-versa. The chromatin structure of the various lines will be checked by both genetic and biochemical approaches (analysis of the impact of Su(var) mutations; ChIP-PCR experiments).  These studies will lead to a better understanding of heterochromatic gene regulation, and identification of motifs (some of which may be novel) that influence gene expression in repeat-rich domains that are also common in the genomes of higher eukaryotes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Drosophila Dot Chromosome:  Gene Expression in the Context of Repetitious DNA     Many human diseases are caused by mis-regulation of gene expression. The DNA that makes up our genomes is not free in the nucleus, but is packaged up by basic proteins, the histones, into a chromatin fiber.  The form of that packaging can have a profound effect on gene expression.  Regions of the genome that have a low density of genes and a high density of repetitious DNA [mostly remnants of invading Transposable Elements (TE)] are often packaged as heterochromatin, a form that promotes gene silencing.  In contrast, regions that have a high gene density and low repeat density are generally packaged as euchromatin, a form that supports appropriate gene expression.  In Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly), the small fourth chromosome (often called the "dot" chromosome) exhibits unusual characteristics compared to other autosomes. The fourth chromosome has a high repeat density and is generally packaged as heterochromatin, yet it contains ~80 genes in the distal 1.4 Mb, a gene density similar to that seen in the euchromatic regions.  Euchromatic genes relocated to the fourth chromosome by rearrangement or transposition exhibit a mosaic pattern of expression, being silenced in some of the cells in which they would normally be active, a phenomenon called "Position-Effect Variegation" or PEV.  However, genes normally found on the fourth chromosome are expressed at levels comparable to those seen for genes normally found in a euchromatic environment.       What allows fourth chromosome genes, such as Rad23, to function where a euchromatic gene, such as hsp70, is silenced? We have identified a "landing pad site" on the fourth chromosome  where we can reproducibly insert a test gene construct that demonstrates this behavior: an hsp70 promoter-driven white reporter exhibits variegation, but a Rad23 promoter-driven white reporter shows full, uniform expression.  In order to identify the sequence features that facilitate the expression of fourth chromosome genes, we conducted a series of experiments where reporter constructs containing fragments of varying lengths of the Rad23 promoter region were inserted into this landing pad site to assess their impacts on the expression of the white reporter.  Results from these analyses have identified the minimal Rad23 fragment needed to drive full white expression as a fragment extending from -100 bp upstream of the Transcription Start Site (TSS) to +126 bp downstream of the TSS.  This result indicates that the features involved in transcript elongation, splicing, etc. are not required for fourth chromosome gene expression.  The critical region (from -100 to +126) includes an unknown upstream site at -100 to -50; both the prominent and minor downstream TSSs (extending to +67) identified by RAMPAGE data; and an Ohler_motif1 instance including an M1BP binding site and a Dmv4 (Inr-like) motif at +10.  All of these features appear to be required for robust gene expression on the fourth chromosome.     Bioinformatics analyses using the MEME suite show that the +/- 300 bp regions surrounding the TSSs of fourth chromosome genes are enriched in an AT-rich motif TATGTATGTATATA, which has significant similarity to the reported topoisomerase II (Top2) binding site.  This site is associated with ~50% of the genes on the fourth chromosome or in pericentric heterochromatin, but with only ~4% of the genes in a euchromatic reference region.  Inserting this motif into the hsp70 promoter resulted in robust (although not quite uniform) white expression on the fourth chromosome, suggesting the interesting possibility that heterochromatin may be defined in part by its topology.  Undergraduate students participating in the Genomics Education Partnership (GEP; http://gep.wustl.edu) are annotating the genes on the fourth chromosome from five Drosophila species.  During the past four years, 95 GEP faculty and their students have contributed a total of 2,153 coding region annotation projects, 353 sequence improvement projects, and 201 TSS annotation projects. The high quality annotations produced by GEP students will enable us to utilize phylogenomic footprinting to identify additional conserved regulatory motifs on the fourth chromosome. This analysis should provide additional insights on the factors that regulate the expression of fourth chromosome genes.     These results significantly expand our understanding of how genes embedded in heterochromatin are expressed.  The discovery of the AT-rich motif that is enriched in the promoters of genes that reside in heterochromatin is particularly exciting.  Should this prove to be a site that promotes Top2 association, this would suggest that chromosome topology differs between heterochromatin and euchromatin in ways that impact gene expression.  Alternatively, identification of a presently unknown effector protein that binds to this site would indicate a heterochromatin-specific transcription factor.  This project has engaged thousands of undergraduates, providing them with an initial research experience in genomics.
