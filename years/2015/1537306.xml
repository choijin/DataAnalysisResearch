<AbstractNarration>This project is motivated by recent observations of evolving fracture networks in tightly-packed systems of particles, or particle rafts, interacting with fluids.  Research supported by this award is focused on computational models and simulations of these systems.  Simulations will enable detailed investigations into their behavior, and help to answer open questions such as why seemingly small perturbations in particle packing give rise to dramatically different fracture patterns.  The tightly packed particle network is an idealized porous medium, and the injection of surfactant is what drives the growth of the fracture networks.  This type of coupling between fluid flow and crack growth is central to many problems of technological relevance, including hydraulic fracturing and corrosion-assisted fracture.  The tabletop experiments are simple and cost effective to study particle systems in detail.  The effort involves outreach activities to public elementary schools in North Carolina, where movies of the simulations and experiments of fracture networks will be shown.  These in-class demonstrations will be used as a launching point to introduce students to basic programming concepts at a young age.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this award is aimed at using simulation science to determine the influence of particle packing, size distributions, and surfactant injection on fracture evolution in particulate systems.  The simulations will provide a means to consider systems beyond the practical limits of experimental testing, such as a much broader range of particle sizes and packing configurations.  In the process, fundamental contributions will be made in applied mechanics and computational science.  These include: 1) a chemo-poro-elasticity based theory for the fracturing of particulate raft systems; and 2) multi-scale, coupled finite-element and molecular dynamics methods that can handle a range of time-scales, from the fast scales of particle interactions to the much slower scales of surfactant diffusion.   These models and simulations will be used to study recent experiments in the dynamics of fracture of particulate rafts, focusing on the important roles of particle heterogeneity and surfactant injection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examined how fracture networks evolve in tightly-packed systems of particles, or particle rafts, interacting with fluids.  The particular systems examined consist of a single layer of particles floating on the top of a fluid layer.  Such a layer of particles has been shown to behave like an elastic sheet.  When a drop of surfactant is introduced at a spot on the layer, it expands outward and expands into fractures that form in the layer of particles.  As such, the system represents an idealized setting to study the way that fluid flow can be coupled to the formation of fracture networks in solid systems.    A modern continuum-based model was developed to describe this process.  The model accounts for the interplay between the particle packing and the fluid flow and allows for two-way coupling.  In other words, while the fluid flow can drive the fracture of the layer, the layer also provides some resistance that in turn affects where the fluid flows.   This model was the first of its kind to be constructed for this class of systems.   Computer simulations based on this model revealed a number of important findings.  In particular, we found that the number of fractures that form in the layer is proportional to the difference in surface tension between the surfactant and the underlying fluid layer.  It is also inversely proportional to the fracture resistance of the layer.  This relationship allowed us to construct a phase diagram (image 1) for fracture in these systems.
