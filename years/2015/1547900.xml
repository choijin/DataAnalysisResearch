<AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to the seventh Midwest Verification Day (MVD), to be held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  in September 2015. MVD is an informal regional workshop with the goal of cultivating a regional research network in verification and formal methods. The funds will help support U.S. based students, focusing on Ph.D. students at an advanced stage in their program and students who would otherwise not be able to attend MVD. The broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area. Higher priority will be assigned to students giving presentations and a strong emphasis will be put on supporting students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This grant provided partial support for seventh edition of Midwest Verification Day (MVD'15), an annual informal regional workshop on hardware and software verification, with verification understood in a broad sense. Main topics of interest include deductive verification, model checking, static analysis, abstract interpretation, runtime verification, language-based verification, and model-based testing. The workshop is &nbsp;strongly student-oriented and provides a forum for graduate and undergraduate students to &nbsp;present their research work and ideas. MVD &nbsp;provides an opportunity for student, faculty and industrial researchers in the Midwestern region of United States to develop and strengthen collaborative research. Since its inception in 2009, student participation in Midwest Verification Day has been supported and encouraged by NSF funding.<br />MVD&rsquo;15 was held October 9-10, 2015 on the campus of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and was hosted by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois. The program of MVD&rsquo;15 featured 19 presentations, including 15 student presentations and 2 invited presentations. The invited talks were given by Prof. Rance Cleaveland from the University of Maryland, College Park, and Dr. David Greve from Rockwell Collins. The meeting had 60 participants from 12 institutions. Participants were from both industry and academia. A wide variety of topics such as model checking and testing of concurrent systems, verification of cyberphysical systems, security of programs, and synthesis of programs were discussed. NSF funding provided travel and accommodation support for 16 students as well as two invited speakers. Combined with funding support from Rockwell Collins, Runtime Verification Inc., and Galois Inc., NSF support allowed us to organize the workshop at no cost to the participants. All students that requested travel and accommodation support received it. Participant responses collected after the workshop confirmed that this support was an important factor in their decision to attend and contribute to the workshop. Although the workshop does not have formal proceedings, several papers and research ideas presented at the workshop has since then been developed and published at leading research venues.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/26/2016<br>      Modified by: Mahesh&nbsp;Viswanathan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
