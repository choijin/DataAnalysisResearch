<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Michael Harvey is "Assessing the importance of plumage divergence within species for the evolution of plumage diversity across birds." The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Michigan, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Daniel Rabosky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on connecting variation among individuals within species to differences across species. Individuals within a species often differ greatly in genetic make-up (genotype) as well as appearance (phenotype). Some of these differences are associated with geography such that individuals from one region are readily distinguishable from those from another region. It is unclear, however, what the implications of this geographic variation are over longer evolutionary timescales. Do species with greater variation tend to produce more species or last longer than species with limited variation? The fellowship research is assessing whether the pattern and rate of phenotypic divergence within bird species predicts patterns or rates of phenotypic diversification across species. Using digital photography and measurements from computer vision, data on phenotypic variation in birds are being gathered from museum specimens at the Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan and other museums as needed. Estimates are then made of evolutionary history using genetic data also gathered from collections to model the history of phenotype evolution both within and across species. These studies reveal what correlations exist between phenotypic divergence within species and phenotypic diversification among species and represent one of the first comparative analysis of phenotypic divergence within and across species at a large scale.  Then it can be determined what types of variation within a species have lasting impacts on the evolutionary trajectory of its descendants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training goals include gaining expertise in using digital imagery and computer vision to quantify phenotypes. Educational outreach to undergraduate students involves them in using museum collections, conducting high-throughput digital photography, training computer vision algorithms, and learning genetic techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project provided the first use of photogrammetry, the use of photographs to measure and model real-world objects, applied to building 3D models of bird museum specimens from full-color spectrum digital images. Results indicate that photogrammetry is a useful tool for measuring the diversity of bird plumages. The grantees placed particular focus on a group of roughly 1,300 species of perching birds (the suboscines), and were able to make photogrammetric models from male and female individuals in all suboscine families. They then estimated the evolutionary history of suboscines from genomic data, and used this estimate to model the history of plumage evolution across the group. They also developed a new statistical method, called ES-sim, to test whether plumage variation or variation in other continuous traits is linked to the origins of species diversity. The grantees are making their 3D models of bird specimens publicly available on the Sketchfab platform. They have also published code and simulated data used in the project to public repositories on the Github platform. This project trained both the primary awardee as a postdoctoral fellow and provided training in genetic and genomic methods for a graduate student. It also engaged undergraduate students, staff, and the public through demonstrations of photogrammetry of bird specimens.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/26/2018<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;G&nbsp;Harvey</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523893/1523893_10393662_1524768414645_photoscan--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523893/1523893_10393662_1524768414645_photoscan--rgov-800width.jpg" title="photogrammetry_model"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523893/1523893_10393662_1524768414645_photoscan--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="photogrammetry_model"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">3D model of a specimen of Ocellated Antbird (Phaenostictus mcleannani) using photogrammetry and full-color spectrum digital photographs.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael G Harvey</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Michael&nbsp;G&nbsp;Harvey</div> <div class="imageTitle">photogrammetry_model</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
