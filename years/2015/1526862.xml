<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to bring together new techniques for filtering and planning to improve reasoning and analysis steps employed during robot design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By understanding those parts of the design process that are typically conducted by hand and by asking which parts can be practically automated, the research has the potential to assist practitioners by scaling up the problems tackled, optimizing systems automatically, and ultimately freeing designers from low-level detail and elevating their use of time.</AbstractNarration>

Part of that effort (along with several members of the community) solidified into "The Robot Design Game", an activity that has been effective for outreach in helping to illustrate the combinatorial challenges inherent in producing robot designs capable of achieving tasks.  More work remains to be done to improve the practicality of these algorithms and the ideas more generally, but the project has helped establish a useful base from which to explore computational tools for robot design.
