<AbstractNarration>The main focus of this project is on dynamical systems. Probably the most important example is the time evolution of a physical system. Given complete information about its state at a particular time, one should be able to predict the state at any later time. If the dynamics is "reversible" (such as in Newtonian mechanics), one can also determine the state at any previous time. If there are no outside influences on the system, the new state depends only on the beginning state and how long the system was allowed to run, not on the particular time at which it started. (If you plant a seed in the fall, the result six months later will be different from the result if you plant it in the spring. However,  if the climate were the same year round, the result six months later would be the same regardless of when you plant.) This setup is an example of an action of the group of real numbers: the set of possible lengths of time the system is allowed to run. Actions of other groups are also important. The group of integers corresponds to taking time in discrete steps, which is sometimes appropriate and is mathematically simpler. Other groups arise from symmetry in a system or from entirely different considerations. One main goal of this project is to better understand certain kinds of dynamical systems, at this stage primarily discrete ones but for which the groups can be otherwise complicated. One direction is to understand the relation between the system and a particular algebraic object, the so-called crossed product, constructed from the system. Another direction is the complete description in a special case (in which the collection of objects of the system is very complicated but the group is actually finite) of all possible systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The largest component of this project involves relating the properties of a minimal and essentially free action of a countable amenable group on a compact metric space to the structure of its crossed product. The plan is to push forward the boundaries of our knowledge in two two particular directions: (1) relating the mean dimension of a minimal homeomorphism to the radius of comparison of the crossed product (simplest group, namely, the integers, and most complicated space) and (2) proving regularity properties when the group is arbitrary but the space is the Cantor set (simplest space, most complicated group). It is also hoped that related methods will help with actions on simple C*-algebras when the action has the tracial Rokhlin property. The next component is the classification of pointwise outer actions of finite groups on purely infinite simple separable nuclear C*-algebras, a much larger class of actions than the ones already classified (those with the Rokhlin property). The third component is the study of operator algebras on Lebesgue spaces with exponent different from two. This is a new field which turns out to be unexpectedly rich.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     % To see the correct version, process with AMSLaTeX. \documentclass[10pt]{amsart} \usepackage{amssymb}  \title[Project Outcomes Report]{Project Outcomes Report for NSF Grant DMS-1501144}  \author{N.~Christopher Phillips}  \begin{document}  \maketitle  This project was concerned with Banach algebras, primarily C*-algebras. The set $M_n ({\mathbb{C}})$ of all $n \times n$ matrices with complex entries is an algebra: one can add, subtract, and multiply such matrices, and one can multiply a matrix by a complex number. (Multiplication is not commutative: usually $a b \neq b a$.) One can also form the adjoint $a^*$ of a matrix~$a$: take the transpose and replace all the entries by their complex conjugates. A Banach algebra also needs a ``norm'', which, roughly, is a measure of the size of an element. For a matrix: not how many entries it has, rather, if it acts on a vector in the usual way, how much bigger does it make the vector? For this, we need to know how big the vectors are. Taking the size of $\xi = (\xi_1, \xi_2, \ldots, \xi_n) \in {\mathbb{C}}^n$ to be \[ \| \xi \|_2  = \sqrt{ | \xi_1 |^2 + | \xi_2 |^2 + \cdots + | \xi_n |^2}, \] which is the immediate generalization of the usual distance in the ordinary three dimensional space we live in, and using this measure of size to define a norm on $M_n ({\mathbb{C}})$, we get a C*-algebra.  It has dimension $n^2$: to specify an element, you need $n^2$ paremeters, since you have to say what each of the $n^2$ entries is. Most Banach algebras, and in particular most C*-algebras, are infinite dimensional.  C*-algebras have applications to and connections with other areas of mathematics. One area is topology, which considers ``spaces'' like the surface of a sphere, the surface of a donut, or a space-time as in general relativity. Another is quantum mechanics and quantum field theory in physics. A third area, the most important here, is dynamical systems. The most obvious dynamical systems are time evolutions: think of something, such as a solar system or a flowing fluid, whose state, here the positions and velocities of the planets, moons, etc.\  or the molecules in the fluid, changes with time. There are others, for example, time evolutions with discrete time; an example would be a process whose state changes once per day, or even one which changes continuously but for which the changes are observed once per day. If the process is periodic, so that states repeat after a finite time, and uses discrete time, one gets a dynamical systems with only finitely many ``times''. Symmetries of an object also give rise to dynamical systems, often also with only finitely many ``times'' but arranged in a more complicated way.  There are two main directions to the outcomes of this project (as well as a number of somewhat related discoveries, omitted here). The first is the structure of C*-algebras associated to dynamical systems. The C*-algebra associated with an ordinary space is commutative. However, the C*-algebra associated with a dynamical system involving an ordinary space is normally no longer commutative. This phenomenon is visible in the fluid flow example as follows. If you measure the temperature and then let a river carry you downstream, the result is probably not the same as if you let the river carry you downstream and then measure the temperature.  The dynamical systems I consider usually have discrete time (or are based on a finite set of symmetries). This is simpler to deal with, and the analogous questions for continuous time are mostly still beyond the reach of current research. (I hope this will change soon.) They give ``simple'' C*-algebras; roughly speaking, the algebras can't be taken apart into smaller pieces in a reasonable way. The main results show that certain properties of the C*-algebra are determined by other properties of the dynamical system, although from just considering the properties separately there is sometimes no apparent connection.  The second direction is operator algebras on $L^p$ spaces. Suppose $1 \leq p &lt; \infty$. We make $M_n ({\mathbb{C}})$ into a Banach algebra using a different norm, starting from the size measure on ${\mathbb{C}}^n$ given by \[ \| \xi \|_p  = \sqrt[p]{ | \xi_1 |^p + | \xi_2 |^p + \cdots + | \xi_n |^p}. \] If $p = 1$, this is the distance you travel on a rectangular street grid if you must stay on the streets. Then we look at infinite dimensional versions of this algebra. People have previously paid little attention to such algebras, assuming there was little of interest to discover. I have found that there are interesting things to say. Some of the most important examples of C*-algebras have analogs in this new situation, with properties which are similar but not quite the same. Moreover, the theory is essentially different for every different choice of $p$. Although applications are not yet clear, this is a new and potentially exciting area of pure mathematics which has attracted interest from researchers and graduate students in several different countries.  \end{document}           Last Modified: 05/13/2019       Submitted by: N.
