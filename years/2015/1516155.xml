<AbstractNarration>This project is concerned with the spontaneous formation of periodic structures in complex systems. Examples of such systems include bands of mussels in tidal flats, bacterial aggregation patterns, and hexagonal or stripe patterns in convection problems.  Spatial patterns often arise due to the instability of a simpler state.  For example, in ecological or chemical applications an equilibrium state may be destabilized due to the introduction of a previously absent species.  Initial states lying near this equilibrium state will evolve towards a new profile and one would like to predict what this new state will be.  For spatially extended problems, this process involves the formation of moving interfaces, known as invasion fronts, that move at a fixed speed and serve to transition the unstable state to some other configuration.  The objective is to uncover the properties of a nonlinear system that lead to selection of a particular invasion front and consequently the patterned state that is created by that front.  Transitions from unstable to stable states occur in many applied contexts and this research will help inform scientists to formulate predictions regarding, or even control over, the formation of complex spatiotemporal patterns in those systems.  The work has potential application via the role of reaction-diffusion equations in modeling the generation of small scale structures in nanotechnology and materials science.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The mathematical focus of the project is the study of pattern formation in systems of reaction-diffusion equations in which periodic structures are created by invasion fronts.   Several specific systems of parabolic partial differential equations will be considered with the aim of extracting general principles mediating wavespeed selection.  The project areas include the study of competition amongst patterns in reaction-diffusion-advection equations arising in ecological and chemical applications, coarsening modes in biological aggregation models of Keller-Segel type, and the existence of fronts in coupled amplitude equations describing the emergence of and competition between patterned states near a supercritical Turing bifurcation.  The project will require a variety of tools including linear analysis, geometric singular perturbation theory, blow-up techniques, and comparison principles. There are several innate challenges in regards to describing pattern-forming fronts in systems of equations that will require extensions of analytical techniques.  For example, systems of equations can support invasion fronts wherein different components invade at different speeds for which no single fixed frame can capture the relevant dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Invasion fronts refer to moving interfaces that transition an unstable steady state into some other state.  This project served to advance the mathematical theory governing the dynamics of these fronts as well as to apply this theory to make predictions for systems of practical interest.  On the theoretical side, the research focused on identifying the mathematical features of systems which determine the speed of these invasion fronts, the states that are selected in their wake and how these fronts respond to perturbations.  Invasion fronts propagate due to the instability of the steady state which causes solutions to grow at each point in space combined with diffusion which causes the instability to spread in space.  One project outcome was to derive an explicit criterion for how resonances between different unstable modes could conspire to determine the speed of the front. Another outcome was to study how changes in system parameters could affect the speed of the front.  It was discovered that in some instances small changes in system parameters can lead to large changes in the invasion speed and this phenomena was explained in the language of bifurcation theory.    Another natural question regards what happens when an invasion front is perturbed.  When the perturbation decays the front is stable and a method of proof was developed to show that a large class of invasion fronts are stable in an appropriate sense.  This project also studied invasion fronts in systems where space was described by a graph.  This is in contrast to the cases listed above where space is taken to be a continuous variable.  To determine the speed of the front in these cases is analogous to determining how long it takes for the instability to spread from one node in the graph to some other node. Researchers taking part in a summer REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) studied diseases spreading through airline transportation networks modeled by local Susceptible-Infected-Recovered dynamics with movement between nodes modeled by diffusion via the graph laplacian.  Making use of the known theory regarding invasion fronts, an explicit formula for the prediction of disease arrival times was obtained in the limit of small diffusion.  In a related project, the dynamics of invasion fronts when space is given by a homogeneous tree was also studied.  Here general principles governing the spreading speed and growth rate of the total population were determined by reduction to a lattice dynamical system.   Additionally the project contributed to the understanding of pattern formation phenomena.  Pattern formation here refers to the spontaneous formation of coherent patterns. One application considered was the formation of regular bands of mussels in advective environments such as tidal flats.  A mathematical analysis of a model system was carried out and rigorous asymptotic descriptions of the pattern profile and their speeds were obtained.   Finally, an undergraduate research project was carried out wherein the formation of patterns in a simple model of opinion dynamics was studied.  Using the theory of invasion fronts, predictions for the observed pattern were obtained and contrasted with those observed in numerical simulations.
