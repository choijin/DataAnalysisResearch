<AbstractNarration>Islands are dynamically interesting because they pose strong dynamical constraints on the exchange between the island shelf and the open ocean, and can result in important water mass transformation and export. These dynamics also influence the circulation on the shelf, on the slope, and far from the island. Idealized and realistic numerical ocean models will be combined with simple analytic models to better understand what controls water mass transformation and net downwelling around islands.  The idealized framework emphasized here will provide a clearer understanding of why these processes differ between different islands and how they might be expected to change in a changing climate.  Work supported by this grant will contribute to both undergraduate and graduate education programs at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of analytic models and eddy resolving numerical models will provide insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics that control the diapycnal mass flux and mixing on island shelves and export of product waters to the surrounding ocean. Particular focus will be given to asymmetrical forcing situations in which the buoyancy-forcing, wind stress, surrounding ocean, or bottom topography vary around the island perimeter. The general approach will use theory to identify the relevant non-dimensional numbers and provide a dynamical framework with which to guide and interpret the numerical model calculations. The numerical models will be used to test the basic predictions from the theory while more completely resolving important processes such as nonlinear eddy fluxes and convection. Quantities of interest include: properties of product water masses; distribution of upwelling and downwelling; net diapycnal mass flux; induced circulations and fluxes across the shelf break.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this project was to understand how wind and heat loss to the atmosphere can force low frequency (months to years) variability in the circulation around large islands.  There were several distinct research projects supported by this grant.  It was found that heat loss (or evaporation) near an island forces a counter-clockwise circulation around the island that is in addition to the previously known clockwise circulation.  This was found in computer models and laboratory experiments, and also provides an explanation for variability observed along the west coast of Iceland as being forced by winds to the north of Iceland.  In a separate project, the variability in the flow through Denmark Strait, which is an important chokepoint for the climate system, was found to arise from a balance between large-scale flows that push warm/salty water from the south and cold/fresh water from the north and frontal instabilities (analogous to atmospheric weather patterns).  This provides a unifying framework for interpretation of various types of variability observed in Denmark Strait since the 1950's.  In a third study, deep shoals or basins under certain circumstances were found to behave in ways similar to islands. Wind-forcing over these deep topographic features can force large gyres that extend from the surface to the bottom and persist for years. These features were found in computer models and were well explained by mathematical analysis.  Support from this grant also contributed to two additional studies that explored where/how waters sink from near the surface to great depths.
