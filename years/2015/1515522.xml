<AbstractNarration>Rip currents are strong, narrow seaward flows of water that originate in the surf zones of many global beaches. They are related to hundreds of international drownings each year, but exact numbers are difficult to calculate due to logistical difficulties in obtaining accurate incident reports. Annual average rip current fatalities are estimated to be ~100, 53 and 21in the United States (US), Costa Rica, and Australia respectively. While physical rip current behavior is relatively well understood, we know little about the social aspect of rip current hazards. Recent research shows that beachgoers drown from a combination of physical and social factors, with the latter related to beachgoer age, swimming ability, knowledge, and ability to spot a rip. The rip current hazard has been exacerbated by information disconnects between three groups: beach scientists, beach safety practitioners, and the general public. This project will use a mixed-methods approach to address these disconnects by combining novel methods of measuring rip current channel morphology and measured beachgoer knowledge to determine behavior from subject proximity to rip current channels. Results will help improve design of rip current education interventions in Australia, the United States and globally. The project will be overseen by Dr. Rob Brander, Associate Professor at the University of New South Wales and noted rip current expert. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interviews will be analyzed for spatial relationships to rip hazard locations, as determined from bathymetric maps that will be created from multispectral imagery captured by Digital Globe?s WorldView2 (WV2) satellite. The depth of penetration for different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum captured by this satellite can be used to derive bathymetry. Because rips form in topographic lows in bathymetry, their location can be interpreted from channels in the surf zone. This method has the highest accuracy in clear waters like those around Sydney. Rip locations, combined with interview results and locations, will determine if subjects? observed behavior (choice in location within a beach) reflects their knowledge of beach dynamics. Results of this study will clarify how gaps between coastal geomorphologists, policy makers, and beachgoers can be bridged to lower rip-current related fatalities and injuries in Australia and the United States (US). This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>

The goal was to interview people swimming at nearby Bondi Beach, which is a globally famous and popular beach but is also prone to developing deadly rip currents. Rip currents, sometimes called rip-tides, are concentrated flows of water that can form in the surf of a beach and can carry unsuspecting swimmers swiftly out to deep water. The PI successfully interviewed 48 subjects from a variety of demographic groups and swimming abilities, despite wintery conditions during the experiment. She marked the exact locations of these interviews with a GPS and statistically analyzed subjects&rsquo; anonymous answers against their distance to rip currents present at the time of their interview. Maps of rip currents present during the study were calculated from imagery captured by one of Dr. Brander&rsquo;s permanently installed instruments and a US satellite.</p> <p><br />With the maps she created of the study site area, the rip currents present on interview days, and the interview answers, the PI was able to answer several hypotheses. The primary question was: do more vulnerable beach-goers inadvertently sit closer to dangerous rip currents? Vulnerable swimmers could be those who now less about how to spot, avoid, or escape rips &ndash; and they can also be people who are visiting a beach for the first time, or who do not swim well. Results showed that being unable to identify a rip in a photograph was not correlated with sitting near a rip &ndash; or that people who can spot a rip are just as likely to sit near them as people who cannot. This was a new and novel discovery in the rip current science community and has major implications for how signage, warnings, and education programs are designed going forward.</p> <p><br />Of the many questions asked, the only subject characteristic that does have a statistically significant relationship with rip current proximity (where subjects who gave one type of answer were much more likely to sit near a dangerous rip) is this: subjects who self-report that they cannot swim far, either in a pool or in the open ocean, are more likely to sit closer to a rip current. The cause of this relationship is still under investigation by the PI but there are some likely causes, such as the location of entrances to the beach, which may be steering visitors and first-time tourists to park and enter the beach closer to the location of a regularly forming rip current.</p> <p><br />As a result of this successful project, Dr. Rob Brander has increased his level of involvement in rip current education and prevention work in the United States, and in Costa Rica (a result of connections made through the PI, Sarah Trimble).
