<AbstractNarration>A remarkable feature of quantum physics is the non-locality of information.  Quantum information can be encoded not only in individual bits or atoms, but also in the correlations amongst many atoms.  Such correlations -- or "entanglement" -- may one day offer profound benefits for computation and precision sensing technologies.  While the potential benefits of entanglement multiply with increasing particle number, so do the challenges of manipulating and preserving it.  One key difficulty is that the naturally occurring interactions among atoms are local, i.e., an atom ordinarily interacts only with other atoms that are very near it.  In this project, we will engineer a new type of interaction that is non-local and can thus entangle many spatially separated atoms.  We will employ laser light as a messenger for conveying information between these atoms to generate entanglement.  A crucial challenge is to convey this information discreetly, without letting it leak to the surrounding environment; otherwise, the delicate quantum mechanical system would be perturbed by the mere act of observation.  Addressing this challenge will require a customized experimental apparatus, which graduate and undergraduate students will construct and operate, thereby acquiring valuable technical and analytical problem-solving skills.  The educational impact will be extended to students from a local two-year college through summer internships designed to broaden participation in the science and engineering workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on engineering light-mediated spin-spin interactions among laser-cooled atoms.  The primary motivation is to enable the study of novel many-particle entangled states emerging from beyond-mean-field collective spin dynamics.  By strongly coupling many atoms to a single mode of light in an optical resonator, we will generate interactions that are highly coherent, controllable, and non-local.  By furthermore combining non-local interactions with local addressing, we will harness a single quantum bit non-linearity to manipulate the many-particle collective spin.  The ease of tuning and quenching light-mediated interactions, as well as varying the strength and form of dissipation, will enable investigations of the emergence of entanglement in a quantum phase transition or in quantum chaotic dynamics.  Sensitive, resonator-aided measurements will enable detailed quantum-state characterization, including tomographic reconstruction into a phase-space representation allowing for visual comparison of quantum dynamics with corresponding classical trajectories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quantum mechanical systems have the remarkable capacity for storing information non-locally: not in individual bits but in correlations between measurements performed on distinct particles in different places.  Controlling such correlations offers opportunities for developing ultra-precise compact sensors or developing new paradigms for computation.  However, the range of quantum states that arise in nature is limited by the fact that all forces act locally: particles typically interact with other nearby particles.  In this project, we generated effectively non-local interactions by inducing light to convey information amongst thousands of atoms.  In our experiments, quantum information is encoded in the atoms' magnetic moments (spins), which can point either up or down.  A photon scattered between two atoms -- irrespective of the distance between them -- enables one spin to be flipped up only if the other is flipped down.  One milestone of our work was to directly observe these flip-flop effects in a regime where the strength of interaction between a pair of atoms need not decay with the physical distance between them, being governed instead by the intensity pattern of a laser field.  We furthermore observed that these light-induced interactions can produce correlated pairs of 'up' and 'down' spins in a massively parallel fashion.  In future work, this mechanism will allow for engineering entangled states of many atoms whose quantum correlations enhance the precision or spatial resolution of magnetic-field sensors, or improve the performance of compact accelerometers.  We also made significant theoretical contributions in the endeavor to advance control of quantum correlations and to harness them as a technological resource.  Firstly, we identified new ways of approaching fundamental quantum limits in the precision of clocks and sensors, while attaining robustness to experimental imperfections such as detector noise.  We furthermore developed a promising approach to generating laboratory analogs of Schroedinger's cat -- an massive object in a superposition of two extremely different states ('alive' and 'dead').  Such highly non-classical states -- and our approach to generating them -- are applicable in a wide range of contexts relevant to quantum-enhanced force sensing: the object could be a cloud of magnetic atoms (imagine a compass needle simultaneously pointing north and south) or a nano-scale mechanical oscillator (a pendulum simultaneously swinging left and right).  Seeking to advance fundamental understanding of quantum correlations -- and of how such correlations can grow and spread -- we drew inspiration from recent theoretical developments stemming from the quest to understand the fate of quantum information in black holes.  This endeavor has led to the conjecture of a fundamental speed limit on the rate at which quantum information can be scrambled -- delocalized across all degrees of freedom of a system of interacting particles.  In collaborative theoretical work, we showed how the rate of scrambling can be measured in experiments.  This work, together with the first proof-of-principle experiments that it has already inspired, paves the way to elucidating connections between chaos, thermal equilibration, and entanglement in interacting quantum systems.  In addition to advancing scientific knowledge and enabling future quantum technologies, the project contributed to the education of the next generation of scientists and engineers.  The principal investigator and graduate students mentored several undergraduate researchers including a veteran attending a local two-year college, who has now successfully transitioned to a top research university to complete a bachelor's degree in physics.  We additionally led a workshop for high-school math and science teachers, introducing activities for teaching cutting-edge concepts of quantum mechanics through table-top optics experiments.
