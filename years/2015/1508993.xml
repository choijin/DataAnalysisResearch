<AbstractNarration>Both the current wireless communication networks and the electricity grid infrastructure are on the verge of a major paradigm shift. The traditional cellular architecture is evolving into heterogeneous networks (HetNets) consisting of densely deployed macro/micro/pico-cell base stations (BSs). In such HetNets, coordinated transmissions are advocated to perform energy-efficient green communications. At the same time, the current power network infrastructure is also migrating toward a so-termed smart grid that promises unprecedented levels of monitorability and controllability. It is expected that all future communication systems will be powered by a smart grid. Integration of smart-grid technologies into system designs then holds the key to fully exploiting the potential of green communications in next-generation HetNets. This highlights the clear need for fundamental understanding and systematic exploration of smart-grid powered green communications in HetNet deployments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this end, the present project is centered on transformative analytical and algorithmic tools for smart-grid powered green communications. The vision is to establish a comprehensive framework based on state-of-the-art optimization approaches to jointly design green HetNets along with critically relevant smart grid operations. By cross-fertilizing ideas between these two fields, the ultimate goal is to set forth a unified treatment for modeling, analyzing, and designing resource management schemes for smart-grid powered HetNets. The engineering outcome of the proposed research is a suite of protocols for distributed, real-time implementation of basestation activation, coordinated beamforming in HetNets, as well as renewable energy harvesting and storage, demand response, and unit commitment operations for smart grids. Creating energy-efficient, distributed, real-time algorithms will greatly enhance the performance of emerging wireless cellular networks while reducing carbon emissions and enhancing the green communication solution to climate change and global warming. This project also addresses the broader impacts of improving undergraduate STEM education, increasing participation of under-represented minorities, and promoting a scientifically literate public.</AbstractNarration>
