<AbstractNarration>ECCS-1542224&lt;br/&gt;Third Arab-American Frontiers of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Symposium:&lt;br/&gt;A unique opportunity to engage the next generation of S&amp;T leaders  &lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Interdisciplinary scientific collaboration plays an important role in addressing global challenges that impact every region across the world. These challenges often require national, as well as cross-boundary approaches.  The Arab-American Frontiers Symposium is a unique type of gathering that convenes outstanding young scientists, engineers, and medical professionals from the United States and the Arab region to discuss exciting advances and opportunities in their fields. The third symposium will be held on December 5-7, 2015 in partnership with the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia and the National Academies under the overarching theme of "Sensing Technologies, Networks and Applications". The program is participant-driven and is therefore an excellent opportunity for the symposium's attendees to strengthen their leadership, communication and organizational skills and expand their professional network. In addition, by convening a group of participants which is diverse not only in research fields, but also geographically, the Arab American Frontiers symposia will build bridges between countries and promote science diplomacy. Thus, the Arab-American Frontiers program can forge partnerships at an early career stage to improve scientific, engineering and medical research in the United States and the Arab region and build successful long-term collaborative activities among future S&amp;T leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;The Arab-American Frontiers of Science, Engineering, and Medicine program brings together outstanding young scientists, engineers, and medical professionals from the United States and the 21 countries of the Arab League for a symposium to discuss cutting-edge scientific and technological advances in their fields. The third symposium will be hosted by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) on its campus in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. The symposium has three objectives: (1) Enhance scientific dialogue and exchange among young researchers in Arab countries and the United States; (2) Encourage and strengthen scientific collaboration and the transfer of techniques and approaches across disciplines within and beyond the region; and (3) Empower young researchers to assume leadership roles. During the symposium, U.S. and Arab scientists, engineers and medical professionals will discuss major scientific advances on a wide array of topics under the overarching theme of "Sensing Technologies, Networks and Applications". The symposium will cover advances in discovery of new materials, design of new sensor platforms and networks, and ingenious management, assimilation and interpretation of data and our ever increasing need to understand our changing world from molecular to planetary scales. The experience is intellectually stimulating and generates a dialogue across disciplines considered as key for scientific innovation. These exchanges on cutting-edge scientific knowledge among U.S. and Arab participants take place through: five plenary sessions covering a wide range of disciplines; poster presentations by each participant; educational exhibits, and informal discussions. Following the symposium, Arab American Frontiers fellowships (travel seed grants) are awarded to pairs of participants who intend to collaborate on a research topic of common interest.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Summary</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>The third Arab-American Frontiers of Science, Engineering, and Medicine symposium brought together about 100 outstanding young scientists, engineers, and medical professionals from the United States and 10 Arab countries for a symposium to discuss exciting advances and opportunities in their fields. The symposium was a partnership between King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) and the National Academy of Sciences and was held on 5-7 December, 2015 under the overarching theme of &ldquo;Sensing Technologies, Networks, and Applications&rdquo;. The symposium had three objectives: (1) Enhance scientific dialogue and exchange among young researchers in Arab countries and the United States; (2) Encourage and strengthen scientific collaboration and the transfer of techniques and approaches across disciplines within and beyond the region; and (3) Empower young researchers to assume leadership roles.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;The third Frontiers symposium was an unprecedented opportunity for U.S. and Arab scientists to share state of the art knowledge under the overarching theme of sensing technologies, networks and applications, and explore how these findings apply to the regional context. The meeting convened 64 general participants, 24 speakers and 12 organizing committee members from 10 Arab countries and the United States. Through formal presentations, the subsequent panel discussions, and three poster sessions, the symposium covered advances in the discovery of new materials, design of new sensor platforms and networks, biomedical sensing technology, and applications to agriculture and the environment. The session panels and daily poster sessions generated new ideas for cross disciplinary innovation that do not usually take place in regular single discipline-focused conferences. Based on the post-symposium survey, 72 percent of the participants learned about new developments in their fields, while nearly 89 percent of the participants identified potential applications of new approaches, tools, and/or analysis methods at the symposium that could benefit their research or technical work.&nbsp;</p> <p>Following the symposium, five Arab-American Frontiers fellowships were awarded to pairs of participants who intended to collaborate on a research topic of common interest. For example, Dr. Sherief Reda (Brown University, USA) hosted Dr. Adel Belouchrani (Ecole Nationale Polytechnique, Algeria) in his lab and they have recently published a joint paper on the topic ( <em>S. Reda and A. Belouchrani,&nbsp; &ldquo;Blind Identification of Power Sources in Multicore Processors&rdquo;, IEEE/ACM&nbsp; Design, Automation &amp; Test in Europe, 2017). </em></p> <p>Similarly, Dr. Frank DelRio, a US Frontiers participant from NIST received a fellowship to work with Dr. Moh&rsquo; Amer at KACST on Laser-induced Particle Adsorption on Atomically Thin MoS2. &nbsp;Accordingly to Del Rio, &ldquo;<em>I recently visited Moh at KACST a few weeks ago as part of the last symposium and together we were able to get some very nice results on a project of joint interest.&nbsp; In combining Moh&rsquo;s expertise in Raman and my work with AFM/XPS, I think we are well-poised to answer some very interesting questions related to low-dimensional materials (electronics).</em> <strong>&rdquo;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p> <p>The Arab-American Frontiers symposium served as an excellent opportunity to build new collaborations and establish research partnerships. A survey of all participants to Frontiers symposia indicated that 73 percent of the US respondents did not have any interaction with Arab scientists prior to their participation to the Arab-American Frontiers symposium. The same survey indicated that for 86.7 percent of the U.S. attendees, their participation led to follow-up activities, including follow-up exchange visits for 40 percent of them.</p> <p>The Arab-American Frontiers Fellowships in particular are an excellent opportunity for training and developing new research networks for both visiting and host fellows. Visiting fellows are exposed to a new institution and research ecosystem and they have the opportunity to interact with members of the host fellow&rsquo;s research group and department. According to Dr. Belouchrani, a 2015 Frontiers participant from Algeria and visiting fellow to Dr. Sherief Reda&rsquo;s lab at Brown University: &ldquo;<em>I had contact with several members of the Laboratory for Engineering Man/Machine Systems (LEMS) [&hellip;] I had also interesting interactions with Prof. Reda&rsquo;s PhD students.&nbsp; I have attended the meetings organized by Prof. Reda and his research team. I have given a seminar at the LEMS untitled ''Time Frequency Array Signal Processing: A synergistic relationship between time frequency methods and sensor array processing&rdquo;.</em>&nbsp; Students were also engaged in the symposium itself where they served as volunteers; as a result, they attended all the scientific sessions and interacted with top-notch participants from the U.S. and the Arab region.</p> <p>Finally, Arab-American Frontiers symposium provided a platform to young scientists from the Arab world and the United States to be more visible, grow professionally, and learn useful leadership skills. The symposium is participant-driven and is therefore an excellent opportunity for both organizing committee members and general participants to strengthen their leadership, communication and organizational skills, and expand their professional network. According to our recent survey, 89% of the respondents said that the symposium was useful for their professional development.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/20/2017<br>      Modified by: Dalal&nbsp;Najib</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511212742946_Group_NSF--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511212742946_Group_NSF--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Group photo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511212742946_Group_NSF--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Group photo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Participants to the third Arab-American Frontiers Symposium at KAUST</div> <div class="imageCredit">KAUST</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dalal&nbsp;Najib</div> <div class="imageTitle">Group photo</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511213119320_OrganizingandoversightcommitteesNSF--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511213119320_OrganizingandoversightcommitteesNSF--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Oversight and organizing committee members"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511213119320_OrganizingandoversightcommitteesNSF--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Oversight and organizing committee members"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Oversight and organizing committee members of the third Arab-American Frontiers Symposium</div> <div class="imageCredit">KAUST</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dalal&nbsp;Najib</div> <div class="imageTitle">Oversight and organizing committee members</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511213263156_IMG_0702--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511213263156_IMG_0702--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Panel Discussion"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511213263156_IMG_0702--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Panel Discussion"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Panel discussion during the session on " Integrated Approaches to Sensing Across Modalities"</div> <div class="imageCredit">KAUST</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dalal&nbsp;Najib</div> <div class="imageTitle">Panel Discussion</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511213393132_IMG_0395--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511213393132_IMG_0395--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Poster Session"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511213393132_IMG_0395--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Poster Session"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Poster Session during the Third Arab-American Frontiers Symposium</div> <div class="imageCredit">KAUST</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dalal&nbsp;Najib</div> <div class="imageTitle">Poster Session</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511216173859_DelRio_Amer1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511216173859_DelRio_Amer1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="US fellow from NIST visiting KACST"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542224/1542224_10371184_1511216173859_DelRio_Amer1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="US fellow from NIST visiting KACST"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dr. Frank DelRio, a US Frontiers participant from NIST received a Frontiers fellowship after the symposium at Saudi Arabia to work with Dr. Moh?
