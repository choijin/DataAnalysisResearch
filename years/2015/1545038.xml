<AbstractNarration>The timely and accurate in-service identification of faults in mechanical structures, such as airplanes, can play a vitally important role in avoiding catastrophes.  One major challenge, however, is that the sensing system relies on high frequency signals, the coordination of which is difficult to achieve throughout a large structure.  To tackle this fundamental issue, the research team will take advantage of 3D printing technology to fabricate integrated sensor-structure components.  Specifically, the team plans to innovate a novel printing scheme that can embed piezoelectric transducers (namely, sensor/actuator coupled elements) into layered composites.  As the transducers are densely distributed throughout the entire structure, they function like a nerve system embedded into the structure.  Such a sensor nerve system, when combined with new control and command systems and advanced data and signal processing capability, can fully unleash the latest computing power to pinpoint the fault location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new framework of utilizing emerging additive manufacturing technology to produce a structural system with integrated, densely distributed active sensing elements will potentially lead to paradigm-shifting progress in structural self-diagnosis.  This advancement may allow the acquisition of high-quality, active interrogation data throughout the entire structure, which can then be used to facilitate highly accurate and robust decision-making.  It will lead to intellectual contributions including: 1) development of a new sensing modality with mechanical-electrical dual-field adaptivity, that yields rich and high-quality data throughout the structure; 2) design of an additive manufacturing scheme that inserts piezoelectric micro transducer arrays throughout the structure to enable active interrogation; and 3) formulation of new data analytics and inverse analysis that can accurately identify the fault location/severity and guide the fine-tuning of the sensor system.</AbstractNarration>

The methodology developments and research findings of this project are at different stages of dissemination:  some were published, some are accepted for publication but will appear later, and others are in the peer-review process and subject to revisions before publication.  In the first objective line of work, the methodology outcomes are published/under review with the data science methodology journals like Technometrics and Journal of the American Statistical Association, while an application paper is published in Structural Health Monitoring.  In the second objective line of work, the outcomes are by and large published/under review with the data science methodology journals, including IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, IISE Transactions, Journal of Machine Learning Research, and IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.     Students who worked on the project received training in cyber-physical systems, covering data science, machine learning, and structural health monitoring.  The research team presented their methods and ideas not only to their own professional affiliations but also to groups across disciplinary boundaries and to their industrial partners. One Ph.D. student graduated in 2019 and joined the faculty of Rutgers University as an assistant professor.  The second Ph.D. student is to graduate in 2020 and will stay at TAMU as a post-doc.  Both students received several awards and recognitions for their work supported by this project, including a prestigious First Prize award of the conference-wide poster competition at INFORMS annual meeting in Oct 2019.  This First Prize award was identified by a panel of judges out of more than 200 contestants.       Last Modified: 03/29/2020       Submitted by: Yu Ding]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
