The meeting generated much discussion and interaction among scientists, engineers and funding representatives from the NSF, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and from affiliated funding organizations of foreign collaborating countries.  This meeting is a key annual event for facilitating fundamental scientific research that seeks to deepen our understanding of the brain.
