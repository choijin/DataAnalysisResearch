<AbstractNarration>This study will examine genetic changes in sea otter populations using samples from Pre-Columbian to Modern times. Many rare or endangered species have experienced sharp population declines known as population "bottlenecks".  These bottlenecks can have deleterious genetic impacts similar to inbreeding and affect the probability of species recovery. Understanding and quantifying these effects in populations allows for more effective management and better prediction of survival outcomes. A model example of a species that has experienced population bottlenecks is the sea otter. It was hunted almost to extinction, with numerical declines of &gt;99% during the course of the 18th -19th century fur trade. The small number of surviving otters increased over the 20th century under careful monitoring and enhanced protection. In this project, the researchers will endeavor to determine whether the fur trade decline had lasting impacts on the sea otter genome that can be observed in extant populations. The researchers will compare genomes of sea otters that lived before the fur trade to those living today across the entire geographic range. Native American rubbish deposits, known as middens, dating back to Pre-Columbian times will supply the prehistoric and historical samples.  The researchers will use cutting-edge gene sequencing technology to identify deleterious genes and predict their effect on individuals and populations. The results will inform future management plans for these populations and provide a new precedent for research on rare and endangered species. Researchers also will work with the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute to create exhibits demonstrating how genome sequencing can aid conservation efforts and provide new genomic insights into a charismatic species that has an essential role in maintaining coastal kelp forest ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will utilize low and high coverage genome sequencing of individuals from six modern and three ancient pre-bottlenecked sea otter populations to reconstruct demographic history and quantify patterns of deleterious variation as a proxy for genetic load. A novel analytical framework will be developed using genetic variation data across multiple time points to study the relationship between small population size and patterns of deleterious mutations. Using forward-in-time simulations, null expectations of how genetic drift should act on different genomic elements will be developed for comparison to the empirical genomic dataset, and the importance of natural selection in preserving and purging deleterious variation will be quantified. The roles of purifying, relaxed and balancing selection will be examined by testing for enrichment of deleterious variation across genic regions. This research will provide a framework for distinguishing between moderately and strongly deleterious mutations and for evaluating the effects of bottlenecks on natural selection at the molecular level that can be applicable to other systems. As a result of this research, a variety of recent demographic events in a species with a complex demographic history will be detected and quantified, patterns of deleterious mutations across multiple time points will be compared, and patterns of genetic load will be predicted. Finally, the ways in which purifying and balancing selection are affected by small population sizes will be evaluated. The replication of recent extreme demographic events across sea otter populations and the abundance of pre-fur trade otter samples in Pre-Columbian middens provide unprecedented opportunities to isolate the effects of a bottleneck on deleterious variation and genetic load. The results and methods developed in this study will be broadly applicable to understanding the biology of small populations, especially those that are endangered.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our research focused on using genomic analyses to infer the impacts of population decline in species of conservation concern and on making those techniques accessible to others who work on non-model organisms. We first focused on assessing different methods for inferring the history of populations from genetic data, then applying those methods to the sea otter, a species which has suffered severe population decline. We initially produced two papers aimed at making demographic inference from genomic data accessible and interpretable. The inference of historical population size changes, splits, and migrations is one of the primary goals of population genetics and gives profound insights into our own history and that of other species. However, there are numerous techniques based on different types of data which may yield inconsistent results and prove hard to interpret. In our first paper on this topic (Beichman, Phung and Lohmueller, 2017, <em>G3: </em><em>Genes|Genomes|Genetics</em>), we examined how well three commonly used demographic inference methods could predict empirical data, finding that a highly used method based on single whole genomes can result in misleading results. This finding was of great relevance to the conservation genetics community, as a single genome is often all that is available for demographic analysis. We then wrote a review paper (Beichman, Huerta-Sanchez, and Lohmueller, 2018, <em>Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics</em>) comparing multiple demographic inference techniques, specifically focused on how they can be applied to studies of non-model organisms which may have limited sample sizes or prior knowledge of population history. This resource expanded on workshop presentations that we developed for the La Kretz Conservation Genomics Workshops (2017, 2018). Finally, we used simulations to explore different models of genetic rescue of bottlenecked populations, finding that large populations may not be the best choice when moving new individuals into a declining population (Kyriazis, Wayne and Lohmueller, 2019, <em>bioRxiv</em>).</p> <p>Our ultimate goal was to apply these techniques to a system which could provide insights into how an extreme population decline can affect genetic diversity and fitness. Sea otters (<em>Enhydra lutris</em>) were hunted to the verge of extinction by fur traders in the 18<sup>th</sup>-19<sup>th</sup> centuries. Every population was either fully extirpated or went through an extreme and independent population bottleneck. We first sequenced and annotated the southern sea otter genome and explored the evolutionary history of the sea otter and its distant relative, the South American giant otter (<em>Pteronura brasiliensis</em>) (Beichman et al., 2019, <em>Molecular Biology and Evolution</em>). We found changes to both species&rsquo; genomes due to otters&rsquo; semi-aquatic lifestyle, including a loss of olfactory receptors. We also discovered that the sea otter has extremely low genetic diversity and elevated levels of putatively deleterious variation. This work resulted in many research presentations, including to an audience of over 2000 researchers at the Fitch Symposium at the <em>Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution</em> meeting in Manchester, UK (2019).

We found that sea otters in California are the last remnants of a highly diverged sea otter lineage and that the pre-fur trade genetic structure of sea otter populations has been preserved. We used the demographic methods we developed previously to detect a signal of extreme population decline in every sea otter population, likely caused by the fur trade bottleneck.
