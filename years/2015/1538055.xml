<AbstractNarration>This award supports establishing a mathematical framework for modeling, evaluating, approximating, and optimizing the performance of service systems featuring time-varying random as well as deterministic/scheduled input processes.  Two important example problem classes are (1) optimizing efficiency and utilization while improving patient satisfaction in healthcare facilities that treat both time-varying randomly-arriving patients (e.g., emergent or walk-in) as well as patients having scheduled appointments (e.g., primary-care-physician referrals, school-required physical exams, or scheduled vaccinations), and (2) optimizing efficiency and utilization while improving flexibility and responsiveness to global competition in manufacturing facilities that operate in both a time-varying stochastic (e.g., production) environment as well as a deterministic/scheduled (e.g., job-release schedule) environment.  The solution to a unified abstraction of both problem classes requires modeling and analysis methods that allow rich variations in model-input processes, and model logic, while adequately capturing the time-dependent evolution of the resulting probabilistic network. Traditional (exact) time-dependent differential-difference equation modeling of such networks is infeasible since the number of differential-difference equations describing even modest-sized networks can be of the order of hundreds of thousands (or more). Monte Carlo (MC) computer simulation, the natural alternative choice, is convenient but burdened with slow convergence rates and additional mathematically technical inefficiencies.   Methods investigated by the research team will assist healthcare (and other) service and manufacturing sector industries to increase their economic competitiveness and patient/customer, satisfaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will result in closure-equipped partial moment differential equations (PMDEs) for numerically approximating the time-dependent evolution of general stochastic networks having scheduled interventions. By exploiting the structure of PMDEs, and then strategically using closure approximations, the research team will be able to efficiently describe the time-dependent evolution of very general networks.  Preliminary evidence indicates that the time-dependent evolution of modest stochastic networks can be approximated to machine accuracy within a few seconds on a typical laptop computer.  Moreover, higher order derivatives, which often require significant effort in the Monte Carlo context, can be obtained with little to no extra effort by exploiting the rich structure inherent in the approximations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In NSF Project 1538055 we addressed the development of efficient and accurate algorithms, along with the supporting theory, to optimize time-based (and other) interventions within complex stochastic systems.  Our methods were based on developing new stochastic optimization methods appropriate for use in both numerical approximation methods (such as numerical integration of large sets of moment- and partial-moment differential-difference equations) as well as Monte Carlo sampling methods.  Our methods have been empirically demonstrated to be quite accurate as well as efficient.    We developed methods for 1) Continuous-Optimization in Simulation, and  2) Integer-Ordered-Optimization in Simulation.  We then demonstrated the practical utility of these methods on a realisitc Surgery Re-Scheduling model that we developed.  We also developed the mathematical framework and software for modeling, evaluating, approximating, and optimizing the performance of time-varying stochastic service systems having both deterministically scheduled as well as time-varying stochastic arrival processes. This work required further development of both time-varying queueing approximations as well as stochastic optimization methods.   Specifically we developed our methods for evaluating, approximating and optimizing the performance of these time-varying stochastic service systems with respect to the quality of service in four fold:  (1)   Deterministic Demand Scheduling: Schedule deterministic arrivals that optimize the performance of service system, where ?optimality? is defined in a well-defined rigorous way. We approximate and optimize the time-averaged expected virtual waiting time and calculate the higher order derivatives to attain higher-order optimality.   (2)   Staffing Decision under Demand Uncertainty: Regardless of the distribution of the demand, we developed staffing rules that react to the requested quality of service to determine the quality of the estimators of the unknown demand-process parameters, as well as making optimal staffing decisions. Theoretical results on the consistency and optimality of our method is illustrated using sequential statistics approaches.   (3)   Optimality of the above data-driven settings:  We developed a general framework that establishes optimality criterion under various distribution-free structural conditions:  Consider settings such as stochastic optimization where a smooth objective function f is unknown but can be estimated with an inexact oracle such as quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) or numerical quadrature. The inexact oracle is assumed to yield function estimates having error that decays with increasing oracle effort. For solving such problems, we present the Adaptive Sampling Gradient Method (ASGM) in two flavors depending on whether the step size used within ASGM is constant or determined through a backtracking line search. ASGM?s salient feature is the adaptive manner in which it constructs gradient estimates (henceforth called gradient approximates), by exerting just enough oracle effort at each iterate to keep the error in the gradient approximate within a constant factor of the norm of the gradient approximate. ASGM applies to both derivative-based and derivative-free contexts, and generates iterates that globally convergence to a first-order critical point. We also illustrate ASGM?s work complexity with respect to the gradient norm for common choices, e.g., QMC with finite-difference derivatives. We compare these complexities to those obtained from methods that use traditional random sampling.   (4)   Approximating Time-Varying Tractable Queueing Models:  In all the three folds above, approximating a time non-homogeneous ?tractable? queuing models was at the core of the optimality analysis, given the random, parameter-free input processes. Accordingly, we develop an efficient numerical approximation algorithm for the mean, variance and higher-order moments of the number of entities in the system at time t for the Ph(t) / Ph(t) / s / c queueing model. We also developed an approximation for the time-dependent virtual-waiting-time mean, variance and distribution function. Our approach is to partition the state space into known subspaces, develop the moment and partial-moment differential equations for each subspace and then develop closure approximations to approximate unknown probabilities appearing on the right-hand side of the moment and partial-moment differential equations via a two-moment matching algorithm. We describe the validation of the approximation and measure its accuracy. The efficiency of the approximation method is demonstrated through comparison with exact approach of solving Kolmogorov forward equations.
