<AbstractNarration>1550316&lt;br/&gt;Arias Chavez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Membrane fouling limits achieving energy efficiency of membrane technologies for water treatment. This results in economic, environmental, and energetic penalties on potentially new applications of membranes for resource reclamation. The PI has recently determined that polyamide morphology can vary significantly across membrane surfaces and that some regions can have a very low surface roughness. The proposed study will improve the scientific understanding of the relationship between thin-film composite membrane structure and performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An in-depth, localized evaluation of the low-roughness regions of these membranes is proposed to: (1) better understand and quantify the polyamide layer structure in these regions, and &lt;br/&gt;(2) demonstrate that high standards for membrane permeability and selectivity are maintained in these local regions. Electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and surface titration methods will be used to obtain additional quantitative information about the structure of the polyamide layer in low-roughness regions. New equipment for testing active layer membrane permeability and selectivity will be developed to allow membrane transport performance to be measured on the same scale (&lt; 1 cm2) as roughness characterization work. This work, if  successful, will demonstrates that low-roughness polyamide regions retain excellent permeability and selectivity, and will serve as a proof-of-concept for the development of a new line of membranes effective against foulants of all types rather than just one type of foulant. To increase outreach and diversity, the PI will partner with a local high school to involve the students in thinking about decentralized water treatment technologies. Some of these technologies will also be used to make environmental engineering compelling and understandable to middle-school-aged girls at the annual Engineering the Future outreach event held at the</AbstractNarration>

Highly selective membranes can be used to safely separate unconventional water sources so that drinking water can be obtained, but the energy cost for the separation can be high, particularly when membranes are exposed to foulants.  When these foulants build up on the surface of membranes, they reduce water flux through the membrane, forcing operators to increase energy inputs in order to maintain production rates.  Foulants can also reduce membrane selectivity and integrity in certain cases.  Preventing membrane fouling, then, is critically important for achieving water security at low energy cost.     The membranes used in reverse osmosis, one of most selective membrane processes, are particularly susceptible to fouling.  One reason for this is that their polyamide selective layers are very rough on a microscopic scale, with irregular, densely-packed nodules and peaks emerging from their surfaces at heights of 100 - 1000 nm.  As foulant-laden feed water sweeps over the surface of a membrane, foulants can easily become trapped in these raised features, causing membrane performance to decline.  If we could make a membrane that was just as permeable and selective as a conventional reverse osmosis membrane, but with a smooth surface instead of a rough one, we would make great progress in preventing membrane fouling and advancing our water and energy sustainability as a society.  However, the conventional understanding is that a membrane selective enough for desalinating seawater is intrinsically rough; if a membrane isn't rough, then it isn't selective.      Our work closely examined the surfaces of seawater desalination membranes, both ones fabricated in our lab and those made commercially, to determine if membranes truly had to be rough to be selective.  We found that high quality membranes have highly variable surfaces, with some areas having 'typical' rough polyamide, and other areas, with lower frequency, having very smooth polyamide that might have significantly better resistance to fouling.
