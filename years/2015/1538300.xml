<AbstractNarration>For many dynamic systems, optimal periodic operation provides superior performance to the best possible constant input.  For example, compared to stationary flight, airborne wind energy systems can achieve higher apparent wind speed -- and generate significantly more electricity -- by flying in circular or figure-8 orbits.  However these results may be sensitive to uncertainty.  For example, the performance of a periodic energy harvesting trajectory designed for a particular flight condition may degrade rapidly when wind speed changes.  Thus the overarching goal of this project is to enable dynamic controllers that rapidly adjust their periodic operation, in order to continue to provide near-optimal performance despite changing conditions.  The application to airborne wind energy systems, which can access wind streams with reliably high speeds and moderate air density, generate electricity more efficiently and more reliably than stationary systems, thus benefiting society through lower power costs and improved energy security.  Moreover, the fundamental tools to be created in this project will be applicable to many other important problems, including recurrent drug-delivery scheduling for chronic disease treatment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing results on periodic optimal control focus on offline optimization.  Very little is known about the following fundamental challenges: (i) adaptation to unknown plant dynamics, (ii) achievement of periodic optimality in a robust and stable manner, and (iii) simultaneous optimization of both the time period and shape of the periodic trajectory.  This project addresses these challenges, thereby furnishing a novel framework for robust online periodic control. Two distinct approaches will be pursued for online optimization of periodic control trajectories in the presence of parametric uncertainties, namely a novel implementation of extremum-seeking methods, and an indirect adaptive control algorithm.  The closed-loop system stability will be analyzed using Floquet theory.  Performance will be evaluated in simulations of a benchmark drug delivery problem and an energy-harvesting flight problem.  Finally, effectiveness for control of energy harvesting flight will be validated experimentally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was motivated by the degree to which the periodic operation of a diverse class of dynamic systems, known in the scientific literature as "proper systems", is superior to steady-state operation.  When harvesting wind energy using an airborne turbine, for instance, one can generate significantly higher amounts of power (on average) through periodic crosswind flight compared to steady-state flight.  Similarly, the treatment of a chronic disease in the presence of drug resistance can potentially be more effective if the drug is administered intermittently/periodically, as opposed to constant-rate administration.  Prior to the project, an extensive literature existed on periodic optimal control.  However, a fundamental need still existed for examining self-adjusting periodic optimal controllers, ones that can adapt to uncertainties in the underlying system dynamics.  The overarching goals of this project were: (i) to address this need by developing a fundamental framework for the self-adjusting periodic optimal control of proper systems, and (ii) to apply this framework to a diverse set of control design problems.      The intellectual merit of this project stems from four main contributions to the literature.  First, the project utilized periodic optimal control theory to compare the merits of periodic flapping flight versus helicopter-like steady rotary flight for an insect-sized robotic system.  Conditions for the relative merit of periodic flight were examined rigorously through this mathematical framework, helping shed more light on earlier comparisons in the literature.  Second, the project utilized optimal control theory to gain insight into the structure of the solution to the problem of optimally treating a chronic disease in the presence of drug resistance.  The optimal treatment protocol was found to have a bang-singular-bang structure, meaning that it consisted of repeated cycles of (i) aggressive drug administration, (ii) gradual reduction in drug administration, and (iii) no drug administration.  Third, the project developed a novel online periodic optimal control algorithm that combines ideas from the extremum-seeking and least squares estimation literatures.  Fourth, the project developed a second set of novel online periodic optimal control algorithms, based on the self-tuning control literature, and used Floquet theory to analyze the stability of these controllers.      The broader impact of this project stemmed from three main facts.  First, the project highlighted the versatility of periodic optimal control theory by applying it to a broad range of practical application problems.  This included applications from the robotic flapping flight, energy-harvesting flight, and drug delivery literatures. Second, the project’s contributions to the specific domain of energy-harvesting flight demonstrated, both in simulation and experimentally, the potential of periodic flight to improve the average power output of such systems.  This contribution is particularly important given society’s growing interest in tethered energy harvesting systems, including both wind and marine hydrokinetic systems, for offshore energy harvesting.  Finally, the project provided training to a diverse team of three graduate students plus a number of undergraduate researchers mentored by these graduate students.  Two of these graduate students’ doctoral thesis, plus the third student’s Master of science thesis, were directly supported by this project.
