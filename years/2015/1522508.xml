<AbstractNarration>Funds will support the construction of a new research greenhouse at Blandy Experimental Farm, an environmental sciences field station in the northern Shenandoah Valley operated by the University of Virginia (http://blandy.virginia.edu/).  Blandy supports a broad range of research in the environmental sciences, but research on plant genetics and plant ecology are particular strengths.  The Blandy faculty anticipates that strength in these areas is sustainable and that student training in this area will continue to grow.  Blandy's existing greenhouse is over 70 years old and has become structurally compromised.  Because it was originally built within the Orland E. White Arboretum, it is now surrounded by trees that greatly reduce sunlight into the greenhouse.  Its inefficient design does not allow much flexibility for expansion.  This proposal represents the first phase of the replacement.  The proposed greenhouse would include two 510 square-foot bays that would provide a total of 612 square feet of bench space.  The floors of the proposed building would be concrete to help minimize pest and disease problems.  The new greenhouse would have improved temperature and environmental control systems, including a propane heating system, a simple ventilation and exhaust system, and a retractable shade system.  The new greenhouse will provide substantially better support for Blandy researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate and graduate training is central to Blandy's mission, and a research greenhouse is an essential resource for both of these programs.  Past graduate students at Blandy have continued on to productive careers in science that range from K-12 science education to faculty positions at universities.  The undergraduate research program at Blandy has been highly successful in training students, most of whom have gone on to highly regarded graduate programs in ecology.  These students include many talented young men and women from underrepresented groups who have now gone on to higher degrees in science.  Blandy Experimental Farm is also home to the State Arboretum of Virginia and has thriving K-12 and other public programs, all with an environmental science focus.  These programs build from the expertise and discoveries created in Blandy's research program.  For example, all Blandy undergraduate researchers spend a morning presenting some aspect of their research to children attending a summer nature camp at Blandy.  The relationships that have developed in the K-12 program have made it relatively easy to identify and recruit local teachers into NSF-supported programs for teacher training, and most of these teachers have required greenhouse space for their projects.  Blandy has also frequently served as a source for research experience for high school students, and almost all of these students have worked on projects in the greenhouse.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the construction of two new 510 square-foot greenhouse bays at Blandy Experimental Farm.  Blandy is an Environmental Science Field Station operated by the University of Virginia and is located in the northern Shenandoah Valley in Clarke County.  In the summer, Blandy is home to 30-35 researchers from the University of Virginia and faculty and students from institutions around the country.  The greenhouse will serve the research program at Blandy and replaces a 75-year old greenhouse than had become structurally unsound.  Undergraduate and graduate student training is at Blandy's core mission, and Blandy has served as an NSF-funded "Research Experience for Undergraduates" site almost continuously since 1986.  Undergraduate researchers from all over the country spend 11-weeks of the summer conducting independent research at Blandy, and over the past 20 years a third of them have required greenhouse space for their projects.  An even higher percentage (45%) of the graduate students (also from institutions around the country)require greenhouse space as well as the majority of the faculty.  Each greenhouse bay is outfitted with 309 square feet of bench space.  Nine high pressure sodium vapor lights enable researchers to extend the photoperiod if necessary (e..g., to encourage flowering).  Each bay is climate controlled with a computerized system.  Roof and side vents, exhaust fans, and a retractable shade system cool the rooms, and heat is provided with propane furnaces.The two greenhouse bays are connected by an external corridor.  The construction supported by this grant was the first phase of the construction of a greenhouse complex.  The second phase (using local funds) saw the construction of two additional bays and a headhouse for potting storage, etc.  The headhouse contains a sink, water heater, a large stainless steel table, and two larege shelving units.  The two phases combined to increase the available growing space by 70%, and the superior climate control will allow for excellent year-round growing conditions.  The headhouse can handle all the work that doesn't need to happen in the growing areas and greatly increases space and efficiency.  All construction was completed in time to serve the summer 2017 research season.  Four undergraduates, four graduate students, a postdoc, and four faculty used greenhouse space this summer.  Given Blandy's academic strength in plant ecology and especially plant-insect interactions, we expect demand for space to remain high.  The new greenhouse should provide excellent support for decades to come, and the connecting corridor can accommodate another four bays as research demand grows in the future.  Blandy is home to the State Arboretum of Virginia, and over 170,000 visitors visit each year.  The greenhouse is located at a prominant part of the property and is interpreted in information panels at our visitor kiosk.  The research program supported by the greenhouse is an important resource for K-12 and other public programs at Blandy, which serve to bring science to a more general audience.
