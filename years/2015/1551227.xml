<AbstractNarration>The National Academy of Sciences proposes a consensus study to (1) examine patterns of enrollment in undergraduate computer science and computer engineering (CS/CE/Information) courses, including possible drivers of recent and potential future changes in enrollment; and (2) identify current and new strategies for responding to recent and possible future changes in these enrollment levels while maintaining or enhancing educational quality and the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in these fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific Issues that will be considered in this intensive study include the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Current and projected patterns of enrollment in undergraduate courses in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Information (within undergraduate Information Schools), including an analysis of the factors that have driven recent growth and may drive future growth.  Data will be disaggregated by type of 4-year institution (e.g. top 50, R-1). The study will include an analysis of enrollment patterns among CS/CE/Information majors and minors and STEM and non-STEM majors taking service courses offered by CS/CE/Information departments or enrolling in CS/CE/Information courses on an elective basis.  A primary goal of this effort is to determine whether the recent increases in enrollment are similar to other cyclic fluctuations that have occurred in the past or whether they are more likely to be sustained.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Strategies that various institutions are using to respond most effectively to enrollment growth while maintaining or enhancing course access as well as the quality of instruction, considered by type of college or university. The study will examine the impacts those strategies are having on CS/CE/Information departments in terms of, for example, faculty and graduate student hiring and workload (including non-CS faculty), student retention, and support for the needs of different categories of students (such as non-CS majors, CS minors, STEM majors, and non-STEM majors).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- The impact of enrollment growth on efforts to increase the enrollment of women and under-represented minorities in CS/CE/Information courses and degree programs, as well as strategies for retaining those students in the CS/CE/Information field and encouraging their pathways toward graduate degrees and careers in related fields in the context of growing enrollments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A study committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a final consensus report, Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments, in early 2018.  This study was convened to provide a better understanding of the current and future trends in computing enrollments at undergraduate institutions, and the study examined drivers of the current enrollment surge, relationships between the surge and current and potential gains in diversity in the field, and the potential impacts of institutional responses to the increased demand for computer courses and programs. The report identifies strategies and actions for universities (departments, schools, and programs), policymakers, and other organizations to take in response to the enrollment boom, with an eye toward supporting CS programs and ecosystems, diversity in CS, and the future health of the discipline.  The report also emphasizes the increasing importance of CS across academic disciplines and occupational fields, and identifies a need to provide the relevant CS and computing skills training to students and workers in all disciplines as part of institutional and national responses to the CS enrollment boom.   The report is intended for use as an information resource for faculty, university leaders, and policymakers to help inform decisions about how best to respond to increasing CS enrollments and plan for the future of undergraduate CS education and future student success in this important field of study.
