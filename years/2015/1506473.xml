<AbstractNarration>Abstract title: An integrated photonic device in diamond to generate quantum entanglement, a computational resource for quantum information processing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnial description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to demonstrate a quantum device that is an essential building block in a quantum computing network. The device will generate entanglement, a computational resource, between two electron spins in diamond. The main challenge for generating entanglement between spins is performing the operation quickly compared to the entanglement lifetime. Prior experiments in diamond which utilized free-space optical components realized generation rates in the 10-100 millihertz regime.  Here we seek to utilize integrated photonics to realize kilohertz rates. The materials platform contains an optical waveguiding layer built in the semiconductor gallium phosphide. This waveguiding layer connects quantum nodes composed of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. A third detetor layer,  made from the superconducting material niobium nitride, is used to detect the photons emitted from the nitrogen-vacancy centers.  Kilohertz entanglement rates in a scalable platform will enable the realization of large quantum networks. These networks can be utilized to solve computational problems which cannot be solved on a classical computer. Graduate and undergraduates involved in the research will be trained in the design, fabrication, and testing of cutting edge photonic and quantum device technologies. Additionally, a mobile, hands-on demonstration table, which presents fundamental concepts of materials science through diamond-based activities, will be developed and employed at the University of Washington and Seattle-wide science outreach events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic-like solid-state defects are attractive candidates for scalable quantum information processing due to the potential to integrate these defects into devices. However, the challenges associated with tuning the individual quantum properties of these defects, as well as the difficulty in controlling interactions between defects, has thus far prohibited the realization of a scalable defect-based quantum network.  This works seeks to demonstrate a quantum device, an on-chip entanglement generation unit, that is expected to serve as an essential building block for such a network. A novel, hybrid photonic structure will be utilized that integrates gallium phosphide as an optical device layer with a diamond substrate which hosts the nitrogen-vacancy quantum information nodes. The device utilizes photon interference to generate entanglement, which requires control of the optical properties of individual nitrogen-vacancy centers. This control is provided by integrated electrodes compatible with the gallium phosphide layer. The gallium phosphide device layer enables efficient collection and routing of nitrogen-vacancy photons to waveguide-integrated superconducting detectors to achieve kilohertz electron entanglement rates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The major goal of the project was to realize on-chip quantum entanglement between two nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond in an integrated photonics circuit. In the 3-year program period, the project made critical steps toward this goal. Generating entanglement between two quantum bits (qubits) on an integrated photonics chip is motivated by the need to create quantum entanglement at a rate high enough to realize scalable quantum networks. When the distance between nodes is large, a quantum network provides the infrastructure for the broader impact of secure communication.  When the distance is small (e.g. the entire network is on a chip), then the network can be utilized for the broader impact of universal quantum computing. Quantum computing can theoretically solve classes of problems that are not currently tractable on classical supercomputers.    Intellectual Merit: Two major challenges exist when utilizing light-emitting quantum defects as quantum nodes in a network. First, it is very difficult to collect and route single photons emitted from the defect. This motivates an integrated photonics approach.  Using the gallium-phosphide on diamond platform, we demonstrated efficient on-chip collection and routing of photons emitted from single quantum emitters [1,2].  The second challenge is to preserve the quantum characteristics of the quantum defect once it is integrated in the chip. We next demonstrated that by integrating electrodes into our photonic circuit we could improve the spectral properties of the quantum defect [3]. Further improvement is still needed, however, to enable efficient entanglement generation. Broader Impacts: In addition to the technological broader impacts described above, this project trained 1 postdoctoral associate, 2 graduate students, and 6 undergraduates.  The postdoctoral associate and 1 graduate student are now at start-ups in the area of integrated photonics. 3 of the 6 undergraduates are pursuing graduate study in the area of quantum information. The PI additionally is the founder and faculty lead of an afterschool program, the UW Science Explorers, at a Title I Seattle public elementary school. The Explorers perform quarterly units in science and engineering with lesson plans publicly available on their website.    1. Gould, M., Chakravarthi, S., Christen, I.
