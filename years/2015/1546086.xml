<AbstractNarration>Introducing parallelism early into undergraduate education is very important to broader society goals to create knowledgeable workforce. This proposal is seeking support for a meeting to gather community input to inform further efforts for the ongoing initiative of developing and implementing of Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) undergraduate curricula nationally and internationally.&lt;br/&gt;Meeting attendees include domain experts, educators, and representatives from government and industry. The discussion is focused around needs of undergraduate curricula, both in introductory and upper level courses, given changes in the parallel and distributed computing landscape, as well as the challenges and opportunities for broadening adoption and participation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  The goal of this project was to hold a workshop to review the Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) undergraduate curriculum guideline developed by the Center for Parallel and Distributed Computing Curriculum Development and Educational Resources (CDER) in 2012.   The workshop was held August 17-18, 2015, with 36 attendees representing a diverse constituency, including large and small academic institutions (several serving underrepresented groups), three government agencies, and three major companies.   A report was written that is publicly available on the CDER website.   Recommendations from the Workshop  Parallel and distributed computing is the new foundation for nearly all of computer science. Many aspects of current curricula in the United States are stuck in the sequential model of computing that dominated the 20th century.  As part of the renewed emphasis on computer science education in this country, we must develop a workforce prepared to use the computational tools of the 21st century. Thus, investment should be made in PDC professional development, adoption incentives, enabling resources, and curriculum updates.   Broadening Participation  A key challenge is educating the educators. That involves the provision of training opportunities and resources. One model would be to offer summer training seminars that support attendees. Another is to co-locate training with major conferences and support travel costs.   Another key challenge is providing incentives for departments to adopt curriculum changes. The  original CDER grant provided small awards (about $2500) to faculty members, which, coupled with coordinated equipment donations, had a significant effect. But for many schools the amount would need to be somewhat larger. Travel grants to enable early adopters to attend workshops associated with major conferences will also help build a community of educators, which is an important aspect of professional development.    Access to PDC hardware and software is another enabler of broader adoption of the curriculum. The CDER center has a cluster for PDC educational use that is freely available, and could serve as a testbed for developing a model platform. But NSF should consider supporting a set of educational centers to complement the investment in research centers. Such centers will need to provide a different level and model of service that should be defined by the potential users.   Partnerships between industry, large schools, smaller schools, and high performance computing users are a potentially fruitful, high leverage investments for both broadening participation and developing novel approaches to curriculum.   There is also a need to update the curriculum guideline in a manner that would include more implementation examples, and a few specific models of which topics can go where in various courses.   Expanding PDC in the upper division, building from early coverage  There is great potential for more meaningful work in upper level courses if students have already worked with PDC in the first two years. However, developing new approaches depends on early adopters working with those who teach upper level classes to run pilot classes. Those classes could then become models for others to adopt.  Again, it would be helpful to have a program of small grants to provide incentives for experimental curriculum and course development, along with support for the grant recipients to attend workshops to present their work.   The PDC curriculum guideline could be extended to include recommendations for upper level coverage. However, upper level courses are much more diverse so it would be best to develop a menu of topics, where each has examples of how different Bloom levels could be achieved. While initial guideline could help focus pilot course efforts, it should have a multi-year evolutionary process that uses the results of pilot efforts to guide ongoing revision.  Another effort would involve assembling and documenting data sets and code modules to serve as a repository of resources for use in courses. If these could also be hosted on public educational clusters, they would be more directly usable.   PDC Curriculum Guideline Revision  The curriculum guideline is now five years old, and should be revised before the next ACM curriculum revision takes place. Its revision should involve a more diverse set of contributors, and should especially seek to include experts in data-centric and distributed computing.   A revised curriculum should more explicitly define the assumed courses and be expanded to include at least operating systems among the covered courses. It should also provide more implementation guidance in the form of curriculum frameworks and specific examples of where and how the topics can be covered. Some of the guidance can come from the experience of early adopters. Creating a dependence graph for the topics would also be helpful. The algorithms section of the guideline should have a more extensive revision to both address concerns about the focus on computation as the cost metric, and to make the list of topics more tractable through a combination of reorganization and moving some coverage to other areas.
