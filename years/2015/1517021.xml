<AbstractNarration>Supernova events, the explosion of stars, play an essential role in the Universe. These events are incredibly bright, but rare, seen only once every 100 years in our galaxy. Because these events create all the elements important for formation of life, planets and the next generations of stars, the investigator plans to study the material ejected (Supernova Remnants or SNRs) after the explosions, which may be studied many thousands of years after the explosions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will combine available radio, infrared, optical, x-ray and gamma-ray data to produce an consistent survey of the 371 known SNRs in our galaxy. The investigator and her team will employ a quantitative approach which is critical to compare these complex sources and to maximize the scientific utility of the data. The project is the first large-scale effort to analyze these observations in a systematic way, using mathematical tools and hydrodynamic simulations developed by the authors. This research will provide crucial insights regarding the nature of Supernova explosions, the chemical enrichment of galaxies, and the complex interaction between Supernova ejecta and the gas and magnetic fields in our galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will expand the existing Ohio State physics department Masters-to-PhD bridge program to include the astronomy department. The goal of this program is to improve diversity and inclusion in PhD programs, and expanding this initiative to the astronomy department will enable under-represented minorities students to gain research experience and mentorship in astronomy. Her team will network and recruit students from minority-serving institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project addressed fundamental outstanding issues in supernova explosions (SN) through the first systematic study of available observations from all nearby supernova remnants (SNRs; objects from explosions that occurred hundreds to tens of thousands of years ago). We aimed to ascertain the explosion types of the known SNRs in the Milky Way, Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, using their morphologies, their spectral properties, and their environments. Furthermore, we explored the role of explosion versus environment in shaping SNRs through several means, including exploring how neutron star kick velocities are related to ejecta asymmetries and characterizing the evolution of SNR morphology with age. This work made use of the excellent archival data available now for a large sample of SNRs and will capitalize on the substantial past investment to study individual objects in detail. Our systematic approach maximized the scientific utility of these data and enables the use of SNRs as tests of SN explosion and evolution models.  The project led to several impactful results included in four refereed publications:  1)    We found that neutron stars are preferentially moving away from the direction that the bulk of supernova ejecta is traveling in Galactic SNRs. This result implies that neutron stars are kicked by ejecta asymmetries in the explosions. This result was published in the Astrophysical Journal, and the paper was led by an Ohio State graduate student.  2)    We found that based on the stars near the sites of SNRs in the Small Magellanic Cloud, almost all originate from core-collapse explosions of massive stars. We measured the mass of the progenitor stars that exploded and showed that many arose from massive stars &gt;25x the mass of the Sun. This result has been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal, and the paper was led by a Ohio State postdoctoral researcher.  3)    We found that SNR asymmetries increase with age, based on our measurements on the morphologies of many dozens of SNRs at radio wavelengths.This result is consistent with predictions from recent computer simulations showing SNRs expanding into an inhomogeneous, turbulent medium. These results have been submitted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal, and the paper was led by an Ohio State undergraduate student.  4)    We found that metals (e.g., oxygen, silicon, iron) have unique spatial distributions in SNRs. Specifically, the oxygen is distributed more symmetrically than the iron. This result is consistent with predictions from recent computer models of supernova explosions, showing elements synthesized deeper in the exploding star are ejected more asymmetrically. This result is being prepared for publication in the Astrophysical Journal, and the paper is being led by an Ohio State graduate student.  All of these results have been presented at roughly two dozen scientific conferences and seminars/colloquia.  The students and postdoctoral researcher who led the publications described above are from groups that are under-represented in astronomy/astrophysics: a Black PhD student, a Native American woman undergraduate, and a white woman postdoctoral researcher.   In addition, throughout this award, the PI led the organization of the Ohio State astronomy department?s Diversity Journal Club, where issues pertaining to inclusion and culture were discussed by 30-40 participants on a monthly basis.
