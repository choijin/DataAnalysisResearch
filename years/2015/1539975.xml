<AbstractNarration>The project will add an I/UCRC site at Virginia Tech, as a new member of Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS). C-UAS is currently the only NSF-sponsored unmanned aircraft research center. It was established in 2012, with BYU as the lead institution and UC-Boulder as a member. VT faculty will share responsibility for managing research projects with BYU and CU. The participating members of the VT site will also collaborate with members of the current sites to ensure technical success and to foster multi-corporate relationships among industry partners.  The Site will focus on the following application areas:  agriculture (e.g., methods to monitor plant pathogen transport), civil infrastructure (e.g., bridge inspection), and geographic information systems. It will make an impact on society by developing: (1) pre-competitive research products and intellectual property that will advance UAS technology for commerce and security, (2) curriculum enhancements to support the special technical training needs of students pursuing engineering careers in the UAS domain, and (3) a diverse, strongly connected human network of forward-thinking, technically excellent professionals who will invent the future for the UAS commercial sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Tech faculty will make contributions in the broad areas of (1) advanced flight control (e.g., methods to construct robust, secure, and mathematically certified control algorithms), (2) airworthiness, cybersecurity, and reliability (e.g., reliability prediction methods that incorporate imprecise uncertainties intrinsic to small UAS); (3) machine vision and machine learning (e.g., software for real-time, on-board intelligent image processing), (4) multiphysics design optimization (e.g., aircraft design optimization tools that incorporate unsteady fluid/structure interaction), and , and (5) wireless communication (e.g., the use of software defined radio and intelligent communication protocols that adapt the information flow to the environmental conditions).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) is an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC). Added during the third year of the center?s operation, the Virginia Tech site has supported the center?s mission to provide innovative solutions to key technical challenges and superb training for future leaders in the unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) industry. With financial support and strategic guidance from five inaugural industry and government member organizations, the Virginia Tech site has grown in its ability to produce scholarship and technology advancements that directly support the UAS industry and to provide student researchers with relevant, world-class training. Industry-selected research efforts during Virginia Tech?s three year Phase I period include (i) the use of artificial intelligence to help teams of air and ground robots collectively plan their movements, (ii) the use of computer vision methods to help unmanned aircraft detect and track other aircraft that may pose a hazard, (iii) UAS flight control systems that can defeat cyberattacks, (iv) formal strategies to ensure that autonomous robotic systems always behave as intended, and (v) sensing and planning methods to help aerial robots inspect infrastructure such as bridges. Outcomes from the Virginia Tech site?s three year Phase I period include the publication of nearly a dozen peer-reviewed conference and journal papers, &nbsp;the degree completion of three Masters and three doctoral students, and a dozen knowledge exchanges with the center?s full complement of industry and government members through the semi-annual Industry Advisory Board (IAB) meetings and off-quarter briefings.
