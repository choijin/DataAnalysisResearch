<AbstractNarration>With support from this award, the Southwest Center for Arithmetic Geometry will continue its series of annual "Winter Schools" in 2016, 2017, 2018, with the 2016 Arizona Winter School taking place March 11-16, 2016 at the University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ.   Since its founding in 1997, the primary activity of the Southwest Center is the Arizona Winter School (AWS), an annual meeting which has become a prominent national event and provides high-level training and research experience for graduate students in arithmetic geometry and related areas. The AWS is an intensive five-day meeting, organized around a different central topic each year, that features a set of courses and accompanying research projects carefully designed and delivered by leading and emerging experts. At the Winter School, connections among peers are formed, and mentoring relationships between students and senior researchers are developed. As has been the case at previous Winter Schools, subsequent collaborations between participants at all levels are the norm. Students make concrete strides toward becoming research mathematicians, post-doctoral assistants gain valuable mentoring experience in their academic careers, and faculty develop new interests and see new connections that lead to important published results. The Southwest Center website shares reusable content from the Winter Schools, including lecture notes, project descriptions, and audio and video of lectures. Through these thorough records, the dialogues begun at the AWS are extended to the greater community, and the efforts of the AWS participants are made freely and indefinitely available to all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AWS is a unique fusion of traditional mathematics conference and intensive research workshop: the speakers organize courses of four lectures, provide lecture notes in advance, and propose research projects for graduate students to work on during the meeting. Nightly working sessions on these projects and on separate problem sets are run by the speakers and postdoctoral fellows. On the last day, students present their findings to the participants of the meeting. The result is a particularly intense and focused five days of mathematical activity for everyone involved.  Recent Winter School topics have included "Modular forms and modular curves",  "Arithmetic statistics", and "Arithmetic and higher dimensional varieties." The topics of upcoming Winter Schools will be guided by future mathematical developments.  More information about the upcoming and past Arizona Winter School programs can be found at the Southwest Center's website: &lt;br/&gt;http://swc.math.arizona.edu/</AbstractNarration>

Since the first Winter School in 1998, the AWS had developed a significant reputation around the world as a highly successful, model school in graduate mathematics education. The NSF award was the primary source of support for the 2016-&shy;2018 meetings and provided supplemental support for AWS 2019.   Arithmetic geometry lies at the interface between the fields of number theory and algebraic geometry. At its core, it studies arithmetic questions, such as the finding of integral solutions to Diophantine equations, from a modern geometric perspective. In practice, it is a field of vast scope that utilizes and informs theory from much of modern mathematics.  Each Winter School is held on a topic of special interest to researchers in the field of arithmetic geometry, with lecture series given by four distinguished speakers on a particular topic related to their research. The topics of the schools supported by the award were:   AWS 2016: Analytic Methods in Arithmetic Geometry AWS 2017: Perfectoid Spaces AWS 2018: Iwasawa Theory (AWS 2019: Topology and Arithmetic)   The speakers prepare lecture notes prior to the school, which are posted online. Videos of the lectures are also posted online shortly after the talks. In evening working sessions, the speakers and a project assistant supervise smaller groups of Ph.D. students on research projects created prior to the school, and the students present their results on the last day of the school.
