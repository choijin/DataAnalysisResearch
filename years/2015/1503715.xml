<AbstractNarration>The theme of the 2015 Radiation and Climate GRC is Towards Understanding the Interactions between Radiation, Clouds, Aerosol, Precipitation and Climate. The GRC will be held July 26-31, 2015 and will be preceded by the third Graduate Research Seminar on July 25-26, 2015.  Together, these meetings will focus upon outstanding issues in aerosol, cloud, precipitation and radiation interactions from cloud to planetary scales. The GRC is novel in that it explicitly focuses on providing ample opportunities for graduate students,  postdoctoral researchers and other early career scientists to interact with more senior researchers throughout each day of the conference.</AbstractNarration>
