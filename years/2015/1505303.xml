<AbstractNarration>Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support for junior faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who need to re-direct and re-build a research program.  It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the researcher's home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interest in supersonic cavity flow research is growing with the advancement of technology to design long range and sustained supersonic transport and business jets.  Tuskegee University's HBCU-UP RIA will establish an advanced teaching-research infrastructure in a much needed area of teaching and research - computational modeling and simulation.  The proposed research utilizes direct numerical simulation based on a numerical scheme of high accuracy and efficiency to investigate the shock/turbulent mixing layer interaction and various flow features of a supersonic cavity and has applicability to supersonic civil transport and military aircraft.  Data obtained from the developed code will be utilized to perform aero-acoustic analysis, thereby, predicting flow oscillations and corresponding sound pressure levels with maximum accuracy.  The proposed numerical model has the potential to considerably reduce the high costs associated with supersonic experimental testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research material produced will be directly integrated into new and existing courses and classes for undergraduate students from predominately underrepresented minority populations and for faculty development. In addition to developing the the principal investigator's research portfolio, the project contributes to a competitive, well-trained, diverse national workforce for high technology industries, national labs and academic institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves collaborations with researchers at the Ohio State University, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Langley Research Center)and the Alabama Supercomputer Authority.  The development of research capabilities in the area of computational modeling of fluid dynamics problems and high-performance computing assists Tuskegee University faculty in conducting leading-edge research and provides the opportunity to share these outcomes with the scientific community through publications.  The institution is both a minority-serving and an Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) institution.  Thus, the project expands the capability and capacity for research competitiveness in a specialized engineering field in this EPSCoR-designated jurisdiction.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research activity has been devoted towards accurately simulating the shock/boundary layer interaction phenomenon for high-speed cavity flow. Numerical simulation of high-speed cavity flow becomes challenging due to presence of complex flow field within the cavity along with the propagation of aero-acoustic waves that emanate from the cavity opening and have significantly smaller order of magnitude as compared to the scales of turbulence. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) based on an improved higher order numerical scheme is capable of accurately capturing high-frequency oscillations and predicts the actual physics of the complex cavity flow field. In case of high-speed flow regimes, it becomes further challenging to accurately simulate and predict the actual physics of the cavity flow field. In present research work, DNS utilizing a modified high-resolution numerical scheme of high-order accuracy and efficiency has been performed to study the shock/boundary layer interaction for high-speed cavity flow. It has provided the actual flow field details that are not possible with other numerical schemes or experimental efforts. Moreover, the modified numerical scheme has provided more accurate results for high-speed flow field with less number of grid points as compared to other numerical schemes such as central differencing and TVD schemes. Subsequently, the numerical simulations have provided very useful data to predict acoustic resonance and accompanying sound levels, generated due to the highly unsteady and complex nature of the cavity flow field, with maximum accuracy. In fact, the results of sound pressure level analysis have been found in good agreement with the experimental data available in the literature. Furthermore, this research activity helps develop state-of-the-art research capabilities in area of computational modeling and simulation and high-performance computing at Tuskegee University. It has provided a platform to faculty member and students to conduct advanced research and added to the global knowledge of the role the DNS may play to understand complex shock/boundary layer interaction for high-speed cavity flows. In addition, a well-trained diverse workforce of underrepresented minority students has been prepared to work in the competitive high-tech industry and academia. Subsequently, the data generated from the research have contributed to the worldwide research and development activities related to complex and unsteady high-speed cavity flow through peer-reviewed publications and presentations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/02/2020<br>      Modified by: Ovais&nbsp;Khan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div
