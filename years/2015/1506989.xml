<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the research supported in this project is to gain a fundamental understanding of the connection between the atomic and molecular structure and composition of surfaces and interfaces, and the chemical properties and reactivity of these interfaces.  A large number of important technologies, ranging from the use of catalysis in the production of chemicals and fuels, to the processing of electronic components, to the prevention of corrosion and structural deterioration, depend on an understanding of the structure and reactivity of surfaces and interfaces.  Four particular research topics are contained in this project.  The first explores the detailed molecular dynamics of catalytic oxidation reactions important in pollution control and chemical production.  The second is concerned with mechanisms of surface oxidation and corrosion of structural metals and strategies for its prevention.  The third explores the microscopic mechanism of the process of self-assembly at surfaces, relevant to the production of next generation electronic devices and the understanding of bio-films and membranes.  The fourth topic seeks to develop methods for the detailed analysis of the complex surfaces and interfaces that are the subject of this research project.  Each of these research topics serves to train students in research methods while providing the fundamental knowledge to support a wide array of technologies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project focuses on the connection between the detailed atomic, molecular, and electronic structure of surfaces and interfaces, and their chemical properties and reactivity.  These fundamental questions of surface structure and reactivity are addressed in four interrelated areas.  Studies of catalytic oxidation focus on the implementation of nanoplasmonic sensors to evaluate the coverage and presence of intermediates on the catalyst surface during heterogeneous catalytic oxidation reactions.  Mechanistic information obtained from these measurements will be coupled with product internal state distribution information obtained by diode laser absorption spectroscopy, to provide a more complete picture of the catalytic oxidation reaction dynamics. The second area addresses structural alloy oxidation in extreme environments, and synergistic effects in mixed molecular corrosion inhibitors, using photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis of the surfaces.  The third area concerns the mechanisms of self-assembly of large organic molecules at the liquid-solid interface, with a focus on the synthesis of fundamentally interesting chemisorbed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), and the quantitative evaluation of the energetics of formation of physisorbed SAMs on graphite.  Work in the fourth area develops methods to use both static and dynamic differential charging in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to enable the chemical and electronic property analysis of complex composite surface materials that are the focus of the previous research topics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[        The research supported by this award, "Structure and   Dynamics in Heterogeneous Reactions", examined the detailed chemistry of   reactions occurring at solid surfaces.  Six areas were examined over the   course of the award period.  They were 1) self-assembly of molecules at   surfaces, 2) development of plasmonic sensor approaches to monitor   heterogeneous catalytic reactions, 3) study of the internal state   distribution of the products of catalytic oxidation reactions, 4) oxidation   of reactive metals and the interaction of water and oxygen with complex oxide   surfaces, 5) mechanisms of action of organic molecule corrosion inhibitors,   and 6) development of differential charging methods in XPS analysis of   surfaces.  In each of these areas, specific project outcomes are   reported here.  In the area of self-assembly, we were able to examine   the relationship between the structures of two dimensional self-assembly at   surfaces with the structures of three dimensional assembly of crystals of the   same organic molecules. These results provide information for the design of   organic thin film electronic devices, as well as an understanding of the crystal   growth of organic molecules relevant to drug design. We also developed an   approach for using self-assembly to robustly attach metal-organic framework   materials to gold substrates.  We   developed a catalytic reactor with a plasmonic sensor included to monitor the   coverage of reaction intermediates on the surface of platinum nanoparticle   catalysts.  We also developed simplified   theory for the design of nanoplasmonic arrays that can be used as sensors in   this application. In the study of the internal energy of catalytic oxidation   reactions, the internal state distribution of the CO2 product of   the catalytic oxidation of acetaldehyde was completed.  The product CO2 was found to be significantly vibrationally excited, with the degree of   excitation depending on the kinetics of the reaction process.  In our   study of oxidation of reactive metals, we provided detailed information about   the interaction of water and oxygen with reactive surfaces such as lithium   and indium, with applications to the use of these materials in alternative energy   application.  Theoretical studies of   the interaction of water and oxygen with spinel oxides useful in   heterogeneous catalysis applications were also carried out.  Corrosion inhibition chemistry was examined   from the point of view of nitrogen containing organic molecular corrosion   inhibition materials.  Comparisons with sulfur heterocycles and sulfur   plus nitrogen heterocycles were made. This information is useful for the   design of corrosion inhibition strategies needed in petroleum production and   refining.  The final area of research focused on the development of   analytical tools that can be used for compositional characterization of   complex, composite surface samples that are often seen in technologically   important areas such as heterogeneous catalysis, and electronic device   fabrication.    In all of this work, fundamental understanding   of the systems under study helps to lead to technological applications that   rely on this fundamental knowledge.   In addition to the basic knowledge provided by the   research supported by this award, students were trained in the art of   research and were prepared to carry out independent research in areas vital   to commercial product development, healthcare and disease prevention, and   national security.  In particular, seven PhD students worked on this   research project.  All have completed their PhD work during the course   of this project.  Additionally, two undergraduate students participated   in the work of this research program.  Both have gone on to graduate   study in chemistry. The research carried out here supported by the NSF has   been reported in eighteen publications thus far, along with seven PhD   dissertations. There are a number of additional manuscripts being written up   for publication.               Last Modified: 01/14/2019       Submitted by: Andrew B Bocarsly]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
