<AbstractNarration>Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is a versatile modeling and optimization technique that has been increasingly used in computational biology in inventive ways that differ from its traditional uses. Spectacular improvements in the speed of modern ILP solvers and computers now often allow the solution to important instances of hard computational problems that lack guaranteed-efficient solution methods. This project will further the exploitation of integer programming to solve realistic instances of computational problems in biology. The broader impact of this project will be through the improved computational tools that will be created for use in biology and perhaps medicine. This could have a transformative impact in biology. Broader impact will also be in the training of graduate and undergraduate students, and in outreach to biologists involved in computation. This project will also impact algorithmic computer science, by demonstrating a shift in emphasis from seeking worst-case efficient solutions or approximations to problem instances of all sizes and properties, to seeking methods that are effective in finding exact solutions to realistic problem instances of great importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are intellectual challenges in modeling biological phenomena for integer programming, non-trivial technical issues, and educational and outreach efforts needed to make the advances available to a larger biological community.  The research questions are of three broad types: 1) Many research questions concern how to formulate, and more efficiently implement, a large succession of related ILP computations. This arises due to the need to evaluate the biological fidelity, and statistical significance, of a solution, often leading to changes in the biological model and ILP formulation, and many successive ILP computations. 2) It is often possible to devise mathematically-equivalent, but very different, ILP formulations for a computational problem, with large differences in the time and memory needed to solve the ILP instances. Many research questions concern how to devise the best ILP formulations for sub-classes of biological problems, and to identify successful new idioms (or modeling insights) that are common in these formulations. 3) Many technical issues come from the use of ILP as a language to express solutions to biological problems that are not naturally posed in terms of linear constraints. This exploits the fact that integer programming, being NP-hard, can express any problem in NP. However, the consequence is that the formulations are often non-intuitive, and huge in comparison to traditional ILP formulations, with a higher ratio of variables to equations than is expected by ILP solvers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Inellectual Merit: The focus of this project was the further development of the computational techniques of Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and Satisfiability-Solving (SAT) for use in solving computational problems that arise in Biology. ILP is a mature computational  technique that is heavily used in industry to solve hard scheduling and management problems. However, it's use in Biology was very limited at the start of this project. The project developed several ILP solutions to central computational problems in Biology and produced research papers to explain these solutions; created a textbook to teach about using ILP in Biology "Integer Linear Programming in Computational and Systems Biology: An Entry Level Text and Course" published by Cambridge University Press; and introduced ILP to a large number of  researchers and practitioners  in Computational Biology through tutorials, videos, software, and lectures, in addition to the research papers and the textbook. In studying the use of ILP in a wide-range of problem-types from Biology (more than seventy), we identified five problem-types where ILP was much less effective as a solution technique than desired, or was completely ineffective. This was in contrast to its success in most of the problem-types studied.  The problem-types where ILP was least successful involved the optimal  design of networks to reflect or summarize evolutionary processes, or large-scale relationships between Biological entities (molecules, DNA, diseases, etc.)  Having identified hard computational problems in Biology where ILP was not effective, we then concentrated on studying the effectiveness of a much less-mature, less-applied computational technique (SAT) which we believed had the potential to be effective in solving  certain kinds of problems that arise in Biology, i.e., problems where the value of the optimal solution was an integer in a small range of possible values. The results of those studies showed that in these problem-types, SAT was in fact very effective in comparison to ILP in solving problem instances of these hard problems.  This work has been disseminated through one published paper, and another submitted paper,  software, and through lectures and tutorials. In summary, the two most significant intellectual results of this project are the development of successful exploitation of ILP to solve a wide-range of problem-types in Biology, disseminated primarily through the publication of the text-book mentioned above; and the discovery of the surprising effectiveness of SAT-solving as a computational technique for several hard computational problems in Biology, where ILP had been identified as being much less effective. Broader Impacts:  The project has had broader impact outside of computer science in the devopment of more effective computational techniques for a wide-range of problems in Biology; through the development and dissemination of related software; through the publication of a textbook on using ILP in Computational Biology; the further development of the use of SAT-solving for problems in Computational Biology; and the development and dissemination of related software. In addition, the project trained three graduate students and two undergraduate students in the ILP and SAT studies.
