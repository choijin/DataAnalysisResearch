<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Patricia Crown, Erin Hegberg of the University of New Mexico will conduct doctoral research in historical archaeology to study the expansion of modern capitalism into frontier merchant economies and the attendant changes in identity and social ideas about race. By examining daily lives of those who were not necessarily rich or powerful, archaeology is ideally suited to consider issues of colonialism, the spread of capitalism, and social identity. These are important historical research themes for understanding modern racial and ethnic relations in the United States. The proposed research contributes to anthropology by examining the effects of emerging markets and mass-consumption on social networks and identity in the past. It also uses analysis methods that are suitable for other historic colonial and early capitalist contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hegberg's research will examine how people create and maintain community and regional identities through consumer relationships developed to acquire and use material goods. It investigates consumer practices and social relationships of men and women living in Hispanic communities in New Mexico, AD 1821-1912. This period encompasses the Mexican and the American Territorial Periods as New Mexicans were drawn into the larger American racialized capitalist system. In the 19th century frontier, consumer relationships were charged with more than just economic convenience and reflected important networks that were essential to the survival of historic Hispanic settlements. Using detailed analysis of locally produced pottery, imported manufactured goods, and historic documents and advertisements, this project examines and compares consumer patterns at four Hispanic residential sites throughout New Mexico to understand which scale of social network - local or national - was most important to site residents. The results of the research will be the foundation of a doctoral dissertation and a series of articles, public talks, and journal publications, as well as local media outlets such as magazines, radio and genealogical groups. The research team will also partner with local cultural heritage institutions to develop a bi-lingual (English, Spanish) web exhibit based on the results of this research. The emphasis of the website will be to disseminate the research results in plain language, and to encourage user-participation in archaeological and historical interpretation through digital interactive media such as blogs, social networking, forums, or other user-generated content. This project will encourage the public to engage with ideas of race and the historic contexts for racialization in the American Southwest. Historical understandings of Hispanic identity is a particularly poignant topic in New Mexico where 47% of the population identified as Hispanic or Latino in 2013.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Between 1821 and 1912 the New Mexico Territory experienced significant political and economic changes. The region changed hands between three nations?from a Spanish colony to a Mexican territory, to an American territory, and finally an American state in 1912. The Santa Fe Trail connected the territory to broader capitalist markets in the eastern United States, and New Mexicans were gradually drawn into the larger American racialized capitalist system.</p> <p>Using archaeological analysis of New Mexican-made plain ware ceramics and imported artifacts, this research examines how social and economic entanglements with Anglo-American immigrants and changes in the racial discourse in New Mexico impacted Hispanic New Mexicans at four different residential sites. The objects Hispanic residents chose to consume, and the sources of those objects, indicate important social relationships. These consumer relationships, in turn, indicate how Hispanics defined themselves <em>with</em> and <em>agains</em>t other social groups in New Mexico, the United States, and Mexico. The four sites were chosen to represent the full range of the 1821 to 1912 time period and also different geographic locations within the territory. Prior to this project, little comparative work had been done in Territorial period archaeology.</p> <p>This NSF doctoral dissertation improvement grant supported multiple elements of data collection, including thin sections for petrographic analysis, several weeks of archival research, and hiring a graduate student web developer to design a web exhibit to make the research results available to the broader public.</p> <p>New Mexican-made plain ware ceramics were made by a range of people, including Puebloans, Hispanics, and nomadic tribes. These ceramics were a major artifact class at each site, and were used in everyday cooking and storage. However, they have received relatively little study by archaeologists. Technological analyses of New Mexican plain wares included visual inspection, X-ray radiography, petrographic analysis, and refiring analysis to look at manufacturing choices at each stage of pottery production?clay selection, vessel formation, vessel decoration, and firing. Statistical analysis of these data was used to identify microstyles within the assemblages. Imported glass, metal, and ceramics were examined to understand where they were imported from and compare their relative costs. Finally, this NSF grant supported several weeks of archival research to examine merchant licenses, ledger books, and merchant inventories to understand purchasing options and costs that Hispanic New Mexicans faced in the nineteenth century. Together, these data were used construct and compare consumer profiles for each site in the sample.</p> <p>Until now, archaeologists have most often discussed Hispanic New Mexican identity in local terms, looking at consumer patterns within one site at a time. Historians, conversely, frequently discuss Hispanic New Mexican identity in regional terms, that encompass the entire territory. This study shows that the social and material relationships maintained by New Mexicans between 1821 and 1912 were more complex than either narrative suggests. Those sites nearest to large market centers such as Santa Fe did not, in fact, show greater consumption of imported goods or greater diversity in New Mexican-made plain wares. Surprisingly, the most remote site in the sample demonstrated the greatest diversity of both New Mexican plain wares, and the second highest rate of imported materials. This research demonstrates that different Hispanic communities in the study period used a range of strategies to acquire their material culture. Some strategies were rooted in close relationships with local Puebloan producers, and some drew upon a multitude of regional sources to meet material needs. The patterns of Hispanic consumers were varied and defined by individually maintained relationships rather than geographic proximity or market convenience. This research underscores the importance of comparative work in colonial borderland studies, especially regarding questions of material culture and social identities.</p> <p>This research contributes to the anthropological discipline as a case study on the effects of emerging capitalist markets and mass-consumption on social networks and identity, and is particularly well-suited to helping archaeologists understand the relationships between modern social identities and material culture. Regionally, this project is significant because it was comparative and gathered together scattered pieces of research regarding material consumption patterns at residential Hispanic sites across the state, and from previously unanalyzed excavation collections. NSF funding supported the production of a database of technological characteristics of over 3,000 New Mexican plain ware ceramics, a class of artifacts that has not received wide-ranging treatment in New Mexico.</p> <p>The results of the research are being synthesized in a doctoral dissertation and have been presented at professional meetings within archaeological discipline.
