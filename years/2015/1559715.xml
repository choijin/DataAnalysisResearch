<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Doyle of the University of Texas at San Antonio is investigating catalytically generated metal carbenes as synthetic tools for the construction of complex organic compounds.  This research provides fundamental advances in catalysis for metal carbene formation and reactions and offers research opportunities for the education of students who are preparing for careers in the chemical sciences.  The research program includes initiatives to increase diversity, particularly through greater participation of Hispanic and African American students, and undergraduate participation in research.  Efforts are undertaken to cultivate an international consortia to investigate critical unsolved problems in chemical catalysis for metal carbene generation and reactions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalytic processes using carbene precursors that operate with stereocontrol and diversity in product formation are under investigation. Professor Doyle is pursuing the development of donor-acceptor cyclopropenes as effective carbene precursors. The research provides catalysts with divergent reactivities and that improve the stereoselectivity in intramolecular metal carbene additions. The research broadens the scope and expands the versatility of chemical transformations that occur through metal carbene intermediates.</AbstractNarration>
