<AbstractNarration>The the Privacy Enhancing Technology Symposium (PETS) is a leading venue for privacy technology research.  Since starting in 2000, PETS has brought together researchers in privacy-related areas including Internet and other data systems and communication networks.  Student attendance at PETS is an important part of graduate education in privacy. The 2015 Symposium will be held in Philadelphia PA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage participation at PETS by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by research areas.  Preference will be offered to those with papers but inadequate travel funding from their organization. Organizers will make particular efforts to encourage participation of women and under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Privacy Enhancing Technology Symposium (PETS), established in 2000, brings together privacy and anonymity experts from around the world to discuss recent advances and new perspectives. PETS addresses the design and realization of privacy services for the Internet and other data systems and communication networks.The 2015 edition of PETS was held at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from June 30 - July 2, 2015.       The symposium takes an interdisciplinary approach to privacy and attracts social scientists, journalists, activists, and people in industry, in addition to computer scientist academics.       Participation in conferences such as PETS is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with peers and more senior researchers, thus having the opportunity to be exposed to leading edge work in privacy. The support requested in this proposal supported the participation of 19 US-based students who would otherwise have been unable to attend PETS 2015. The students came from 15 different institutions.         The conference posted advertisements for this travel support via the PETS website, twitter account, and various mailing lists. A three-member committee consisting of Rachel Greenstadt (General Chair, PETS 2015), Roger Dingledine (previous PET stipend co-chair) and Andrei Serjantov (previous PET stipend co- chair) decided the recipients of the travel awards.  The funding was used for student travel-related expenses such as airfare, hotel, train, taxi and shuttle.
