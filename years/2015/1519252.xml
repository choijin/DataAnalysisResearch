<AbstractNarration>The proposal requests travel, housing funding and conference registration for US-based doctoral students selected to participate in the Doctoral Consortium (DC). The DC is co-located with The 25th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS), which will be held in Jerusalem in May 4-8, 2015. ICAPS is the main international conference on automated planning. The ICAPS DC aims at broadening the participating of US-based PhD students into the planning area as well as improving the retention of these students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
