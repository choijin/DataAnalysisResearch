<AbstractNarration>The fossil record of life on land through time predominantly comes from the Northern Hemisphere. However, the outstandingly rich, relatively little-known fossil beds of Patagonia, southern Argentina, provide an unrivaled opportunity to learn whether life responded differently to mass extinction, plate tectonics, and past climate change on the other side of the world. This project will intensively sample and analyze fossil plants and animals from Patagonia through about 20 million years, from just before the end-Cretaceous dinosaur extinction (66 million years ago), through the early recovery period and the Eocene warming interval. Through groundbreaking field discoveries and state-of-the-art lab techniques, this research aims to transform understanding of the origins of the Southern Hemispheres flora and environments, the role of Patagonia, and the legacy of surviving living fossils now located in vulnerable rainforest areas as far away as Southeast Asia. The work will generate the most complete terrestrial record and curated fossil-plant collection for the Southern Hemisphere through a critical interval of Earth history. It will produce a new, globally significant reference point for studying mass extinction, recovery, and response to climate change from a fossilized living laboratory, with direct importance for conservation and ecosystem management today. In addition to scholarly publications and meeting presentations, a large number of educational, training, and outreach activities are planned. These will include exhibits, educational resource development for public engagement with the fossil sites, and a trilingual childrens book. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will use field paleontology and stratigraphy at a series of exceptional Patagonian fossil localities, dating from the latest Cretaceous to middle Eocene, to elevate understanding of Patagonia's uniquely informative fossil floras. Most of the fossil sites are located in the La Colonia, Lefipan, Salamanca, Penas Coloradas, and Huitrera formations of Chubut and neighboring provinces. The research will focus on five, broadly related questions targeting significant gaps in knowledge. (1) Was Patagonia a refuge from the end-Cretaceous mass extinction? (2) What are the composition, diversity, and biogeographic affinities of the earliest Paleocene floras and insect faunas? (3) Do the Eocene floras and faunas contain lineages that now survive in South America, Asia, and Africa, as well as Australasia? (4) Do the Eocene floras document the earliest phases of South American isolation by showing a loss of Gondwanan taxa and an increase in New World taxa through time? (5) How much geologic time does the prolific early Eocene site at Laguna del Hunco represent, and what processes formed these unique deposits that preserved one of the most diverse fossil biotas in the world?</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The study of fossils, and more broadly, the complete fossil record has taken on new importance with the advent of repeatable phylogenetic methods (phylogeny: study of relationships among organisms based on how closely they are related to each other), the ability to model both process and pattern in evolutionary history, and an increased focus on development in the context of evolution. Paleontologists who study the fossil record of plants are paleobotanists (basically plant evolutionary biologists), and their main goal is to answer questions such as the origin of flowering plants, evolution of land plants, plant adaptations through time, and the influence of climate on plant distributions. Paleobotany research goes well beyond the collection and examination of fossils and requires deep study and understanding of plant development, external morphology, internal anatomy, and the nature of evolutionary change in a phylogenetic context in these systems, in addition to comprehending the geological and sedimentological aspects of the localities where the fossils were collected.<br /><br />During the tenure of this grant, several floras of Early Cretaceous (~120 ma) to Paleogene (~24 ma) age of Patagonia, Argentina were studied in collaboration with American and Argentinean colleagues. These floras have yielded an unexpected wealth of fossils that so far include the oldest records worldwide for many taxa such as Physalis (tomatillo) and Eucalyptus, several Cunoniaceae (the ?Cunonia? family), and aquatic ferns. Although finding the oldest Eucalyptus on a continent where it is now extinct was startling, such fossils also provide data for the study of the rate of floral and fruit evolution and pose new questions about diversification and dispersal that could not otherwise be answered. This project provides data for those researchers interested in the relationships of climate, flora, and biogeography of the Southern Hemisphere, in addition to improving our understanding of the floristic composition and a better comprehension of distribution patterns of these floras. This is critical, because to really understand the modern biotic distribution of plants in both hemispheres, there is a need for addressing many questions such as how, why, when, and where did this extraordinary biotic diversity evolve. To accomplish our work, we have used traditional neobotanical and paleobiological methods combined with non-traditional ones. Approaches include morphological and anatomical descriptions and comparisons of fossils with extant materials and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and most recently, with cutting-edge microCT-scanning; when combined these methods provide us with a wealth of characters sometimes previously unknown in the fossil record as they reveal even more features that help interpretation. The non-traditional methods comprise the actual inclusion of the fossils within combined morphological and molecular data phylogenetic analyses utilizing modeling methods&nbsp; (principles of maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and parsimony) as used in phylogenetics, co-evolution, and biogeography. These approaches are collection-based and the foundation for the PI lab overall research program. By studying fossils, we are contributing to understand several long-standing problems involving the origin of morphological features during the early stages in angiosperm diversification, documenting the changes in suites of floral characters, and the general conditions (climate and environment) in which they developed. This project allowed us to reevaluate evolutionary processes (extinction, retraction, expansion, diversification, coevolution, and codiversification) that have significantly shaped modern Patagonian vegetation by studying fossils in deep time (Cretaceous-Paleogene).<br /><br />Three Plant Science undergraduate students (including 1 underrepresented female minority)&nbsp;&nbsp; were trained in all aspects of paleobotany from field work to the preparation of a manuscript for publication and provided them with a rich experience in research and scholarship. Two Argentinean graduate students participated in the project, they interacted with American scientists, participated in scientific meetings and published contributions in peer-review journals. A postdoctoral fellow work for two years and secured a faculty position at an undergraduate teaching institution. The PI was selected as editor-in-chief of one of the most influential paleobotanical journals; she is the first female and Latina editor-in-chief since the creation of the journal in 1967.
