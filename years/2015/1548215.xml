<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the Texas floods of May 2015 in an around the Blanco River.  The unprecedented flood occurred in the towns of Wimberley and San Marcos. Hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed, two reinforced concrete bridges were washed off their piers (a third received heavy damage), and nearly 100 high water rescues were made.  In addition to severe loss of life and infrastructure damage, Texas A&amp;M Forest Service estimates as many as 12,000 trees were damaged or uprooted in the lower portion of the basin.  The project will document the extent of flooding and the impact of large woody debris (trees) as a feedback mechanism that may have additionally raided water levels.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the Texas floods of May 2015 by 1) documenting high water marks (stage heights) in upland tributaries and along the main stem as well as 2) characterizing the geometry of selected river cross sections containing large woody debris piles. These geographic characterizations will better define floodwave timing, velocity, and stage height. This study will be used in a full forensic hydrological investigation seeking to understand the meteorological, hydrologic, and hydraulic intricacies of the event.  The investigator will coordinate his activities among the USGS, Texas A&amp;M Forest Service and the Guadalupe Blanco River Authority.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chad Furl has completed research associated with the NSF RAPID award entitled "RAPID: Forensic Hydrological Field Investigation of the Blanco River Flood &ndash; May 2015, Wimberley, TX".  During the funding period, the PI spent approximately 1 month mapping high water marks along the Blanco River and its tributaries in south central Texas immediately after the historic flood event in May 2015.  The high water marks were deduced from first-hand accounts of the flood event along with silt lines and other physical markers delineating the maximum flood height.  Measurements were taken using RTK GPS instrumentation at approximately 125 locations.  The high water mark data were used to create flood inundation maps for approximately 75 miles of the river.  In addition to the high water mark mapping, terrestrial LIDAR measurements were taken using a scanner with a range of 1.4 km.  The data were taken at an area left fallow after the flood event and were used to document the catastrophic tree damage along the river.  Results from the study were used in a hydrometeorological investigation of the event and have been submitted to the journal of Hydrometeorology.  Raw data from the field efforts along with flood inundation maps can be found at: http://engineering.utsa.edu/~sharif/Research.html          Last Modified: 09/28/2016       Submitted by: Chad Furl]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
