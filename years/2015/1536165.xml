<AbstractNarration>Coastal marine ecosystems provide a number of important services and resources for humans, and at the same time, coastal waters are subject to environmental stressors such as increases in ocean acidification and reductions in dissolved oxygen. The effects of these stressors on coastal marine organisms remain poorly understood because most research to date has examined the sensitivity of species to one factor, but not to more than one in combination. This project will determine how a model fish species, the Atlantic silverside, will respond to observed and predicted levels of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2). Shorter-term experiments will measure embryo and larval survival, growth, and metabolism, and determine whether parents experiencing stressful conditions produce more robust offspring. Longer-term experiments will study the consequences of ocean acidification over the entire life span by quantifying the effects of high-CO2 conditions on the ratio of males to females, lifetime growth, and reproductive investment. These studies will provide a more comprehensive view of how multiple stressors may impact populations of Atlantic silversides and potentially other important forage fish species. This collaborative project will support and train three graduate students at the University of Connecticut and the Stony Brook University (NY), two institutions that attract students from minority groups. It will also provide a variety of opportunities for undergraduates to participate in research and the public to learn about the study, through summer research projects, incorporation in the "Women in Science and Engineering" program, and interactive displays of environmental data from monitoring buoys. The two early-career investigators are committed to increasing ocean literacy and awareness of NSF-funded research through public talks and presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project responds to the recognized need for multi-stressor assessments of species sensitivities to anthropogenic environmental change. It will combine environmental monitoring with advanced experimental approaches to characterize early and whole life consequences of acidification and hypoxia in the Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), a valued model species and important forage fish along most of the US east coast. Experiments will employ a newly constructed, computer-controlled fish rearing system to allow independent and combined manipulation of seawater pCO2 and dissolved oxygen (DO) content and the application of static and fluctuating pCO2 and DO levels that were chosen to represent contemporary and potential future scenarios in productive coastal habitats. First CO2, DO, and CO2 × DO dependent reaction norms will be quantified for fitness-relevant early life history (ELH) traits including pre- and post-hatch survival, time to hatch, post-hatch growth, by rearing offspring collected from wild adults from fertilization to 20 days post hatch (dph) using a full factorial design of 3 CO2 × 3 DO levels. Second, the effects of tidal and diel CO2 × DO fluctuations of different amplitudes on silverside ELH traits will be quantified. To address knowledge gaps regarding the CO2-sensitivity in this species, laboratory manipulations of adult spawner environments and reciprocal offspring exposure experiments will elucidate the role of transgenerational plasticity as a potential short-term mechanism to cope with changing environments. To better understand the mechanisms of fish early life CO2-sensitivity, the effects of temperature × CO2 on pre- and post-hatch metabolism will be robustly quantified. The final objective is to rear silversides from fertilization to maturity under different CO2 levels and assess potential CO2-effects on sex ratio and whole life growth and fecundity.</AbstractNarration>

Our project examined the climate sensitivity of an important model organism, the Atlantic silverside (<em>Menidia menidia</em>), a small, abundant forage fish in nearshore waters along the US east coast. &nbsp;Over 5 years, we conducted a comprehensive set of experiments, some as short as two weeks, some spanning more than a year. We systematically examined how this fish was affected by more acidic, meaning higher CO<sub>2</sub> conditions ? either alone or in combination with elevated temperature or lower oxygen levels.</p> <p>To conduct many of these experiments, we engineered and built the ?Automated Larval Fish Rearing System (ALFiRS)? at the Rankin Seawater Lab of the University of Connecticut. It has a 3 x 3 design of nine independent rearing units, each with computer-control over their CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and temperature levels. The units can even mimic diel or tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>x O<sub>2</sub> fluctuations, which are very common in nearshore environments. To represent wild silverside populations, we started each experiment with embryos that were collected from a large number of adults collected by beach seine at a local field site (Image 1). In the laboratory, we focused on silverside traits that are known to determine Darwinian fitness, which is the success in contributing offspring to the next generation. This included measuring survival, length and weight growth, metabolism, sex ratios, fecundity and many other traits.</p> <p>Like most organisms and especially fish, we found that silversides are most sensitive to predicted ocean acidification at their early life stages, meaning as unhatched embryos and very young larvae. The responses are highly variable, which is why we employed serial experimentation (n=20) to robustly quantify silverside early life CO<sub>2 </sub>sensitivity. This revealed an average 10% reduction in embryo survival under future CO<sub>2 </sub>conditions and a curious seasonal change in offspring CO<sub>2 </sub>sensitivity that is likely an adaptation of this species to seasonal changes in their productive nearshore habitat (Image 2).</p> <p>We found complex interactions between temperature and CO<sub>2</sub>, where CO<sub>2</sub> effects were often more pronounced at low or very high temperatures, while largely absent at optimal temperatures for this species. We found similar interactions with low oxygen conditions, which is important because high CO<sub>2</sub> and low O<sub>2 </sub>conditions already co-occur seasonally in many coastal areas. These fluctuations are predicted to become more extreme in the future. Our research showed, however, that diel and tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>x O<sub>2 </sub>fluctuations appear to be beneficial to silversides and mitigated most effects seen under static conditions.</p> <p>We also conducted a number of novel, long-term rearing experiments on silversides, demonstrating that juveniles grow up shorter under high CO<sub>2 </sub>conditions, while the fecundity of lab-matured females was largely unaffected by acidification. The findings of this project led to the development of the ?<em>Ocean Variability Hypothesis</em>? that emphasizes the role of natural CO<sub>2 </sub>variability in the environment for a species? CO<sub>2 </sub>sensitivity ? a contribution and attempt to synthesize the complexity of empirical data from a rapidly expanding field (Image 3).</p> <p>In addition to its core foci, the project unearthed novel evidence for sex-selective survival of juvenile silversides in the wild (Image 4), quantified patterns in CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2 </sub>fluctuations in 16 estuaries across the US (Image 5), and contributed review and perspective articles to advance the scientific field. Nearly all published datasets are citable and publicly available from NSF?s BCO-DMO data portal as well as from other data repositories.</p> <p>The project made a substantial, positive impact on the lives and careers of more than 20 people involved in it over 5 years. It supported the thesis research of three Master students, one PhD student, and one post-doctoral researcher. It mentored three consecutive NSF-REU students and their research projects and inspired over 15 undergraduate students working or volunteering for the project (Image 6). The project succeeded in capacity building for hands-on skills like fish sampling and fish husbandry, for conducting accurate water chemistry measurements and effectively analyzing, visualizing, and publishing research data. Apart from peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, we brought our findings to the general public via community college lectures, open-house demonstrations, blogs, brochures and on social media.
