<AbstractNarration>This award provided funding for the conference Analytic and Probabilistic Techniques in Modern Convex Geometry, to be held at the University of Missouri from November 7-9, 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially the fields of random matrices, probability, and convex analysis. The confirmed participant list includes a number of leading researchers in the fields covered by this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through mailing lists and advertisements in media maintained by professional organizations.  More information will be available at http://www.bengal.missouri.edu/~pivovarovp/APTMCG.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The conference was devoted to recent trends in convex geometry, especially using analytic and probabilistic methods. There were a variety of interesting talks from leading experts and early-stage researchers. For example, Paul Goodey gave a wonderful expository talk on geometric applications of the Fourier transform, especially connected to work of Alex Koldobsky, to which the conference was dedicated. &nbsp;Elisabeth Werner presented joint work with Florian Besau on the floating body in non-Euclidean settings. Floating bodies in Euclidean space play a fundamental role in affine convex geometry, random polytopes, the geometry of centroid bodies, among others. She explained how one can define the floating body in hyperbolic space and presented a unified approach to floating bodies on manifolds of constant curvature. &nbsp;Vitali Milman presented joint work with Liran Rotem on algebraic constructions of convex bodies. These are connected to new results on &ldquo;continued fractions&rdquo; of convex bodies by Molchanov and also new isoperimetric inequalities, like the log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality, conjectured by Boroczky, Lutwak, Yang and Zhang. &nbsp;Sergey Bobkov presented joint work with Gennadiy Chistyakov and Friedrich Goetze on second-order concentration properties. The conference also had many talks by young researchers. Christos Saroglou presented joint work with Artem Zvavitch on significant progress towards a long-standing open problem of Petty on the volume of projections bodies. In particular, they prove that ellipsoids are a &ldquo;local&rdquo; solution. Galyna Livshyts presented joint work with Grigoris Paouris and Peter Pivovarov on sharp bounds for densities of marginal distributions of product measures.

One of the primary goals of the grant was to foster collaboration between the instutitions of the PI and co-PI&rsquo;s. In this respect, the meeting was a great success. We had a poster session for students and postdocs. We have since had several short visits by early-stage researchers between our institutions. A large contingent of early-stage researchers also attended a companion workshop held at Texas A&amp;M on "Geometric Functional Analysis" at College Station, TX, July 25-29, 2016, which was co-organized by Bill Johnson, Grigoris Paouris and Mark Rudelson.</p> <p>The remaining funds from the grant were spent on partial travel support for US participants for the latter workshop.

Assaf Naor discussed metric embeddings, the Lipschitz extension problem, and quantitative differentiation; in particular, he presented joint work with Young that provides a solution to a conjecture of Goemans and Linial.
