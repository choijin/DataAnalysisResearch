<AbstractNarration>The advancement in science is closely connected to the capabilities of instrumentation. Particle accelerators are the instruments of particle physics and x-ray production. The next generations of particle accelerators are being designed to explore the frontiers of high-energy physics and for xray beams for research in biology, chemistry, physics, material science and medicine.  Accelerator science research is necessary to gain greater understanding of the physical processes that can impact the performance of these accelerators and develop new techniques of particle acceleration technology. The accelerator science research will be conducted at two of the premier laboratories in the United States in accelerator science, the Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education (CLASSE) at Cornell University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will use the Cornell Electron-Positron Storage Ring Test Accelerator (CesrTA), to examine important beam physics, such as the electron cloud effect, emittance limitations in storage rings, and the fast ion instability, for future lepton storage rings and x-ray sources. One of the key goals of the CesrTA research program is to improve our understanding of the interaction of the electron cloud with the high-energy particle beam. The electron cloud constrains many of the operational parameters of the storage ring such as beam current; bunch spacing, ring energy, and these parameters can be measured experimentally on CesrTA. Beam dynamics experiments using the CesrTA beam diagnostics capable of quantifying bunch-by-bunch and turn-by-turn beam dynamics will be used to study important lepton storage ring beam dynamics in the presence of the electron cloud. In addition, we conduct basic accelerator science research on crystal channeling at the Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests (FACET) and the End Station A Test Beam (ESTB) facility at SLAC. Channeling is the phenomenon that arises when charged particles become trapped between the crystal planes due to the electrostatic field of the crystal ions. There is strong interest in using bent crystals as collimators and magnets for high-energy electron and positron beams and well as using crystals as generators of gamma-rays as a positron crystal undulator. The development of a crystal undulator opens the prospect of creation of novel light sources that will find their application in technology, medicine and basic sciences. Both accelerator science research projects provide Cal Poly undergraduate students research opportunities at large accelerator facilities in accelerator science.  Cal Poly students will gain hands-on experience in all facets of the physics research from designing an experiment, simulating the physics, building the hardware, taking the data, analyzing the data, and publishing the results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Accelerator Science at the California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo  This proposal provided Principal Investigator (PI) and undergraduate students accelerator science and particle physics research, teaching, and outreach at the California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly).  The research was conducted at three of the premier laboratories in the world in accelerator science, the Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education (CLASSE) at Cornell University, the Stanford National Accelerator Center (SLAC) at Stanford University, and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Meyrin, Switzerland.    Particle accelerators are not only the instruments used for scientific discovery in frontiers of high-energy physics but also serve as a high intensity x-ray source that is used by scientist in many fields of science and engineering.  From this proposal the accelerator science research conducted at the Cornell Electron-Positron Storage Ring Test Accelerator (CesrTA) consisted of developing beam diagnostics able to quantify bunch-by-bunch and turn-by-turn beam dynamics that allowed us to understand and eliminate beam instabilities that limit our ability to operational ability for present and future particle accelerators.  The PI and undergraduate students performed experiments on CesrTA that enhanced our knowledge of beam instability limitations, such as the electron cloud instability, of particle accelerators and developed beam diagnostic instrumentation for future accelerators.  This research resulted in 5 conference proceedings and 5 peer review journal articles in accelerator science.   Particle physics and the radiation process of particles in the regime of strong electromagnetic fields measured by colliding charged particles (electrons and positrons) with a strong electromagnetic field created by: 1) a crystalline target at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN as part of the NA63 collaboration and 2) a crystalline undulator target at the End Station Test Beam (ESTB) facilities at SLAC as part of the T523 collaboration.  Charged particles entering an aligned crystalline target become trapped between the crystal planes due to the electrostatic field of the crystal ions.  The positron beam follows a nearly sinusoidal-like trajectory due to the strong electromagnetic field and produces stimulated undulator type (coherent) electromagnetic radiation due to the periodic bending of the particles in the crystallographic plane.  These g-rays have many important applications due to their short wavelength, penetrating power, and ability to ionize.  From the experiments performed at SLAC and CERN we have: 1) made the first experimental observation of quasi-channeling particles (particles with enough transverse energy to be above the potential well of the crystal but are not amorphous particles),  2) confirmed that the Landau-Lifshitz equation properly describes high energy charged particle dynamics in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields, and 3) showed that aligned crystal volume reflection radiation produces an intensity enhancement suggesting that crystals be considered as a potential g-rays source.  We also contributed to the development of a Monte Carlo simulation of axially channeled electrons through crystals by tracking the particles transverse energy travel through the crystal.  During this proposal, the PI and undergraduate students published one conference proceeding and 7 peer review journal articles on particles in strong fields.  The educational and outreach components of this proposal included: i) provide students research opportunities at large accelerator facilities, ii) provide Cal Poly students training in accelerator science and particle physics, iii) enhance the experimental physics component of the Cal Poly Physics department, iv) provide research experience at undergraduate institutions which is traditionally an underrepresented group, and iv) provided public outreach to k-12 students with demonstrations of electricity and magnetism.  This project has educated undergraduate students in all facets of experimental physics from designing an experiment, simulating the physics, building the hardware, taking the data, analyzing the data, and publishing the results.  In addition, this project has allowed the PI to broaden his knowledge base in accelerator science and particle physics.
