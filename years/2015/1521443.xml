<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to optimize the workflow, coordination and communication of surgical operating room (OR) teams. Recent technological advances have allowed development of a simple solution to radically improve the workflow and performance of OR team members. Historically, OR teams have relied on archaic paper instrument lists and previous experience to orchestrate complex tasks, resulting in lost time and waste due to non-coordination. In particular, the two biggest frustrations for surgeons and OR teams is not having the precise tools and equipment needed for a surgery and difficulty staying on the same page as a surgery progresses. Research shows workflow distractions and disruptions related to these instruments, equipment, and awareness issues are a major cause for delays/errors in the OR, which lead to problems with costs, efficiency, and most importantly quality of surgical care. By introducing a digital real-time workflow management tool to the OR environment, this technology will set a new benchmark for OR team performance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The proposed project aims to test and prove the value of a digital application software that displays the tools, tasks and preferences specific to the operating surgeon along each step of a given procedure. This software solves decades old frustrations of OR teams by guiding them through a surgery in real time, raising awareness as to the technical progression of the case, and effectively decreasing the preventable disruptions, distractions and delays related to the failure of having the correct instruments/equipment available. Via a prospective multi-institutional study, the technology will be tested during live surgical procedures to generate data proving its value based on cost savings and efficiency. Ultimately, the use of this technology will lead to improved surgical quality. Using an iterative design and development approach, the testing of this technology will directly feed back into the development of additional fundamental features and new generations of this product, such that OR team satisfaction is maximized and it fits as seamlessly as possible into existing workflow. The time has come to harness modern technology to optimize the performance of our surgical teams and thus improve delivery of care in the OR.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Background: ExplORer, a web-based, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) workflow management application, is a first-of-its kind interactive surgical playbook that promotes optimal teamwork in the operating room (OR). Best practices are built into a customized workflow for each case. Step-by-step instructions help each member of the surgical team (e.g. surgeon, scrub nurse, circulator nurse, and anesthesiologist) follow the case and prepare for what is coming next. The names, descriptions, and pictures of the materials needed at each step are included.   Disruptive and uniquely innovative, ExplORer not only drives increased communication and efficiency in the OR but also generates granular data on surgical activity - how long steps take, which contingencies are followed, and the tools and tasks each member of the team utilizes (based on their customization). Objective 1: Implement ExplORer in three common surgical procedures in multiple surgical disciplines and settings.    At the University of Chicago Medicine (UCM), pilot testing included 21 surgeons performing 17 different surgical procedures across 5 specialties. We collected baseline data on 117 total surgical cases and used ExplORer to collect data on 26 cases. Based on preliminary data analysis, we have decided to pursue a new direction moving forward: the Resident Acute Care Surgery Service (RACS) at UCM, staffed by fourth year General Surgery residents supervised by chief residents and attending physicians who do a varying proportion of work based upon case complexity.  The RACS team performs emergent referral cases alongside a nursing team from whichever department is on-call and thereby available. We hypothesize that our software can minimize cost, while also reducing variability, minimizing complications, and maximizing education. Objective 2: Refine the process by which surgeons, teams, and hospitals upload content into ExplORer. Our Chief Technology Officer and his team continuously refined the administrative portal in order to improve the speed and ease with which content is built. They have released 12 versions of the software including updates with respect to content creation in accordance with input from our users.    Objective 3: Use test site data to develop preliminary analytic models of surgical activity. The aggregate data analytics dashboard we developed serves the purpose of displaying cumulative data analysis based off the granular intraoperative workflow and cost statistics/information collected by ExplORer. We can investigate correlations between surgical choices (e.g. materials at a given step, team member experience), patient outcomes, cost, and duration.  Project Outcomes and Conclusion: In Phase I, we developed a user-focused system that enables simplified and facilitated inputting of this data by surgeons and surgical teams. Additionally, we have broken new ground in the field of surgical analytics.   The next logical step is to allow for healthcare systems to integrate with electronic medical record software and supply chain software if they so choose, allowing for an exchange of data: specifically, preference card data, scheduling information, and instrument availability &amp; cost data. We will be using phase II funding in part for this, as well as for (a) other technological usability enhancements and (b) data collection in new operative specialties (namely within the interventional suite) to ensure we our technology optimizes its unique processes. Following Phase II, we aim to expand the field of intra-operative surgical data capture and analysis, improving operations of hospitals not only within the walls of the OR, but also in adjacent areas such as sterile processing, supply chain management &amp; procurement, and staffing &amp; training.
