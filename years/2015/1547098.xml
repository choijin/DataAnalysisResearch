<AbstractNarration>This award will provide the funds to the National Research Council (NRC) to conduct a study of the fundamental research needed to improve understanding of the processes that initiate, sustain, and end volcanic eruptions and the relationships between those processes and observed eruption precursors. Large volcanic eruptions can have disastrous impacts on infrastructure, agriculture, air and water quality, respiratory health, global air travel, and the economy. Successful forecasts, such as the forecast of 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines, can save lives and lessen the adverse impacts of such events. Use of the new interdisciplinary research approaches and innovative sensing systems could make it possible to distinguish an impending eruption from mere volcanic unrest, enabling more reliable warnings to affected populations. In addition, this study could foster collaboration among researchers in different disciplines, instrument developers, and government managers responsible for monitoring volcanoes, warning the public, or mitigating volcanic hazards at local, regional, and national levels. Such collaboration could both inform future volcanology research and enhance volcano monitoring and warning efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because eruptions are commonly preceded by precursors such as volcanic tremor, earthquakes, gas discharges, or surface deformation, eruptions at some well-monitored volcanoes have been forecast successfully. However, although our capability to provide useful warnings of possible eruptions has improved, many aspects of volcanic systems are not fully understood, and volcanic eruptions cannot be reliably predicted. Advancing the field requires contributions from multiple scientific disciplines, including volcanology, geodynamics, geodesy, seismology, meteorology, hydrology, and remote sensing. This study would bring together experts from these disciplines to identify priority research, modeling, and observations needed to better understand the behavior of volcanoes and their future activity. The engagement of these experts and the findings and conclusions from the study could advance understanding of volcanic eruptions and inform the U.S. research agenda.  In particular, the NRC will convene a committee of 12 individuals in the field of volcanology to compile information on the current scientific understanding of magma storage, ascent, and eruption; new research on volcanic processes and precursors that could lead to better forecasts; new observations or instrument deployment strategies; and research and observation priorities to improve understanding of eruptions and to inform monitoring and early warning. The committee would hold 3 meetings and a workshop to gather information, deliberate, and prepare a consensus report on the tasks listed above. The published report would be shared freely and disseminated to the research and technical community as well as to interested policy and decision makers at federal, state, and local levels.</AbstractNarration>

These eruptions can have devastating economic and social consequences, even at great distances from the volcano. Consequently, knowing where, when, how big, how long, and the consequences of an eruption are vital public concerns. Fortunately, many eruptions are preceded by unrest that can be detected using ground, airborne, and spaceborne instruments. Data from these instruments, combined with basic understanding of how volcanoes work, form the basis for forecasting eruptions. At the same time, monitoring data provide key insights into how volcanoes work.  We broadly understand why and where volcanoes exist, how the magma feeding the volcano is generated and evolves, and how magma that erupts is distributed over Earth's surface. Yet our understanding is incomplete. What controls whether magma will erupt? What processes initiate eruptions? How quickly does magma rise to the surface? Which types of unrest are precursors to eruption rather than a return to dormancy? Which volcanoes are most likely to erupt in the coming decades?  Major improvements in understanding and forecasting are possible through enhanced monitoring combined with advances in experimental and mathematical models for volcanic processes. In the United States, fewer than half of the 169 potentially active volcanoes have even one seismometer to detect the small earthquakes that signal underground magma movement. Only three have continuous gas measurements -- gas matters because it drives eruptions.  This report identified key science questions, research and observation priorities, and approaches for building a volcano science community capable of tackling them. These are summarized as three grand challenges in volcano science.  The title of this report reflects one of the grand challenges: to document and understand the repose, unrest, precursors, and timing of eruptions during the entire life cycle of volcanoes. At present, our understanding is biased because the necessary observations are available for only a few volcanoes. Moreover, activity at those volcanoes represents only a small fraction of the diversity of eruptions on Earth.  A lack of monitoring hampers forecasting because most eruption forecasts are based on recognizing patterns in data. Models of volcanic processes provide a basis for closing observational gaps and hence could help improve forecasting. A second grand challenge is to develop quantitative models for the processes that govern volcanic eruptions and to use these models to forecast the size, duration, and hazard of eruptions.  A third grand challenge is to develop a coordinated community of scientists who will make this happen. Foremost this requires effective integration of the complementary research and monitoring roles of universities and government agencies. In addition, volcano science draws on a large number of disciplines (e.g., geology, geophysics, geochemistry) and approaches (e.g., remote sensing, high-performance computing), and vehicles are needed to support interdisciplinary research and training, including community collaborations and education at all levels.  Although these grand challenges are large in scope and require great effort, achieving them would yield now understanding of how volcanoes work and their consequences, and improve volcano eruption planning and warning for all of society.
