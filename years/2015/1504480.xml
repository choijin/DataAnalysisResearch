<AbstractNarration>Typically, learning is thought to occur during studying, whereas retrieval of information during testing serves to assess what was learned. Importantly and perhaps surprisingly, modern research is demonstrating that retrieval practice often produces large gains in long-term retention of knowledge relative to repeated studying. Thus retrieval practice promotes the acquisition of knowledge that can be flexibly retrieved and transferred to different contexts. This has important implications for both the study of memory and its application to educational practice. In light of the clear need for educational approaches that can enhance students' success in STEM courses, it is important to apply this new research to STEM educational practice to examine the robustness of the research in science and mathematics courses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to examine the systematic application of retrieval practice to enhance achievement in STEM courses. Students will complete a series of in-class exercises involving retrieval of course information and reflection on their confidence, familiarity, and out-of-class preparation with the material. Students' responses on these exercises throughout the semester will determine whether regular doses of retrieval practice are associated with increased accuracy, confidence, and out-of-class preparation. Performance on course assessments will reveal whether particular response patterns on the exercises predict achievement. The project will provide important new data on how best to use retrieval practice in STEM courses to maximize students' achievement and awareness of their own learning (metacognition), and permit the discovery of heretofore unknown factors (e.g., individual student differences in preparation) that may moderate these effects. The knowledge gained will provide educators with the tools they need to maximize student achievement, and to help equip students with the skills they need to thrive in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
