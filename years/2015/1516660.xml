<AbstractNarration>Molecular evolution starts from random changes in DNA, but then natural selection eliminates some of the changes and retains the others. An important question concerns the adaptation of different species to a similar environmental challenge; would they do it through similar or different changes to the DNA? This project will address the causes of evolution, and the possibility to predict evolutionary change by studying birds living at high altitude in the Andes, and their close relatives living at low altitudes. The project will explore the ways in which the hemoglobins (the oxygen carrying proteins of the blood) have changed to enable the uptake and release of oxygen under different atmospheric conditions (high and low altitude). This project will provide interdisciplinary training for postdoctoral and graduate students and includes a public outreach component that will focus on 'adaptation to extreme environments' to teach elementary school students how evolution by natural selection works. All data and samples will be linked to specimen-vouchers at the Museum of Southwestern Biology (U. New Mexico) and will be accessible through an open-access data repository. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to assess the pervasiveness of parallel molecular evolution and to test hypotheses about its causes by examining mechanisms of hemoglobin (Hb) adaptation in multiple species that have independently colonized high-altitude environments. Experimental analyses of Hb function will be used to identify and characterize the molecular basis of evolved changes in Hb-O2 affinity in multiple bird species that have contrasting altitudinal range limits in the Andes. The comparisons will involve multiple phylogenetically replicated 'taxon pairs' (pairs of conspecific populations or closely related species that are native to high- or low-altitude). In cases where functionally distinct Hbs of high- and low-altitude taxa are distinguished by multiple amino acid substitutions, a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and ancestral protein resurrection will be used to examine the functional effects of sequential mutational steps in all possible pathways that connect the ancestral (low-affinity) Hb and the derived (high-affinity) Hb. In addition to measuring oxygenation properties of each engineered Hb mutant, additional functional and structural properties that can potentially trade-off with Hb-O2 affinity will also be measured. By relating the results of the site-directed mutagenesis experiments to phylogenetically replicated changes in Hb function, this protein-engineering analysis will illuminate the role of pleiotropic constraints in promoting parallel molecular evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of this grant was to collaborate on studies of hemoglobin protein evolution in birds in ways that help us to better understand how this important protein adapts to evolutionary changes in altitude during the diversification of birds. As part of this grant, new samples of blood and frozen tissue were obtained from key montane populations in order to study their hemoglobin proteins and the genes that encode them. Advances were made in obtaining DNA sequences for the regions of the genome that contain the hemoglobin genes, and this was achieved for many species of birds. The DNA sequences revealed that many high montane bird species have evolved and adapted while exchanging genes among species at a high rate. Integrative, specimen-based studies of these bird populations have revealed that natural selection for optimization of hemoglobin to the local elevation is accompanied by strong diversifying selection on many other aspects of the phenotype. Furthermore, many DNA changes that could be adaptive on their own may not be adaptive when combined with other DNA variants, a phenomenon known as 'epistasis'. In summary, this project made progress in determining the aspects of high altitude adaptation that are predictable as well as those that are unpredictable in a broad comparison of independent evolutionary lineages. The samples that were obtained and archived for this project will continue to be valuable for research in the decades and centuries to come, particularly for the purposes of understanding how evolution occurs along elevational gradients.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/01/2019<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;C&nbsp;Witt</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1516660/1516660_10374383_1549044371634_vouchersforexport--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1516660/1516660_10374383_1549044371634_vouchersforexport--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Specimens packed for transport."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1516660/1516660_10374383_1549044371634_vouchersforexport--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Specimens packed for transport."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This photo shows a series of voucher specimens of Andean birds that have been collected and preserved, along with their blood and tissues, in order to advance the study of high altitude adaptation.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Christopher C.
