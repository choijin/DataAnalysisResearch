<AbstractNarration>Documenting, understanding, and predicting how organisms respond to natural and anthropogenic change is complicated; some responses may be short-term, but others may result from evolutionary change.  This project will exploit long-term ecological data to ask when, where, and how often changes observed in aquatic organisms represent true evolutionary responses. Its value lies in the use and analysis of existing data to ask new questions about the nature of ecological changes over time. The University of Texas at Arlington is an Hispanic Serving Institution; groups under-served in STEM areas comprise 42% of the student population. The investigator will engage undergraduate and graduate students in the research activities, with clear plans to recruit students from under-served groups. He will use his analyses and resulting data in undergraduate inquiry-based laboratory exercises to demonstrate how to distinguish ecological from evolutionary responses and to extend his mentoring of under-served groups. Existing outreach programs at his institution will allow him to engage high school students in summer research activities. Through public outreach programs, he will increase awareness of the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to anthropogenic change and the importance of long-term research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites have documented responses of natural populations and communities to rising temperatures, increased urbanization, eutrophication, and the spread of exotic species, but have not examined the extent to which these responses reflect evolutionary change. The five aims comprising this project will quantify phenotypic responses to long-term ecological change, using phenotype as a signal for evolutionary responses. Existing data, samples, and experiments from over twenty lakes in Wisconsin and Alaska will be analyzed to explore changes in zooplankton traits that might indicate evolutionary responses to invasive species, land use change, rising temperatures, and changes in nutrient availability. Appropriate data sets and samples to address these questions have been identified, although some questions will require new measurements from archived specimens. Preliminary analyses are provocative. In some cases, changes in zooplankton body sizes and abundances support predator-induced selection. In other cases, they contradict predictions from prevailing theory. Exploratory statistical analyses will be used throughout to relate changes in response variables to putative selection pressures. Results will allow the tempo and trajectory of phenotypic change to be compared across sites to ask whether similar responses occur in temperate and arctic ecosystems. The investigator is an early-career researcher; his longer-term goal is to build these exploratory studies into a research program that integrates long-term ecological and evolutionary studies.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Anthropogenic changes in the environment, such as rising temperatures, species invasions, and eutrophication have the potential drive evolutionary changes in the traits of organisms. This project evaluated the evidence for evolutionary change in aquatic communities using data and experiments from two long-term ecological research programs. This work focused on waterfleas (Daphnia sp.) because they have well established ecological roles, fast generation times, and are known to respond to changes in the environment. In lakes in Wisconsin (part of the Northern Temperate Lakes long-term ecological research site), we tested the influence of a recent invertebrate invasive species (spiny waterflea) on evolution in waterfleas. Spiny waterfleas invaded these lakes in 2009 and have caused steep declines in the abundances of their prey. We evaluated the influence of the invasive predator on waterfleas via an evaluation of long-term trends and comparative experiments. We found that the invasion of this novel predator has driven rapid evolution in the traits of waterfleas (&lt;10 years). These evolutionary changes are important because they enhance the population growth rate of waterfleas and thereby work to counteract the negative impacts of the invader. In lakes in Alaska (part of the Arctic long-term ecological research site), we examined the impacts of elevated nutrient levels on adaptation in waterfleas. Here, long-term manipulations of nutrient levels is associated with evolved shifts in the traits (i.e., growth, reproduction, etc.) of waterfleas. Such outcomes provide new insights into the tempo and dynamics of evolution in response to common anthropogenic changes in the environment. This research program was combined with a multifaceted set of broader impacts. This included training for undergraduate and graduate students.
