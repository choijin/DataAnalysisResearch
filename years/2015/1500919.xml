<AbstractNarration>The Neotropics are estimated to house more seed plant species than the African, Asian, and Oceanic tropics combined. Recent studies of diverse plant groups have noted that closely related species often occupy similar types of habitats despite being geographically separated. This observation led to the hypothesis that dispersal is common in many groups and that migration to new, but suitable habitats can spur diversification. Adaptations can also stimulate radiations within plant groups, though less is known about the contributions of these seemingly rare but important evolutionary events to biodiversity. This research will focus on the systematics of the Neotropical plant genus Citharexylum (Verbenaceae), and the relative contributions of dispersal and adaptation to species diversification in the group.  Studies that provide an understanding of how organisms have dispersed and evolved in the past provide the necessary historical context to predict how these same groups are likely to disperse and diversify in the future.  One graduate student will be trained and undergraduates will be introduced to a broad range of laboratory and analytical methods.  The research will also enhance international scientific research infrastructure by establishing collaborations in several South and Central American countries. .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of this project is to understand how biogeographic events (migration/colonization versus adaptation) influence diversification in Neotropical plant lineages. This study will elucidate the biogeographic history of the plant genus Citharexylum, a lineage of trees and shrubs that originated in and diversified into multiple biomes of the Neotropics. A time-calibrated phylogeny of Citharexylum with near-complete sampling will be inferred using multiple, independent loci. Phylogenetic inference will take a two-tiered approach using both high-throughput and traditional sequencing methods to produce a robust phylogeny. This framework will then be used to test evolutionary and biogeographic hypotheses about the genus. Statistical analyses will reconstruct ancestral ranges/climatic niches and detect the placement and magnitude of diversification rate shifts in the phylogeny. Additionally, the phylogeny will be dated using a fossil-calibrated phylogeny of the inclusive group Lamiales allowing assessment of migrations and adaptive events with known geologic and climatic events in the history of the Neotropics. This work will help build the foundation of knowledge surrounding the timing and magnitude of diversification events as well as the directionality of niche evolution in the New World.</AbstractNarration>

The resultant dated phylogeny was used to determine:  What are the crown and stem ages of Citharexylum? When did dispersals between continents and colonizations of different biomes occur and how do those events relate to geologic history (e.g. closure of the Isthmus of Panama or Andean orogeny)? Which biome did the most recent common ancestor of Citharexlum occupy? Do some biomes incur higher or lower diversification rates than others? Is one pattern&mdash;niche conservatism or niche evolution&mdash;associated with higher diversification rates?  We found that Citharexylum originated in Mesoamerica in the mid-Miocene, but the crown radiation occurred in the late Miocene to early Pliocene. There have been four dispersal events from Mesoamerica to South America, which occurred within the last 4 Ma when the Isthmus of Panama had more or less reached its current conformation.

Despite differences in biogeographic patterns and diversification rates, both the Mesoamerican clade and South American clade have produced similar taxonomic diversity in the same amount of time.
