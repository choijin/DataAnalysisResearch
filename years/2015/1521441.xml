<AbstractNarration>A porous medium is any material consisting of solids and voids (or pores).  Sponges, beach sand, and furnace filters are familiar examples of porous materials (porous media).  Other examples are petroleum reservoirs, aquifers that supply groundwater, and catalytic converters that reduce car emissions.  With the recent advances in computer speed and power, scientists now have methods to simulate and understand the way that water and dissolved matter, as well as small particles, move through porous media.  This can be used to help fabricate porous materials with specific useful qualities and to understand the behavior of natural porous materials.  The way that chemicals spread in porous media as they flow though the intricate network of the pores is called dispersion.  Dispersion is important because it influences how quickly chemical reactions and mass transfer happen at the solid interfaces of a porous material.  For example, understanding of dispersion is essential to understanding how blood is oxygenated in the lungs during breathing.  As a second example, understanding dispersion is important for understanding the spread and eventual cleanup of contaminants spilled into the subsurface.  In this research, 3-dimensional X-ray images (much like a medical CAT scan) of real porous materials will be collected, and state-of-the-art computational methods will simulate the dispersion process within the porous media. This information will be useful in developing new theories for describing dispersion in porous materials, and this will have potential utility in engineering applications (such as filtration) and in fundamental science (such as understanding how our lungs work!)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although dispersion in porous media has been studies for over 100 years, the interaction of diffusion with the complex variations in the flow field within a porous medium are still not understood at the level of basic continuum mechanics. It has only recently become possible to conduct numerical simulations of flow within the geometry of a complex, three-dimensional porous medium of sufficient size and resolution to generate the kind of data needed to connect the microscale physical processes within a porous medium with the observable macroscopic behavior of the material as a whole.  This research will combine theory, numerical computation, and experimental data to examine the process of dispersion in monodisperse and polydisperse porous media at an unprecedented level of detail.  Because dispersion in porous media is relevant to a host of subsurface processes relevant to practicing hydrologists (e.g., bioremediation, contaminant spreading, mass transfer between rivers and the hyporheic zone), it is important to understand the dispersion process so that we can determine how it affects transport in the subsurface. This research also has applications to engineered systems outside of hydrology (such as chromatography and catalysis). The  goal is to bring new understanding about the dispersion process by: 1) experimentally measuring (via X-ray tomography) beds of random porous media at unprecedented resolution; 2) conducting direct numerical simulations of the flow and dispersion process in these porous media (up through the steady inertial flow range) using state-of-the art numerical methods; and 3) developing modified descriptive theory (via the method of volume averaging) to predict the macroscopic behavior of the dispersion process from representative structure of porous materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the 1920's, scientists studying fluid mechanics started to turn their attention to the ways that chemical mix in fluids.  Much of this work began as an effort to understand how pollutants spread in the atmosphere, but it soon spread to interest in a host of natural and engineered mixing phenomena.  The phenomenon in which fluctuations in velocity fields caused spreading of chemicals became known as \emph{dispersion} theory, and it was a significant area of research on its own in the 1950's and 1960's.    The name of GI Taylor has become nearly synonymous with dispersion theory because of his long and distinguished history with the topic.  He published one of the first scientific papers on the topic in 1922.  Taylor researched dispersion off-and-on throughout his career, but in 1953, he published what would  become one of the seminal works on the topic.  Researchers over the years had noted that the process of dispersive spreading tended to increase over time until it reached a steady level.  One can think of dispersive spreading as an analogy of investing in a silicon valley start up; while the rates of return might be very large initially, they will eventually settle to a more sustainable level that is close to constant.   Taylor was able to generate a theory that allowed researchers to predict what the steady level of dispersion would be after sufficient time had passed.  Taylor developed a result known as the macroscopic dispersion equation; this equation was able to describe the net movement of a chemical species with high fidelity, assuming that enough time had passed since the chemicals were injected.  This was a significant revelation at the time, on par with what researchers were doing theoretically in other, more exotic sounding disciplines like quantum mechanics.  The paper became one of the watershed moments in both the understanding and prediction of chemical spreading, and it went on to have influence for decades and in many different disciplines.  While Taylor's theory describing the long-time rate of dispersive spreading was successful, researchers still  struggled with the problem of how dispersive spreading evolved from its dynamic, early time behavior (near what is known as its ``initial condition"), to when it attained its more constant value that was predicted by Taylor's theory.  An example of such spreading is shown in Figure 1.  There had been some success in using a time-dependent dispersion coefficient, and this kind of approach continued to be developed as one of the primary theories through the 1970's and 1980's.  The basic idea was to represent the dispersive spreading by a coefficient that increased in time from a small value (near the diffusion limit) to the much larger, steady value predicted by Taylor's theory.  There were some problems with the approach, the primary one being that it seemingly led to paradoxes.  For example, if chemical solutes injected at two different times overlapped, which time did one assign to the dispersion coefficient- the one that applied to the oldest or youngest chemical injection?  Taylor himself expressed his frustration with the lack of suitable theory when in a 1959 paper titled, appropriately, ``The present position in the theory of turbulent diffusion", he made the following comment regarding time-dependent dispersion.  Taylor had made it clear that the theories of the time, where a time dependent dispersion coefficient was adopted, violated some of the most basic notions of causality in physics.    This problem remained known in dispersion theory, but no clear resolutions had presented themselves.  While theories advanced using time-dependent coefficients, they remained vulnerable to the problem that they could not predict what happened when injections at two different times overlapped.  In a recent paper, by Taghizadeh et al. (Journal of Fluid Mechanics, vol. 889, 2020) have provided one resolution to this long-standing problem.  Using results from the theory of partial differential equations, they were able to show that the problem with the time-dependent dispersion arose from neglecting a term that represented the solute's relaxation from its initial configuration.  In short, the chemical species when they are first injected do not necessarily follow a dispersion-type equation.  Rather, the at the early times, the initial condition has to ``relax" to become consistent with the dispersion equation.  During this time, it turns out, there is additional term in Taylor's macroscale dispersion equation that had been missing.  This additional term corrects the dispersion process to account for the initial spatial configuration of the chemical species being transported.  Somewhat surprisingly, the theory also resolves the paradoxes that occurred in earlier theories with time-dependent dispersion coefficients.  In the new theory, there is never a question about what dispersion coefficient should be used when chemical solutes overlap; the adjustment to the spreading process is accounted for automatically by the presence of the additional term.
