<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Many efforts have been made to use virtual worlds to teach science concepts that are either inaccessible or impractical in the classroom. This project examines an important question: if a student learns different science topics in the same virtual world over time, will their longer-term, deeper engagement in that virtual world help them build a more integrated understanding of the different subjects? If so, this would help people build more effective virtual worlds for learning, and would also help provide insight into how learners develop either integrated or fragmented understanding of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will include integration of the EcoMUVE ecology learning virtual world with chemistry curriculum derived from the Project-Based Inquiry Science project Living Together. A qualitative exploratory study using middle school classrooms will examine processes related to transfer, grounded in the theory of figured worlds and encoding specificity in case-based reasoning. The qualitative study will focus on conditions that generate intense and sustained emotional engagement in the virtual world, the memories generated by this engagement after the fact, and ways that these memories are triggered in related but different curricular activities. Observation of learners, directly and with lightweight cameras; interviews and challenges designed to be memory probes; and design-based research strategies will be used to work towards design principles for the types of cognitive processes that underly transfer and knowledge integration. The broader impact of the project will be to inform educators and technologists how to better design for long-term, problem-based engagement in science topics and to support transfer and integrated understanding.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this exploratory Cyberlearning EAGER project was to investigate the range and variety of conditions that influenced students&rsquo; engagement, interest and memory making as they addressed a challenge in one virtual world as well as learn about what caused the students to remain engaged even when faced with difficulties or challenges. Finding this out will help in developing principles for designing virtual worlds and the challenges done within them in ways that are engaging enough that learners will keep at it long enough to deeply learn about phenomena and with enough interest to form memories that allow them to reuse what they&rsquo;ve learned and make connections in the future.</p> <p class="p1">We carried out our research in two local sixth grade classes as they engaged with EcoMuve, a 3D virtual learning environment of a pond ecosystem (<a href="http://ecolearn.gse.harvard.edu/ecoMUVE/overview.php)">http://ecolearn.gse.harvard.edu/ecoMUVE/overview.php)</a>. EcoMuve has the look and feel of a videogame (Figures 1 and 2) and was&nbsp;designed as a resource for learning the science of ecosystems and a context for learning to make causal explanations. Students are challenged to explain why the large fish in the pond suddenly died off (Figures 3 and 4). &nbsp;We collected screencast video to capture what student pairs did in the environment&mdash;their explorations, their data collection, their conversations and their hypotheses and explanations. We videotaped class discussions and student final presentations, and we conducted interviews with student pairs probing them for their memories and seeing how they applied what they learned to scientific problems related to the curriculum challenge. From the data, we created case studies of five pairs of students and synthesized across them to identify what engaged and excited students and what students remembered.</p> <p>We identified two ways the challenge and environment &ldquo;invited&rdquo; students to engage: (i) identity entryways and (ii) interest entryways. Becoming involved with EcoMUVE appealed to students with a variety of identities: gamers, lovers of science, and lovers of mysteries and detective stories. Involvement with EcoMUVE also appealed to those with interests in bodies of water, animals that live in water, wildlife, natural habitats, animals, and predator/prey relationships.</p> <p>There were five types of support that kept students engaged even when they ran into difficulties: (i) disposition supports, (ii) autonomy supports, (iii) social interactions, (iv) extreme fascination or affect, and (v) competence supports. Students felt they had autonomy to explore the world as they saw fit and to come up with explanations.&nbsp;They enjoyed interactions with &ldquo;people&rdquo; in the virtual world as well as the hints, pats on the back, and arguments they could have with their peers. The realism of this virtual world coupled with the teacher&rsquo;s encouragement to explore meant each student had a chance to come across something personally fascinating.&nbsp;Competence was supported by the ease of navigation and easy-to-use information resources and tools that support reasoning, and regular whole-class discussions furthered feelings of competence by making information and strategies available to everyone and allowing students to recognize and be recognized for what they could contribute to others.&nbsp;</p> <p>As for becoming excited about science and scientific practice, this happened when students recognized the usefulness of some formerly-learned way of doing things (e.g., graph interpretation learned in math class), when they encountered something surprisingly delightful and/or awe-inducing, when they were recognized for achievements by others, and when they got new insights about something they had had experiences with previously.</p> <p>Students tended to remember&nbsp;details of issues they had grappled with, what they found to be challenging, what they found fun, what awed them or made them wonder, and what disappointed or frustrated them. They also each remembered the kinds of things they are particularly interested in.

From the data, we created case studies of five pairs of students and synthesized across them to identify what engaged and excited students and what students remembered.  We identified two ways the challenge and environment "invited" students to engage: (i) identity entryways and (ii) interest entryways. Becoming involved with EcoMUVE appealed to students with a variety of identities: gamers, lovers of science, and lovers of mysteries and detective stories. Involvement with EcoMUVE also appealed to those with interests in bodies of water, animals that live in water, wildlife, natural habitats, animals, and predator/prey relationships.  There were five types of support that kept students engaged even when they ran into difficulties: (i) disposition supports, (ii) autonomy supports, (iii) social interactions, (iv) extreme fascination or affect, and (v) competence supports.

Competence was supported by the ease of navigation and easy-to-use information resources and tools that support reasoning, and regular whole-class discussions furthered feelings of competence by making information and strategies available to everyone and allowing students to recognize and be recognized for what they could contribute to others.   As for becoming excited about science and scientific practice, this happened when students recognized the usefulness of some formerly-learned way of doing things (e.g., graph interpretation learned in math class), when they encountered something surprisingly delightful and/or awe-inducing, when they were recognized for achievements by others, and when they got new insights about something they had had experiences with previously.
