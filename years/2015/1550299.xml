<AbstractNarration>Because liquid evaporation takes away a large amount of heat from a surface, rapid evaporation is desirable. The research team will fabricate new types of surfaces from which thin liquid films can evaporate faster than in a typical boiling process.  As a consequence, these surfaces enable removing heat at very high rates which is demanded in many industrial applications.  Not only graduate students but also K-12 students from the Dallas area will be involved in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thin film evaporation in capillary wicking structures can potentially yield higher heat transfer rates as compared to those of nucleate boiling.  To further enhance the film evaporation heat transfer, the PI proposes to explore a novel avenue with the help of electro-wetting on dielectric (EWOD) to initiate and sustain thin film evaporation in micro/nano porous bi-wick structures decorated on hot spot surfaces.  The PI will first develop multi-scale textured surfaces with micro- and nano-scale structures with treatments to make them super-hydrophobic or super-hydrophilic.  The EWOD fluidic operations will be used to generate precisely controlled liquid volume on the surface.  The project will be concentrated on detecting fluid meniscus distributions and wetting flow dynamics, using micro-PIV (particle imaging velocimetry) on different surface structures to determine the interdependency of the surface texturing on the wicking dynamics and thin film thickness in the presence of high heat fluxes and the effect of surface texturing on heat transfer rates.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We report an electrowetting-controlled cooling system with site-specific treatments on the heat source (evaporator or hot spot) surfaces. Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) has great potential in thermal management because EWOD-driven droplet transport has unique characteristics of prompt response, low power consumption and programmable paths without the need for any mechanical moving parts. Prompt and fast droplet transport is necessary for adaptive and active cooling of high heat flux targets. Using a multi-channel DC/AC control system, we carried out sequenced activation of AC voltages on coplanar electrodes and transmitted a droplet to the spot target along a programmable path. With high positioning accuracy at the chip level, we have successfully transmitted a water droplet of 15 &mu;L at speeds as high as ~10 cm/s. We further improved electrowetting cooling performance by coating a fine copper screen on the cooling targets. The capillarity associated with the copper screen facilitates the delivered droplets automatically spreading and clinging to the target surfaces. As a result, heat transfer is in the more efficient form of filmwise evaporation at the evaporator sites. To maintain a thin film with proper thickness on the hot spots, we implemented EWOD-assisted droplet splitting and merging to precisely control the droplet volume to avoid fluid flooding (accumulation) on the hot spot surfaces. Our investigation indicates that thin-film evaporation is a high-efficiency heat transfer mechanism on a hydrophilized hot spot surface. Based on EWOD technique with surface treatments, the superheat on a hot spot of 4mm x 4mm was maintained well below 30 &ordm;C even when the heat flux reached as high as 80 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. The closed loop of this novel thermal management system can potentially function as a wickless vapor chamber or heat pipe with enhanced heat dissipation capabilities.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/10/2020<br>      Modified by: Jiangtao&nbsp;Cheng</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1550299/1550299_10366361_1594426578019_EWODonSi3N4-SnapshotOverlay--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1550299/1550299_10366361_1594426578019_EWODonSi3N4-SnapshotOverlay--rgov-800width.jpg" title="EWOD-driven droplet transport"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1550299/1550299_10366361_1594426578019_EWODonSi3N4-SnapshotOverlay--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="EWOD-driven droplet transport"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">EWOD-driven digital droplet transport along a programmable path to the target on a chip surface</div> <div class="imageCredit">Cheng</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jiangtao&nbsp;Cheng</div> <div class="imageTitle">EWOD-driven droplet transport</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
