<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be in the ability to better screen for and manage glaucoma. Americans over the age of 40 need to be screened for elevated eye pressure which may lead to glaucoma and blindness. This STTR project aims to develop a non-invasive low-cost instrument that will allow frequent eye pressure measurements through the eye lid. Approximately 4 million Americans suffer from elevated eye pressure and require regular monitoring, the technology developed under this grant will improve public health, reduce cost of eye pressure measurements and will lead to an annual market opportunity in excess of 1B US dollars.  Given the universal need for convenient eye pressure measurement systems a similar market opportunity exists in Europe and the developed countries of Asia and Latin America.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a patient-specific calibration method. Through-the-eye lid tactile tonometry is an indirect pressure measurement technique. While universal calibration may still produce relative pressure measurements, a patient specific calibration will improve the accuracy to a level comparable with existing instruments such as Goldman applanation tonometers. The proposed research will examine the ability of a single measurement to produce an accurate patient-specific calibration.  The proposed approach utilizes an artificial neural network trained a-priory by a finite element model of the human eye capturing easy-to-measure model parameters. It is anticipated that the accuracy of the technique can reach +/- 5 mmHg or better with respect to Goldman applanation tonometry.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The objective of this work was to develop a novel apparatus and technique for eye pressure measurement (tonometry). Tactile tonometry (TT) measures the intraocular pressure (IOP) through the eyelid, and can be administered at home, by the patient &ndash; reduces health care costs, and provides frequent IOP monitoring. IOP tests are indirect measurements. They are affected by the variation in geometric, and material parameters of the human eye and its surrounding tissues. Considering these parameters, a patient-specific calibration technique was analyzed, which could improve the accuracy and sensitivity of the TT measurement. It is based on artificial neural network (ANN) and finite element model (FEM) in tandem. FEM was used&nbsp;for parameter sensitivity analysis, and for ANN training.</p> <p>We have designed and manufactured the hand-held prototype of the tactile tonometer. The device incorporates four miniature force sensors. The sensors are based on polysilicon strain gages, connected in four individual Wheatsone bridges, mounted on a stainless steel substrate. The device is battery powered, the connected LCD provides feedback on the level of the measured forces. The 9 degree of freedom inertial measurement unit is used to compensate the orientation caused bias on the force sensors. The printed circuit board has Bluetooth and USB communication channels. The device is equipped with a speaker for audible feedback for the patient. The sensors are calibrated by holding the device up- then downwards.&nbsp;</p> <p>A multi parameter finite element (FE) model was built, considering physiological variation of&nbsp;geometric and material parameters. The geometric parameters - central corneal thickness (CCT), axial length of the globe (AXL), and eyelid thickness (ELT). The material parameters - hyperelastic constants of the sclera (SC10, SC20), cornea (CC10, CC20), eyelid (LID). Furthermore, the orbital fat (OF) was assumed as a linear, nearly incompressible material. The range of IOP was selected between 7-30 mmHg, according to the relevant ANSI standards (Z80.10 - 2009). The current work ignores the extreme values below, and above the aforementioned range. Our sensitivity analysis showed, that SC20, CCT, AXL, ELT and IOP have the most significant effect on the measurement. An artificial neural network (ANN) was defined and trained based on the FE results, input parameters - CCT, AXL, IOP, CC10, CC20, OF, ELT, SC10, SC20. The output parameters were the slope and intercept values of the linear TT calibration curves.</p> <p>50 human subjects were recruited for TT tests. 37 females and 13 males with a mean age&plusmn;SD of 47.92&plusmn;16.02. The measured IOP range was 10-26 mmHg with a mean&plusmn;SD of 16.14&plusmn;4.08 mmHg. The recruitment and testing were carried out according to the IRB, approved by The University of Arizona. Each patient was tested on two different days. IOP (Goldmann), CCT, and AXL data was collected along with TT measurements, which were carried out by the patients. The TT data was processed, the slope and intercept values of the calibration curves were extracted. The tonometer must be aligned with respect to the eye during the measurement. Thus, the test data was filtered using alignment conditions, which are based on the measured forces on the tonometer probes. The correlation between GAT and TT is positive and significant (R=0.4, p&lt;0.001) within the range of 10-22 mmHg. However, the signal to noise ratio is low.&nbsp;The limits of agreement were &plusmn;4.85mmHg, which satisfy the requirements of FDA (&plusmn;5mmHg). &nbsp;Furthermore, after filtering only 64 measurements satisfied the defined alignment condition out of the 308 tests.&nbsp;In practice, this means that the device has a longer learning curve.&nbsp;</p> <p>The trained ANN was used first to estimate SC20 patient specific parameter, which has&nbsp;the most significant effect on the output parameters&nbsp;(Inverse Biomechanics). Based on the estimated value, slope and intercept values were predicted from test data, collected on day one and day two. CCT, AXL and IOP parameters were measured on day one. However, the remaining parameters were unknown. Thus, the latter were assumed to have the mean values of their analyzed range. The predicted intercept values had an error of&nbsp;6.72&plusmn;42.44% on day one, and&nbsp;$20.26&plusmn;23.07% on day two. Considering the responses' sensitivity, it is anticipated that the unknown parameters are causing the error. As part of the future work, the ANN will be tested to estimate more than one parameter. As a secondary option, the performance can be also improved by reduceing &nbsp;the number of unknown parameters. We analyzed a new approach, which applies the tonometer directly on the sclera, eliminating the eyelid properties. Sensitivity analysis showed that this method is affected by only three unkown parameters, instead of the current five.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/28/2016<br>      Modified by: Peter&nbsp;P&nbsp;Polyvas</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1521481/1521481_10372851_1470947263015_proto1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1521481/1521481_10372851_1470947263015_proto1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tactile tonometer prototype"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1521481/1521481_10372851_1470947263015_proto1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tactile tonometer prototype"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tactile tonometer prototype</div> <div class="imageCredit">EPVSensors LLC</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Peter&nbsp;P&nbsp;Polyvas</div> <div class="imageTitle">Tactile tonometer prototype</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1521481/1521481_10372851_1470953327678_fea1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1521481/1521481_10372851_1470953327678_fea1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="FEM of the eye"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1521481/1521481_10372851_1470953327678_fea1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="FEM of the eye"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Finite Element Model of the human eye and orbit</div> <div class="imageCredit">EPVSensors LLC</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Peter&nbsp;P&nbsp;Polyvas</div> <div class="imageTitle">FEM of the eye</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1521481/1521481_10372851_1471382846870_BA_alg3_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1521481/1521481_10372851_1471382846870_BA_alg3_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="BA plot"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1521481/1521481_10372851_1471382846870_BA_alg3_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="BA plot"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bland Altman plot - TT vs. GAT</div> <div class="imageCredit">EPVSensors LLC</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Peter&nbsp;P&nbsp;Polyvas</div> <div class="imageTitle">BA plot</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
