<AbstractNarration>Hydrogel-like soft materials are abundant in nature including soft tissues such as cartilage, tendons and ligaments. With similar mechanical properties and biocompatibility, synthetic polymer-based hydrogels have been used extensively for a wide range of biomedical applications such as artificial tissues and drug delivery. More recently, hydrogel-like materials have been explored as a class of soft active materials in the development of soft machines and soft robotics. For many of these applications, mechanical properties of the hydrogel-like soft materials are important, governing how they deform and fail under various conditions. In particular, fracture of hydrogel-like soft materials has not been well understood, and it remains a challenge to predict if and when such materials would fracture. This project aims to establish a knowledge base necessary for failure analysis and prediction of hydrogel-like soft materials. The results will enable engineering of such materials with reliable fracture properties for a range of applications including tissue engineering and soft robotics. The three PIs, jointly with expertise in fracture mechanics/dynamics, soft materials, experiments, modeling and simulations, will collaborate to bring different perspectives onto this project. Education and outreach activities will be integrated within the project to enhance its broader societal impacts, which include research experience for undergraduates, engaging minorities and underrepresented groups, and outreach to high school students and general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fracture processes of hydrogel-like soft materials are highly nonlinear in general, coupling large deformation with particular kinetic processes due to solvent diffusion and polymer viscoelasticity. This project is to establish a nonlinear, transient theoretical framework that defines the fracture driving force and a fracture criterion for crack growth in hydrogel-like soft materials, with explicit recognition of the associated kinetic processes. The theoretical framework will enable implementation of numerical simulations that would predict particular fracture behaviors relevant to hydrogel-like materials such as delayed fracture and rate dependence. The results will be compared to experimental measurements for validation. The developed methodology with modeling and experiments will then be used for measuring fracture properties of hydrogel-like soft materials. The distinct effects of solvent diffusion and viscoelasticity on fracture will be elucidated through numerical simulations and a set of experiments from quasistatic to dynamic regimes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research of this project aimed to develop both experimental and modeling methods for measuring and predicting fracture behaviors in polymer gels. A polymer gel consists of solvent molecules such as water and a solid molecular network. Deformation of a polymer gel is often considered to be poroelastic, with elastic deformation coupled with migration of solvent molecules both within the gel and in exchange with the surrounding environment (e.g., swelling and drying). As a result, fracture of a polymer gel is often time- and rate-dependent. Subject to a constant mechanical load, a gel may fracture after a delay (so-called delayed fracture). When a crack grows in a gel, the fracture load may depend on the crack speed (hence rate dependent). In this project we conducted experiments to characterize the poroelastic properties of a gelatin-based hydrogel under both swelling and drying conditions. Fracture experiments showed the time and rate-dependent deformation near the crack tip. While not conclusive at the moment, the collected data is being analyzed to shed light into the intricate fracture behavior of the gel. On the theoretical side, this project has advanced our understanding of the poroelastic effects on fracture of polymer gels. Both analytical and numerical methods were developed to predict the coupled deformation and solvent diffusion near a crack front. An energy criterion was proposed for either delayed fracture or crack growth at a constant velocity, considering the energy dissipation due to solvent diffusion. A poroelastic cohesive zone model was developed to further account for the solvent diffusion within the fracture process zone ahead of the crack tip. These theoretical developments showed clearly the poroelastic effects on delayed fracture and rate-dependent toughening of polymer gels. Comparisons between the model predictions and experiments in literature showed qualitative agreements, and further studies are in progress to consider other mechanisms that may contribute to the time and rate-dependent fracture behaviors of polymer gels.
