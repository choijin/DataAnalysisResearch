<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1309238, Principal Investigator: Colleen Robles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hodge theory provides some of the basic invariants of a complex algebraic variety, and has yielded some of the deepest results in algebraic geometry. The study of Hodge structures and their symmetry groups, Mumford√±Tate groups, lies at the intersection of complex geometry, representation theory and arithmetic. The proposed work addresses the relationship between Hodge theory and representation theory, with a focus on those aspects that may be described using complex geometry. (The Hodge theory of algebraic varieties will not be addressed: the emphasis is on Hodge structures as objects of independent interest.)  In the classical case that the Hodge domain D is a Hermitian symmetric space that may be equivariantly embedded in Siegel's upper-half space, the relation between Hodge theory and the geometric and arithmetic properties of a variety is a deep and extensively researched subject. The area is considerably less developed in the non-classical case, and it is generally felt that the principle obstacle to generalizing the theory (arithmetic properties, automorphic forms, theory of Shimura varieties, et cetera) is our limited understanding of the system of differential equations governing variations of Hodge structure.  The principle motivation and objective of this project is to better understand this system, the complex geometry of the Hodge domain D, and the associated representation theory in the non-classical setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hodge theory lies at the crossroads of several mathematical subjects, including Algebraic Geometry, Complex Geometry, Number Theory and Representation Theory.  This rich confluence makes the subject a fertile and influential area of research.  The underlying motivation to study variations of Hodge structure (a dominant theme in this proposal) is to understand moduli of algebraic varieties.  Algebraic varieties arise as the solution spaces to polynomial equations.  The ability to understand and manipulate solutions of systems of polynomial equations is essential in many areas of engineering, science and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Algebraic Geometry is the study of the geometry of solutions of polynomial equations.  Such equations are ubiquitous in mathematical models/descriptions of phenomena/structures in a many areas, a small sample of which includes the physical sciences, computing, engineering and encryption.  Consequently, the field of Algebraic Geometry is both a beautiful area of abstract mathematics and an essential contributor to applications and the development of technology.  Often one is working with not just a  single (set of) polynomial equation(s) and their solutions, but a family of such.  "Most" of the members of this family will be "good" in the sense that their geometric structure is relatively amenable to analysis.  Hodge theory is a tool developed to study these families.  One advantage of this machinery is that it can also help us understand the "singular" solutions/members of the family.  (Such solutions arise with studying extremal, or limiting phenomena.)  Hodge theory is particularly well-developed in very special cases, and the central theme of this proposal is to extend it's utility to very general situations.  More precisely, the central theme of the project is to study the geometric and representation theoretic aspects of Hodge theory with particular emphasis on Mumford--Tate domains (the classifying spaces of Hodge structures) and Hodge representations.  Work completed over the course of the project includes: (i) classifications of horizontal Schubert varieties; (ii) analysis of the characteristic cohomology associated with the system of partial differential equations govering a variation of Hodge structure; and (iii) a detailed understanding of the representation theoretic aspects of the subject (nilpotent orbits, horizontal SL(2)s), the Lie theoretic and complex geometric structure of Mumford-Tate domains and their boundaries in the associated compact dual, and the relationships between these objects.  This work is connected to the problem of constructing (partial) compactifications of a period map.  Such compactifications are expected to illuminate the structure of the boundary of moduli spaces.          Last Modified: 10/21/2016       Submitted by: Colleen Robles]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
