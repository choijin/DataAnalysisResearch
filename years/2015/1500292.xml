<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating advances in the fabrication of multimaterial fibers to the production of mechanically stable optical fibers capable of transmitting light at mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths for which limited commercially available optical-fiber options exist. The MIR range of the electromagnetic spectrum has recently become accessible (due to the development of semiconductor quantum cascade lasers) and this has opened up exciting applications in chemical sensing, environmental monitoring, and medical imaging. However, fully benefiting from these sensing, monitoring and imaging opportunities requires the development of optical fibers that cover the entire MIR spectrum, are affordable, robust, and easy to handle. This project addresses this critical need by leveraging recent NSF-funded fundamental discoveries in multimaterial fiber fabrication, where distinct materials are combined monolithically in a single fiber strand. The fiber's optical properties are dictated by an otherwise brittle MIR glass, while the superior mechanical properties stem from a robust built-in polymer jacket. The project will result in three distinct optical fiber prototypes packaged with standard end-connectors. When compared to the leading competing MIR fibers in this market space, the monolithic multimaterial optical fibers developed here will offer a broader optical spectral transmission window, lower cost, and superior mechanical robustness for ease of handling and manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application, addresses the technology gap in robust optical fibers that have a transparency window covering the entire MIR spectrum and in which the dimension of the core and the index contrast between the core and cladding may be readily controlled. Recent breakthroughs are exploited in one-step multimaterial preform extrusion in which a fiber preform - a macroscopic scaled up model of the fiber - is extruded from a billet combining MIR chalcogenide glasses and a thermoplastic polymer. The preform is provided with a thick, built-in thermoplastic polymer jacket that is thermally compatible with the glass and thus they may be co-drawn into a fiber. Since the glass is sealed within the polymer, the preform is readily drawn continuously in an ambient environment into extended fiber lengths. The project will result in three fiber prototypes: a multimode fiber with a transmission window extending to a wavelength of 12 microns, a single-mode fiber for transmitting up to a wavelength of 6 microns, and high-refractive-index-contrast fiber tapers for nonlinear applications - particularly MIR supercontinuum generation. All three prototypes are endowed with superior mechanical properties and will be packaged with standard optical fiber connectors to be readily used in real-world settings. This project combines the efforts of a research scientist for fabrication and testing along with an MBA student for market analysis. The project co-PIs in turn combine technical and commercialization expertise and will leverage both the unique fiber fabrication facilities at the University of Central Florida along with business incubation and venture accelerator programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this technology translation effort will benefit from partnering with the IRFlex Corporation, The Mid-IR Fiber Devices Company, to assist with the transition from research discovery to commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Optical fibers have tremendous impact on everyday life through critical applications in telecommunications, medicine, high-power lasers for manufacturing, and distributed sensing of atmospheric gases, biomolecules, explosives, etc. Silica glass is the most common fiber material, but it is not transmissive beyond a wavelength of ~2 &mu;m. For longer wavelengths other types of glasses are required to produce fibers for delivery of infrared (IR) laser light to a desired location. Candidate glasses that have been considered in producing IR fibers include fluorides, germinates, tellurites, and chalcogenides. Two shortcomings are usually associated with IR fibers: (1) high optical losses, typically a few dB/m; and (2) low mechanical robustness (e.g., Young&rsquo;s Modulus of the chalcogenide glass As<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> is &lt; 1/4 that of silica. The latter drawback especially plagues chalcogenide glasses (ChGs), reducing their utility despite their broad spectral transmission window in the 1.5-10 &mu;m range.

Previously, single-mode ChG fibers had transmitted up to 2.1 W of laser power at 2 &mu;m, handling intensities of ~5 MW/cm<sup>2</sup> on the facet without damage. &nbsp;Our ChG fibers delivered 10.3 W at 2053 nm (a factor of 5 improvement), 1 W at 2520 nm, and 0.5 W at 4102 nm without damage.
