<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project represents a new approach to online academic competition, one that may perhaps incite a shift in the market-based reform movement's present focus on increasing competition at the institutional level toward cultivating it at the grass roots level, that is, at the level of the individual student. Prevailing academic theory suggests that academic competition, well-structured, not only can lead to healthier peer dynamics but also to significant improvement in learning outcomes. Given the importance of mathematics to all fields of fundamental science and engineering, and the tendency of mathematics competitions to attract participants in greater number than other subjects, this project may well become a vital ally to the NSF mission. And if the structure of competition contemplated here proves sound, if students increasingly replace the remote/joystick in their hands with a textbook, or a Chromebook more specifically, the benefit to society in terms of a more educated populace could be substantial. Moreover, the commercial potential of this product may be greater than almost any other approach imaginable. From connecting two U.S. first graders studying arithmetic in a 1-1 match to hosting a Physics championship where high school students from around the world take part, the possible reach of this application is remarkable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical innovation contemplated in this proposal will mark a fundamental advance on existing, generally available web-based technology focused on the delivery of academic competition in two ways. First, it will allow students to identify opponents of similar academic ability and then schedule mutually convenient competitions with them fueled by multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions stored in the system, a content database eventually spanning every grade level and course. In addition, it will make possible the hosting of massive online competition events where potentially millions of students might log in simultaneously to compete for the title of champion of any given subject, first nationally and eventually world-wide. Going forward, special emphasis will be placed on mobile optimization in anticipation of the growing trend toward such devices, especially given the likelihood that student utilization of the proposed functionality will more often occur outside the classroom. The ultimate goal of this project is to emerge with a platform that leverages classic game mechanics to motivate students to learn.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Phase I effort has concluded and was successful. The product, <em>Uberbowl</em>, was completed as proposed, experienced by hundreds of students throughout a series of pilots, and implemented by a major educational organization. It is now generating sales, showing early signs of significant commercial potential.</p> <p><em>Uberbowl </em>allows students to come together online and compete with each other simultaneously, one against all, over MC and fill-in-the-blank questions in an event patterned off the Super Bowl. The experience begins within the account of the Administrator, one of two user roles associated with the <em>Uberbowl </em>platform. Here, an event can be created by the Administrator by naming it, selecting the number of periods, the lengths of each period and subsequent intermission, and uploading/assigning questions, including images, to each period. As to the second user role, each student maintains his/her own account in the system. The student can add/edit basic information like name, school, and profile photo. A list of the events to which the student has been added is displayed. A countdown clock appears for each event. When it reaches 00:00, the user is automatically re-directed to the match arena and the event begins. Here, the system allows students to choose other participants to compete against.&nbsp; Specifically, at the beginning of each period, a student can select the best player in the event as an opponent, a student of similar ability as identified by the system&rsquo;s algorithm, or search among all contestants. After each period, the questions and solutions of the previous periods are displayed as well as the answers the student submitted for all questions, allowing for timely feedback and learning in the moment.&nbsp; In addition, leaderboards containing individual statistics of player performance are featured.</p> <p>The functionality was piloted four times throughout April, twice with high school students and twice with middle school students. These pilots were highly beneficial, allowing the team to identify bugs in the system, obtain student feedback for future development, and gain additional experience organizing an actual online event. Moreover, they paved the way for an implementation at a LearnStorm event held in Ireland in May. By all accounts, Uberbowl was positively received. 0 technical errors were observed by the Principal Investigator who was on hand, and none were reported otherwise. Moreover, students demonstrated engagement, teamwork, and actual excitement.</p> <p>The success of Phase I provides solid evidence that the functionality under development is not only feasible but has the potential to significantly impact learning outcomes and peer dynamics.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/23/2016<br>      Modified by: Timothy&nbsp;Kelley</p> </div>
