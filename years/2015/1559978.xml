<AbstractNarration>Part 1:&lt;br/&gt;The health of our nation's economy depends on the continued growth of a STEM workforce. The effective application of high performance computing (HPC) is a skill increasingly demanded in a widening variety of fields including engineering, biology, plant science, biochemistry, and many others. This REU program will equip underrepresented students to pursue STEM careers by training them to use HPC in mathematics and statistics, engineering, and biological sciences. Participating undergraduate students will engage in cutting-edge research to learn how high fidelity models represent physical phenomena; how these models are implemented within HPC; and how results are analyzed, interpreted, and used to resolve theoretical and applied problems. In addition, a variety of personal, interpersonal, and leadership skills (including technical communication, time management, networking, and continuous improvement) will be cultivated through complementary hands-on/minds-on activities. This project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science by engaging undergraduate students in state-of-the art research in engineering applications and computation; and to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by strengthening the STEM workforce and increasing the participation of underrepresented groups and veterans returning from active duty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2:&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this REU program are to enhance student capacity to: 1) conduct innovative and meaningful research using HPC, 2) learn and think independently within an interdisciplinary collaborative environment, 3) conduct research with the utmost integrity, 4) prepare for professional careers, and 5) pursue graduate degrees in STEM programs. This program will recruit ten students per year from a diverse pool of first- and second-year students from smaller colleges, tribal colleges, and community colleges, with an emphasis on both minority and traditionally underrepresented students, as well as returning veterans. These students will participate in an intensive ten-week summer program and will work closely with faculty mentors on research projects that involve 1) simulation tools in the context of engineering design and analysis; 2) state-of-the-art research tools in engineering applications and computation; 3) statistical analysis based on real datasets and simulations; and 4) advanced numerical methods including parallel algorithms in HPC. The tangible outcomes will include student-authored journal articles, conference proceedings, and technical presentations. Program success will be assessed by an external evaluator through formative and summative evaluations, daily student reflections, student interviews, and student enrollment in STEM graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Summary of Intellectual Merit: The South Dakota State University REU Site in High Performance Computing (HPC) used HPC as a centralized theme for undergraduate research experiences in an interdisciplinary range of fields. This REU Site recruited and mentored 33 undergraduate students from 16 unique states during the summers of 2016-2019. The REU Site participants worked closely with experienced faculty in an intensive, ten week program pertaining to cutting-edge research in mathematics and statistics, computational science, engineering, and biological sciences. This project encompassed several STEM disciplines (mathematics and statistics, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, chemistry and biochemistry, and plant science, among others), which use similar simulation techniques but have significantly different applications. REU Site participants engaged in research as they learn how high fidelity models represent physical phenomena; how these models are implemented within HPC; and how results are analyzed, interpreted, and utilized to gain insight into theoretical and applied problems. Each student worked closely with a graduate assistant mentor on a daily basis. Project experiences involved 1) simulation tools in the context of engineering design and analysis; 2) state-of-the-art research tools in engineering applications and computation; 3) statistical analysis based on real datasets and simulations; and 4) advanced numerical methods including parallel algorithms in HPC, among others. This program fostered critical capabilities in young researchers through its emphasis on interdisciplinary research, publication, and scholarly presentations, as well as the Responsible Conduct of Research.

Competencies that students find particularly challenging include the generation and validation of realistic models, the estimation of model parameters, and the prediction of salient physical phenomena. This REU Site specifically cultivated such competencies by engaging undergraduate students in hands-on research under the guidance of graduate student mentors and faculty advisors. The objectives of this REU Site were to: increase student participation in conducting research from under-represented populations, small rural colleges, tribal colleges, community colleges, and veterans returning from active duty, enhance students? skills and capabilities to conduct innovative and meaningful research using HPC, strengthen students? capabilities for learning and thinking independently within an interdisciplinary collaborative environment, convey the importance of conducting research with the utmost integrity, improve student preparation for their professional careers through integrated professional development activities, and encourage students to pursue graduate degrees in STEM programs. The holistic structure of this REU Site with tangible outcomes (student-authored journal articles, conference proceedings and presentations), helped enable student participants to become leaders in their respective fields. This program contributed to workforce development by not only encouraging undergraduate students to pursue graduate degrees in STEM fields, but also by increasing participation from underrepresented populations. The program recruited from a diverse pool of talented undergraduate participants from minority groups, veterans returning from active duty, and students enrolled in smaller regional colleges with limited research opportunities. The training, mentoring, research experience, and professional development provided by this REU Site attracted and retain talented students to the STEM fields and will contribute to the development of an internationally competitive science and engineering workforce.
