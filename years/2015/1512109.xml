<AbstractNarration>1512109 (McCray) and 1511797 (Mozingo). The U.S. population will increase about 50% over the next 35 years, mostly as urban new development or re-development, presenting a unique opportunity to implement enlightened urban water solutions. Beneficial use of stormwater and recycled wastewater at the local urban scale are innovative water management options but are hampered by regulatory or policy barriers. The primary purposes of this research are (a) to develop engineered modules placed in reaches of constructed urban streams for treatment of selected wastewater or storm-water derived contaminants, including a subset of nutrients (N and P), trace organic chemicals (TrOCs), urban pesticides, metals, and pathogens, and (b) to understand the regulatory, urban planning, and social barriers that must be overcome, and to identify the most conducive urban-planning scenarios to successfully implement this technology at a relevant urban scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The treatment modules to be developed are termed "biohydrochemically enhanced stream-water treatment" (BEST) modules. If successful, BEST modules would enhance urban water quality, promote beneficial reuse of recycled wastewater and storm water, and provide social benefits. Specific objectives include: (1) Identify engineering design characteristics and regulatory opportunities and barriers important for widespread urban landscape-scale implementation of BEST facilities; (2) Test selected geomedia for removal of priority contaminants using column and intermediate-scale 2-D BEST experiments; (3) Design hydraulically optimal BEST modules using experimental results and mathematical modeling to ensure appropriate flow volume and RT that enable effective biochemical reactions for priority pollutants (4) Test BEST modules in our existing pilot-scale constructed streams using local recycled wastewater and stormwater. The research lessons and infrastructure will be incorporated into required graduate and undergraduate core classes in environmental engineering, design studios in urban landscape design, and a hands-on environmental engineering summer field session. An undergraduate senior design team will participate in the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Diffusion of the BEST technology into practice has been a significant outcome.   A patent was issued in 2020:  McCray, John, Skuyler Herzog, and Chris Higgins. "Biohydrochemical enhancement structure for stream-water treatment." U.S. Patent No. 10,570,578. 25 Feb. 2020.  BEST technology has been implemented by several practitioners:  City of Golden, CO; City of Aurora, CO, and is under consideration by other institutions (Sonoma County, CA, Seattle Public Utilities, City and County of Denver, University College Cork, Ireland), City government in Kigali, Rwanda. We have given workshops and lunch-and-learns to professionals in Colorado, including two Colorado Association of Stormwater and Floodplain Managers (CASFM) annual meetings, two CASFM "lunch and learn" events, Urban Drainage &amp; Flood Control District (Denver-Colorado Springs-Fort Collins metropolitan area), and at several local consultant firms.   Workshop/lecture to practitioners attending the International Association of Hydrologists &ndash; Irish Section, Annual Meeting, Interviews with practitioners on implementation of BEST about overcoming technical and policy/regulatory barriers were completed and resulting data were analyzed.   A journal paper on this topic was published in 2020 in the journal Water      Transferability to other fields.   BEST is primarily technology envisioned for stormwater tor dry-weather flows (i.e. urban drool) treatment, but has recently received interest by other for stream restoration (Sonoma County CA), agricultural water quality (Cork Ireland), and wastewater polishing (Kigali, Riwanda, Africa).        Public and political outreach to raise awareness of healthy streams for mitigating urban pollution  Featured in the film "Engineering with Nature-An Ode to Water, Wood and Stone".  2019 Seattle International Film Festival.  The film highlighted streambed restoration work Seattle Public Utilities was highlighted in the recent  Two educational podcast episodes were written and produced focusing on urban water concepts. These were produced primarily for the public, but with enough technical substance to informative for professionals in the water sector. BEST technology was presented to the US Government Accountability Office (US GAO).  GAO provides fact-based, nonpartisan information to Congress.  BEST was subsequently featured in US GAO report 16-474 "Technology Assessment: Municipal freshwater scarcity: Using technology to improve distribution system efficiency and tap nontraditional water sources"     Graduate Students finished their research-based Degree  Skuyler Herzog completed his PhD degree PhD student Brittnee Haplin was partially funded, expected to complete degree in December 2021. PhD student Andrea Portmann used BEST experimental facilities as part of her PhD program.      Inclusion of BEST in graduate and undergraduate coursework:   BEST and other green infrastructure for water quality enhancement were included in graduate and undergraduate courses   Chemical Transport in the Environment (required undergraduate and graduate course in Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering degree programs), Colorado School of Mines Senior Design, College of Engineering &amp; Computational Science, Colorado School of Mines  Special Topics Graduate Course, Stanford University      Signature Educational Experiences have been provided for numerous undergraduate students, which is a significant priority for our university, as well as for non-thesis Master’s students, which is a significant priority for our department:  A multi-disciplinary senior design team (Civil, electrical, mechanics, and design engineering students) in our College of Engineering is working on implementing a BEST system in the City of Golden CO. Six undergraduate researchers have received multi-year research experiences on our project.   3 REU undergraduate students from outside our university (including one from a community college) have received summer research experiences on our project Four non-thesis Master’s students have received year-long research experiences on our project. One Non-thesis MS degree student (Paige Becker) continued in a PhD program in streambed science and engineering at Indiana University One undergraduate student, Franco Pilone, went on to a MS Thesis program in the environment in       Infrastructure:  An impressive pilot-scale artificial streams experimental system has been built at Colorado School of Mines to test the BEST technology.  This facility will remain at Mines after the project is over, and provide opportunities for continued research on urban stream pollution as well as natural streambed interactions (also called the hyporheic zone, or "river’s liver").     Partnerships with International Research Agencies  Conducted joint experiments with the Federal Environment Agency, Berlin Germany. Prof. McCray delivered Key note lecture for the Annual Meeting of the International Association of Hydrogeolgoists, Irish Section.
