<AbstractNarration>Principal Investigator: Blockstein&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No:  1505341&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Council of Energy Research and Education Leaders (CEREL) of the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) will hold the inaugural National Energy Education Summit on January 26, 2015 in Washington, DC.  This conference award will provide partial support for this Summit. The Summit will be an opportunity for energy, environmental, and STEM educators in K-12, higher education, and informal education to gather with leaders from the private sector, government, and civil society to share best practices and develop new partnerships in order to expand the scale, impact and effectiveness of energy education.  The Summit will engage energy educators at all levels to build, improve and expand energy education to serve the needs of students and citizens.  The Summit will promote teaching, learning and training to help to build an interdisciplinary field of energy education. Sessions will specifically deal with improved teaching and learning as well as development of programs such as majors, minors, and certificates that facilitate teaching and learning.  Furthermore, the Summit will provide financial support for presenters from under-represented populations, and will have at least one session focused on engagement of under-represented populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Council of Energy Research and Education Leaders (CEREL) of the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) will hold the inaugural National Energy Education Summit on January 26, 2015 in Washington, DC.  This conference award will provide partial support for this Summit. The Summit will be an opportunity for energy, environmental and STEM educators in K-12, higher education, and informal education to gather with leaders from business and industry, government, and civil society to share best practices and develop new partnerships in order to expand the scale, impact and effectiveness of energy education. Education and workforce training for the energy infrastructure that powers national and regional economies traditionally relies on science and engineering fields. However, education on energy topics should also embrace political economy, history, ethics, environmental, and cultural studies, as well as science and engineering.  Towards this end, the broadly-defined, interdisciplinary field of energy studies is advancing rapidly.  The National Energy Education Summit seeks to further define the principles of energy literacy need to operationalize the field of energy studies.  In this context, the overall goal of the Summit is to expand the scale, impact and effectiveness of energy education through energy studies. The Summit will engage energy educators at all levels to build, improve and expand energy education to serve the needs of students and citizens. The agenda will include issues at both the classroom level (content, curriculum and pedagogy) and at the programmatic level (degree and sub-degree programs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summit will promote teaching, learning and training to help to build an interdisciplinary field of energy education. Many of the sessions will specifically deal with improved teaching and learning. Other sessions will explore programs such as majors, minors, and certificates that facilitate teaching and learning.  Furthermore, the Summit will provide financial support for presenters from under-represented populations, and will have at least one session focused on engagement of under-represented populations.</AbstractNarration>
