<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project focuses on designing exercises and developing a set of computational methods to measure and enhance semantic-based creativity in the workforce. When hiring a prospect or training an existing employee, there is no efficient way to measure one's problem solving abilities.  In order to be an efficient problem solver, an employee must possess the knowledge (e.g., an employee is given a problem whose solution she has witnessed or contributed to previously) and the employee needs to think creatively (e.g., the employee encounters a novel problem; in most scenarios, creative employees use brainstorming methods to generate a number of possible solutions and test possible solutions to arrive at the best answer).  This project's unique approach is the design of models, where creativity and divergent thinking is measured and a CQ index is generated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using advanced techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and psychometric approach, the project evaluates the responses and generates an index called "Creativity Quotient," which represents users' creativity. The responses are evaluated based three factors: fluency (# of unique and relevant ideas), flexibility (# of categories of responses) &amp; originality (infrequency and uniqueness of responses). The technique deploys a word or phrase-based associative weight where the algorithm measures the uniqueness of associations between words and phrases. Unique associations receive higher weighting.</AbstractNarration>

According to this model, oneÆs creative thinking abilities are measured based on four indices &ndash; Fluency, Flexibility, Originality and Elaboration.  Based on collaboration with our resident psychologist and subject-matter expert, a scaling factor for each index has been created:  Fluency: # of unique and relevant responses - 1 &ndash; 1,000 (90th percentile &gt; 900) Flexibility: # of distinct categories of responses - 1 &ndash; 1,000 (90th percentile &gt; 900) Originality: Statistical infrequency of responses - 1 &ndash; 1,000 (90th percentile &gt; 900 Elaboration: Measure of details per each response - 1 &ndash; 1,000 (90th percentile &gt; 900)   Two exercises named ResqueIt and ZomIt have been developed.  Each exercise measures one or more of the indices above.  We have used numerous reliability and validation techniques drawn from the psychometric approaches to conduct corresponding reliability and validity studies. They are CronbachÆs alpha for internal reliability, Factor Analysis for construct validity, and classical PearsonÆs product-moment correlation for criterion validity.    Correlation study between CQ measures and GPA; as part of this study, it was crucial to ensure that, we are not measuring oneÆs knowledge. Hence, we performed a quick study to measure the correlation between GPA and CQ measures (Originality, Flexibility, Fluency, Elaboration).  The Pearson-correlation between the SAT, GRE and ACTÆs score and CQ measures are below 0.35; hence SparcItÆs dimensions do not measure or correlated with any of the standardized tests.

The term storytelling is an over-arching concept that attests to the ability of a person to form and tell a story. The grading rubric for the storytelling features five main criteria: ideas, form, flavor, mechanics, and wording. The ideas criterion pertains to the relevance of the story, as well as its clarity. The form criterion reflects the organization of the text, and the inclusion of necessary structural parts. The flavor criterion judges the style of the text, and its consistence throughout. The mechanics criterion straightforwardly judges the grammar and punctuation of the story. The wording criterion reflects the choice of words, and their arrangement.
