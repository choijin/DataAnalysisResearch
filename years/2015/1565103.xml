<AbstractNarration>Global-scale environmental issues such as food security, the spread of disease, and the availability of clean water emphasize the importance of environmental data that can address specific problems while also providing predictions of future conditions. The increasing availability of large volumes of different kinds of data offers new opportunities to address these issues. This project will provide the environmental research community with efficient and reliable means for data management, storage, and sharing. The facilities developed will allow researchers, policy makers, managers, and other stakeholders to bring relevant data to bear on complex environmental questions. Modern approaches that encourage geographically distributed collaboration will be used to increase efficiency of data curation beyond those available for single projects. The project will provide the training and skills needed to overcome technical and social barriers to collaboration, thereby enhancing infrastructure to address ecological questions over broad spatial and temporal scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in environmental sciences is often conducted by individual investigators over limited spatial and temporal scales under funding models that provide limited capacity for data curation or sharing. Data that are archived in a stable, accessible repository and that are accompanied by appropriate metadata benefit both data producers and consumers through improved discoverability and reliability. This project builds on expertise available in the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) community to provide these benefits. The Provenance Aware Synthesis Architecture repository will ensure long-term availability of data and open data access through federations such as DataONE. This system will be expanded in several ways to accommodate a broader community of data providers and users. These enhancements include a scalable user identity management system, improved data documentation procedures to simplify data submission for non-technical users, and expand the data-quality assurance tools to accommodate a broader range of community practices. Training activities will be developed that range from the basics of metadata creation to the adoption of standardized best practices for specific types of data. The development of templates for describing a data lifecycle will accelerate the availability of data for synthesis. The project will leverage the collective experience of the LTER community to improve data management across a broad community through communication and collaboration. It will facilitate shared technology to develop more commonly usable and more efficient approaches to data curation workflows. Participants in training workshops will be trained in developing workflow technology, re-using existing workflows, and archiving and sharing their developments. Through these workshops, together with community-level centers of expertise, and individual-based skill exchanges, the project will increase the volume of data available along with data discoverability and reuse. These advances will accelerate scientific inquiry through data curation and publication as well as through data discovery and integration.</AbstractNarration>

Without data the results derived from research would have no valid basis for which to make decisions or to draw conclusions. Long-term synthesis studies would be impossible to perform if data from prior or synergistic efforts were not available to compare or use as inputs for derived products. To ensure that scientific data (1) persists into the future and (2) are freely and easily accessible to the broader community, the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) in July 2016 continued the legacy of stewardship of data that began with technology developed under the Long Term Ecological Research Network program of NSF. EDI has successfully transitioned the PASTA+ data repository software from an LTER exclusive system to one that serves the Long Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB), the Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS), and the Macrosystem Biology (MSB) programs at NSF. In addition, EDI provided an open repository for ecological and environmental scientists in need of data publication and archive services.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>As demonstrated in the Figure "Data package uploads", scientists and researchers continued to use EDI's full service data repository regularly from the project's beginning in July 2016 (red dashed-line) to its first phase conclusion in September 2019. This chart shows data package upload frequency (weekly) and cumulatively over the current life of the repository. The number of data packages submitted by individual scientists has now grown to over 17,500, with over 5,000 data packages being submitted during EDI's grant period. The EDI data repository curates more than 80,000 data packages total, with a majority of these data packages being added early in the repository's life from large, one-time synthesis projects, like those from the LTER Landsat satellite program and the Ecotrends project. As clearly indicated, environmental and ecological data continue to be published and archived to the EDI data repository, which is critical to preservation and legacy of scientific data.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The pie chart Figure breaks down the type of data archived in the EDI data repository by the number of data files and total volume of data stored. Tabular data files, at 80%, are the most common type of data file stored in the repository, followed by geographic (i.e., map), compressed (e.g., Zip), and image data. There are well over 220,000 individual data files in the EDI data repository today (one or more data files make up a data package, along with a single science metadata file).&nbsp; The most voluminous data (those that require the greatest storage space) are compressed files (e.g., Zip) at 52%, which contain a variety of different data types that are not easily distinguishable at first glance. These are followed by tabular data at 22% and geographic, imagery, non-compressed binary, and other data at between 5-6%, each. The total volume of data stored within the EDI data repository now equals about 10 Terabytes. EDI bears witness to a change in the type of data being stored in the repository: more often today, scientists are asking to archive very large (100's of Gigabytes) data files so that they may be published for broader use. These data are now becoming more common as new technology increases both the fidelity and frequency of data collection.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>EDI has actively supported the scientific data publication and archive life-cycle through events such as teaching data management best practices, providing webinars on using the EDI data repository, and engaging the scientific community through outreach and assistance at nationally organized meetings and conferences. The single photographic image is of an EDI representative providing data-related information at the 2017 American Geophysical Union meeting "Data Help Desk" in New Orleans, <span>Louisiana</span>. In summary, EDI had contributed presentations or posters at over 40 national meetings, issued 17 "newsletters", provided 42 webinars, workshops, or hack-a-thon sessions, consulted 230 times with scientific data collaborators, contributed 26 new information management "best practices", and submitted 5 peer-reviewed publications about scientific data management.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Perhaps the greatest measure of EDI's impact on society is the use and reuse of environmental and ecological data published and archived in the repository by researchers who were either directly involved in the data's provenance or have used the data in a related synthesis project. This measure (see Figure "Publications citing EDI archived data"), computed by analyzing peer-reviewed publications, reports, or memoirs for EDI registered Digital Object Identifiers through Google Scholar, shows a significant upward trend in the citation of data archived in the EDI data repository, with the greatest citation use during the later years of the EDI grant period. Although not conclusive, such a trend is likely the result of EDI's goal to make scientific data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) - an edict of scientific data publishers world-wide.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/20/2019<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;W&nbsp;Brunt</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1565103/1565103_10436182_1576551103562_uploads-EDI--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1565103/1565103_10436182_1576551103562_uploads-EDI--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Data Package Uploads"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1565103/1565103_10436182_1576551103562_uploads-EDI--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Data Package Uploads"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Frequency and cumulative uploads of data packages to the Environmental Data Initiative data repository.
