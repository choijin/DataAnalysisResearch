<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the conference "Dynamics of Evolution Equations" to be hosted by the Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques in Luminy, France from March 21 through March 25, 2016.  Dynamical systems is an all-encompassing field, which has thriven through the continuous interaction with other sciences and engineering.  The present conference has a blend of presentation of current research and tutorials covering the interaction of dynamical systems and biology, control engineering and other applied subjects.  The format, small size, and location, of the Conference are perfectly suited for learning and scientific exchange, and particularly appropriate for young researchers, who will be able to interact with senior researchers and gain both scientific knowledge and international experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific focus of the conference will cover the following topics: Differential equations and their discrete time analogues, Partial Differential equations, Stochastic differential equations, Functional differential equations and equations with delayed effects, Problems on networks (problems on graphs), Discontinuous and hybrid systems, Control theory, and Modeling in biological and social systems. These are subjects which are timely and widely important.  It is anticipated that interactions among participants will lead to the development of new directions of research and to the strengthening and fostering of international collaborations.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The support provided by the Grant helped defray some of the expenses that researchers from the USA encumbered for participating in the conference "Dynamics of Evolution Equations.'' The conference was held at the Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques (CIRM) in Luminy (France), during March 21 -- March 25, 2016.  The conference consisted in plenary presentations, invited contributions, and a poster session, all broadly concerned with theoretical aspects of dynamical systems and their applications:  Partial Differential equations, Stochastic differential equations, Functional differential equations and equations with delayed effects, Problems on networks (problems on graphs), Discontinuous and hybrid systems, Control theory, and Modeling in biological and social systems.   The majority (60%) of the support went to PhD students and Postdoctoral fellows, who were especially target for support.  One of the 9 supported students gave an invited presentation, and five more presented their research at the Poster session.  The intellectual merits of this activity were chiefly concerned with aiding dissemination, training, and collaboration.  Particularly, to enhance exposure of doctoral students and young researchers on challenging, fundamental, and timely research topics.  The chief broader impact of the activity was to allow students and post-docs from  the USA to participate, and to use the acquired knowledge as a foundational step in their scientific development.  In the time since the conference took place, we know first hand of students who gave seminars on what they learned, and maintained scientific contact with people whom they met at the Conference.
