<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made on a collaborative proposal and supports computational and theoretical research and education on novel complex materials for which the arrangement of atoms cannot be described by regular spatially periodic patterns typical of a crystalline material. These non-crystalline materials have complicated atomic-scale structures and are part of everyday life.  They are important for the development of new devices, corrosion-resistant coatings, artificial bone, and other advanced materials.  Conventional computational modeling approaches involve a simulation process that leads to a computer model which is then compared to experiment. In contrast, the research team aims to build known experimental or other information into the process of the simulation itself through a new approach with a basis in information theory. The research contributes new methods and computational tools for materials modeling and the discovery of new materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics outreach program focused on the southern Mississippi region. It involves the participation of minority students at the high school and college level, and the development of a tutorial program for gifted undergraduates at the University of Southern Mississippi. The program will build on the experiences of the entire team. This award also contributes to the development of a computational materials program with a focus on complex materials. The PIs aim to create a broader collaborative program on materials computation that builds on the strengths of neighboring universities and serves the southern Mississippi region. The research will involve international collaborations with the University of Cambridge, and provide international research experience to students supported under the award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made on a collaborative proposal and supports theoretical research and computational modeling of complex amorphous materials and educational outreach. The research team aims to develop a new approach to the modeling of complex non-crystalline materials that incorporates experimental information through an appropriate total-energy functional that jointly satisfies both theory and experimental data.  The determination of structure of complex amorphous solids is posed as an inverse or hybrid problem. The problem is mapped onto a multi-objective non-convex optimization program. The team will utilize recently developed bio-inspired global optimization techniques to address the problem. An integration of theory and experiments will be achieved by developing a mathematical framework to enable the search for structural solutions in an augmented solution space consisting of a direct product of the configurational space of a suitable total-energy functional and the solution space spanned by a set of input experimental data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting experimentally constrained molecular/atomic relaxation approach will be applied to several problems in amorphous materials ranging from superionic conduction in solid glassy-electrolytes and modeling large-scale inhomogeneities in amorphous solids to the structural and dynamical properties of few representative metallic and bulk metallic glasses at the intermediate length scale. In particular, the superionic conduction in solid glassy-oxides will be reviewed in light of the new hybrid models by incorporating structural information at the intermediate length scale from experiments, which is of direct significance in developing durable solid-state batteries, smart sensors, and portable, fuel cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics outreach program focused on the southern Mississippi region.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The reconstruction of three-dimensional models of noncrystalline solids from experimental data constitutes an archetypal example of inverse problems in materials modeling. Inverse approaches provide a distinct route to design complex disordered materials by directly incorporating a set of experimental observables in simulation methodologies. To this end, the key purpose of the project was to develop data-driven inverse and hybrid approaches.&nbsp; While inverse approach relu on experimental data only,&nbsp; a hybrid approach combines the strength of experimental data&nbsp; with approximate first-principles or semi-empirical&nbsp; total-energy functionals in order to develop accurate&nbsp; structural solutions and the resulting structural, electronic&nbsp; and vibrational obtained therefrom.<br /><br />We have developed a number methods, such as Force-Enhanced&nbsp; Atomic Relaxation (FEAR), information-based inverse approach&nbsp; (INDIA), and multiobjective constrained Monte Carlo (MQ-CMC)&nbsp; approaches.&nbsp; The structural solutions from these methods were&nbsp; then employed to study structural and electronic properties&nbsp; of noncrystalline&nbsp; materials, for example, amorphous silicon&nbsp; (<em>a</em>-Si) and its hydrogenated counterpart, amorphous graphene,&nbsp; vitreous silica, chalcogenide glasses and putative ground-state&nbsp; structures of Fe, Ni and Cu clusters.<br /><br />The project led to the publication of more than 20 peer-reviewed papers in high-impact international journals,&nbsp; including Physical Review Applied, Scientific Reports and Nanoscale.&nbsp; A complete list of publications can be found in the Final NSF Report.</p> <p>Among many notable achievements, the project addressed a difficult inverse problem involving structural determination of complex materials from a knowledge of diffraction data and a set of structural constraints.&nbsp; Although the problem was suggested in the 1980s in order to determine the structure of disordered/partially-disordered solids by inverting diffraction data, an accurate structural solution was still not available until 2019, despite significant efforts in the past decades. This led to a conjecture that the inversion problem was ill defined and that an accurate inversion of one-dimensional diffraction data might not be possible, without using additional information. By adopting an information-driven probabilistic viewpoint, and posing the structural determination of noncrystalline solids as an inferential problem, the problem of materials-structure determination was addressed as an multiobjective optimization program, jointly supported by experimental data and information. This finally led to the desired accurate solution of this long-standing problem, which employed only experimental diffraction data but no total-energy functionals.&nbsp; This is a major achievement toward developing a truly information-based approach to complex disordered solids without using total energies and forces. This approach will be particularly useful in studying complex multicomponent disordered systems (e.g., metallic and bulk metallic glasses), where it is difficult to construct accurate empirical/semiempirical force fields, and full quantum-mechanical calculations are simply computationally infeasible.</p> <p>Likewise, the project successfully addressed computational modeling of hydrogen-rich nanometer-size voids in a-Si in order to study the temperature induced morphological changes in voids. While the problem (of morphology of voids) has been extensively studied experimentally, using small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), hydrogen-effusion measurements, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, etc., there exist no credible large-scale computational studies until our work that can truly address the problem on the nanometer length scale. The difficulties here involve: 1) the generation of ultra-large realistic models of a-Si, with a linear size of several nanometers, in order to include nano-size voids, with a void-volume fraction as observed in SAXS and IR measurements; 2) the computational complexity associated with conducting quantum-mechanical simulation of nanometer-size voids in the presence of hydrogen for studying structural evolution.&nbsp; The project successfully addressed these problems by producing ultra-large a-Si models, via high-quality classical molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations, and the subsequent quantum-mechanical treatment of hydrogen dynamics in the vicinity of nanometer-size voids.&nbsp; This made it possible to study the morphology of voids in real space and the role of hydrogen in the reconstruction of void surfaces at low and high annealing temperatures. This work is featured in the cover page of Royal Society journal Nanoscale.</p> <p>From the point of view of broader impact, the project brough exciting opportunities for the development of research and training facilities in materials modeling in Mississippi. A number of high-school, undergraduate (UG) and graduate students participated in computational research projects. The PI at the USM organized a week-long computational workshop for UG and high-school students, exchanged graduate students with the collaborating sites at Arlington (TX) and Athens (OH), and developed a research program of highest international standing in computational materials by collaborating with groups based in Cambridge (UK), Athens (Ohio) and Arlington (TX). The project resulted in the production of two (2) PhD dissertations at the USM and several MS research projects by thesis and project options. The MS students successfully completed their program and moved on to continue for their PhD degree elsewhere in the USA. This directly contributes to the goal of producing the next generation STEM graduates for the research and development sector in the USA. Finally, the project indirectly contributed to organize a summer school in computational modeling of materials for historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) by the PI in June 2019.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/03/2020<br>      Modified by: Parthapratim&nbsp;Biswas</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1507166/1507166_10407772_1580702174765_FIG5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1507166/1507166_10407772_1580702174765_FIG5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nanoscale structure of hydrogen-rich voids in a-Si:H at room temperature"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1507166/1507166_10407772_1580702174765_FIG5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nanoscale structure of hydrogen-rich voids in a-Si:H at room temperature"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The distribution of H atoms inside a void in a-Si:H, obtained from density-functional calculations.
