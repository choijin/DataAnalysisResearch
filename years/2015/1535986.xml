<AbstractNarration>Advanced research and development in industrial sectors ranging from life sciences to electronics, requires interdisciplinary efforts to pool knowledge in order to extend the technological frontier. This project will inform managerial approaches to heighten the chance of commercial success for interdisciplinary R&amp;D programs. The National Institutes of Health's Nanomedicine Development Centers (NDCs), a research program designed with a ten-year horizon to fund not only basic nanomedicine science but its translation into clinical outcomes provides an opportunity to study the organization and outcomes of science. The clinical applications are expected to improve health outcomes and the efficiency of the U.S. healthcare system. The NDC researchers come from a variety of disciplines, including biology, integrative physiology, computational biology, neurobiology, genetics, chemistry, biomolecular engineering, oncology and ophthalmology, and thus understanding their ability to engage in interdisciplinary integration is paramount to their success. This research will help improve strategies for forming and managing interdisciplinary teams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project introduces an analytical approach to examining the antecedents and payoffs to interdisciplinary R&amp;D. This study considers the researchers' prior experience with interdisciplinary research, in conjunction with the variety, distance, and interdependence of the disciplines represented in their respective NDC teams. This research is grounded in the theory of human capital accumulation, defined as the knowledge, experience and skills by individuals. A related management literature has examined how human capital contributes to innovation and firm financial performance. This research extends these literatures by analyzing how interdisciplinary interaction influences human capital accumulation and scientific achievement. Two primary measures of scientific impact are employed by this study: quality-weighted forward citations to the publications resulting from each research program; and the progress made towards commercial application. Survey data provide additional insights into the drivers of success for interdisciplinary teams.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF award #1535986 funded the research group (Professors Melissa Appleyard, Beverly Tyler, Turanay Caner, and Dr. Griffin Weber&ndash;consultant) to examine the antecedents, team mechanisms, and payoffs associated with the interdisciplinary R&amp;D conducted at the Nanomedicine Development Centers (NDCs) funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH NDC research program was designed with a projected ten-year horizon, to provide funding not only for basic nanomedicine science but also to translate this research into clinical outcomes. Because the NDC researchers represented a variety of disciplines, including biology, integrative physiology, computational biology, neurobiology, genetics, chemistry, biomolecular engineering, oncology and ophthalmology, understanding their ability to engage in interdisciplinary integration is paramount to their success and that of the NDC Program.  The overarching goal of this NSF project was to assess the determinants of successful interdisciplinary research and development by pursuing these four primary goal areas: 1) conducting interviews with NIH personnel to better understand the governance structure of the NDC Program; 2) studying the NDC researchers' prior experience with interdisciplinary research and assess the variety, distance, and interdependence of the disciplines represented in the eight NIH NDC teams; 3) examining how experience, variety, distance, and interdependence are associated with researchers? publication patterns before and after the formation of their NDC team; and 4) exploring the mechanisms used to transfer, translate, and transform interdisciplinary knowledge&mdash;this process is defined as "knowledge meshing"&mdash;in the eight NDCs.  This project aims to contribute to the team science and innovation streams of scholarly and practitioner literature in the management field by analyzing how approaches to interdisciplinary R&amp;D influence scientific outcomes; and how interdisciplinary research teams pool their varied knowledge stocks for discovery and translation into clinical application, and consequentially develop capabilities in knowledge meshing.  R&amp;D teams with members from a range of fields can face issues as cross-disciplinary conflicts or disagreements arise.  Therefore, it is important to unpack the behavioral aspects of working in and managing interdisciplinary teams.  For example, rather than forming a large interdisciplinary team to pursue a research goal, a funding agency could coordinate smaller disciplinary-specific teams, which could mitigate these issues on each team but lead to difficulties when research results are handed off across teams. We intend for the findings of this research to provide direction and managerial insights for principal investigators and public policy leaders in the realm of advanced science and engineering research to heighten success of interdisciplinary R&amp;D.  As a result of this NSF-funded study of NIH Nanomedicine Centers we were able to interview NIH research staff, collect and analyze extensive publication and citation data for scientists working in the eight NDC centers, and design and conduct a survey to assess behavioral aspects of the work done in the teams. Our interviews with NIH research staff allowed us to better contextualize the study, interpret the secondary data in our empirical study, and design the survey administered to the NDC participants.

We believe that both will have important impacts on research and pedagogical methods in public policy and management disciplines for two reasons.  First, the availability of our dataset and Stata routines will increase the likelihood of other scholars conducting empirical research exploring interdisciplinary science.  Second, the dataset built as a result of this NSF grant provides an empirical context for testing theories about the role of interdisciplinary research to effectively address major scientific challenges in human health research including the pursuit of personalized medicine.  While bibliometric analysis has been used in management, public policy, and team science literatures to assess the output of interdisciplinary teams, little is known about the behavioral processes involved.
