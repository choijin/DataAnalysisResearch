<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Kim Williams of the Colorado School of Mines to develop thermal field-flow fractionation (ThFFF) as a versatile platform for separating and characterizing complex nanoscale materials. Thermal diffusion in liquids is a transport phenomenon that presents fertile ground for developing new measurement capabilities because it is founded on different principles than existing methods. The planned close collaboration with synthesis and engineering groups is ideal for maximizing research impact across different fields. Given the significant rise in the synthesis and application of polymers and organic/inorganic/metallic nanoparticle hybrids in fields such as energy, biomedicine, and coatings, the platform being targeted has significant potential for broad scientific, educational and environmental impact. In addition, an outreach program developed by Professor Williams introduces activities related to nanoscale materials to K-12 teachers of disadvantaged Denver school districts and the Rocky Mountain Camp for Dyslexic children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on understanding of the relationship between thermal diffusion and polymer-solvent or nanoparticle-solvent parameters for the purpose of developing thermal field-flow fractionation (ThFFF) as a central tool for the analysis and study of currently intractable systems. Thermal diffusion in liquids continues to represent a fertile ground for developing separations and analyses that are founded on a different basis than existing methods. The proposed work is aimed at enhancing  understanding of thermal diffusion and polymer-solvent or nanoparticle-solvent parameters that drive this transport process. Strategic libraries of materials with specifically chosen levels of complexities have been chosen, e.g., polymers with a varying set of controlled backbone lengths, side chain lengths, and grafting densities have been selected in order to enable the Williams research team to identify the main analyte properties that contribute to thermal diffusion in different solvents and to assess existing thermal diffusion theories.  The overarching objectives include identifying specific co-polymer architectures and their distributions, assessing thermal diffusion trends of organic and metal hybrid nanoparticles, and demonstrating surface composition-based separations and analyses. The proposed studies are also expected to shed light on which of the prevailing models best describes polymer dynamics and dynamics of polymer systems that are confined.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focussed on developing new measurement capabilities for nanoscale materials, particularly polymers and inorganic- and bio-nanoparticles. These materials are often present in complex and heterogeneous environments that make the measurement of their size, composition, or architecture distributions challenging. Obtaining this level of detailed information requires an initial separation stage whereby each component is spatially separated into different ‘bins’ followed by the analysis of contents in each bin. This two stage approach is accomplished using field-flow fractionation (FFF) with multiple detectors. In general, FFF techniques are well suited for nanomaterials and larger sizes because separation is implemented in an open channel rather than in the packed columns prevalent in chromatography. Consequently, recovery of sample after separation is usually higher because analytes are not ‘trapped’ within the packing media.  The thermal FFF (ThFFF) separation mechanism is based on a ratio between two transport processes, thermal diffusion (DT) and normal diffusion (D), also known as the Soret (ST) coefficient. Measured DT values are shown to correlate to the composition of platinum-iron oxide hybrid nanoparticles and measured ST values are shown to yield information about the degree of branching and architecture of polymers. Both characteristics have a large impact on the properties of these materials and the products that incorporate them.  A second technique, asymmetrical flow FFF (AF4) was demonstrated as a significantly faster alternative to isolating lipoproteins from human plasma samples than currently used ultracentrifugation methods. In addition, AF4 was used to investigate the aggregation kinetics of a biotherapeutic protein and semi-preparative capabilities were developed.   Advances within the analytical science field include the introduction of new approaches to separate and characterize complex nano-objects in very different sample matrices and in widely disparate fields. The ThFFF system’s ability to determine the degree of branching in polymers in the absence of a linear polymer analogue with the same chemistry is a significant development as linear analogues are often not available. ThFFF’s nanoparticle composition sensitivity is a new strategy in a relatively sparse analytical toolbox. The ability to process larger amounts of sample, e.g., semi-preparative AF4, and faster separations are key to enhancing current applications in both the materials and biology disciplines. The availability of larger amounts of uniform nanomaterials can facilitate materials testing for product development while the faster bio-nanoparticle separations is expected to enhance future disease biomarker investigations.  The broader impacts of this project include:  1)      Increased use of thermal FFF &ndash; our research group is actively disseminating information through short courses, training students in other research groups, and collaborating with industrial scientists.  2)      Five graduate and four undergraduate students and one postdoctoral have received training and professional development opportunities through this project.  Students are learning to work as individuals and as a team on open ended questions and are honing their scientific communication skills through presentations and co-authoring papers.  3)      To help increase diversity in STEM, we have developed science experiments related to polymers and conducted them at the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Early College school in Denver and at the Rocky Mountain Camp for dyslexic children.
