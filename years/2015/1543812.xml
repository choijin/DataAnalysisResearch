<AbstractNarration>This award supports the fifth "Gone Fishing" meeting on Poisson Geometry to be held at the University of Colorado at Boulder from March 31 to April 3, 2016.  The "Gone Fishing" workshop series consists of regular meetings in North America of mathematicians interested in Poisson Geometry and its applications, attracting leading experts and young researchers alike.  The aim of the series is to promote interaction between mathematicians, physicists, and groups working on related areas having different perspectives.  As these various fields continue to progress further, it is becoming increasingly urgent to encourage more interaction and cross fertilization between them. Last but not least the "Gone Fishing" meetings  provide a unique forum forjunior mathematicians from all over the United States to  learn about cutting edge developments in Poisson Geometry and to disseminate  their own research results in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poisson Geometry originates as the mathematical formulation of classical mechanics as the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics.  Its history begins with 19th century classics by Poisson, Hamilton, Jacobi, and Lie, developing into a separate field in its own right around 1980 via the works of Lichnerowicz and Weinstein.  Today, Poisson Geometry intersects and is applied to many areas of mathematics, including symplectic geometry, generalized complex geometry, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, cluster algebras, integrable systems, quantization, non-commutative geometry, stratification theory, and the geometry of singular symplectic and Poisson structures. The "Gone Fishing" workshops provide an excellent opportunity for scientists based in North America to exchange ideas and stimulate collaboration. Each workshop has a goal to address important questions and future directions of the subject. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;URL: http://math.colorado.edu/gonefishing2016/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Gone Fishing meetings on Poisson geometry started with a first conference at Washington University, St. Louis in 2011 and evolved into the major yearly national event where senior and junior researchers in the field of Poisson geometry meet and discuss the latest developments.   In 2016, the Gone Fishing workshop was held at the University of Colorado Boulder from March 10 to 13. Special lectures were given by  Rui Loja Fernandes, University of Illinois Eckhard Meinrenken, University of Toronto Brent Pym, University of Oxford Alan Weinstein, University of California Berkeley   Overall, there were 46 registered participants from around 20 different institutions in North America, one participant from Brazil, and one participant from the UK.The majority of participants, altogether 28, could give a talk.The main themes covered in these talks were on groupoid theory, symplectic realizations and integrability of Poisson manifolds, singular Poisson structures, quantization theory, symplectic geometry and geometric mechanics.   One of the main goals of the workshop was to get more young researchers from the USA, especially graduate students and postdocs, involved.  Overall, the conference was a big success due to the quality of presentations, the diversity of participants, and the achieved goal of greater involvement of young researchers.  The remaining funds were used in the years 2017 and 2018 to support research visits and talks of experts in Poisson geometry, topology, differential geometry and related areas at the University of Colorado.
