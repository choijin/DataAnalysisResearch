<AbstractNarration>Upper-level weather charts typically show large-scale wave patterns which are closely associated with the surface fronts, cyclones, and anticyclones that make up daily weather in the middle latitudes.  The movements of these waves, and the surface weather patterns connected to them, is driven in large measure by the mean westerly jet streams along which they propagate.  The mean jet streams are in turn strongly affected by the behavior of the waves, thus the topic of wave-mean flow interaction is essential for understanding and predicting midlatitude weather.  Classical wave-mean flow interaction theory offers powerful insights, but it is based on linear wave dynamics and thus is only formally valid for small amplitude, or infinitesimal, waves.  This is a substantial limitation given the waviness of the real-world atmosphere, and the PI has devoted considerable effort to the development of a more general theory which holds for waves of finite amplitude (see AGS-1151790 and AGS-0750916).  The present work applies this theory to several topics in atmospheric dynamics, including the 20-30 day oscillation found in the eddy kinetic energy of the Southern Hemisphere storm track (see AGS-1343080). Preliminary work suggests that the oscillation satisfy a wave action conservation relationship and the periodicity is related to wave-induced poleward surface heat flux.  Another topic is the dynamics of atmospheric blocking episodes, and a localized version of the wave-mean flow framework is developed to address this problem.  Other topics include the roles of boundary layer damping and condensational heating in wave-mean flow interaction.  The work is conducted through a combination of analysis of meteorological data (from reanalysis products) and simulations with various configurations of the Community Atmosphere Model (the atmospheric component model of the Community Earth System Model).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has broader impacts in both a scientific and societal sense, as the conceptual framework developed by the PI can be used by researchers to study a variety of phenomena related to climate variability and change.  Further downstream the improved understanding provided by the framework can benefit weather prediction on monthly to seasonal timescales and contribute to better understanding of the results of future climate projections used for decision support.  Beyond the benefits of the research itself, the project supports education through a summer school on atmospheric dynamics attended by about 30 graduate students and early career scientists.  The summer school includes a combination of lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities.   In addition, the project supports a graduate student and a postdoc, thereby training the next -generation workforce in this research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Weather and climate of Earth?s midlatitudes are dominated by the jet stream and large-scale eddies embedded in it.  For example, weather systems (extratropical cyclones and anticyclones) are closely associated with eastward moving ?troughs? and ?ridges? in the jet stream 5-6 miles above ground.   Anomalous behaviors of the jet stream often bring about unseasonable, sometimes extreme, weather.   Variability of the jet stream arises from its interaction with the eddies.  These eddies arise in part from spontaneous instability of the airflow, and in part from external forcing due to airflow disrupted by land masses.  Understanding the jet-eddy interaction is therefore key to both improving numerical weather forecasts and interpreting the results of climate simulations.  Although theory has been around for several decades, it has largely been limited to small-amplitude eddies and not amenable to the real atmosphere, where eddies attain large amplitude.  Only recently had the theory been extended to finite-amplitude and finally become applicable to data analysis.  In this project, we applied the new theoretical framework to meteorological data to elucidate how large eddies modify the jet stream and how the altered jet stream in turn affects the eddies.  A particular quantity of interest is wave activity, a measure of the waviness of the jet stream and eddy?s ability to modify angular momentum.  Through theory and data analysis we confirmed that there is strong anti-correlation between wave activity and the eastward wind speed of the jet.  That is, the wavier the jet stream, the slower the eastward component of its wind becomes.  If the jet stream becomes very wavy in some location, the eastward wind becomes weak, and this slows down migration of wave activity coming from upstream (west).  As a result, wave activity further accumulates there, making the jet even wavier and more stagnant.  We found that this positive feedback is the main mechanism for anomalous, persistent meandering of the jet stream known as atmospheric blocking, which often causes unusual weather (droughts, heat waves, extended rainfall, etc.).  We further demonstrated mathematically that the feedback process is analogous to the formation of traffic congestion on a highway: the jet stream is a weather highway and blocking is a traffic jam that develops once the highway is too loaded with wave activity.  To our knowledge, not only is this one of few successful theories of atmospheric blocking but also represents a rare instance in which a theory is directly verifiable with data and at the same time has a parallel in a different discipline (in this case transportation engineering).   Our theory allows to build a simple model of block formation under different flow parameters.  While not comprehensive as more sophisticated climate models, the simple model allows to conduct a large number of simulations economically, so a robust statistics of block formation may be obtained under controlled ?climate change? scenarios.  For example, if the jet stream gradually slows down (one of the projected long-term consequences of global warming), the frequency of wintertime blocking increases but eventually it becomes perpetual at the location of the preexisting ridges due to topography.   The theory of wave activity has been applied successfully to other anomalous behaviors of the jet stream as well, including stratospheric sudden warming (SSW), a major disruption of the polar vortex in the winter Arctic stratosphere.  While SSWs and atmospheric blocking are very different phenomena, they both involve the interaction between the jet stream and large-scale eddy that can be described by the wave activity theory.  This demonstrates the theory?s versatility, stemming from its foundation in the conservation of angular momentum and Kelvin?s circulation.
