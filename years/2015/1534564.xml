<AbstractNarration>A network bringing together scientists working with laboratory based collections of microbes is being established. The network will hold numerous workshops teaching best practices for managing, preserving, and distributing bacteria, fungi, and other microscopic organisms in the context of formal culture collections. Biosecurity and regulatory issues will also be emphasized at workshops. Additional goals include re-establishing a professional society of culture collection researchers in the US, developing internet based collection management tools, and fostering communication between US collections, foreign collections, and international collection networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collections of living microbes assure that current and past research and innovation are available to future generations of scientists. Biological materials which are made available via well managed collections represent the foundation of the modern biotechnology industry. Materials in culture collections impact fields as diverse as human health, agricultural productivity, biotechnology, and bio-diversity research.  While there are several professional collections in the US, most collections in the US are small and do not have long term strategies for survival. The network supported by this grant will ensure that smaller collections benefit from expertise available at larger living microbe collections.</AbstractNarration>

The original aims of the USCCN were:  Organize workshops to address the challenges faced by culture collections Coordinate community efforts for cyberinfrastructure Develop a formal off-site preservation plan  Fund visits by less experienced collection curators to successful culture collections to demonstrate best practices Strengthen contacts among US collections, and with international collections Explore mechanisms for long-term support of USCCN      Since 2012, USCCN has provided a unique venue for managers and curators of living and research-focused microbe collections to promote best practices and to engage the larger living collection community more broadly, both nationally and internationally.

Specific accomplishments of USCCN include:  USCCN held annual meetings covering various themes on issues such as use of specimens from collections in genome sequencing projects, the Nagoya Protocol, outreach programs, data standards, off-site cryopreserved backup services, and how to preserve endangered collections.  USCCN has also served as a sounding board for collection personnel to compare collection management practices such as databases, websites, international shipping challenges, and new products and services, most recently in the form of virtual meetings. Meeting discussions led to 12 peer-reviewed publications and book chapters co-authored by USCCN participants.  Collection personnel have traveled to visit other U.S. collections and to international culture collection conferences. Sixteen US microbial collections have cryopreserved off-site stocks at the USDA National Laboratory for Genetic Resource Preservation at Fort Collins, Colorado. Five collections deposited their online catalogs in the Global Catalog of Microorganisms, making the collections more visible to international researchers.
