<AbstractNarration>Continental hydrothermal systems have immense scientific and practical significance and are critically important to the Earth?s thermal budget and geochemical cycles. Continental hydrothermal systems are a primary source of economically important metal deposits, provide geothermal resources, support exotic ecosystems that are just beginning to be explored, and in some settings pose a significant geologic hazard via hydrothermal explosions. The subsurface conditions and processes that control these systems are poorly understood because they entail the flow of multi-phase and multi-component fluids through rocks with heterogeneous permeability fields that are perturbed by a multitude of geological and environmental processes. Carefully designed multidisciplinary field experiments and modeling efforts are &lt;br/&gt;required to understand the coupled processes that drive these dynamic systems and control their response to geological and environmental forcing. This project is focused on quantifying the response of continental hydrothermal systems to tectonic, magmatic, and climatic processes operating on time-scales from seconds to thousands of years. The PIs address important and timely scientific questions, such as: How do multi-phase fluids and dissolved constituents flux through hydrothermal systems? How do these systems redistribute elements to produce mineral deposits and microbial habitats? How do earthquakes and magmatic activity perturb hydrothermal systems? What triggers hydrothermal explosions? How do environmental processes and climate affect continental hydrothermal systems? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will involve a combination of fieldwork, data analysis, and modeling. The field program uses a combination of innovative instrument networks and sediment coring activities that will be integrated through modeling activities to study the response of the Yellowstone Lake hydrothermal system to tectonic, magmatic, and climatic forcing. Yellowstone Lake is an ideal site for this research because it hosts an active hydrothermal system located in a region with high levels of tectonic and magmatic activity that has been influenced by a broad range of climate conditions in postglacial times. Research activities will include components of geochemistry, seismology, geology, geodesy, heat flow, micropaleontology, limnology, paleoclimatology, statistics, analytical modeling, and numerical modeling, all of which are essential for unraveling the coupled processes that drive system behavior. Working on a lake-floor system provides an exceptional opportunity to study forcing-response relationships on an expanded range of time-scales spanning more than 11 orders of magnitude.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The Yellowstone caldera marks the leading edge of an active volcanic province and generates large heat and mass fluxes whcih are accompanied by high rates of seismicity, ground deformation and hydrothermal activity. Within the caldera and its surroundings, heat and mass transport is focused in thermal areas, including hot springs, geysers, mud pots, and fumaroles. While the thermal areas of Yellowstone National Park have been the subject of essentially continuous scientific investigations for more than a century, it has only recently been recognized that hydrothermal activity extends beneath several of the major lakes, and Yellowstone Lake, in particular. The contribution of the sublacustrine thermal areas to the overall heat and mass budgets of the Yellowstone Plateau, and their unique characteristics relative to subaerial systems, are just beginning to be understood.       The focus of our study is the Stevenson Island Deep Hole (SIDH), an area within Yellowstone Lake.  Yellowstone Lake, the largest high-altitude freshwater lake in North America, covers some 341 square kilometers of Yellowstone National Park in northwestern Wyoming. The SIDH is in the northern portion of Yellowstone Lake, is extremely hot, and hosts an active lake floor vent field.  These vents are located in the deepest part of the Deep Hole at water depths of 109 to 117 m (depths vary annually with lake level), and consist of &lt;10 cm diameter openings in the weakly consolidated soft sediment that forms the bottom of the vent field.  Measured temperatures of vent fluids were generally between 63 and 160&deg; C, although a temperature of 174&deg; C, corresponding to the in-situ saturation temperature,was measured at a depth of ~20 cm in throat of a vent.  The mean depth of these vents is 110 m below the lake surface and the mean discharge temperature is about 150&deg; C.  To better understand this area and thermal processes governing this vent field we collected several sets of thermal data.       We made 149 measurements of heat flow in and around the SIDH.  These measurements are used to assess the total heat being released and spatial patterns of heat flow around the vent field.  We find this region is releasing more than 2 orders of magnitude greater heat than the average of the caldera demonstrating that the heat source for this vent field is very focused.  Fluids rising through this system beneath the lake floor intersect the boiling curve and are converted to vapor.  This vapor rises, likely through natural fractures beneath the lake floor sediments, until it comes in contact with a low permeability lid, and when the vapor comes in contact with colder lake water it condenses releasing substantial quantities of heat.  The low permeability lid keeps lake water from flooding the vapor system.  A heat balance calculation indicates that fluids exiting the vents likely consist of ~19-22 wt% condensed steam and ~78-81 wt% lake water.  Spatial patterns of heat flow around the vent field show areas where water is entering and exiting this system.  The top of the vapor reservoir beneath the SIDH vent field is located at a depth of ~14 m below to the lake floor.  The estimated temperature at this interface between underlying steam and overlying liquid water is ~189&deg; C.  The difference in heat flux inside and outside the SIDH is likely due to the latent heat of condensation, and we estimate that conductive flux across the reservoir lid is accommodated by a vapor condensation rate of 0.3 kg s-1.  By comparison, we estimate that between 2.4 to 14 kg s-1 of vapor escapes through the lid to discharge into the lake as condensate through discrete vents.       We also installed probes at five sites that monitored changes in temperature as a function of time.  The probes extend to 1-m beneath the lake floor and house five thermistors.  The temperature time series demonstrate that thermal gradients in surficial sediments are controlled by a rich diversity of bottom water temperature variations that diffuse downward, and that inside thermal areas they also respond to hydrothermal variations, which diffuse upward. These data provide new insight into the thermal environment of surficial sediments, the thermo-physical properties of the lake sediments, and the impact of hydrothermal processes on these parameters.       Thermal data within the lake water column above the vent field show a hydrothermal plume.  During peak summer stratification, the plume had vertical velocities of up to ~10 cm/s in the mid&#8208;water column and generated a salinity anomaly of &minus;0.0014 psu (5% lower than background) at a neutral buoyancy depth of ~45 m, corresponding to a rise height of ~70 m.
