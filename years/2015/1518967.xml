<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Sebastian Franco at the City College of the City University of New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two pillars of our current understanding of the universe, Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, are mutually incompatible. String theory reconciles them, unifying all fundamental interactions in nature, including gravity, in a quantum theory. Fundamental physics is going through an era of exceptional developments, both at the experimental and theoretical fronts. Ongoing experiments are probing the basic structure of nature along a multitude of complementary directions, from the cosmological to the intensity frontiers. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has recently discovered the Higgs boson, the last missing piece of the Standard Model of particle physics, and is vigorously testing several of its possible extensions.  As part of his proposed research, Professor Franco will undertake a comprehensive investigation of the connection between string-theory models and our world. He will also study several new possibilities for physics beyond the Standard Model, with an emphasis on models with ingredients that appear generically in string theory or with a radical departure from conventional scenarios.  As such, the proposed research program will help preserve the United States' long-standing status at the cutting edge of string phenomenology. This proposal also has a significant broader-impact component. One of its salient elements is the creation of the "From the Collider to the Classroom" program, in which active physicists will present their research to high school teachers. The PI will actively engage undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral associates in his research, training them in research methods in theoretical physics. He also plans to introduce key improvements to the undergraduate research program at CCNY aimed at developing high-impact practices leading to deep approaches to learning. Finally, the PI will continue and strengthen his ongoing interdisciplinary collaborations bringing together the physics and mathematics communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, key objectives of this proposal are: a systematic derivation of precise features of the Standard Model, such as its flavor structure in local Type IIB string-theory constructions and comparison with experiments;  the development and implementation of new algorithms for a large-scale computer search of these models;  the study of favorable scenarios in which characteristic features of string theory can lead to recognizable imprints accessible to experiments;  a thorough investigation of a wide range of new supersymmetry-breaking and mediation scenarios and their implications for the LHC, and the development of new tools for studying global aspects of string compactifications and their incidence in experimentally measureable quantities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The two pillars of our current understanding of the universe, Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, are mutually incompatible. String theory reconciles them, unifying all fundamental interactions in nature, including gravity, in a quantum theory. Fundamental physics is going through an era of exceptional developments, both at the experimental and theoretical fronts. At the high-energy frontier, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has recently discovered the Higgs boson, the last missing piece of the Standard Model of particle physics and is vigorously testing several of its possible extensions. The primary goals of this proposal were to investigate how to derive the physics of our world from string theory constructions and to exploit string theory to deepen our understanding of quantum field theory, the framework that underlies our description of particle physics.  This project resulted on significant progress on several fronts, which include:     - We carried out a large-scale survey of singular geometries in Type IIB string theory and the quantum field theories that they give rise to. At present, this is the most exhaustive classification for this corner of string theory.  - Using the theories in this classification as starting points, we initiated a systematic search for viable extensions of the Standard Model in string theory.  - We created a new computational package for investigating string theory configurations and the corresponding quantum field theories. We made this package publicly available so other researchers can benefit from it.  - We introduced new tools that substantially simplify the map between the geometry of extra dimensions in string theory and quantum field theory.  - We developed a new geometric perspective on non-perturbative string theory effects. Such effects play a crucial role in several scenarios relating string theory to the physics of our universe.  - We found a geometric unification of quantum field theory dualities in different dimensions and proposed a completely new duality in 0d.

Our work builds on some of the most recent developments in cutting edge mathematics.

For this, we partnered with several nearby organizations, most of which serve an underprivileged population. This has allowed us to reach a large number of primarily minority elementary, middle and high school students.

At present, more than 350 students have attended and greatly enjoyed these activities.  - We have vigorously engaged in strengthening interdisciplinary interactions between physics and mathematics. This has been done in a variety of ways, including: collaborations with mathematicians, and research talks and lectures aimed at mathematical audiences.
