<AbstractNarration>The Langlands program aims at establishing deep relations between number theory (arithmetic information about integers, for example their factorization into products of primes) and harmonic analysis (for example, harmonic functions on certain space with additional symmetry). Such relations are often established through the understanding of certain spaces, called the modular varieties. In particular, the geometry of these spaces encodes fruitful arithmetic data that will help solve problems in both number theory and analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, one main objective is to give an explicit characterization of certain Newton strata of the special fiber of the modular varieties, including the basic stratum (in some cases). For one application, the Principal Investigator will seek to verify the Tate conjecture for the special fiber of modular varieties under some genericity condition. The explicit description is tied to the Taylor-Wiles modularity lifting technique for coherent cohomology of Hilbert modular varieties of low weight. It is also tied to the Euler system method that gives rise to results relating Selmer groups and the vanishing of p-adic L-functions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project develops a completely new and powerful tool in the so-called Langlands program by studying the geometry of Shimura varieties.  The Langlands program aims to exploit profound yet mysterious relations among three subjects:  (a) Analysis: typically involving questions of solving differential equations, like y'' + 3y = x; or more generally, understanding system of partial differential equations.  (b) Algebraic geometry: curves consisting of (x,y)'s such that y2=x3+x+1, or more generally certain higher dimensional spaces defined by system of polynomial equations.  (c) Arithmetic: involving typical question like which integer is the sum of two squares, or how many primes roughly there are that are less than a billion, or a trillion and etc.  The interplay of these three aspects allows one to attack important questions in one area using the tools from other areas. Most advancements in the Langlands program rely on the study of certain type of spaces, called the Shimura varieties. These are certain geometric spaces (and therefore is closely related to (b)), on which there are naturally defined differential equations (hence carries information from (a)). Moreover, they can be alternatively defined by some equations with integer coefficients, and are therefore closely related to questions in (c).  One can view these varieties as the central objects in the Langlands program that tie the three key components of the program together.     This NSF project tries to understand certain geometric aspect of these Shimura varieties. More precisely, the guiding principle of our project is that certain arithmetic property (as in (c) above) we obtained from these Shimura varieties (so-called Galois representations), as conjectured by famous mathematician John Tate, predicts that these Shimura varieties should contain certain very special subspaces which has precisely half the dimension as the Shimura varieties (which is a question in the nature of (b)).  The first step of the project (joint work with Xinwen Zhu) is to find candidates for these special subspaces which turns out to be exactly the same as the so-called basic locus and was previously studied by many mathematicians, yet not knowing its relation to the Galois representations.  The second step is to analyze when these candidates actually verify the predictions by Tate. It turns out that this depends on the information provided by (a): the behavior of solutions to certain differential equations on this Shimura varieties. If these differential equations are somewhat "generic", then we do get all the special subspaces as predicted by Tate; yet, for "non-generic" ones, we only obtain a subset of what is predicted.  One can view this result as a strong evidence of one of the Clay's Millennium Problems: Hodge Conjecture. It would be nice to find additional special subspaces in the "non-generic" case as suggested by Tate, but this will probably require the full power of Hodge Conjecture, which is not available at the moment.  To sum up, in this project, we establish an important and profound relation among the three aspects (a), (b) and (c), under the framework of Langlands program. The PI has also obtained many applications of this results to questions in (a), (b) and (c).     The author organized several workshops and gave a few lecture series on topics directly related to the project, including organizing one special session at an American Mathematical Society Sectional meeting, a lecture series at Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research, and etc. As far as the PI knows, the main paper from the project was also the subject of a few study groups for graduate students. So the results of this project is well disseminated in the mathematical community worldwide.     Aimed at improving general undergrad's interest in number theory as well as providing additional training for graduate students in number theory, the PI, together with Keith Conrad, Amanda Folsom, and Alvaro Lozano-Robledo organized the Connecticut Summer School in Number Theory; this attracts 65 students (20 undergrad and 45 graduate students) nationwide to attend, and the students are lectured on fundamental results in number theory, and are introduced to basic concepts in contemporary number theory. The summer school is followed by a conference on number theory, and the students subsequently see how the new mathematics they just learned is used in the researches.     At UConn, the PI (co-)organizes several events at undergraduate and graduate level: including an annual event Number Theory Day aimed at general audience, a directed reading program and a training session for Putnam competition for undergraduate students, and several reading/learning seminars on topics related to number theory for graduate students.
