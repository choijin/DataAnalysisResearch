<AbstractNarration>The kinetic theory and its models such as the Boltzmann equation and Vlasov equations have played an important role in the understanding of problems in gas dynamics, plasma physics, and fluid equations. In many physical situations, the particles in various models interact with boundaries, and this interaction creates several interesting phenomena such as the formation of singularities. In general, boundary effects may not stay only near the boundary but also impact on the whole interior dynamics. Therefore the boundary effects are important and have rich application in many cases.  However, boundary problems in kinetic models are mathematically challenging due to their singular nature. This project aims to develop new mathematical tools to handle these problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project studies several important boundary problems arising in kinetic models and fluid equations. The first topic regards optimal regularity of Boltzmann solutions in bounded domains with several physical boundary conditions for both dynamical and stationary problems. The second topic concerns the boundary-field interaction in kinetic models such as Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann systems. The third topic is to understand the relation between steady Boltzmann solutions and the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier systems in the presence of a boundary when the mean free path is sufficiently small. The last topic concerns fluid-material interaction such as surfactant dynamics on viscous surface waves.  Results of the project are expected to improve modeling capabilities for a wide range of problems of interest to other scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Funded by NSF grant 1501031, the PI has obtained a number of new mathematical results in the investigations of boundary problems in kinetic theory. The PI has successfully developed a mathematical theory for describing the interaction between a dilute gas and the boundary and settles several important open questions. The PI proved global wellposedness of Boltzmann equation and an asymptotic stability when the gas particle hits the boundary and bounces back as billiard. The PI constructed global unique solution of Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system inside convex container and proved its asymptotic stability. All these problems have important potential applications, and the PI is continuing his study along these new research directions.   Broader Impacts:   The grant provided PhD thesis topics for three graduate students (Yunbai Cao, Jiaxin Jin, Hongxu Chen). He mentored Donghyun Lee (Van-Vleck postdoc at UW-Madison, 2015-2018), who holds a tenure-track position at Postech in Korea. The PI taught a topics course in Fall 2017 and Spring 2015 on mathematical kinetic theory, which introduced basic knowledge and recent progress to graduate students and postdocs. The PI continues to broadly disseminate his results to a broad audience. He gave a six-hour mini course on the boundary problems in Boltzmann theory in summer school at USC (2017), an introductory course in a workshop for junior researchers at Madison (2019).
