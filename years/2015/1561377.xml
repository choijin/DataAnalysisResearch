<AbstractNarration>The emergence of social inequality, here defined as unequal access to material and social resources within a society, is one of the most intriguing issues for social scientists as it implies the existence of hierarchical power structures and the emergence of complex society. As the basic social unit, household is a particularly apt arena for studying economic difference and for reconstructing the nature and degree of social inequality in early societies. Under the supervision of Dr. Elizabeth Arkush, doctoral candidate Peiyu Chen, of the University of Pittsburgh, will excavate the site of Huaca Negra on the Peruvian northern coast and undertake analysis of the recovered materials to investigate early social inequality from a household perspective. Through investigating practices of domestic activities, both commoners' and elites' everyday life can be studied, which offer the potential for examining the whole spectrum of social variation within a given society, and helps to reconstruct the nature and degree of social inequality. This project will incorporate US and Peruvian students from various universities and provide training in different archeological techniques and analysis. The information obtained, which will be the foundation for Chen's dissertation, will be digitalized and made available through the Center for Comparative Archaeology of the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous scholarship on the emergence of complex society in Andean prehistory has focused on monument construction, under the presumption that it requires leaders to organize large scale construction projects. The proposed research, however, attempts to shift attention away from magnificent public constructions towards understanding daily household practice. Huaca Negra, a Peruvian coastal site that was occupied from 5,000 to 3,000 B.P in the Viru Valley, had been identified by earlier researchers as a domestic midden mound, and its time span witnessed the emergence of large-scale monument construction on the Peruvian northern and central coast. This makes the site an ideal place to examine both household practices and the development of social inequality. The research will involve a program of excavation and analyses of unearthed materials. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses will be applied to discern the spatial distribution of resources, variation in abundance between households, and diversity in the proportion of different resources. This project will distinguish materials related to the subsistence economy (food), craft production (utilitarian goods) and social networks (trade goods), providing a window onto the process by which certain households might be able to gain unequal access to resources and started to accumulate power to support their leadership.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project focused on understanding the very first beginnings of social inequality in prehistoric Peru. On the north coast of Peru, communities of people subsisting on rich ocean troves of fish and shellfish settled in permanent villages long before the adoption of agriculture or pottery. &nbsp;Eventually they began building large monumental mounds and temples, apparently forming the foundation for larger societies and social hierarchies. That is the general story archaeologists have Huaca Negra was initially excavated in the 1940s, helping to define our knowledge of early periods in this part of Peru (Strong and Evans 1952). Although Strong and Evans identified the site as a domestic midden dating to the Initial Period (3,800 to 2,800 BP) this new excavation project has redefined the site as a long-term occupied mound that was used over a 2000-year time span from the Late Preceramic Period to the Initial Period (5,000 to 3,200 BP), with the majority of occupation occurring in the Late Preceramic Period. Significantly, Huaca Negra was not solely dedicated to public or ceremonial purposes, as is typically proposed for mounds in early Andean societies. There is public architecture, but there is also evidence of domestic economic activities, including subsistence (animal and plant remains), craft production (stone tools, textiles, and ceramics) and exchange (exotic materials). This site should prompt us to reconsider the customary dichotomy of &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; as two mutually exclusive realms of prehistoric social life. In addition, evidence from Huaca Negra can help paint a detailed picture of the gradual developmental trajectory of social inequality within this particular society.</p> <p>With the support of NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research fund, fourteen C14 dating samples provide fine resolution of the occupation sequence in Huaca Negra. Four occupation phases are identified based on the correlation of archaeological stratigraphy and C14 dating results; three of them can be divided into two sub-phases: (1) before 5,000 to 4,800 BP: intermittent human activity. (2) 4,800 to 4,450 and 4,450 to 4,100BP: beginning of sedentary life. (3) 4,100 to 3,800 and 3,800 to 3,600 BP: construction and use of mound. (4)3,600to 3,400 and 3,400 to 3,200: post-mound, beginning of ceramic use in the Initial Period occupation. The excavation shows that this mound is a result of the accumulation of long-term occupation.</p> <p>By introducing the excavation results to the neighboring local community, this project has also raised the local community&rsquo;s awareness about the value of the cultural heritage in their vicinity. The project also provided the opportunity for local and international students to participate in both field excavation and laboratory analyses. Our results not only contribute to our understanding of cultural history in coastal Peru, but also offers a unique chance to investigate long-term cultural process over two thousand years in one specific place and a new perspective to assess the interface between public and domestic realms of prehistoric social life.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/27/2017<br>      Modified by: Peiyu&nbsp;Chen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1561377/1561377_10407669_1488138717215_Sitemap--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1561377/1561377_10407669_1488138717215_Sitemap--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Site map"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1561377/1561377_10407669_1488138717215_Sitemap--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Site map"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The location of Huaca Negra and its landscape on google map</div> <div class="imageCredit">Peiyu Chen</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Peiyu&nbsp;Chen</div> <div class="imageTitle">Site map</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1561377/1561377_10407669_1488139662443_continuoushumanactivity--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1561377/1561377_10407669_1488139662443_continuoushumanactivity--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Site Stratigraphy"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1561377/1561377_10407669_1488139662443_continuoushumanactivity--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Site Stratigraphy"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Stratigraphy shows the continuous human activities in Huaca Negra</div> <div class="imageCredit">Peiyu Chen</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Peiyu&nbsp;Chen</div> <div class="imageTitle">Site Stratigraphy</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1561377/1561377_10407669_1488138939896_Workingintheunit--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1561377/1561377_10407669_1488138939896_Workingintheunit--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Working in Huaca Negra"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1561377/1561377_10407669_1488138939896_Workingintheunit--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Working in Huaca Negra"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Co-PI and project co-director check the hearth in the deep unit</div> <div class="imageCredit">Peiyu Chen</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Peiyu&nbsp;Chen</div> <div class="imageTitle">Working in Huaca Negra</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1561377/1561377_10407669_1488139927181_architectures--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1561377/1561377_10407669_1488139927181_architectures--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Remains of Architectures"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1561377/1561377_10407669_1488139927181_architectures--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Remains of Architectures"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ancient walls in Huaca Negra dated back to 4,700 BP</div> <div class="imageCredit">Peiyu Chen</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Peiyu&nbsp;Chen</div> <div class="imageTitle">Remains of Architectures</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
