<AbstractNarration>The award will provide funding for U.S. student participation in the 19th Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference organized by the American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute.  The conference this year will be held in Bethesda, MD on July 14-16.  The conference will focus on catalyzing innovation in the areas of environmental-friendly chemistry and chemical engineering.  Student support will be directed toward travel scholarships to attend the conference, registration fees for students, a judged student poster session, and defraying expenses of instructors for a one-day free student workshop before the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference reaches beyond the normal curriculum for undergraduate and post-graduate students.  It will introduce them to the broad range of technical innovations and opportunities available in the vitally important areas of energy sustainability and the environment.  These are areas of extreme importance to our nation's future and quality of life in general.  The conference will catch many of these students at a time when they are considering career paths, and it will open up a broad vista of exciting opportunities.  In addition they will learn how to conduct outreach activities and advocate for green chemistry and chemical engineering in their local communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference (www.GCandE.org) is organized each year by the American Chemical Society (ACS) Green Chemistry Institute&reg; (ACS GCI) and its conference organizing committee comprised of scientists and engineers from other non-profit organizations, U.S. government agencies, academic institutions and industry.  Green Chemistry and Engineering (GC&amp;E) are highly interdisciplinary fields of study with a strong international presence.  The purpose of the annual conference is to bridge chemistry, engineering, and sustainability with a focus on translating principles to practice.  Celebrating its19th year in 2015, the conference focuses on topics that are relevant to both fundamental research and practical implementation in all aspects of chemistry and chemical engineering.  The 19th Annual GC&amp;E Conference was held on July 14-16, 2015 in Bethesda, MD.  The 2015 theme was "Catalyzing Innovation."  The National Science Foundation granted support for student programming at several previous GC&amp;E conferences, most recently in 2014.  This award was used student education in green chemistry and engineering through educational and training activities at the GC&amp;E conference.  The award funds were used to increase student (undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral) involvement in GC&amp;E by providing students with:  travel scholarships to participate in the GC&amp;E Conference;  conference registration; a judged student poster session at the GC&amp;E Conference;  and instructors for a one-day, free GC&amp;E Student Workshop before  the conference;   Intellectual Merit  The promotion and advancement of green chemistry and engineering are keys to a sustainable future.  The scientific community must actively recruit the best new minds to these fields through education and training. Additionally it is critical to maintain continuous communication with industrial employers to encourage the hiring of green chemists.  The GC&amp;E student workshop and conference provided attendees with a unique learning platform for obtaining valuable information on the most current topics within green chemistry and engineering.

These topics are not commonly encountered in traditional university courses and conferences, but are integral for a sustainable future.   Broader Impacts  Through the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate negative impacts to human health and the environment, green chemistry and green engineering approaches seek to achieve the twin goals of economic prosperity and sustainability. Green chemistry and engineering are important disciplines that provide more sustainable solutions to global challenges.  Educating the innovators of tomorrow is a crucial part in securing the well-being of the future. This highly successful interdisciplinary conference and workshop provides a proven opportunity for students to receive and apply information and that will propel research and the development of innovative and sustainable solutions. Workshop participants learned about the latest developments in green chemistry and engineering while being challenged to consider the broader economic, social and political context in which these developments occur.
