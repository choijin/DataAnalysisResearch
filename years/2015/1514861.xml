<AbstractNarration>Following the second hottest month on record since the 1940s, water temperatures near the main Hawaiian Islands reached 30 °C in October 2014.  The result of this 2 °C increase above normal temperatures has been a severe bleaching event across the Hawaiian Archipelago. In Kaneohe Bay, 75% of the dominant coral species are bleached.  Bleaching is a stress response whereby corals lose their symbiotic algae and turn white. Prolonged bleaching can lead to disease, decreases in coral growth and reproduction, and even death.  In addition, rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide cause the oceans to become more acidic and potentially less hospitable to coral reefs.  By the end of this century, seawater is predicted to be twice as acidic as it is today.  The current bleaching event in Hawaii provides a rare opportunity to test the ability of corals to recover under the acidic ocean conditions expected by the end of this century.  This research compares the recovery rate of bleached corals in normal seawater to those exposed to more acidic seawater. The results will inform which species or reef regions are more resilient to global change conditions and thus better targets for protection.  The results will be particularly relevant to management of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and World Heritage site.  It will also provide critical data input for models that project the persistence of reefs in the future.  Educationally, the research will provide a dynamic learning and training environment for students and a post-doctoral researcher.  Minority students will be recruited and trained in marine science providing them with excellent career options in STEM disciplines. Results will be broadly disseminated through publications, classroom visits, public outreach and online media. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on the planet, housing an estimated 25% of marine species. Massive coral bleaching poses a substantial threat to the integrity of coral reef habitats, and is predicted to be the major source of mortality for reefs under future climate model scenarios. Although previous work on the recovery of corals from bleaching sets the groundwork for this project, it remains to be seen how recovery from bleaching will be impacted by climate change and ocean acidification. This project takes advantage of the natural difference in baseline temperature and seawater acidity conditions between Kaneohe Bay and Waimanalo Bay, HI. Both these sites are impacted by the massive bleaching event. This research will test the recovery rate of bleached corals in normal seawater to that of bleached corals exposed to more acidic seawater. Three questions will be addressed:  1) Will ocean acidification slow rates of recovery from bleaching?; 2) Does zooplankton feeding minimize the impact of bleaching?; and 3) Do corals acclimated to warmer, more acidic conditions (Kaneohe Bay) recover more quickly than corals at present day mean oceanic conditions (Waimanalo Bay)? The project integrates techniques across the disciplines of ecology, physiology, evolution, and genomics. The research will help to identify characteristics of resilient coral species or populations that are more likely to survive bleaching events in the future.</AbstractNarration>

In the fall of 2014, a high temperature event resulted in massive coral bleaching across the Hawaiian Archipelago.  This event allowed us to use corals that bleached or not under natural conditions to conduct a year-long recovery experiment to test the following three hypotheses:  1) OA increases recovery time from bleaching; 2) zooplankton feeding enhances rates of recovery from bleaching; and 3) corals pre-conditioned to warmer, more acidic conditions recover faster from bleaching under OA conditions than those not pre-conditioned.  Six bleached and six non-bleached coral colonies of the coral species Montipora capitata and Porites compressa from two sites (24 colonies of each species total) were placed in the following treatments: 1) ambient pH + fed zooplankton, 2) ambient pH + unfed, 3) lower pH + fed zooplankton, 4) lower pH + unfed.

Additional laboratory analyses (algal density, total lipid, lipid class, protein, and carbohydrate) are still in progress.  Initial findings confirm the expectation that bleached corals had lower algal pigment concentrations (Chlorophyll a) than non-bleached corals for both species and sites. Recovery of coral pigmentation occurred within 7 months and was unaffected by OA or feeding rates for either species.  Coral biomass was not affected by bleaching, OA, or feeding. Coral metabolism was compromised in M. capitata under OA conditions, but only if starved.  Although calcification and survivorship were higher among unbleached than bleached corals, we saw no detectable effect of feeding on calcification or survivorship for either species over the year-long study, whereas OA led to a small reduction in calcification regardless of other factors.  A second mass bleaching event in the fall of 2015 gave us the rare opportunity to observe how corals respond to repeat bleaching stress in the experimental tanks with or without acidification and feeding. The corals showed strikingly similar patterns of bleaching in 2015 as compared to 2014, with the previously bleached corals bleaching again while the previously unbleached corals largely avoided bleaching for a second time. The corals from the warmer site at Kane?ohe also showed lower susceptibility to bleaching and mortality than those from the cooler site at Waimanalo, but neither OA nor feeding affected those responses.  Overall we find that corals living under naturally higher temperature and lower pH conditions (e.g., Kane?ohe Bay), are more tolerant of future ocean conditions. We also find that OA does not prolong recovery from bleaching, and that feeding (which would be natural on reefs) acts as a possible ?rescue effect? from OA stress for M. capitata.  In addition, whether or not a coral bleached was the primary factor in determining performance, but the long-term consequences of thermal stress also appear to be site dependent and not completely ameliorated by feeding.  Additional laboratory analyses are currently underway to confirm whether these preliminary results hold up and whether bleaching-resistant corals are pre-conditioned by the environment, or if certain reefs are populated by more resistant individuals that better survive these future ocean conditions.  Broader Impacts:  Two post-docs, 8 graduate and 8 undergraduate students were trained under this award, and findings constitute a portion of the dissertation of two graduate students and 4 senior theses for undergraduates.  The research findings were presented at the 13th International Coral Reef Symposium, an undergraduate research forum, three public talks, and two departmental seminars to date.  Two peer-reviewed publications are in preparation, and a third is expected. Finally, these data will undoubtedly play a role in future management decisions made by the State of Hawaii's Department of Aquatic Resources.
