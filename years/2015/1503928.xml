<AbstractNarration>    This project will examine the processes controlling the flow of water through and beneath an Arctic glacier. The hydraulic properties of glaciers are a major factor influencing the rate at which glaciers slide on the underlying rock. Understanding subglacial flow is critical to developing models that accurately predict how glaciers will behave in response to warming climate and how glaciers will contribute to sea level rise.  For outreach and educational purposes, the project will develop a web-based, interactive fluid dynamics tutorial concerning subglacial conduits.  A project web site will also be developed.  The project will contribute to workforce development by supporting the training of a graduate student and by providing partial support for three early-career scientists.&lt;br/&gt;    This study will perform three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) large eddy simulations (LES) of turbulent flows in a subglacial conduit using realistic surfaces and mesh boundaries. The computations will be done using 3D high-performance computing. The conduit geometry and roughness will be based on a unique set of field measurements made on a Svalbard glacier using with a modified video-game controller at mm resolution. The result of this effort is a first-ever high resolution visualization of a real subglacial conduit and the first subglacial LES simulations with realistic geometry. Results will be compared with model output using the more standard Darcy-Weisbach or Manning formulations.  The study will provide improved insights into hydrological processes in mountain glaciers and large ice sheets such as the Greenland Ice Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Task 1: Recover data in order to map the full conduit at mm resolution.  (1) A 125 m long subglacial conduit under Svalbard, Norway was reconstructed using structure-from-motion. The data has been released to the NSF ArcticData.io repository.  (2) For a 10 m section on this subglacial conduit, two Matlab packages, STL2Conts and Conts2Mesh, were developed to convert structure-from-motion derived surfaces to digital elevation models, to quantify surface roughness, to decompose surface features (surface roughness, cross-sectional changes, and sinuosity) into individual parts, and to prepare geometries for CFD simulations.  (3) One paper was published to understand the roughness in this subglacial conduit in Journal of Glaciology.  Task 2: Use 3D scans of conduit bed roughness to parameterize models of conduit enlargement.  (4) 12 CFD simulations were performed to answer three questions: (a) What is the bulk flow resistance in a realistic subglacial conduit? (b) What is the relative importance of different sources contributing to flow resistance? (c) What are the impacts of our CFD simulated friction factor on predicting subglacial hydrodynamics and ice dynamics?

(c) most glaciology models may severely underestimate the flow resistance in real subglacial conduits and thus significantly misrepresent subglacial hydrodynamics and ice dynamics.  (6) One paper is currently under review by the journal Geophysical Research Letters.  (7) We also performed 14 simulations to particularly focus on how to properly quantify surface roughness and resulted flow resistance.  (8) Following the same procedure of using structure-from-motion and CFD to quantify flow resistance in complex natural environments, we finished another paper which applies the methods developed in this NSF project to another NSF project.  (9) This project produced a PhD thesis.  Task T3: Simulate the full conduit.  (10) We developed a 1D subglacial conduit model, conduitFOAM, to simulate the hydrodynamics and ice-melting process for subglacial hydrology. A paper is in preparation. This model will be made free in OpenFOAM platform when our paper is published. One paper is being prepared for submission.
