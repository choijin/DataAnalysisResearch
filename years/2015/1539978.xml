<AbstractNarration>In order to determine which types of air monitoring technologies and what kinds of scientific collaboration work best, the PI will compare monitoring projects with contrasting configurations of technology and collaboration. The PI will create and teach an annual science and engineering ethics course during which students will spend a week in a fenceline community learning from residents and other expert-activists about local environmental hazards and the technologies that produce them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will create bridges between engineering professional communities and the public through exchange of expertise. The community collaborations she proposes will simultaneously broaden pathways for non-engineer citizens to actively and substantively participate in engineering projects and broaden the education of engineers to understand the community contexts and environmental justice implications of design decisions.</AbstractNarration>
