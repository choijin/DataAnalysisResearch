<AbstractNarration>Symbioses, which are physically close associations of species including positive (mutualism) and negative (parasitism) interactions, are more the rule than the exception in nature.  Virtually all species, including humans, have been and continue to be strongly influenced by symbioses. Ultimately, a comprehensive understanding of the history of life on Earth requires the detailed understanding of the evolutionary and ecological forces shaping species symbioses. The over-arching goal of this research project is to integrate evolutionary (genealogical) and ecological (species interactions) network analyses to test hypotheses about the origins and control of symbiotic associations. This work will focus on the evolution of specificity between symbiotic partners (generalists vs. specialists) using lichen symbioses as a model system. The project builds on a great deal of prior genetic analyses, which have been conducted on over 700 symbiotic associations between fungal and algal species, which give rise to lichens. This project will also provide opportunities for postdoc and undergraduate student training, and will develop non-technical web pages outlining the project to be made available to the public. There will also be professional symposia on the development of novel computational methods for studying symbioses. High school students will be invited to participate in this project based on their interest in a general workshop on lichen symbioses that will be organized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The datasets and phylogenetic results generated by previous studies, provide a unique opportunity to address the following objectives of this study: (1) conduct a network analysis to reveal the association trends of the two mutualistic partners giving rise to lichens, and to infer the most important contributing factors to those associations; (2) compare these results from lichens with other fungal-photoautotrophic systems (e.g., mycorrhizae, endophytes); and (3) design new phylogenetic methods to study the evolution of specificity of interacting fungi and cyanobacteria or algae, and to identify factors correlated with shifts in specificity toward lower or higher specificity in species associations (generalists or specialists). This project is expected to advance the field by coupling the inferential power of phylogenetics with ecological network theory to study symbiotic associations among species within lichens. This new approach for what may be called eco-phylogenetic analysis will estimate, for the first time, the contribution of biotic and abiotic factors through time that best explain the patterns of symbiotic associations observed in nature. The methods developed will be applicable to other symbioses, beyond lichens.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit</span>:</strong> As part of this project we did the first ever network analysis for lichens. We characterized the structure of a lichen network at a very fine phylogenetic scale, by identifying the photosynthetic partners (i.e., cyanobacteria of the genus <em>Nostoc</em>) of lichenized fungi belonging to a monophyletic section of a genus (i.e., section <em>Polydactylon</em> of the genus <em>Peltigera</em>), worldwide. Even at such a fine phylogenetic scale, we found that interactions were highly modular and anti-nested, indicating strong preferences in interactions, especially compared to other fungal-photoautotroph symbioses such as mycorrhizae and fungal endophytes. When considering local <em>Peltigera</em> communities, i.e., datasets at small spatial scales with only a slightly broader phylogenetic range, interactions remained modular but were asymmetric, with generalist <em>Nostoc</em> partners interacting with specialized <em>Peltigera</em> species. This asymmetry was not detected with our global spatial scale (worldwide) dataset. We also found that two <em>Nostoc</em> phylogroups dominated the boreal biome in Qu?bec, Canada, by associating with several specialized <em>Peltigera</em> species (supporting symbiotic asymmetry) and that bioclimatic factors (especially precipitation) at an intrabiome scale are a stronger driver of <em>Peltigera</em> distribution than cyanobiont availability. By integrating network theory, community phylogenetics and biogeographical history reconstruction methods, and using a global interaction matrix for <em>Peltigera</em> and its <em>Nostoc</em> symbionts, we confirmed that module affiliation rarely evolved through the splitting of large ancestral modules. Instead, new modules appear to emerge independently, which is often associated with a fungal speciation event. This suggests that network structure evolves through rare shifts by <em>Peltigera</em> to distantly related <em>Nostoc strains</em> leading to new modules. We found strong phylogenetic signal in these interactions using the phylogenetic history of <em>Peltigera</em>, even after controlling for geographical overlap, i.e., partner switching by <em>Peltigera </em>is constrained by phylogenetically conserved phenotypic traits. When restricting our analyses to <em>Peltigera </em>sister species, we found that cyanobiont "switches" occur through partner acquisitions followed by losses rather than an instantaneous replacement. As expected, traces of acquisition of new partners followed by losses of old partners vanished as we looked at sister species that diverged earlier during the evolution of <em>Peltigera</em>. This suggests that fungal speciation may be accompanied by a stepwise process of (1) novel partner acquisition and (2) rapid loss of the ancestral partner. This could explain the maintenance of high specialization levels in symbiotic systems where the transmission of the cyanobiont to the next generation is assumed to be predominantly horizontal. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impacts</span>: </strong>This project supported the training of two postdoctoral research associates, two Ph.D. students, one undergrad from Colombia (male), two female Duke undergrads, and one female visiting undergrad. Training of undergrads (mostly seniors) also occurred through a new course "Symbiosis: from organelles to microbiomes" that was developed as part of this grant and offered for the first time in the spring of 2017. First-year undergrads are introduced to research on symbiotic systems through the course "Genomics of Symbiosis" that the PI offers once every other year. As part of this course, students have the opportunity to take a workshop to help them find and join a research lab at Duke. As part of this grant, this workshop is now offered (since the spring of 2017) across Arts and Sciences, including Engineering, at Duke. During 2018 more than 150 undergraduate students, mostly first-year students took this workshop. Four international symposia were orgazined by participants for this research project.
