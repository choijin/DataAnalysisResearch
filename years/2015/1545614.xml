<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to facilitate a Maker summit that will serve as a catalyst to establish networks and communication channels amongst different stakeholders in the Maker community. Makers are a quickly growing community of innovators who embody characteristics such as ingenuity, creativity, and propensity toward lifelong learning; all of which are important for the Engineer of 2020. During the first-ever White House Maker Faire in June 2014, President Barack Obama petitioned mayors, federal agencies, educational institutions, companies, foundations, libraries and museums to support Makers. Encouraged by the potential impact Makers can have on innovation in the United States, many of those who were petitioned responded with tangible commitments to assist in the advancement of the Maker Movement. This proposed Maker summit will bring stakeholders together for the purpose of generating knowledge that all participants can utilize to strengthen the role of Makers in advancing the creation of innovative products. The proposed one-and-a-half day summit will take place in the Washington, DC metro area in Fall 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maker Summit provides leaders of the Maker Movement a unique opportunity to convene and share ideas and best practices. The summit will draw approximately thirty participants from five different sectors: informal learning in museum/library settings; making/hacking in community spaces; university maker spaces; engineering and science researchers who engage making; and education researchers who engage in making. Attendees from these communities will be afforded opportunities to forge connections with each other across different segments of the Maker Movement; envision the future of Making for the engineering and education communities; and identify how Maker spaces can be designed to foster inclusiveness and broaden participation. The summit will include Makers from communities as diverse as major museums and educational institutions to small nonprofit organizations and local libraries. These various groups will connect and learn from each other, generating the potential to enhance the STEM knowledge and  of the U.S. citizenry.  Opportunities to join forces and collaborate will be afforded to all attendees, who will both share and discover how to maximize the potential of the Maker movement in their sectors and local areas. Furthermore, the best practices that will be disseminated at the Summit (and beyond)  - will benefit Makers on a global scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The notion of "making," defined as hobbyists building and creating in informal settings, has in the last several years coalesced into what is now commonly called the "Maker Movement." This growing community of individuals come from different disciplines, experiences, skill levels, and backgrounds. Known as Makers, participants include hobbyists, tinkerers, manufacturers, artists, engineers, crafters, and more.  The movement is characterized by a creative, do-it-yourself (DIY) mindset and a strong sense of community. The movement evolved throughout the last several centuries thanks to invention, innovation and the introduction of digital tools and technologies. To support the movement, Makerspaces (commercial and informal) have appeared around the country, as have Maker Faires, where makers can showcase their creations.   The American Society for Engineering Education assembled more than 50 participants from the Maker Movement in a November 2015 event. The goals of this "summit" were to forge connections across the Maker Movement; envision the future of Making for engineering and education communities; and identify how Makerspaces can be designed to foster inclusiveness and broaden participation in the movement. The final product was a report, which summarized the discussion and made recommendations.  On the first day of the event, participants discussed four issues poised to play pivotal roles in advancing the Maker Movement:  the relationship between informal (museums, YouTube videos, etc.) and formal (school) learning, teaching, assessment, and evaluation, diversity, accessibility, and inclusion, and new technologies and innovation     The group suggested that informal and formal educators collaborate on projects that incorporate Making activities, noting that the movement can encourage more action-based learning to enable students to master a wider range of skills. Further, they agreed that a website or other virtual place where they can meet and collaborate would be greatly beneficial.  The second day of the summit centered on recommendations and strategies for sustaining, advancing, and expanding the Maker Movement on a large scale. Participants made three recommendations:  increase Maker networks and networking experiences,  offer Maker-specific career and professional development opportunities, and  broaden the roles and relationships of movement participants and stakeholders   The summit concluded with participants looking to the future of the Maker Movement, citing a need for innovation, new tools, and new ways to assess and evaluate the impact of Making on learners. Participants also need to expand the movement?s economic, educational, and cultural role.  The list of key findings from the summit is below:  Makers seek stronger networks and more networking experiences. Educators must pursue more organic evaluation efforts addressing practical skills and long-term learning to more effectively assess the impact of Making on learning. The movement must embrace efforts to increase diversity, accessibility, and inclusion to sustain and impact economic and global workforce advancement. Makers need greater access to both tangible (3D printers, computer software) and intangible (best practices frameworks, Maker-specific Communities of Practice, targeted opportunities) tools to sustain a strong base of dedicated participants. Roles and relationships of movement participants and stakeholders (students, educators, government officials, members of the STEM community, manufacturers and industry leaders) must be broadened and Makerspaces must adopt a more holistic, culturally expansive, and community centric role.
