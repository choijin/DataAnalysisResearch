<AbstractNarration>This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by developing and testing a six-year sequence of courses and summer events designed to prepare low-income youth for the local area workforce.  The project will recruit, retain, and prepare students from underrepresented populations in STEM-related fields.  While in the program, students will learn: a) science concepts related to hydroponics; b) how to develop hydroponics systems that are powered by alternative energy sources; c) how to build and program robotic arms to plant and harvest produce; d) how to automate the operation and monitoring of hydroponic systems; and e) how to build and program telepresence robots while earning college credits.  Midway through the program, beginning in grade 10, participating students will also benefit from a Web-based mentoring program that will facilitate interactions with STEM professionals, program alumni, and each other.  The project is collaborative effort involving a school district, a community college, a university, and a mentoring organization.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes of the multi-year program of activities, courses, and mentoring strategies will be studied through a mixed-methods research approach based on a combination of survey data and participant interviews.  The theoretical framework for the project is grounded in social cognitive career theory, career construction theory, and the relational theory of working.  The work will be guided by four research questions: 1. To what extent does the seeding-the-future intervention foster progress in students' intentions to pursue further STEM educational options and to consider STEM careers?  2. To what extent does the intervention enhance students' career adaptability, as defined by academic resilience?  3. What role does relational support, as exemplified by the virtual mentoring program, support from family members, teachers, and other important people in the students' lives, play in self-efficacy development, interest formation, resilience, and intentionality to pursue STEM courses and fields?  And, 4. How do youth understandings of complex scientific and technological systems change over time, and what aspects of the program support youth system thinking?  Constructs being measured include social support, academic support, academic resilience, mathematics and science outcome expectancy, mathematics and science intent, mathematics and science self-efficacy, and science interest.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary  Over the course of this project we developed a suite of instructional tools and resources that focused on youth learning how to use solar panels and other alternative energy sources to power hydroponic systems.  We focused on exposing and supporting youth to explore potential careers in green energy and emerging agricultural fields involving hydroponics and aquaponics.  Our work was presented at multiple conferences and was showcased in multiple media outlets through the duration of the grant project.       Broader impacts  Over the life of the project our work impacted 240 youth directly through our college bound program at Boston College. However, with the support of addtional foundations we expanded our teacher training component to multiple cities throughout massachusetts and the northeast.  In total we have trained, mostly high school teachers, 150 teachers throughout the duration of the project on the project materials.  We focused our efforts on recruiting teachers who taught in low-income schools and those that are in gateway communities such as Lawrence, MA, and Springfield, MA.   We also expanded the program to included additional after-school sites outside of Boston College.  In that work we found that the participation in the after-school programs supported positive youth identity and that youth were more excited to study science and expressed more interest in pursing a related career field.   Intellectual Merit  We found that the critical component to engagement in the project for most youth was the social justice aspect of growing food and determining what to do with their produce.  Many youth participated in farmers markets and it was through their sharing of their work and the science and technology that they learned was key in driving their interest development.  In fact, we found that focusing on social and food justice as the driving issue was the hook that engaged youth, particularly, those youth who joined the Boston College program (note that the students who participate in the Boston College program attend in part due the focus on college preparatoin, not just preparation around science).  We also found that for those youth who started our program who were not particularly interested in science would require two or more years before they were able to internalize how and in what ways learning science would be important to them in school and in other endeavors.  In this regard, we belive that for after-school or out-of-school programs to have long-term impacts on youth with the goal of increasing the pool of youth who are interested in studying STEM fields should stive to develop a pathway approach where youth learn new skills each year and partcipate for a minimum of two years.
