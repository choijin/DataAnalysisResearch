<AbstractNarration>PART 1:  NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will directly monitor the formation of solid electrically conducted polymers (also known as "synthetic metals") from liquid solutions using a special high-resolution electron microscope which allows direct observation of the cyrstallization process as it takes place.  These organic materials are used in many advanced applications including flexible batteries, solar cells, and biomedical devices.  However, the way their complicated structures actually form at the molecular level is not well understood scientifically.  The project will examine the formation and growth of these complex materials during an electrochemical reaction.  The experiments will use a special sample stage that will make it possible to watch and monitor within the electron microscope what happens as the materials change from liquid to solid.  The research project will teach students in materials science and engineering how to establish a detailed understanding about the relationship between microstructure and properties of electrically active polymers, as well as contribute to their broader interdisciplinary education.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;PART 2:  TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research project will investigate the electrochemical deposition of functionalized poly(thiophenes) using in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  Conjugated poly(thiophenes), including poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT), are of considerable scientific and commercial interest, but the detailed mechanisms of electrochemical deposition are not yet known.  An in-situ sample holder will be used to examine the deposition from liquid monomer solution to solid polymer directly in a TEM.  These experiments will make it possible to monitor the oxidative polymerization of thiophene monomers in the region of the electrode-electrolyte interface, providing detailed information about the structural evolution of the resulting polymer films as a function of total charge delivered to the electrode.  The results will be correlated with measurements of charge transport properties using impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.  Correlations will also be made with images obtained by complementary imaging techniques including optical and scanning electron microscopy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Conjugated polymers are a relatively new class of materials that are able to conduct charge both electronically (like metals) and ionically (like salty water solutions, or electrolytes). One particular example of these materials, known as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), or PEDOT, has been of interest for applications such as the interface between biomedical devices and living tissue.  One of the most important methods of depositing these compounds is with electrochemical deposition, a technique that has long been used to put metal coatings on various surfaces.  However relatively little was known about how exactly these materials formed a coating as the process proceeds.  This has made it difficult to optimize the details of the method and fully understand the relationship between structure and materials properties.     This project investigated the use of a low dose, high voltage, high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a specially designed sample stage with a microfabricated liquid holder.  These instrumental capabilities made it possible for us to investigate this process in previously unprecedented detail.  The method requires putting a thin sandwich of liquid held between two thin membranes directly in the path of the electron beam, at the center of the vacuum chamber.  Although this technique had been used on inorganic metals and ceramics, it had never been attempted on organic materials such as PEDOT.  Because such compounds are extraordinariliy sensitive to the high energy (200 kV) beams used in a TEM, it was thought that such experiments might even be impossible.     Our work has now established that this approach is not just feasible but quite reproducible, although it remains difficult.  We have observed unprecedented detail about the reaction, including the formation of individual droplets, their density per area, and their area and thickness as a function of charge.  We have also obtained information about the chemical changes by complimentary techniques such as optical microscopy and chemical spectroscopy.  In future studies we are planning to investigate changes in composition of the deposited polymer, substrate, and the use of secondary particles in the reaction mixture.  We are also hoping to continue to pursue complementary experiments to provide as complete a picture of the process as possible.       These results are helping to guide the design, synthesis, and characterization of conjugated polymers for improved performance.  One immediate impact has been an improved understanding of changes in the solubility, processing, and properties of polymers with variable amounts of hydrophilic (water-loving) side groups.  The results of our experiments have been published in 15 peer-reviewed papers since the project began, and have been presented discussed at a variety of national and international meetings.
