<AbstractNarration>The International Gender Summit is held annually, to highlight the role and status of women in STEM disciplines.  This fifth summit, International Gender Summit Africa 2015 (GSA), recognizes the multitude of scientific and economic opportunities available on the continent.  The summit will provide a link between enhancing African economic prosperity and increasing the presence and status of women in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chicago School of Professional Psychology conducts a project titled Opportunities for UnderRepresented Scholars (OURS), which provides leadership training, culminating in a post-graduate certificate in academic leadership, to STEM women of color in faculty and administrator positions at minority-serving institutions of higher education.  The project leaders and four alumnae of the program will attend and make presentations on aspects of OURS at GSA, focusing primarily on concerted efforts to:  (1) raise awareness; (2) disseminate effective best practices; and (3) contribute to the ongoing leadership development of women of color in the academic STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the International Gender Summit award was to provide an opportunity to introduce international audiences to the Academic Leadership Certificate program (referred to as "OURS") that advances the leadership development of STEM women faculty at both Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). By taking a group of certificate program leaders and participants to the 2015 International Gender Summit V in Cape Town, South Africa and the 2016 International Gender Summit VIII in Mexico City, Mexico, it provided the US participants and attendees were provided with cross-cultural exposure to participants through the range of speakers from African and Latin American science-centered programs and universities. Moreover, the OURS women networked with attendees, particularly academic leaders, from other countries further deepening connections and knowledge about women-led STEM initiatives particularly in Mexico and South Africa.  Intellectual Merit  Through the presentation of two panels during the 2015 South Africa conference and a poster presentation at the 2016 Mexico City conference, OURS Fellows and program leaders were able to present a scalable leadership preparation model for STEM women of color and women from underserved indigenous populations, as well as possible strategies for broadening participation in academic leadership in colleges and universities.   Broader Impacts  In the process of connecting and networking with STEM women faculty and professionals from the African diaspora, Latin America, and other countries from around the world, OURS women were able to broaden their horizons with respect to the strategies for advancing women in the STEM disciplines in higher education.
