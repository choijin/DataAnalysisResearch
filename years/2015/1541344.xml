<AbstractNarration>Trinity College's Next Generation Science Network and DMZ project dramatically increases institutional interconnectivity and cyberinfrastructure capability to facilitate data-intensive research and teaching opportunities.  The Science DMZ gives researchers and teachers an unfettered direct path to Virtual Research Networks, Connecticut Education Network resources, and Internet2, bypassing legacy control mechanisms and thus allowing for higher speed interconnectivity.  The resource brings the level of connectivity typically found at a large research university into the unique environment of a small liberal arts college.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The network upgrade replaces outdated campus wiring and networking hardware with that capable of 1Gbps for end node connectivity and multiple 10Gbps interconnects to science servers and the Connecticut Education Network (CEN).  This is accomplished with the installation of new routers and switches in the Trinity College (Hartford, CT) campus science complex buildings, as well as upgrades to cyber-border equipment connecting to the Connecticut Education Network (CEN), an Internet2 partner.  The project includes installation of performance-oriented monitoring software (PerfSonar) and will give researchers direct access to IPv6 resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Trinity College Next Generation Science Network and DMZ project was designed to allow the college?s researchers and instructors a low latency high speed data pathway to remote resources.  This project replaced networking hardware in our science facilities and wide area connection to our regional Research and Education Network (Connecticut Education Network).  The project also creates a ScienceDMZ for defined data intensive workflows and deploys a PerfSONAR node for performance monitoring.  The project work is now substantially complete, and the Trinity science community is now able to participate in the collection, processing, and dissemination of large datasets that were previously difficult to accomplish with our cyberinfrastructure.  Our final ScienceDMZ configuration and associated PerfSONAR node will go into production in June 2018.       Faculty has already noted significant improvement of data flows with the first two phases of our project complete.  Phase I brought online a 10gbit connection to Internet2 via Connecticut Education Network with new high-speed WAN routers.  Phase II replaced network LAN switches in science buildings used by faculty and researchers to connect to both WAN resources and local servers.  Phase III will allow us to enable ScienceDMZ capabilities on this new hardware direct to researchers when needed.  Now that the hardware is installed, and we are will finishing its configuration, we will begin to work with faculty on how to best utilities the resource.  Some faculty have already noted significant increases of 8-10 times the pre-grant transfer levels, however work must still be done to utilize the ScienceDMZ, streamline workflows, and measure improvement.  We look forward to the process of education, incremental improvement and monitoring of this resource as our faculty and researchers begin to more fully utilize it for scientific discovery.
