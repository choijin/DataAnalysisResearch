<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in four meetings in a series of annual conferences in number theory held in Upstate New York; the first conference will take place in Ithaca from April 10 to April 12 in 2015, the second conference in Rochester in 2016, the third conference in Binghamton in 2017, and the fourth conference in Buffalo in 2018. The investigators represent four different institutions: Binghamton University, Cornell University, SUNY-Buffalo, and the University of Rochester. The conference series seeks to have a broader impact in a number of ways. It will help graduate students and post-docs by exposing them to work of leading experts, by allowing them to communicate their own research and interests, and by giving them the chance to interact with experts, among themselves and with young people from nearby places. It will also allow specialists to disseminate their ideas to a larger audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the level of faculty research, the conference series will stimulate collaborations among several specialists in the region, while at the same time strengthening ties between researchers in Upstate New York and those near Boston, New York City, Montreal, Philadelphia, Princeton, and Toronto.  The meetings will catalyze the region's research in number theory and will enrich the opportunities for education and professional development available to junior researchers in the region. The first conference will be centered on the themes of arithmetic geometry over finite fields and new directions in automorphic forms. More information about the conference series can be found at http://www.math.cornell.edu/~upstatenumber/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Upstate New York Number Theory conference is an annual conference held  in the Spring that rotates between institutions in Upstate New York. The  5th conference was held on April 10-12, 2015 at Cornell University. The  6th conference was held on April 30-May 1, 2016 at Rochester University.  The 7th conference was held on May 6-7, 2017 at Binghamton University. The  8th conference was held on April 28-29, 2018 at the University of Buffalo,  in conjunction with Daemen College.    A primary goal of these conferences was to bring together the specialists  from the various branches of number theory in the Upstate New York region  and surrounding areas and to expose the younger researchers to new and old  problems in the field. It provided opportunities for research, teaching  and mentoring in mathematics.    In total there were delivered 27 one-hour plenary talks and 112  contributing talks. A large proportion of the conference participants were  graduate students and postdocs. It has allowed them to be exposed to the  work and to communicate their own research with leading experts and other  young researchers from nearby places.    The main intellectual merit of this conference series are the  proliferation of the number-theoretical knowledge, and broadening of the  expertise of the conferences' participants.    The two broader impacts of the series are the increased cohesion among the  number theorists in the Upstate New York region, and the motivation it has  given to the the younger participants: graduate students and recent PhDs.
