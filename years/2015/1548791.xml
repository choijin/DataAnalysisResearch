<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable continuous sensing applications in a wide range of energy-constrained devices like smartphones, smartwatches, and other wearables. Without dramatic innovations in the development of ultralow power sensory processing, continuous sensing will remain a niche application limited to environments with a stable and plentiful power source. The technology described in this proposal will demonstrate the viability and potential widespread deployment of continuous sensing devices in mobile or remote environments with strict energy constraints. An important immediate market for the proposed technology with significant customer base is the smartphone and wearables market, where many new and emerging end user applications could leverage environmental sensing to trigger context-based and anticipatory actions. The proposed technology is broadly applicable to a number of other markets and domains, including medical, health, and safety monitoring of critical patient sensors, personal fitness devices, military applications, and environmental monitors. The ability to flexibly deploy continuous sensing for these and other applications has the potential to revolutionize these markets and create entirely new and unforeseen application domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel platform&lt;br/&gt;technology--inspired by the mammalian neural pathways, which process sensory information--to enable&lt;br/&gt;?always listening? audio processing capability within energy-constrained devices such as smartphones, tablets, smart watches, and other sensor-enabled wearable devices. The core technology, which provides the sensor processing capability, will model many of the computational properties and capabilities of the biological neurons that humans use to analyze information from their various senses. This research will allow a broad range of devices to continuously monitor their microphones, using streaming audio input to interpret various user commands, infer the current context and needs of the user from background noise, and even identify dangerous and harmful situations heard by the device.  The research will target deployment of these capabilities on low power microprocessors and microcontrollers, often referred to as sensor hubs, which are included in many modern smartphones, tablets, and wearables. Targeting deployment on the sensor hubs will enable ?always listening? devices without compromising the battery life of the device.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This SBIR Phase I Project, titled Neural Algorithms for Multimodal Sensory Analysis, resulted in the successful completion of all research and development milestones. As a result, Thalchemy was able to advance their core Neural Algorithm technology, an algorithmic and software model based on the sensor processing pathways of the human brain.  As evidenced by the successful completion of this SBIR Phase I Project, Thalchemy?s biologically-inspired Neural Algorithms demonstrate the potential to completely surpass the accuracy and scalability of today?s sensor processing solutions. Furthermore, Thalchemy?s Neural Algorithms have a smaller memory footprint and consume less power than any competing solution. In modeling networks of biological spiking neurons, this study has provided key insights into how the brain quite efficiently and accurately processes sensory data.  This unique approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that sensory data is analyzed, and is broadly applicable to a number of other markets, including medical, health, and safety monitoring of critical patient sensors, personal fitness and training devices, military applications, and remote environmental monitoring, seismic data, and structural integrity.  Future research, which will build upon these findings, and will focus on other, larger problems that  biological brains are capable of solving.  This includes learning and performing complex motor tasks, accurately analyzing and interpreting complex visual scenes, and utilizing contextual awareness of data in new situations. By performing research and development in the field of brain-inspired computing, Thalchemy will help further the biological understanding of brain function and capability.  During this Phase I Research Project, Thalchemy demonstrated the clear advantage of its brain-inspired approach to sensory processing.  By using the same core set of Neural Algorithms, Thalchemy has demonstrated how a single algorithm can perform highly accurate pattern matching in different sensory modalities.  Not only are these algorithms capable of highly accurate recognition, even in high noise environments, but they are also computationally quite efficient and, therefore, can be easily deployed in battery constrained environments, such as a smartphone or a wearable platform.  Finally, these Neural Algorithms can be easily re-targeted for new patterns, such as new command phrases or hotwords, gestures, user activities or exercises, and more.  The following is the summary of significant outcomes of this Phase I project:   The Neural Algorithms met and exceeded the ambitious accuracy goals set for the voice recognition tasks targeted in this proposal.  These accuracy results meet or exceed the current "industry best" solutions developed by competitors with more than a dozen years experience in the speech-processing industry.     The Neural Algorithms for single hotword recognition consumed less than 1 mA of current. This is 36% below the target current draw outlined in the proposal.  This means the Neural Algorithm solution can provide voice recognition features with minimal impact on the battery life..     Thalchemy?s Neural Algorithm approach is more scalable and customizable than any other competing solution in the market. Using only a handful of training examples the Neural Algorithm can be configured to identify new complex spatio-temporal sensory events.  Thalchemy?s Neural Algorithm library is the first of its kind - demonstrating truly multimodal sensory processing capabilities.  While competitors have focused on a single sensor modality (motion processing or audio processing) using the traditional techniques for that sensor type, Thalchemy has used its brain-inspired core IP to create a general algorithm that demonstrates superior pattern matching accuracy across all sensor types.
