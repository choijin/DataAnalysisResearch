<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a microscale sensor of water stress and temperature for real-time monitoring of the chemical state within concrete during curing, and for refined predictions of the concrete's mechanical properties. The HydroT sensor of water status and temperature, and the Extended Maturity Analysis that it will enable, are important because they will allow for improved control of the properties of concrete during curing. Improper curing of concrete structures can cause stress that may lead to cracking and ultimate failure. Real-time sensing and monitoring of concrete curing will lead to improved functionality, increased lifetime, and a reduction in the global use of this energy-intensive material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in prototypes of the HydroT sensor, initial development of Extended Maturity Methods using these sensors in concrete curing, and an improved understanding of the priority markets for the commercialization of this technology. The HydroT sensor has the following unique features: 1) unprecedented sensitivity for the measurement of water stress in the range that is relevant in concrete. This capability will allow for water status to be incorporated, for the first time, into methods of tracking and controlling concrete properties during construction. 2) Integration of water and temperature sensing using microfabrication techniques. This approach will allow for simple, low-cost scaled-up and production by leveraging the existing capabilities of microfabrication foundries. 3) Small format and simple integration with electronics and communication. These characteristics will make the barrier for adoption by industry low. Taken together, these features mean that the HydroT technology will provide the concrete industry an important new functionality (sensing of water status) in a device that can replace the temperature probes used in conventional Maturity Analysis with similar costs and technical complexity.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To translate the HydroT Probe and Extended Maturity Analysis toward commercial application, the team will pursue advances in the understanding and technical approaches on both hardware and application fronts. These developments will involve fundamental advances in the ability to manipulate the properties of critical materials such as the porous membrane and deeper understanding of the coupling of moisture and temperature in defining maturation in important classes of concrete. Additionally, the team will pursue a deeper understanding of the market, competitors, and potential partners for manufacturing and distribution. Throughout, the team will aim to reinforce its intellectual property position and to build a core group of entrepreneurs and technical staff to carry the project into a successful start-up company. As part of the project, the personnel involved - undergraduates, graduates, and post-docs - will gain experience in innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation through participation in the patent application process with Cornell's technology transfer office and activities such as Cornell's Pre-Seed Workshop and technology accelerator program, eLabs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Water plays an essential role in biology, technology, and terrestrial processes. Knowing the thermodynamic state of water within a given material helps us understand both the biological, chemical, and physical processes that can occur within it. Materials of interest in this project included biological tissues (particularly of plants), synthetic materials such as concrete, and natural materials such as soils. The most important thermodynamic property is the free energy or chemical potential, because it tells us how accessible a given molecule is to participate in a chemical reaction or to move from one place to another. Our tools for measuring chemical potential of water within complex natural and synthetic materials has been limited. This project matured the fabrication and modes of use of a new tool called a microtensiometer that addresses this limitation. The original concept and initial prototype of this sensor had been developed under a previous NSF award to the principle investigator at Cornell University.</p> <p>Under this award, the team went through two stages of prototyping of the microtensiometer to achieve technical goals related to size, speed of response, and reliability. Using microfabrication tools in the NSF-sponsored cleanroom at Cornell University, the team shank the overall dimensions of the device by a factor of two. To improve the response time of the device required an innovation that was inspired by the vascular system of plants: the team integrated an array of microchannels into the nanoporous membrane that allows the device to maintain tension. As in the xylem tissue of plants, these microchannels are segmented such that the liquid passes between subsequent channels through thin barriers made of nanoporous material. This design lowers the resistance by allowing the liquid to travel long distances in channels with high conductance and it protects the device from entry and spreading of gases with the nanoporous barriers. The inclusion of this biomimetic vascular structure decreased the response time from around one hour to a few minutes.&nbsp; The team also developed methods to package the microfabricated sensor to protect the sensing elements both chemically and mechanically.</p> <p>The team used the sensor and related devices to characterize function in two contexts that emerge in important applications. The first relates to the presence of gradients of temperature in the material in which one would like to measure the chemical potential of water. In this context, thermodynamic calculations and some previous experiments suggest that differences in temperature between the sensor and the material could lead to large errors in the measurement of chemical potential. The team developed an experiment to measure this effect directly with the microtensiometer. These experiments led to the most complete characterization of this effect yet known and provide important information for the development of protocols to use the microtensiometer accurate measurements. The second context relates to situations in which the liquid inside the microtensiometer contains solutes. This scenario is important because solutes could infiltrate the device as contaminates in some applications or they could be added on purpose to change the response of the device. These experiments fully characterized the impact of internal solutes and pointed a way toward extending the range of operation of the device.</p> <p>The target application for the microtensiometer was the measurement of water chemical potential within concrete during curing. Within the period of this award, the team was not able to define a package that allowed for accurate measurements in the chemically and mechanically harsh environment of concretem, but they did make important progress toward this goal. The team did manage to make the device work in another important application: the continuous measurement of drought stress in woody plants. In this context, the microtensiometer provides unprecedented information about the water status of plants that can inform our understanding of plant physiology and provide a basis for more efficient water use in agriculture.</p> <p>Cornell holds two issued patents on the technology developed in this award.

As the technology matures further, it may also serve other markets such as in civil and geotechnical engineering or food processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/07/2018<br>      Modified by: Abraham&nbsp;D&nbsp;Stroock</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1500261/1500261_10356734_1523149098664_Microtensiometer--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1500261/1500261_10356734_1523149098664_Microtensiometer--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Microtensiometer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1500261/1500261_10356734_1523149098664_Microtensiometer--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Microtensiometer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Microtensiometer.
