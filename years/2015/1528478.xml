<AbstractNarration>Since 2008, social scientists have documented a global land rush of unprecedented scale, with over 80 million hectares changing hands in the last decade. The vast majority of such land deals are taking place in the global South, where the impetus for short-term economic development often overshadows concerns for sustainable peace and development. For this reason, land deals often lead to dispossession for ethnic, indigenous, and other marginalized peoples and exacerbate existing conflicts over territory, resources, and power. This can in turn destabilize entire regions where the U.S. might have strategic economic and political interests. This project, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, examines the relationship between land law and sustainable peace and development efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cornell University doctoral student, Emily Hong, under the direction of Dr. Annelise Riles, will undertake the research in the Burma-China-Thailand borderlands, with a primary base in Kachin State, Burma. Taking an ethnographic approach to examining policy in practice, the researcher will examine the significance of land law for ordinary people often left out of expert-dominated discussions on development. Burma/Myanmar provides an ideal setting for understanding these dynamics, due to the centrality of land and ethnic identity in ongoing peace talks and legal reforms. Through year-long ethnographic fieldwork with activists, farmers, and intellectuals, the researcher will investigate two spheres in which Kachin people attempt to shape their political future: land law and indigenous media through extensive interviews, focus groups, participant observation, and archival research. On a national level, the researcher will focus on a current campaign for customary land law, part of a growing global trend that seeks state recognition of ancestral or indigenous land use practices; on a local level, she will examine the work of local activists and farmers who document land-based dispossession, cultivate local solutions to development problems, and create their own widely-circulating media. The project seeks to understand not only the impacts of state-led processes of law and development in the global land rush but how ordinary people actively shape alternatives for sustainable peace and development. The project will advance the fields of cultural anthropology and law and social sciences, particularly in the areas of political anthropology, legal anthropology and the interdisciplinary study of human rights, studies of indigenous sovereignty and political change, and collaborative ethnography.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spurred by a fractured political ?transition? since 2010, an influx of capital-intensive development and interventions from foreign technocratic ?experts? is creating profound shifts in the conflict-afflicted landscapes of Burma/Myanmar?s borderlands. Left out of expert-dominated discussions on development, Kachin activists, farmers, intellectuals and armed group leaders in the country?s North have taken up the mantle of designing political alternatives that seek to realize self-determination in the realm of land and natural resource governance. Through extensive interviews, focus groups, participant observation, and archival research over the course of 18 months, the researcher investigated two spheres in which Kachin activists and their allies exercise their political imagination&mdash;law and indigenous media. The research traces the making of two laws and policies&mdash;a land policy to be applied first in territory held by an ethnic armed group and a natural resource policy that seeks recognition through Kachin State parliament under a federal arrangement. Secondly, it examines the process of a Kachin rock band?s collaboration with activists to compose, film, and produce a groundbreaking music video album on land, natural resources, and self-determination. In producing such ?semi-autonomous? forms of law and media, activists and their allies attempt to address institutional ethnic inequalities by drawing on transnational and indigenous grammars of self-determination and ownership. Both of these empirical cases reveal the ways that law and media, far from serving as tools of state domination, can be fertile ground for the exercise of political imagination.        While anchored in the Myanmar-China-Thailand borderlands, this research sheds light on a global trend&mdash;how ethnic and indigenous peoples are retooling techniques previously in the domain of ?experts? in the face of dispossession caused by increasingly legal land grabs. Such research has the capacity to transform understandings of how non-state actors bring about new forms of political sovereignty in global borderland zones, between the logics of the state and international human rights law.     As of June 2017, key outcomes of this research include a peer-reviewed journal article, three academic conference presentations, and a production-stage feature documentary film.
