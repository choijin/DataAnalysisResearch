<AbstractNarration>The goal of this workshop is to plan a global network of mountain observatories by linking and aligning existing mountain observatories. Mountains are high-value features within the Earth system. Mountain regions are currently experiencing profound environmental changes, which translate into serious challenges to society. Bringing science to bear on these challenges requires more comprehensive, long term data on mountain systems around the world. A global network of observatories on mountain social ecological systems is a key step toward obtaining these data and promoting comparative analyses. Observatories of various types exist already in mountains around the world; the key is to bring them into communication with each other and to move toward congruent observing methodologies that reveal the complexity of these social ecological systems. Such a network of observatories accelerates innovation and aligns methodologies. A network promotes exchange on questions and methods by promoting transparency and  breaking barriers between disciplines and cultures. A network can also develop data analysis and management policies and procedure to support collaboration. Members within the network build stronger contacts, see different solutions, and learn whom they can work with to find help with their challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will convent an international panel of representatives from research, government, and education to  address the motivating science questions, the structure of the network, the key variables now and for the future,  the management of data,  and communication. It will define objectives to bring together data from many different sites, modeling approaches that could help extend observations and best practices with respect to the engagement of stakeholders and the co-production of knowledge.  Many of the environmental issues facing mountain regions have serious social implications. The participant list includes stakeholders that can make the network more  effective at informing decision making and policy. Observatories can serve as active sites where researchers can engage with and learn from advocates, business, and elected officials. Such a network will also encourage active engagement with local stakeholders, K-12 education, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and institutions of higher learning.</AbstractNarration>

They cover a quarter of the Earth&rsquo;s terrestrial surface. Their vertical extension creates great habitat over short distances, increases precipitation relative to adjacent lowlands and favors large water reservoirs in the form of glaciers, snowpack and permafrost.

The reduction in water stored as snow and ice, driven by the shift from snow to rain as well as reductions in amount, reduce groundwater recharge in mountainous areas as well as the timing and amount of streamflow. These impacts are felt locally but also in cities and agricultural areas far downstream that rely on mountain water in regions as diverse as western North America, the altiplano in South America, Central Asia, and China. Increasingly destructive wildfire, degraded wildlife habitat, and wildland-urban interface conflict are additional challenges to mountain economies and communities, especially in Europe and North America. Disease vectors, invasive species, biodiversity loss and water pollution similarly afflict disparate regions around the world.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary/Overview:  A Global Network of Mountain Observatories (GNOMO) was created during an NSF and MRI supported meeting held 13 - 15 September 2015 at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory locate north of Crested Butte, Colorado, USA.  Scientists, Field Station Managers, Faculty, techncians and Artists met and launched this network during this meeting: http://gnomo.ucnrs.org.  The Why? Mountains are high-value features within the Earth system. They cover a quarter of the Earth’s terrestrial surface. Their vertical extension creates great habitat over short distances, increases precipitation relative to adjacent lowlands and favors large water reservoirs in the form of glaciers, snowpack and permafrost. While often seen as resource-rich but forbidding in temperate and boreal climates, mountains are prime human habitat in tropical regions with much higher population densities than in adjacent lowland forests, plains, or deserts.

Since the meeting:  Presentations were made at the Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS) Annual meetings in 2015, 2016 and 2017.  In May of 2019 contributors to the GEO-GNOME effort gathered in Bern, Switzerland, for a three day workshop hosted by the MRI to review and scope a new work plan for GEO-GNOME. The workshop was coordinated by the GEO-GNOME co-leads Carolina Adler from the MRI and Elisa Palazzi from the National Research Council of Italy, together with Marc Zebisch from EURAC Research.  GNOMO is "one of the areas that the new MRI, under the Directorship of Carolina Adler, are keen on continuing.
