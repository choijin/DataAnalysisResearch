<AbstractNarration>The Susquehanna University Noyce project addresses the need for highly qualified STEM teachers in urban and rural communities.  It will prepare and support 25 physics, chemistry, and mathemtics majors to become highly qualified secondary education candidates for teaching positions in high-need school districts in Pennsylvania. Project objectives are to: recruit, retain, and graduate the Noyce scholars; to ensure they benefit from innovative best practices in STEM pedagogy; and to ensure they develop cultural competencies and the preparation needed to successfully teach in rural or urban high-need classrooms. The project emphasizes instructional practices that engage learners in inquiry-based learning activities and provides relevant and significant field experiences. An important component of the project is the emphasis placed on promoting cultural competencies related to linguistic, cultural, and economic diversity. Candidates develop these competencies through field placements, cultural immersion, and add-on certification as English as a Second Language (ESL) Program Specialists. Upon graduation and employment in Pennsylvania schools, Noyce scholars will be provided on-going mentorship through site visits and alumni retreats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Susquehanna University Noyce project will prepare the physics, chemistry, and mathematics majors through the following: An internship program that provides these pre-service teacher candidates with early teaching experiences incorporating systematic reflection, mentoring, and constructive feedback; field experiences that provide cross-cultural immersion in high-need rural or urban communities and are supported through systematic critical reflection; field experiences that prepare the candidates for working in economically, culturally, and linguistically diverse classrooms; courses that include best pedagogical practices for diverse classrooms, and optional ESL certification. In addition, the STEM educational methods courses will model and prepare candidates to utilize instructional activities characterized by inquiry, experimentation, collaboration, and interdisciplinary learning. Finally, during student teaching, Noyce scholars will complete action research capstone projects on their instructional practices. Data will be systematically collected on each element of the Noyce Scholars project, as well as on the holistic experience of Noyce scholars, to assess individual and cumulative consequences. Ultimately, the project will prepare STEM teachers with a sophisticated understanding of diverse and underserved students' learning needs and deep knowledge about their content area and effective pedagogical approaches. Teachers who possess strong content knowledge, employ engaging instructional practices, and understand students and their communities promote greater student academic achievement and sustained interest than those lacking one or more of these capacities. When learners from underserved communities view their teachers as community members and/or invested in their communities, they are more likely to see themselves as capable of pursuing similar academic and professional paths. This project has the potential to positively impact surrounding high-need communities by increasing academic achievement, STEM engagement, and subsequent interest in postsecondary education and/or STEM-related careers. In turn, these project outcomes hold potential to expand the knowledge-base regarding the preparation of teachers to succeed in such high-need school districts. Susquehanna University has a commitment to actively recruit Noyce scholars from historically underserved populations (minority, low-income, and first-generation students) in order to increase the presence of relatable role models in mathematics and science.</AbstractNarration>
