<AbstractNarration>Catalytically Active Earth Abundant Materials with Unique Structure and Property&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the metals and materials used in catalysis are rare and expensive. However, as energy needs increase and the traditional catalytically-active noble metals become scarce, it is paramount that novel materials are discovered to replace them and the capabilities of these new materials are explored. The team, consisting of Profs. Trewyn, Pylypenko, and Richards, is investigating the development of nanostructures composed of earth abundant materials entrapped in high surface area, porous materials with unique shapes and chemistry, and are developing a fundamental understanding of factors that influence reactions integral to biomass upgrading to higher value products, such as fuels and chemical feedstocks for industrial use. The team is focused on the chemistry of both catalytically active nanoparticles and metal atoms distributed in the porous supports. They are studying the conversion process of metals and metal oxides to metal carbides and metal nitrides which may possess unique catalytic properties that closely mimic those of the noble metals currently used for many of the catalytic processes important to our global energy and chemical needs. This collaborative effort leverages a strong and unique ability to study the properties of the active species distributed at the atomic level using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) under reaction conditions. Importantly, this team brings expertise in material sciences, material characterization, inorganic and analytical chemistry and catalysis. The catalytic activity of these newly synthesized catalysts are tested against reactions frequently observed in upgrading biomass so as to develop important structure/activity relationships. The team attracts undergraduate and graduate students from many disciplines and walks of life to participate in research. The group hosts and mentors high school students to conduct research in their laboratories along with traveling to K-12 schools to demonstrate the power of science. Finally, the team participates in organizing several conferences in these research areas, all emphasizing student involvement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research project, Drs. Trewyn, Pylypenko, and Richards, all of the Colorado School of Mines, are supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program to develop and study nanostructures of earth abundant elements with enhanced catalytic activity while manipulating the density and stability of the active sites on high surface area, porous supports. Working as a highly complimentary team, they are evolving the synthesis of supported metal carbides and metal nitrides by converting metal and metal oxide nanoparticles embedded in mesoporous silica through exposure to methane (carbon) and ammonia (nitrogen) at elevated thermal and pressurized conditions. Atomically distributed metal carbides and metal nitrides are presently produced by post-synthetically treating mixed metal oxides under similar conditions. The group is investigating the properties of active species that give them catalytic properties similar to the very active, but rare, Group 10 metals. In addition to a strong synthetic background, the team uses their expertise in in-situ/operando characterization techniques, including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which allows the team to analyze the materials at the states most relevant to working environments to pinpoint the most active sites. Using a series of biomass upgrading related reactions, the team is measuring and comparing the catalytic activity of the newly synthesized catalysts and identifying the best alternatives to noble metals. The research team attracts diverse undergraduate and graduate students from many disciplines to participate in research. They host and mentor high school students to conduct actual research in their laboratories along with traveling to K-12 schools to demonstrate the power of science. New curricula are developed to introduce students to state-of-the-art methods of materials synthesis and characterization along with extensive catalysis. The team is involved in organization of various conferences aimed at disseminating the materials, material characterization methods, and catalysis processes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research objectives of this project were to synthesize porous inorganic materials with earth abundant elements uniformly distributed within the framework. The overarching goal of this fundamental study is to reduce our reliance on the noble metals in catalysis. Outreach and broader impacting objectives were the development of new graduate and undergraduate courses, developing science modules for the Rocky Mountain Camp for Dyslexic Children, and incorporating high school students into our research environment.</p> <p>Intellectual Merit:</p> <p>Knowing that some earth abundant metal carbides/nitrides have similar catalytic characteristics as platinum and palladium, but the challenge lies in supporting them on silica supports led us to propose this project. The challenge is that Pt and Pd can be supported either as individual atoms or nanoparticles in and on silica support but since earth abundant elements like molybdenum and iron need to be post-synthetically treated, it is very difficult to support them without aggregating. We accomplished this goal with several different elements including iron, molybdenum, nickel, and tungsten through careful investigations of co-synthesizing with different salts that had effects on the pH and surface chemistry of the supports. We published several peer-reviewed papers on this subject describing our accomplishments, a number of them have been cited repeatedly by other researchers already. Another significant outcome we achieved is a new synthesis route to reduce metal salts on to zeolite surfaces in an electric field. The materials synthesized in this route led to copper supported on acid zeolites for reduction catalysts. The purchase of a new near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscope was made possible through an NSF-MRI grant that was funded in 2017. Once this instrument was purchased and set up in 2018 we used materials synthesized to fulfill objectives on the this grant to run the new instrument through its paces. The results of these studies were included in a number of our publications. Finally, some outcomes from this work continues in efforts in different directions. We are currently investigating new catalyst technology for chemical and thermal depolymerization of end-of-life plastics, partial oxidation of methane, and 3D printing catalytically active structures. These research efforts would not have been possible without this funding. One significant outcome of this project were two completed PhD theses, one in Applied Chemistry and the other in Material Science, both issued from the Colorado School of Mines. The former Applied Chemistry student is currently a post-doctoral researcher at NREL and the Material Science graduate works for Citrine, Inc., a materials genome data start-up.</p> <p>Broader Impacts:</p> <p>We used the opportunity NSF offered to develop science and engineering modules for a group of campers attending the Rocky Mountain Camp for Dyslexic Children. This is a 5-week daycamp that occurs each summer in Evergreen, CO about 20 miles from Golden CO. Each year, 40 children ages 7-13 attend from across the United States to develop and maintain their reading, writing, and comprehension skills. We participated by developing science and modules for each group of 10 (four different groups per day) for one hour of STEM activity. Campers attend multiple years as their need dictates, so we had to develop different modules each year. This was very rewarding outreach we participated in, watching the students understand concepts and enjoy the STEM activities gave everyone who partook in the camp a feeling of accomplishment. Some examples of the activities we did were to look at catalase activity in potatoes. We showed the campers what happens if you microwave or freeze the potato and compare the activity in the potato flesh with that of the skin. We also used agar with pH sensitive dyes to demonstrate factors like surface area to volume ratio. New courses were developed as outreach as well for this grant. Professor Trewyn developed and taught a graduate course on heterogeneous catalysis twice, Professor Pylypenko developed and taught a graduate course on surface science, and Professor Richards developed an undergraduate course on nanotechnology and nanoscience. These courses have been well prescribed by students from many different majors. A number of new high school students from the Jefferson County High School Internship program have been given an opportunity to work in the PIs? labs because of this funding. Professor Trewyn alone has supported at least six different high school students who work with graduate and undergraduate students on research projects. Two of these high school students have coauthored a peer-reviewed paper with my group. Finally, we organized and hosted a STEM high school workshop at Mines in June 2019, where 5 STEM high school teachers worked through different chemistry experiments and discussions to do in their classrooms.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/05/2019<br>      Modified by: Brian&nbsp;G&nbsp;Trewyn</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508728/1508728_10381214_1575584353969_49984378_9864939815398--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508728/1508728_10381214_1575584353969_49984378_9864939815398--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student group interactions!"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508728/1508728_10381214_1575584353969_49984378_9864939815398--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student group interactions!"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student members of the local American Vacuum Society, which Prof. Pylypenko serves as the faculty advisor for, working on resume building.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Svitlana Pylypenko</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brian&nbsp;G&nbsp;Trewyn</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student group interactions!</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508728/1508728_10381214_1575570780914_IMG_6128--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508728/1508728_10381214_1575570780914_IMG_6128--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Making Slime!"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508728/1508728_10381214_1575570780914_IMG_6128--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Making Slime!"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Campers at the Rocky Mountain Camp for Dyslexic Children making slime with Prof. Richards and Trewyn.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brian Trewyn</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brian&nbsp;G&nbsp;Trewyn</div> <div class="imageTitle">Making Slime!</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508728/1508728_10381214_1575571101583_IMG_8197--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508728/1508728_10381214_1575571101583_IMG_8197--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Learning about surface area to volume ratio"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508728/1508728_10381214_1575571101583_IMG_8197--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Learning about surface area to volume ratio"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Campers at the Rocky Mountain Camp for Dyslexic Children learning about surface area to volume ratio using agar cubes of different size infused with pH sensitive dyes.
