<AbstractNarration>The behavior of biological systems including ecosystems and social networks is fundamentally dependent on the spatial structure of the underlying physical environment and distribution of organisms within that environment, as well as the nature of the interactions among the organisms.  This research advances the analysis of mathematical models that will improve understanding of important biological processes such as the dynamics of movement of organisms, spread of infectious diseases, and proliferation of information in social networks.  Mathematical techniques will be used along with simulations to advance knowledge of such systems.  Results arising from this work may be integrated into undergraduate mathematics and biology courses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves the study of spatial stochastic models that have important applications to biology, particularly ecology.  This project will investigate phase transitions and limiting behavior of models for population dynamics, infectious disease transmission, and structure of social networks.  The models will incorporate the interaction among particles through a number of actions, which include birth and mortality, competition, and migration.</AbstractNarration>

New understanding and insights about population models were obtained. The quadratic contact process considers a population in a spatial setting evolving over time with random birth and death rates, for which a birth of an individual requires two parents. When the range at which individual interact is large, the population has a propagation speed in each direction and a relationship between the critical values for the population to survive starting from a finite number of individuals and that for the population to have an equilibrium and these speeds was obtained. In an approximation to the Bolker and Pacala population process, a population is split into groups, which can represent, for example, physical separation or social stratification. Individuals have random birth and death rates with migration between groups and competition within and among the groups. Relationships between the multiple parameters and conditions for equilibrium were obtained for this model. Cyclic birth rates were also investigated, taking into consideration that many species do not produce offspring continuously at the same rates throughout time but rather in cycles, throughout the year, for example.
