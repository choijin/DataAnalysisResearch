<AbstractNarration>This EARS (Enhancing Access to the Radio Spectrum) program was founded in response to the 2010 Presidential Memorandum on Unleashing the Wireless Broadband Revolution mandated by Congress as part of the National Broadband Plan. It was referenced in 2010 State of the Union and later on the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (More than 1/3 of the bill deals with radio spectrum), the PCAST 2012 Report [President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology] (which calls for vastly increased use of spectrum sharing) and the 2013 Presidential memo (Expanding America's Leadership in Wireless Innovation). The aim of this program is to identify bold new concepts with the potential to contribute to significant improvements in the efficiency of radio spectrum utilization, protection of passive sensing services, and in the ability for traditionally underserved Americans to benefit from current and future wireless-enabled goods and services. The impact is large on the economics of the Nation as seen on the last FCC bidding of 65MHz of the spectrum for over $45 billion early in 2015. It will enable access to science, engineering, industry, civilian and military users of the RF spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will analyze the magnitude of spectrum scarcity as it relates to the optimization of spectrum utilization. The cellular industry has been asking for more spectrum for mobile broadband by calling it a "Supply" to support higher "Demand" of mobile data services. Higher amount of spectrum can surely support data-centric services more efficiently. However, other variables of Wireless Broadband Eco-systems can lower the burden on existing cellular infrastructure and they can collectively play a role of "substitute" for more spectrum. The PI's preliminary model (based on System Dynamics techniques) already showed that the need for more spectrum could be lowered by making efficient use of existing network infrastructure (e.g. Wi-Fi Offloading). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make the existing model comprehensive and future-proof, they plan to expand it by adding economic parameters like auction data and recently emerged technical parameters like Spectrum Re-farming, Small Cells, and LTE deployment in unlicensed bands. This research will also incorporate economic studies and drivers to better understand the efficiency at which the new spectrum is being utilized by cellular operators and how it affects their plans to deploy data offloading techniques on unlicensed frequencies. The proposed project is not limited to "research" activities but it includes "development" phase as well; the research part will allow them to define the mathematical relationships among the technical and economic variables and the development part will produce a working and interactive model of mobile broadband eco-system to demonstrate the effects of various technical and economic variables on spectrum allocation. The project outcome not only will test the Spectrum Scarcity hypotheses but will also provide future projections for spectrum utilization and will trigger recommendations to government and regulatory bodies for sufficient allocation of spectrum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Future trends toward intelligent infrastructure systems, such as the smart grid, intelligent transportation systems, unmanned aircraft systems, and environmental monitoring systems, give rise to the need for reliable communications for real-time monitoring and control operations. Wireless networking is a promising technology for meeting these requirements; however, existing spectrum allocations are not likely to suffice. This project explored the use of shared spectrum for meeting the communication requirements of future intelligent infrastructure systems.  A key challenge in this context is how to meet the reliability, latency and bandwidth requirements of monitoring and control operations using intermittently available shared spectrum.  This project addressed these challenges by drawing upon a variety of disciplines including wireless networking, cyber-physical systems, optimization and economics. Specific questions addressed include how to model the service requirements of emerging monitoring and control applications, how to pool various bands of spectrum to enable the design of robust monitoring and control networks, and how to structure spectrum markets to enable these applications to acquire the needed bandwidth.  Over the four years of this project we made a number of contributions in the area of spectrum sharing for real-time monitoring and control.  These include issues of robust design, throughput maximization, the impact of latency of control of autonomous vehicles, and latency optimization.  We describe some of our key contributions below.  1) We developed robust network architecture for spectrum sharing networks.  In spectrum-sharing networks, primary users have the priority of preempting secondary users, which significantly degrades the performance of underlying secondary users. In order to address this issue, we developed a back-up network architecture, where we use backup channels to provide reliability guarantees for secondary users.  2) We consider the impact of communication constraints on collision avoidance for autonomous vehicles.   Autonomous vehicles need to be aware of other vehicles in their vicinity in order to avoid collisions and successfully perform their tasks. Such network awareness is ensured by exchanging location and control information over wireless radio channels. However, wireless interference constraints limit the number of messages that can be exchanged between the vehicles.  In order to address this issue we study the impact of such communication constraints on maximum vehicle speed in dense autonomous vehicular networks, and establish speed limits as a function of the communication capacity.   3) We study the problem of capacity and delay scaling for broadcast transmission in highly mobile wireless networks:  We study broadcast capacity and minimum delay scaling laws for highly mobile wireless networks, in which each node has to disseminate or broadcast packets to all other nodes in the network.  Our results show that high mobility does not improve broadcast capacity, and that there is no tradeoff between capacity and delay.  These results are particularly relevant for networks of autonmous vehicles that depend on real-time updates.  4) We study the problem of information freshness using the newly proposed metric of Age-of-Information (AoI).  AoI measures the amount of time that elapsed from the moment the mostly recently received update was generated until the present time. AoI is an important metric for many cyber physical systems that rely on fresh information updates from sensors.  We study the problem of minimizing AoI in wireless networks and obtain optimal scheduling algorithms for both broadcast and general network topologies.  5) We developed a new theory for uncertainty variables for state estimation and inference.  Probability theory forms an overarching framework for modeling uncertainty, and by extension, also in designing state estimation and inference algorithms. While it provides a good foundation to system modeling, analysis, and an understanding of the real world, its application to algorithm design suffers from computational intractability. We develop a new framework of uncertainty variables to model uncertainty.  This new framework has wide applicability for  monitoring and control applications that need to make estimates of their environment in real-time.
