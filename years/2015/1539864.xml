<AbstractNarration>This project studies how workers engage in either legal action or collective bargaining for dispute resolution. It seeks to understand how and when workers are able increase their rights, even when they find little political support and have limited capacities within the workplace. The study asks three questions: (1) Why do some low wage workers use legal action while others use collective bargaining?, (2) When workers attempt collective bargaining why are some able to bring management to the bargaining table and others not?, and(3) If taking legal action, why do some workers attempt to use the law to expand their rights when others do not? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer these questions, the study compares six different cases of labor disputes and focuses on the role of management, state authorities, and non-governmental organizations working in labor (labor NGOs) in southern China. The data collection combines interviews with workers, attorneys, and non-government organizations associated with the cases with legal and organizational documents from archived files on each case, media reports and participant observation notes from court hearings and meetings with workers. It is expected that managers and firm-level factors will play a crucial role in workers' decisions to use legal action or attempt collective bargaining. State authorities are critical in the collective bargaining process, and their intervention enables some workers to bring management to the bargaining table. Finally, labor NGOs may guide some workers to use legal action to expand their rights; on the other hand, workers who do not engage with labor NGOs use the courtroom strictly for recovering material interests. This study will increase our knowledge of the contemporary industrial setting in China. Such knowledge will improve business and political relationships with China, leading to a more productive relationship to the advantage of all parties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The dissertation written from my findings traces a politically contentious practice from its emergence in southern China in 2010, through its repression and appropriation by the state in 2015. In asking why social movements occur and why they do or don?t succeed, social-movement literature must contend with movement failure and how entrenched political structures can thwart efforts for reform. By studying the rise and fall of collective bargaining, which was introduced to workers by labor NGOs as a contentious political practice, and situating findings within a social-movement framework, this study bridges studies on regime resilience and social movements.   Contentious collective bargaining found acceptance among workers due to ambiguous political opportunities that dovetailed with labor NGOs efforts to promote the practice. Similarly, collective bargaining?s demise was brought on through contradictions in the state-built organizational structures, rather than repressive forces alone. Indeed, local state actors did not immediately move to stamp out workers? attempts to use collective bargaining. At one point, they even actively encouraged workers to use it to resolve their disputes. Eventually, they would appropriate the practice for themselves while quashing the activists and NGOs who had originally promoted it. But the state?s support of collective bargaining depended on the extent to which it could be used to minimize workers? disruptive activity and maintain legal boundaries. While labor NGOs had hoped collective bargaining could be used to expand workers? rights, contradictions within the state-built organizational infrastructure were able to neuter the practice and maintain structures of power.        The data for my study is primarily built from the analysis of six different labor disputes that unfolded from 2011 to 2014 and in 2016. The overarching analytic approach of this study follows McMichael?s incorporated comparison strategy, which emphasizes the relational aspect of different cases and allows a systemic whole to be constructed through comparison of related cases. The chapters here focus on presenting a narrative of these labor disputes in order to provide multiple snapshots of a different moments in collective bargaining?s life course, and construct a more holistic picture of its trajectory in China. While each chapter engages a distinct line of inquiry, the cases throughout these chapters are connected to each other across time and space.   My dissertation contributes to social-movement theories by detailing the institutional mechanisms that fortify regime resilience, allowing this literature to better understand movement failure.
