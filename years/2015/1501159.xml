<AbstractNarration>During the height of the ice age, glaciers covered large portions of North America. Temperate forests persisted in areas known as glacial refugia, such as the coastal plains of the southern United States. Some species may also have existed much farther north than previously thought possible, but evidence for these cryptic northern refugia is controversial. The proposed research will test whether two hickory species survived glaciation in cryptic refugia, possibly located in the southern Appalachians or Ozarks. Genetic variation will be assessed in populations of the two species from across the eastern United States, and patterns of variation will be statistically compared to patterns generated under computer simulations according to a variety of historical scenarios. For the first time, this will provide a measure of confidence in how likely it is that cryptic northern refugia existed. This aspect of forest history is important for understanding how tree populations have migrated and adapted to climate change in the past. The patterns of genetic variation detected will have implications for forestry and conservation biology, and as a resource for future research. The research itself promotes the progress of science by combining genetic analysis and paleogeographical reconstruction, and it has implications for national welfare, given the potential impacts a changing climate; the project also supports education and diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survival of temperate species in southern refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum (21.5 Ka) is a classic phylogeographic paradigm, yet this paradigm has been challenged by new but inconclusive evidence suggesting the additional existence of cryptic northern refugia. Using two eastern North American hickory species, the research will analyze a large genetic dataset of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using computer simulations and Approximate Bayesian Computation to test whether spatially-explicit demographic models containing both cryptic northern refugia and southern refugia better explain the data than models containing only traditional southern refugia. The rangewide SNP dataset will also allow exploratory analysis of patterns of local adaptation. This project will be the first to assess statistical support for cryptic northern refugia in any species, and will establish a genomic resource for future studies. Results will aid in better understanding past responses to climate change, including historical migration rates, patterns of adaptation, and geographic distributions of genetic diversity. The relevance to applied biology will be highlighted in a brochure distributed to a wide network of foresters and conservation biologists established through fieldwork. An existing University of Michigan program will also serve as a platform for discussing the project and its relevance to climate change with local high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Since the end of the last ice age more than 20,000 years ago, northern hemisphere temperate tree species have migrated northward as glaciers melted and climates warmed. By examining genetic data from trees sampled across the entire geographic distribution of a given species, it is possible to make inferences about where forests were located during the ice age, and how migration of tree species has impacted the present-day geographic distribution of genetic diversity. The goal of this project was to determine where populations of two widespread eastern North American hickory species (bitternut hickory and shagbark hickory) were located during the last ice age, and to build and test different models of how the species migrated and recolonized their current ranges since the end of the last ice age.<br /><br />The locations where temperate species survived during ice ages are known as &ldquo;refugia&rdquo;, and are generally believed to have consisted of small populations located near southern areas of a species&rsquo; modern distribution. While the locations of refugia are well known in Europe, they have been less precisely located in eastern North America. In addition, recent research has suggested that some species may have survived much farther north than previously believed possible. The project activities were designed to test these (and other) hypotheses.</p> <p><br />In addition to determining refugium locations, the project documented patterns of genetic variation across eastern North America. Understanding geographic patterns of genetic variation will allow conservation biologists to identify areas of high genetic diversity and highly genetically unique populations that may be of conservation priority. These same populations may also be of interest to foresters as potential sources to screen for variation in traits of economic importance such as pest and pathogen resistance, wood quality and growth, nut production, etc.</p> <p><br />In order to test different hypotheses about refugium locations and migration patterns, four major activities were conducted:</p> <p><br />(1) Collection of DNA samples from across eastern North America for both species. More than 180 individuals were sampled for each species from 21 states and provinces.</p> <p><br />(2) Generation of a genomic dataset. More than 1,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic markers were characterized for each individual.<br /><br />(3) Predicting possible refugium locations. Refugia were predicted using ecological niche models, which can be used to determine areas of suitable climate where the species may have lived during the past. The most likely areas predicted from ecological niche models are similar for both species, and include a southeastern refugium in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, and a southwestern refugium in Louisiana and eastern Texas. However, alternative methods of predicting refugium locations based on minimum temperature and precipitation requirements suggest that temperate forest species may have occupied a much larger area during the last ice age, potentially including most of the southeastern United States.<br /><br />(4) Testing alternative hypotheses concerning refugium locations, and factors affecting migration history and driving the contemporary geographic distribution of genetic diversity. The genomic dataset from (2) will be used to test hypotheses generated in (3) by comparing predictions of demographic models to the observed genetic data. At the time of writing, the PhD student co-principal investigator supported by the project has one year remaining until graduation and final results of this activity are not yet available. However, preliminary results have revealed several interesting genetic patterns. In both species, there is relatively high genetic diversity throughout the species&rsquo; range, especially in central and northern populations. There is also very little genetic differentiation across different geographic areas. These patterns contrast sharply with those found in Europe (where southern populations are very distinct and have the highest genetic diversity), and may suggest that ice age forests in eastern North America were more extensive and less isolated into distinct refugia. Over the next year, the final stages of the project will consist of using the resources generated in steps (1-3) to model and statistically test alternative hypotheses that could explain these preliminary findings.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/07/2017<br>      Modified by: Jordan&nbsp;Bemmels</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501159/1501159_10354191_1496848116074_BN1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501159/1501159_10354191_1496848116074_BN1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bitternut bud"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501159/1501159_10354191_1496848116074_BN1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bitternut bud"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Sulphur-yellow bud of bitternut hickory</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jordan Bemmels</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jordan&nbsp;Bemmels</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bitternut bud</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501159/1501159_10354191_1496848161399_BN2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501159/1501159_10354191_1496848161399_BN2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bitternut leaf"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501159/1501159_10354191_1496848161399_BN2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bitternut leaf"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Leaf scales on the underside of the leaf of bitternut hickory</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jordan Bemmels</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jordan&nbsp;Bemmels</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bitternut leaf</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501159/1501159_10354191_1496848233779_SB1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501159/1501159_10354191_1496848233779_SB1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Shagbark bark"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501159/1501159_10354191_1496848233779_SB1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Shagbark bark"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Shagbark hickory is easily recognized by its distinctive bark that peels off in long, thick strips</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jordan Bemmels</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jordan&nbsp;Bemmels</div> <div class="imageTitle">Shagbark bark</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501159/1501159_10354191_1496848299849_SB2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501159/1501159_10354191_1496848299849_SB2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Shagbark fruit"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501159/1501159_10354191_1496848299849_SB2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Shagbark fruit"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Immature nuts of shagbark hickory</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jordan Bemmels</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jordan&nbsp;Bemmels</div> <div class="imageTitle">Shagbark fruit</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
