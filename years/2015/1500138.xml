<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines:  African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion.  BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, namely to "integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities."  Since national security and economic vitality of the United States require a highly trained domestic STEM workforce, institutions engaged in the most advanced levels of research and innovation must do their part to train tomorrow's leaders in STEM. The Wisconsin LSAMP BD (WiscAMP-BD) Program builds on the growing diversity of undergraduate students who are completing their Baccalaureate degrees in STEM. The strategies employed by the WiscAMP-BD Program will contribute significantly to increasing the diversity of leaders in academia and the STEM workforce, thereby helping the nation to remain globally competitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WiscAMP-BD program is based on established theories of identity development and integration, adult learning and career development, and institutional change and has the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt;1) To recruit and enroll a cohort of twelve students into any of the 54 STEM doctoral programs at UW-Madison;&lt;br/&gt;2) To pair each of the students who are strong candidates for graduate study and are underrepresented in STEM with faculty mentors who are engaged in cutting-edge research and committed to mentoring students from underrepresented populations;&lt;br/&gt;3) To establish a community of practice for WiscAMP-BD students to support the development of eight core competencies and their persistence to the doctoral degree.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The ability of the United States to protect its national interests and remain competitive on a global scale requires a domestic workforce with advanced degree training in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Yet, graduate education in STEM is marked by a persistent absence of certain ethnic/racial groups and in some disciplines women of all backgrounds. Despite the need for diverse researchers, many excellent students from backgrounds that are underrepresented in STEM begin their graduate studies in a STEM discipline, but leave before completing their degrees. The Wisconsin Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Bridge to the Doctorate (WiscAMP-BD) Cohort 1 project addressed the need to increase the diversity of an advanced degree STEM workforce by:</p> <ul> <li>Recruiting a cohort of 12 excellent students who graduated with baccalaureate degrees in STEM from Louis Stokes Alliance from Minority Participation institutions across the country</li> <li>Pairing students with experienced faculty advisors who have robust research programs and are committed to supporting students with mentorship and research funding through five years of graduate study</li> <li>Providing professional development seminars, social opportunities with a diverse community of peers, and access to a network of culturally responsive faculty mentors</li> </ul> <p>At the end of its award period, the WiscAMP-BD Cohort 1 project has successfully retained 10 out of 12 underrepresented minority students in STEM doctoral training programs. Two students completed their Master&rsquo;s Degrees (one in Civil Engineering and one in Forest and Wildlife Ecology) with commitments from their faculty advisors to support the students should they choose to resume their graduate studies. One student completed her Master&rsquo;s degree in Pharmaceutical Science and transferred to continue her doctorate in chemical biology at another institution.</p> <p>Of the 10 students who remain in doctoral programs, two were successful in obtaining prestigious research fellowships beyond the Bridge to the Doctorate. One student in Biomedical Engineering was selected for a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. Another student in the Neuroscience Training Program was awarded the&nbsp;National Institutes of Health (NIH) Ruth L. Kirschstein Pre-doctoral Individual National Research Service Award (NRSA) award. One student in Engineering Physics was selected for an internship with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A student in the Chemistry doctoral program was first author on a featured research article published in the lead journal for her discipline. Two additional students were also successful in publishing articles in peer-reviewed journals. These are notable accomplishments for students early in their graduate careers.</p> <p>Broader Impacts: The WiscAMP-BD Cohort 1 outcomes reflect the collective commitment of faculty, graduate training program staff and administrative leadership to the national effort to broaden participation in STEM and diversity the professoriate. The collaborations between programs, faculty and staff have led to more integrated and consistent professional development opportunities across graduate training programs. The long-term outcome of the WiscAMP-BD program will be to increase the ethnic/racial diversity of <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">leaders</span></em> throughout academic science and engineering.&nbsp; Increasing the diversity of academic leadership will promote greater diversity in all STEM areas and foster research excellence and innovation.</p> <p>Intellectual Merit: The WiscAMP-BD project included an evaluation component that provided valuable evidence of the importance of programs to retain underrepresented minority students in STEM graduate programs. A survey of students who were participating in WiscAMP-BD and similar programs found that minority graduate students in these programs were more likely than their counterparts to believe they belonged in their discipline and to value the importance of ethnic and gender diversity in their field of research. These results are consistent with attitudes and beliefs that will lead to persistence in research career pathways and have been disseminated at regional and national conferences.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/09/2018<br>      Modified by: Gail&nbsp;Coover</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1500138/1500138_10354931_1531163765955_2016SLS--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1500138/1500138_10354931_1531163765955_2016SLS--rgov-800width.jpg" title="1st_Student_Leadership_Symposium"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1500138/1500138_10354931_1531163765955_2016SLS--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="1st_Student_Leadership_Symposium"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">WiscAMP Undergraduate students and Bridge to the Doctorate Fellows commemorating the first WiscAMP Student Leadership Symposium.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Gail Coover</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gail&nbsp;Coover</div> <div class="imageTitle">1st_Student_Leadership_Symposium</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1500138/1500138_10354931_1531163154639_KatrinaCarterSchraggeLab--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1500138/1500138_10354931_1531163154639_KatrinaCarterSchraggeLab--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Katrina_Carter"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1500138/1500138_10354931_1531163154639_KatrinaCarterSchraggeLab--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Katrina_Carter"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Katrina Carter, Physiology Graduate Training Program, collects data in William Schragge's research laboratory.</div> <div class="imageCredit">William Schragge</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gail&nbsp;Coover</div> <div class="imageTitle">Katrina_Carter</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1500138/1500138_10354931_1531163390146_Dilibe2017--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1500138/1500138_10354931_1531163390146_Dilibe2017--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Godwin_Dilibe_Offiah"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1500138/1500138_10354931_1531163390146_Dilibe2017--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Godwin_Dilibe_Offiah"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dilibe Offiah earned his Master's Degree in Civil Engineering in December 2017.
