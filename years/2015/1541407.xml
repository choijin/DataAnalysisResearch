<AbstractNarration>The University of South Florida (USF) is building a Campus Research Network (CRN) to provide campus research laboratories high-speed connectivity to centralized USF High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities to facilitate scientific data-driven experimental work and to enable the analysis of extremely large data sets. The CRN is a dedicated 100 Gb/s Science DMZ connecting the USF Health Informatics Institute, the Neurophysiological Laboratory, and the Auditory &amp; Speech Sciences Laboratory to central USF HPC resources. High performance data transfer nodes (capable of sustaining over 100 Gb/s read/write from/to disk throughput) are installed near the HPC resources as well as the laboratories to facilitate high-speed data transfers, allowing for data transferred to the cluster for analysis to be immediately available to all compute nodes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new CRN promises to accelerate the development of innovative, data-driven experimental techniques using near real-time feedback based on the analysis of large experimental data sets to alter experimental and treatment conditions and/or medical device settings to provide a better understanding of age-related effects on brain function as well as enabling the development of brain-controlled sharing devices. The CRN also advances the understanding of diabetes and rare diseases by providing the bandwidth required to transfer the extremely large data sets curated by the Health Informatics Institute to the central USF HPC cluster. This project lays a foundation for connecting multiple Tampa-area USF campuses to the Florida Lambda Rail (and Internet2) at 100 Gb/s, allowing for state-wide, national, and international collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of South Florida successfully implemented the Campus Research Network, a dedicated 100 Gb/s Science DMZ network, connecting several experimental facilities to the central high-performance computing infrastructure to facilitate data-intensive research activities.  After several iterations, servers called data transfer nodes, or DTNs for short, capable of supporting close to 100 Gb/s disk-to-disk transfers have also been designed and installed.  These DTNs allow data generated by these experimental facilities to be transferred to the central HPC cluster for analysis as fast as it is created, allowing data-driven alterations to the experiment in near real-time.   The Campus Research Network has improved the connectivity between the Health Informatics Institute's primary data center and their dedicated high-performance computing cluster from 10 Gb/s across a shared campus network to 100 Gb/s on a dedicated Science DMZ network.  The increased bandwidth has accelerated pediatric diabetes and rare-disease research by significantly reducing the transfer time of large datasets for analysis.  The development of distributed analysis techniques for neuroscience data has lead to both the optimization of existing and the development of new data analysis methods not originally considered within this award, spawning on-going research activities.   The installation of the Campus Research Network has also spawned excitement over accelerating data-intensive scientific workflows around the University of South Florida.  This excitement has and will continue to open communication and collaborations across multiple Departments and Colleges as well as potentially increasing the use of advanced computing technologies, resulting in increased research output.
