<AbstractNarration>The General Theory of Relativity discovered by Einstein tells us that the familiar, everyday force of gravity is a manifestation of something much stranger: the bending of the geometry of space-time by matter. Among the key predictions of the theory is the existence of gravitational waves: ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The detection of continuous gravitational waves from rotating neutron stars would be especially interesting because many such sources are expected to continue emitting for long durations, allowing follow-up investigation of increasing precision, and because it is believed that these waves will provide insight into the poorly known structure of these exotic stars. The research to be carried out, on both the instrumental and analytical sides, will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art science at the frontier of knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will focus on a number of specific areas related to the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO) Experiment: 1) co-leading the ongoing LIGO Scientific Collaboration's search for continuous gravitational waves; 2) carrying out searches for those waves from both isolated and binary neutron stars using programs developed previously by the University of Michigan gravitational waves group; 3) developing new search algorithms with improved sensitivity and computational efficiency; and 4) detector characterization of Advanced LIGO interferometers focused on spectral line identification and mitigation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Discovery  Gravitational waves now provide a new window to the universe, thanks to the exquisitely sensitive interferometers of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory). The discovery by LIGO in September 2015 of gravitational waves from the merger of two massive black holes marked one of the major milestones in science of the last century. The discovery in August 2017 of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger followed by subsequent electromagnetic observations was another major milestone, not just for gravitational wave astronomy, but for understanding the production of heavy elements in the Universe. As charter members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), the Michigan Gravitational Wave Group has taken on leadership and major responsibilites within the LSC, in the quest to discover gravitational waves and with them to observe new phenomena in the universe. The PI co-led the Continuous Waves search group for nine years, served on the LSC Executive Committee and Management Team, served on the Detection Committee, which validated the GW150914 discovery before its announcement to the world in early 2016, and now co-leads the LSC Editorial Board.   Intellectual Merit  The Michigan group's primary focus in the LSC is to find continuous gravitational waves radiated by rotating neutron stars in the galaxy. The PI co-led the LSC working group searching for such  continuous-wave sources for nine years, with effort devoted in recent years to preparing for discovery in the Advanced LIGO era, which began in fall 2015. Searches have been carried out by the Michigan group in the O1+O2 data for both isolated and binary neutron stars in our galaxy. Searches are now under way by the Michigan group in the O3 data for continuous waves from isolated neutron stars in the galaxy (all-sky, directed and targeted searches).  During the Advanced LIGO era, the Michigan group also worked extensively in detector characterization focused on identifying and mitigating spectral artifacts that can degrade searches for continuous waves. Data from Advanced LIGO commissioning, from engineering runs and from the first observing run have been carefully scanned and spectral artifacts reported to commissioners. This effort has been been aided by extended visits by Michigan graduate students to LIGO Hanford Observatory.  Broader Impacts  Over the years the Michigan group has trained many graduate students, many undergraduates and a handful of high school students to work at the forefront of physics research and instrumentation. The group has taken full advantage of several special programs at the national and university level to attract students, including female and Hispanic students.  The PI and graduate students have given outreach talks, including a pair of video-taped "Saturday Morning Physics" lectures immediately following the February 2016 discovery announcement, lectures now shown regularly on local Ann Arbor community television.  The group has also collaborated with the Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum (for which Riles served for two terms on the Board of Trustees) in building LIGO-related exhibits.
