<AbstractNarration>Computer systems today are all built around what is called the von Neumann architecture where the computation subsystem and the memory subsystem are separately designed and considered. This model has served the industry well for several decades. It does, however, create a bottleneck (referred as the von Neumann bottleneck) between the two subsystems. The increasing scale and dependence on data in modern computers put more and more stress on the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting computer speed and increasing energy costs. New technologies to address this problem can significantly improve all computers including modern data centers and supercomputers that are shouldering ever more responsibilities in science, medicine, engineering, business and commerce, and everyday life of an average citizen. This project is an effort to develop one such technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research centers around a novel nano-scale device recently developed by one of the investigators of the project. The device is called a coupled-disk resonator or CDR for short. CDR contains two flat disks very closely placed together. The fascinating property is that, thanks to technology, these disks can be shrunk down to nano-scale and placed in close proximity precisely. As a result, they can interact with light in a variety of controllable ways that allow computer designers to build superior optical communication systems than possible today. More excitingly, the CDRs can be manipulated to perform (simple) computations directly without having to convert optical signals first to electronic signals as is the case today. The potential outcome is not only high-performance communication channels, but smart ones that can significantly mitigate the von Neumann bottleneck. In this project, the investigators will study and experiment with the designs of both the device and the system built with these devices in an effort to bring this potential technology closer to reality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project exploratores the area of optical networks. As the CMOS performance becomes the bottleneck in future computer systems, we seek potential breakthrough using optical devices which have a number of intrinsic benefits such as high throughputs and low latencies. The device of focus is a novel optomechanical device called Coupled-Disk Resonator (or CDR). Using CDR as a path forward, this project aims to make optical interconnect inside a computer system closer to reality.   * We have achieved coupled microdisk resonator with an intrinsic optical Q as high as 1.01*10^5, on the silicon carbide platform.   * We have achieved the f*Q product as high as 2.1*10^10 in the fabricated coupled microdisk resonators.   * We have achieved the efficient excation of nonlinear optomechanics in the coupled microdisk resonator.   * We have achieved an intrinsic optical Q as high as 1.1*10^5 for lithium niobate nano-optomechanical resonators, which is about two orders of magnitude higher than any other lithium niobate nanoresonators reported to date.   * We have achieved the f*Q product for nanomechanical modes as high as 1.47*10^12 for a mechanical frequency up to about 1.03GHz, in the lithium niobate nanobeam resonator.   * We have achieved a strong optomechanical coupling of g_OM=22GHz/nm.   * We have achieved the efficient excitation of nonlinear optomechanics in the lithium niobate nano-optomechanical resonators.   * We have observed extremely efficient all-optical control and tuning of optical cavity, with a tuning rate of ~84MHz/photon, the highest value ever reported.   * We have observed intriguing quenching of nonlinear photorefraction in high-Q lithium niobate photonic crystal nanoresonator, for the first time ever reported.   * We have achieved an intrinsic optical Q as high as 1.3*10^6 for lithium niobate nonlinear microring resonator.   * We have achieved engineered group-velocity dispersion in lithium niobate microring resonators, whose value can be flexibly tuned between normal dispersion and anomalous dispersion.     The project also trained a number of PhD students include a female student in broad interdisciplinary areas of nanophotonics, nonlinear photonics, micro/nanomechanics, material science, and system designs.  The research outcomes have been disseminated to the research communities through published papers and conference presentations.   The research outcomes have been incorporated into the course offered  at the University of Rochester, Nanophotonic and Nanomechanical Devices, which has attracted broad interest across multiple disciplines of Optics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Material Science, and Technical Entrepreneurship and Management.   The research project has provided lab demonstrations and lab tours to promote the interest and participation of K-12 students, and to broaden the participation from underrepresented groups, through the outreach programs at the University of Rochester.
