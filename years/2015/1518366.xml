<AbstractNarration>Understanding how ecosystems function and provide important services for humans is one of the great ecological challenges of the 21st century. This research examines how predator species contribute to reducing crop losses in agricultural ecosystems by consumption of crop-eating species, thereby providing an important ecosystem service that increases crop productivity. By learning how to enhance the abundance and activity of predators, agricultural productivity and environmental quality should improve. Strengthening this type of ecosystem service is increasingly important given evidence of negative effects of chemical pest management and consumer preferences for food produced with fewer chemical inputs. This project investigates whether predatory bird populations increase when researchers provide nest boxes in fruit-growing regions and whether the predatory birds in turn reduce crop damage by consuming crop-eating insects, rodents, and birds. Further, the project investigates factors that potentially influence fruit growers' decisions about the use of predator nest boxes, including economic and consumer-preference considerations. The work will result in greater knowledge about the contexts under which humans can enhance ecosystem service delivery. It will provide information about factors that influence fruit grower adoption of management strategies of crop-eating species. Finally, it will document the value of nest-box programs to the conservation of predatory bird species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the American kestrel, Falco sparverius, a falcon whose prey species damage cherries, blueberries, and other fruits. The work addresses two hypotheses:  1) resource subsidies in the form of nest boxes for kestrels reduce prey activity and abundance and, thus, reduce damage to cultivated fruit and 2) the economics of fruit production, consumer preferences for particular pest management techniques, and kestrel conservation will influence grower decisions about installing nest boxes, and produce positive feedbacks on the growth of nest-box programs in agricultural regions. Researchers will survey abundance and activity of kestrels and crop-eating species, as well as fruit damage, in landscapes with and without kestrels using nest boxes. They will calculate costs and benefits to individual growers and regional economies of utilizing predator nest boxes in fruit-producing regions. The project will use a national survey of fruit growers and in-person interviews, along with modeling approaches, to investigate factors that influence grower adoption of predator nest boxes as a pest management practice.  By integrating information from ecology, economics, and food systems sociology, the project will improve understanding of linkages between natural predator-prey effects, the degree to which humans can manipulate such effects through providing resources to predators, and the potential for factors other than economic ones to influence grower decisions about agricultural practices.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We worked with fruit farmers to investigate whether we could attract small falcons, American kestrels, to their farms to reduce the abundance of other birds, like American robins, that eat blueberries and cherries. American kestrels eat many crop pests including insects, mammals, and other birds and so our expectation was that their presence in an orchard would deter pest species. We installed kestrel nest boxes on towers in cherry orchards and blueberry fields in northern and western Michigan. We found that kestrels were more common in sites with nest boxes compared to sites without them. We documented that kestrels successfully raised young in the boxes and often fledged three to four young at a time. We also found that kestrels in sweet cherry orchards reduced the abundance of fruit-eating birds. We estimated that, if all sweet cherry growers in Michigan attracted kestrels to their orchards, the sweet cherries saved from fruit-eating birds would increase Michigan state income by more than $2 million, and produce nearly 50 jobs, over five years.</p> <p>We found that the effects of installing nest boxes varied in different regions. Kestrel boxes were occupied at lower rates on blueberry farms in western Michigan compared to those on sweet cherry farms in northern Michigan, although the boxes in the two regions tended to produce the same number of fledglings. In addition, boxes on blueberry farms were used much more often by non-native European starlings, a pest bird species, in blueberry fields. Therefore, it takes more time to manage kestrel nest boxes in regions with more starlings because the boxes will need to be monitored for starling activity.</p> <p>We conducted a national survey of fruit farmers and interviewed some of them, to document the factors that influenced their decisions about farm management practices, including conservation practices. Key considerations for farmers were fruit quality, cost and effectiveness of practices, pest pressure, and timing. We found high farmer interest in attracting predatory birds with nest boxes because they thought this practice would reduce bird damage and increase fruit quality and income. They indicated that more information about costs and benefits of this technique would be valuable. We also found that, for farmers who included natural predators like kestrels in their thinking, the timing of farm management practices was important. In other words, if the installation and maintenance of kestrel nest boxes could be done when there were fewer other demands on their time, they would be more likely to adopt this strategy. Finally, farmers employing one conservation practice, like predator nest boxes, were more likely to be employing others, like managing habitat for beneficial insects like bee pollinators.</p> <p>Overall, our results indicate that attracting natural predators to agricultural landscapes can reduce pest abundance at a low cost, with potential reverberating benefits including greater awareness of the value of natural predators, reduced pesticide use, and increased income to farmers who communicate their use of this pest management technique to consumers.&nbsp;</p> <p>We made the information from our project available to farmers, researchers, university extension personnel, and students through papers we have published and through presentations at farmer and academic conferences and in classrooms.
