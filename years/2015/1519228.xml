<AbstractNarration>------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT FOR 1519228&lt;br/&gt;The social democratic states of Northern Europe are characterized by a universalistic welfare system, which guarantees basic living standards for everyone. Although these countries have historically had little diversity, recently they have experienced significant demographic change through international migration. The incorporation of diverse immigrant groups into Nordic societies presents a number of interesting challenges for the principle of universalism. This project, which trains a graduate student to conduct rigorous social scientific research in the areas of international migration and political sociology, analyzes the forces that have created universalist social democracies that are strikingly different from those of the past. Moreover, it investigates whether increased migration has undermined universalism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dissertation project will investigate country-to-country trends in international migration and some consequences of these trends in three steps. First, the research uses quantitative panel techniques on an extended sample representing all welfare state types to test whether migration follows a welfare magnet pattern, where migrants are disproportionately drawn to the generous welfare institutions of the Nordic social democracies, as some researchers have suggested. Second, the project offers a contemporary approach to international migration by tracing the institutional and social influences on migration flows within a context of increased global connectedness, going beyond conventional macro-structural explanations. In particular, the study considers destination countries' ties and commitment to an international society that seeks to aid refugees. It also considers social connectedness and exchange factors, like the sending of remittance monies and the increased use of communication technologies in an understudied context - migrants' origin countries. Third, the study turns to multilevel quantitative analyses of individual-level survey data to examine whether increasing migration levels and diversity in a region or country are associated with a decline in individual social trust and support for state welfare programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Advanced industrialized countries are experiencing profound shifts in social relations from large-scale international migration. This dissertation examines international migration as both a source and consequence of social forces in an increasingly globalized world. It focuses on migration to the universalist welfare states of Nordic Europe, which have transformed from largely homogenous societies to ones that are ethnically, racially, and religiously diverse.

I find that South-North migration is driven by World-Systemic influence like capital penetration, whereas South-South migration is more strongly associated with connectedness factors like socially-transmitted remittances. Nordic-bound migration is distinct from typical South-North migration as it is not significantly tied to capital movement and is instead influenced more by destination characteristics. Across all types, origin conflict is a significant predictor of international mobility. Finally, I analyze what migration-led diversity means for the bases of universalism by examining individual-level social trust and welfare support across 17 European societies.
