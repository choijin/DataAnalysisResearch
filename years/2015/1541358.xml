<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to understand how students' emotions play key roles in both learning engineering and their development of a professional identity.  There is increasing evidence that emotion impacts learning, yet these connections are not yet well understood.  By examining connections between emotions and learning, this project will inform the design of engineering degree programs which can connect scientific, technical, and social knowledge for the students and will design future solutions to societal problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arise from how the research on emotion and learning can be used by educators to create better learning environments for engineering students.  The project will also help students to better connect knowledge and adopt effective learning strategies.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by building the capacity of the nation's citizenry for addressing societal challenges through engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Primary Project Investigators  Nadia Kellam, Audrey Boklage, Brooke Coley, Joachim Walther  Need  The role that emotions play in student learning in higher education has largely been understudied. This is, in part, due to the nature of emotions, instinctive or intuitive feelings, which are often valued less than logical and rational ways of thinking.  Project Outcomes  Emotional turbulence is common in the first year of an engineering program. Students from different groups demonstrated varying emotional responses to similar experiences. Racially diverse students experienced more intense emotions in their engineering programs. Men were more emotionally articulate than women. In the second year students became more accepting of their identities as engineers and experienced more positive emotions. In the third year, students engaged in the professional and academic sphere of engineering and thus had more positive emotions and confirmation that they were engineers. In the fourth year, tensions and negative emotions reappeared as students began to make post-graduation plans. Narrative research is an effective way to tell student stories, and to conduct research on those stories.     So, what?  Advising: Many students had stories of faculty and advisors recommending that students take reduced course loads and focus on their studies, resulting in giving up extracurricular activities. This advice unintentionally resulted in students experiencing engineering to be a difficult major where excelling as an engineer means sacrificing other meaningful parts of their life.  Challenging, stimulating, and engaging engineering programs: Without even experiencing weed-out classes, the students that were interviewed in this study had many intense negative emotions, especially in their first year.  Subjecting students to more negative emotions in their first year commonly results in them feeling like they do not belong in engineering.  A focus on a more engaging early college experience could result in students being more challenged, stimulated, and engaged in their engineering programs which could result in enjoyment in their first years.  Failure as leading to learning: A stronger articulation of the value in learning how to fail and the acceptance of failure as a pathway to success would be valuable for our engineering students. Many students enter college with few experiences of failure, thus they have great stress and anxiety when they experience any type of failure (sometimes manifest as making a B+ in an introductory class).  Power of the story: In this narrative research project, we found that the power of an individual?s story is undeniable and difficult to ignore. Through students stories and their lived experiences in engineering, we can get a vibrant snapshot of engineering to begin to transform engineering education to attract diverse people to engineering and to ultimately be situated to address grand challenges that we are facing today.  Sense of community: In the second and third year, many students began to experience a sense of community and this was the time that they began to experience more positive emotions and demonstrated qualities such as ambition and resilience.  Family influence: In the fourth year, students from underrepresented groups, had more stress as they felt pressure (sometimes only perceived pressure) to enter the job market over pursuing graduate school. When students discussed this with their families, they were usually encouraged to pursue graduate school.  Family influence is critical for these students,especially during their first and fourth year as they experience more emotional turbulence.  Internships: Students who experienced internships or co-ops experienced a sense of empowerment that helped encourage them to continue in engineering. Professional development experiences for faculty members may help them better support undergraduate students and to help them gain this sense of empowerment through their curriculum.  Student empowerment and persistence: When students experienced intense, positive emotions, these emotions were often accompanied by empowerment and subsequent persistence in the major.  Designing curricula that engages, challenges, and stimulates engineering students will result in more positive emotions and can likely lead to empowerment and persistence&mdash;something critical as we are still struggling to attract and retain more students in engineering, and especially students from underrepresented groups.
