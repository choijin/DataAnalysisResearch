<AbstractNarration>Magnetic components such as inductors and transformers are indispensable parts of commercial power supplies. Although they are often blamed as a hindrance toward higher power density, the magnetic volumes could actually be less than those occupied by the unused spaces and the product's housing. Converter size will shrink significantly if the discrete inductors and transformers are eliminated by integrating magnetic energy storage or functionalities into the housing and unused spaces. Since the housing is often realized by molding a protective, non-magnetic compound over the power converter, this project will pursue the innovation of incorporating a molding material that has magnetic properties.  Molding such multifunctional material over the converter will form both the protective housing and the magnetic components, realizing "power integration by multifunctional molding ". Students affinity to new materials and to integration will be leveraged to share research opportunities and results with others. Construction of a multi-disciplinary engineering suite to realize the visions outlined above is expected to be a magnet attracting new undergraduates into electrical and material engineering and science, enticing juniors and seniors to graduate school, and promoting diversity. The engineering suite will serve as a campus test facility for laboratory experiments covering magnetic materials, molding resins, coupled magnetic fields, power-electronic circuits, and capstone design projects. "Scieneers," undergraduates in Virginia Tech's Scieneering program, will team with graduate research assistants to assist in simulation and experimental validation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the research is to integrate energy-storage function into the encapsulating case of power module, thereby reducing material usage and possibly simplifying manufacturing process. Fundamental contributions are anticipated in materials and electrical engineering, education, and application. Encapsulation material that integrates mechanical/chemical (protective) and electrical (energy storage) functions are to be synthesized using low temperature and low pressure. Multi-magnetics module (MMM) with unexplored electromagnetic properties and design methodology are to be devised to take advantage of such material. Designability of power-electronic converters are to be assessed the presence of magnetic medium. Converter topologies are to be synthesized to leverage the field couplings inside an MMM. All fundamental advances are to culminate in a manufacturing process of multi-magnetics module with less materials and cost, possibly. In addition to the educational efforts noted above, point-of-load converters and battery chargers will be packaged into semi-assembled modules to be completed by the Center for Enhancement of Engineering Diversity's high school students in the summer as a part of Virginia Tech's effort to recruit and train engineers of diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
