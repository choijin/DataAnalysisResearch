<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports the training of 30 undergraduate students in climate science research.  The proposal is for three years.  Ten students each year during the summer will have a choice of conducting research in multiple disciplines, such as atmospheric science, oceanography, terrestrial ecology, chemistry and biogeochemistry.  The overall objective is to attract a diverse group of students to climate science research by simulating the graduate research environment as closely as possible.  The program is a complete immersion in the research process complemented with weekly activities to enhance students' professional development through workshops on basic research skills and seminars on science communication, ethics, graduate school, and career opportunities.  Students will report their research in the form of a peer-reviewed journal article and a talk in the style of a scientific conference or a video for a general audience.</AbstractNarration>
