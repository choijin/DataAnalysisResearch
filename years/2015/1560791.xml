<AbstractNarration>In engineering, there is a dearth of women in the professoriate, especially women of color. This project addresses a major impediment to broadening participation in engineering and is closely aligned with current National Science Foundation goals to broaden participation in STEM overall. With a primary focus on women of color, this project involves creating a 1-day workshop targeting underrepresented doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, assistant professors, and associate professors in engineering (e.g., African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key objective of the effort is to provide the aforementioned groups with specific professional development to help foster greater preparation and appreciation for the engineering professoriate and create more opportunities for networking and information sharing with other colleagues around the nation. Other objectives of the workshop focus on leadership, mentoring, and work-life balance. The project includes strong research and evaluation components that aim to generate important information to improve recruitment and retention of women of color in the engineering professoriate. It also includes the development of a comprehensive website to provide information about the workshop and to promote the results from workshop participation.</AbstractNarration>

This one-day workshop was held in Madison, Wisconsin on June 3, 2016, in honor of the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Denice Denton Emerging Leader award. The award honors the life and career of Professor Denice D. Denton (1959&ndash;2006), an engineering faculty member and the first female dean of engineering in a major U.S. research university. Professor Denton worked throughout her life to give minorities a voice and to make engineering attractive to women and minorities; she strongly promoted diversity in higher education, and she helped many people break barriers and find their path in life.

It is important to help expand their network of professional contacts to ensure their future success. This community was empowered by the resources made available to them at this workshop. There were 164 workshop participants from 66 institutions. Almost 61% were from public universities, 24% were from private universities, and 15% were from minority institutions and business/government. Many disciplines were represented with the largest group coming from engineering followed by sciences (Computer Science, Physics &amp; Astronomy, Mathematics, Social Science). Of the 164 participants, approximately 85% were female and 15% were male. In terms of position, 27% were Assistant Professors, 45% were Associate Professors, 12% were Professors, 9% were graduate students, and 7% were from business/government. One year after the workshop, 11 participants traveled to leadership and professional conferences.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/08/2017<br>      Modified by: Susan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Burkett</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560791/1560791_10410010_1511902886100_EL-group-photo--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560791/1560791_10410010_1511902886100_EL-group-photo--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Group Photo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1560791/1560791_10410010_1511902886100_EL-group-photo--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Group Photo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photo taken of Workshop Participants and Organizing Committee members.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Regina King</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Susan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Burkett</div> <div class="imageTitle">Group Photo</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
