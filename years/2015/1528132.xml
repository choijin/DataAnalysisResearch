<AbstractNarration>Data-centric technologies form an essential part of the nation's economy and infrastructure.  Coincident with the evolution of these technologies, the amount of information that is being collected, stored and processed is growing at an exponential pace.  A sustainable solution for managing this explosion of data should be guided in part by a fundamental understanding of how information can be stored in a succinct manner that meets utility and access requirements.  This research seeks to quantify basic tradeoffs associated with information storage, utility and accessibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information theory provides a framework for quantifying what is and what is not possible in data compression and transmission.  The traditional information-theoretic framework, however, does not readily address critical challenges inherent to modern data processing applications and large data sets.  In particular, information-theoretic analyses generally ignore complexity constraints and encounter significant difficulties when distributed settings are considered.  Building on recent work by the principal investigator on compression under logarithmic loss and compression for similarity queries, this project will address these two issues by investigating rate-distortion tradeoffs with the added dimensions of distributed processing and complexity constraints.  Specific goals of the project include (i) characterizing the compressibility of an information source subject to the constraint that elementary queries are supported in the compressed domain with bounded complexity; and (ii) quantifying the performance of distributed processing (relative to centralized processing) for compression and inference.  As a counterpart to the proposed theoretical analyses, the design of practical algorithms that are capable of achieving the established information-theoretic limits will be pursued.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This project sought to identify rate-distortion paradigms applicable to modern data-centric problems, and to develop underlying theory and accompanying algorithms taking information- and complexity-theoretic considerations into account.   Broadly speaking, the outcomes of this project cover three complementary topics: (i) tradeoffs between information-optimality and algorithmic complexity for data-centric problems including DNA assembly and data structure queries; (ii) basic theory for distributed and networked compression systems; and (iii) statistical limits of estimation from noisy observations when a priori knowledge of data labels is missing or incomplete.   For the first topic, we established fundamental limits on the extent to which data can be compressed, subject to the constraint that the source data can be queried in compressed form with specified latency.  In another direction, we characterized the minimum ambiguity achievable in genome assemblies, subject to parameters of current sequencing technologies.  This ultimately inspired the implementation of a publicly available genome assembly package, HINGE, which has been used by research groups worldwide.    For the second topic, new information inequalities were discovered that unify several important results in network information theory.  These inequalities also apply more broadly, for instance in characterizing high-dimensional statistical and geometric phenomena.    For the third topic, we established statistical and computational limits for a multivariate regression problem, in which the observations have missing or incomplete labels. This type of observation model arises naturally in many applications, for instance in pose and correspondence estimation in images, and in low-power sensor networks.  To complement our theoretical results, we proposed computationally efficient estimators which are provably consistent and analyzed their performance. Efficacy was demonstrated on an image point-cloud matching task.    The above findings have been presented at international research symposia and published in scholarly journals.   Beyond scientific and technical accomplishments, this project contributed to the professional development of a Ph.D. student and an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley.  Notably, as a result of their work on this project, the undergraduate researcher received the UC Berkeley Arthur M. Hopkin award, the top undergraduate research award in UC Berkeley?s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.
