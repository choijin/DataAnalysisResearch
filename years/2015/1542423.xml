<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL AND TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding in the amount of $ 5,000 in support of the attendance and participation of young US-based scientists in the "Symposium: NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy of Polymers and Biobased Materials Pacific Conference" to be held in Honolulu HI, December 15-20, 2015.  The funds will cover approximately three full, and four student registration fees, as well as five housing grants. NMR spectroscopy is a premier technique for the study of polymers as well as biobased polymeric materials, i.e. polymers designed based on naturally occurring materials. The main purpose of this international conference is to report on the latest developments in NMR spectroscopy and their impact on the determination of the fundamental molecular and structural characteristics of polymers and their properties as well as in their specialized functions in a multitude of technological applications. Both fundamental and applied aspects will be covered is a planned set of eight session topics: (1) Polymer dynamics, interphases and crystallinity. (2) Diffusion and flow in polymers. (3) Blends, surfaces, and confined environments. (4) Polymer-focused advances in NMR instrumentation and methodology. (5) Solid state polymer structure. (6) Polymers in energy fields-batteries, fuel cells, biomass. (7) Polymers in solution phase. (8) Integration of NMR w/other techniques). The talks will be geared so that general polymer scientists can comprehend and exploit the studies presented.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[              Polymers represent the 3rd largest industry in the US, providing $400+ billion of product output and employing nearly 900,000 Americans (www.plasticsindustry.org).  Continued advancement of this industry requires creation of new polymers and processes to make them and organize them into useful devices.  In order to accomplish such innovation, we must increasingly understand how these polymers work by delving deep into the molecular structures and molecular motions that drive their bulk properties. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as an analysis tool can measure molecular structure and motion with unprecedented detail, and can also determine a range of properties of materials, from molecular scale, through the nanoscale and microscale, and up to the bulk scale.  Developments in the uses of NMR to understand polymers can yield (and has yielded) dramatic advances in new polymers and applications of polymers to new industries.    This symposium, which brought together 80 world experts in both polymer science and NMR measurements, is contributing to new avenues for comprehending basic polymer behaviors as well as developing new polymers.  The NSF POLY funding for this symposium supported the travel of 6 young US researchers who likely would not have been able to attend this key meeting.  These promising researchers are just entering this field, and are poised to make strong impacts on polymer science through their sensitive NMR studies.  The NSF POLY travel award recipients are:  Dr. Gregory Boutis (Brooklyn College), Dr. Andrew Clough (Oklahoma State University), Keith Fritzsching (Brandeis University), Dr. Gregory Holland (San Diego State University), Bryce Kidd (Virginia Tech), and Ying Wang (Virginia Tech).  See photos in attached image file. These symposium attendees each communicated their work via lectures and poster presentations.  These presentations and subsequent discussions covered their research studies, ranging from advanced polymer membranes for water purification, polymer gels for advanced batteries, naturally derived silk-based polymers made by spiders and silkworms, to understanding behaviors of protein-based polymers in human joint cartilage.  These studies all integrated NMR studies with broad knowledge obtained from other polymer characterization methods such as X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXD), electron microscopy (TEM and SEM), ion conductivity, and rheology.  Similarly, these studies made ties with theories and computer simulations relevant to polymer science, such as theories from the fields of porous materials, ion conduction, and polymer crystallinity.   These strategies for integrating knowledge from multiple viewpoints and disciplines are amplifying the productivity of polymer analysis studies with NMR.  Symposia such as this one serve to also build bridges to other areas of science that can impact our fundamental understanding of polymers, as well as develop new polymeric materials and thus new and productive US industries.    Finally, this NSF POLY support has furthered the development of human resources.  By participating in this symposium, these researchers have expanded their scope of research, have learned new aspects of scientific communication and collaboration, and have interfaced with both industrial and academic employers present at the meeting.
