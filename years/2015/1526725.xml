<AbstractNarration>Distributed computing systems are all around us, ranging from multiple cores in a cell phone to the Internet itself.  Distributed storage, or shared data, is a vital mechanism for communication among computing entities ("processors") in distributed systems and facilitates the development of correct and efficient applications.  Although shared data is a desirable abstraction, it is not generally provided in large-scale distributed systems due to physical limitations.  Instead, processors keep individual copies of the data, and communicate by sending messages to keep the copies consistent.  It is known that providing shared data with strong guarantees on how consistent the data is can be expensive -- in particular, the operations on the data can take a long time to complete.  This fact has fueled interest in more "relaxed" versions of the data, in the hope that operations can be implemented faster.  As an example of relaxed data, imagine data that supports read and write operations where a read operation can return a value that is not the one most recently written.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing software for distributed storage systems (and indeed for most distributed systems) that is correct and efficient is challenging due to complications caused by concurrency, component failures, and variable communication delays.  Yet being able to do so will benefit society because of the ubiquity of such software.  This project takes a principled approach, based on rigorous mathematical reasoning, to find distributed algorithms for some fundamental problems that underlie distributed storage systems, with especial focus on relaxed data, and to characterize applications that can exploit the relaxations and their improved performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project activities will also include creating undergraduate curricular materials on distributed computing to fill existing gaps and providing research experiences for undergraduates, especially women who are woefully under-represented, to encourage more to obtain graduate degrees in computing-related field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical problems to be solved include these: Find optimal implementations of various data structures that satisfy the "linearizability" consistency condition, where the performance metrics considered include worst-case as well as amortized time; amortized bounds are often of more use than isolated worst-case results, yet they have not been the focus of much analysis.  Discover the relationship between relaxing the specification of an object and relaxing the consistency condition.  Characterize general classes of applications that can exploit relaxed data structures or relaxed consistency conditions.  Determine the level of fault-tolerance of data types in a generic way.  Characterize patterns of churn (processors entering and leaving the system) that allow linearizable objects to be implemented in an asynchronous system subject to crash failures.  The PIs plan to apply, as a general tool, classifications of data type operations by their algebraic properties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the increasing reliance of society on distributed computing systems, provably correct and optimally efficient algorithms for implementing shared data will significantly benefit society through improved distributed applications, in particular for cloud computing and storage systems.  The use of shared memory, instead of more low-level techniques, contributes to better structured and easier-to-verify distributed applications.  Understanding inherent limits on efficiency allows better exploration of the design space.  Distributed storage, or shared data, is a vital mechanism for communication among processors in distributed computer systems, and facilitates the development of higher-level applications, such as those in cloud services.  Although shared data is a convenient abstraction, it is not generally provided in large-scale distributed systems.  Instead, processors keep individual copies of the data, and communicate by sending messages to keep the replicas consistent.  Strongly consistent implementations of shared objects with strict semantics are provably expensive, fueling interest in relaxing the semantics of the objects and/or the consistency condition.   We identified several situations in which a relaxed version of the specification of an arbitrary abstract data type is equivalent to a relaxed consistency condition.  In particular, we showed that data type relaxations are a subset of consistency conditions, i.e., relaxations and some weakened consistency conditions are different ways to express the same set of allowable behaviors.  The ability to use whichever model (relaxed data type specification or relaxed consistency condition) is more convenient is one direct, practical benefit of the correspondence.  The notion of consensus number tells which data types can be built out of which other data types in a fault-tolerant way.  We showed how the consensus number of any abstract data type in a large class can be determined in a generic way; the benefit is that as new data types are proposed, their consensus number can be automatically determined.  We also considered several varieties of a relaxed first-in-first-out queue, which are useful for applications such as webservers and state space exploration.  We determined the consensus numbers of these kinds of relaxed queues, which are outside the class considered in the work just mentioned.  Distributed systems in which processors enter and leave dynamically, such as mobile ad hoc networks and data centers, are typically asynchronous and crash-prone.  We developed an algorithm to emulate a shared read-write register in such systems, which is the first one to allow churn to continue forever and the system size to grow without bound.  The project partially supported seven graduate students.  One completed his PhD and started as an assistant professor; two completed their master's degrees, one of whom is continuing for a PhD.  Two undergraduates were supported for a summer of research.         Last Modified: 11/29/2018       Submitted by: Jennifer L Welch]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
