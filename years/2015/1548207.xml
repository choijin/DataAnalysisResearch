<AbstractNarration>A hallmark of effective science is reproducible results. If a result cannot be reproduced, it cannot be considered a robust scientific finding. Unfortunately, obstacles often slow progress towards these robust, reproducible observations in ecology and evolutionary biology as well as in many other disciplines. Scientists are rewarded for publicizing exciting results, but scientists have much less incentive to publish unexciting results or to test the reproducibility of previously published findings. Scientists therefore often search their data for the most exciting findings that will allow them to publish in the most prestigious journals, and they often do not invest in seeking to publish their full set of results. This and various related practices leads to an inflated rate of published false positives - results that are the outcome of chance rather than real biological phenomena. Because attempts to replicate prior findings are often rare, the error of these false positives often goes unrecognized for long periods. Even when replications exist, drawing conclusions from them is hindered by a lack of standards to promote effective syntheses across studies. Reducing bias and promoting replication and effective synthesis will require changing the institutions that control the incentives currently guiding scientists' decisions. One of the major classes of institutions shaping incentives is scientific journals. Journals in some disciplines, such as psychology and neuroscience, have begun introducing innovative editorial policies to reduce bias and facilitate replication. Now ecologists and evolutionary biologists are seeking to develop ideas appropriate for their own disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a workshop in which prominent journal editors in ecology and evolutionary biology will join with researchers interested in improving scientific inference to develop incentive structures in these disciplines that will reduce false positive rates, promote replication, and facilitate research synthesis. By the end of the workshop, the organizers hope to have drafts of editorial policy templates and other ideas for shaping incentive structures that make sense for these disciplines. The organizers also hope that journal editors and others will then implement policies that are right for their disciplines and journals, and that the discussions that follow in the wake of these initial policy implementations will promote more widespread adoptions of policies that improve empirical progress in their disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our primary objective was to promote empirical progress through the development and implementation of institutional incentive structures that reduce the proportion of results that are false positives, increase replication, and promote effective research syntheses in the empirical literature of ecology and evolutionary biology. We sought to meet this objective by holding a workshop for editors of major journals in ecology and evolutionary biology in which we developed, discussed, and promoted editorial policy tools that could be adopted and implemented by journals in these fields.  Ultimately, we wanted journals to adopt progressive editorial policies that better promote transparency and thus empirical progress.     General outcomes     Intellectual merit: Empirical progress in much of science, including evolutionary biology and ecology, is slowed by inflated rates of false positives in the empirical literature, low rates of replication, and obstacles to effective research syntheses. Many scientific conclusions may be wrong and current research and publishing practices mean that researchers are often slow to recognize errors. Although these problems result from the decisions of thousands of individual researchers, these individual decisions are strongly influenced by a smaller set of institutional incentive structures scientists must navigate. As a result of our workshop, journals have begun to deliberately shape incentive structures to reduce rates of publication of false positives and to promote replication and research syntheses.     Broader impacts: The core goal of this workshop was to maximize broader impacts. Although individual workshop participants learned about reducing false positive rates, promoting replication, and facilitating research synthesis, more important, these participants have begun taking steps to implement these goals throughout the disciplines of evolutionary biology and ecology. Many participants are in the process of implementing changes to editorial policies of the journals they edit, thus impacting all those researchers who derive information from those journals. Further, through editorials published in these journals and other articles published elsewhere, the impact of these initial changes to editorial policy at prominent journals is promoting the adoption of progressive editorial policies in many more journals throughout the disciplines of ecology and evolutionary biology. Thus the ripple effects of this workshop should benefit the disciplines of evolutionary biology and ecology at the broadest level.     Specific outcomes:     We held a workshop titled "Improving inference in evolutionary biology and ecology" in Charlottesville VA in November of 2015. The workshop was attended by 45 participants, including the three organizers (Parker, Nakagawa, Gurevitch), Editors in Chief of 20 journals, representatives of 11 more journals, many ecology and evolution researchers interested in transparency, three psychologists with experience addressing transparency issues in other fields, as well as others.     Every editor-in-chief at the workshop expressed support for improving transparency in evolutionary biology and ecology. As of 5 July 2016:  -16 journals have pledged to adopt policies improving transparency, and at least 13 others are engaged in ongoing discussions of this issue  -Eight (8) journals have agreed either to publish the joint editorial advocating transparency that was written after the workshop or to publish their own version of an editorial advocating transparency. Other journals are still considering this option.  -We have not yet reached out to journal editors not associated with the workshop, so we expect these numbers to grow substantially.     Results of this workshop have been, and continue to be, disseminated in multiple ways:  -Word of mouth &ndash; we had researchers from a great diversity of sub-disciplines together, and these researchers left the workshop and discussed its ou...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
