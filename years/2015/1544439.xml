<AbstractNarration>Glenn McClure, a composer and professor of music, will create an orchestral and choral musical composition by translating subsonic frequency data, obtained by the researcher Dr. Peter Bromirski studying the shifting Ross Ice Shelf, into musical frequencies within the range of human hearing.  McClure will also record audible ambient sounds that will enhance his composition as well as take video and still images for projection during live performances of his finished piece.  The goal is to deliver an artistic experience of the scientific concepts the music is based on and convey an emotional experience of the effects of changing conditions of the Ross Ice Shelf.  In addition to his composition, McClure will create an instructional module with the goal of empowering middle-school students with the ability to create their own musical works from scientific data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project holds relevance for the general public and the educational community as a new motivational instructional tool for science, in general, and Antarctica, specifically.  The deliverables will include sheet music, rehearsal recordings, videos to accompany live performances, composer's notes and links to Antarctic resources for extended study.  The educational products will include the arts integrated instructional module, an online community of practice, other online resources, and a platform to celebrate exemplary student work.  McClure has identified multiple potential dissemination channels for live performances of his compositions in addition to YouTube videos and other outreach opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

My music and field recordings are being used for the creation of new multimedia exhibition at the Birch Aquarium, Lo Jolla, California to be opened in 2018. I recorded a TEDx talk on November 4, 2017 at St. John Fisher College in Rochester, NY entitled "Ear to the Ice." After editing, this talk will be released to the public in early 2018. I was the keynote speaker for the Lessons from Abroad Rochester Area Study Abroad Returnee Conference https://rocyourglobalfuture.com/schedule/ on September 30, SUNY Geneseo. My speech focused on my work with the Artists and Writers Fellowship. As part of UC San Diego?s Initiative for Digital Exploration of Arts and Sciences (ideas.ucsd.edu), my field recordings and music compositions will anchor an interactive exhibit at the Birch Aquarium in La Jolla, CA to be opened in April 2018.

SUNY Geneseo, Geneseo, NY- Live skype interview with student researchers, faculty, and media specialists under the direction of David Irwin, College Communications. 13 students researched and wrote essays exploring the history of artists in Antarctica under the direction of Dr. Joseph Cope. 22 students wrote essays as part of their Science Journalism class with Dr. Jess Fenn. 40 students in the Chamber Singers under the direction of Dr. Gerard Floriano premiered the first musical work, "Tremble" on October 22, 2017 at the Doty Recital Hall, SUNY Geneseo campus. Developed an automated algorithm in collaboration with technical specialist Dr. Kirk Anne that translates large amounts of data into musical notes. I served as a faculty advisor to Venture Works, the student entrepreneurship competition under the direction of Dr. Judith Albers. Students developed possible business plans based upon my sonification algorithm. Submission of application to National Science Foundation I-Corps program in collaboration with the SUNY Research Foundation for the purpose of exploring possible commercial applications of my sonification algorithm.
