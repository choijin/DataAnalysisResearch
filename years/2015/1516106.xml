<AbstractNarration>The PI will carry out a series of radio observations to study the atmospheres of old stars with cool, dusty winds. The process that drives the winds is unknown, but understanding it is important, and the new observations obtained in this program will help.  The amount of mass lost in dusty winds can determine the star's fate, and the material shed from the star eventually spreads into the interstellar medium. It is now possible to measure the size, shape, and gas motions in the atmospheres of these stars using the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) radio telescope in New Mexico. The PI and her collaborators will make such measurements and use them to understand how the cool, dusty winds are launched. An educational podcast centered on the theme "Radio Stars" (the fourth in an ongoing series) will share results from this program with the general public. The PI will mentor an undergraduate student from Haystack Observatory's Research Experience for Undergraduate program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using recent observations obtained with the JVLA, this program will produce the most sensitive (by an order of magnitude) images to date of the radio photospheres of a sample of five of the nearest, best-studied AGB stars. A special calibration technique will be employed to "freeze" atmospheric phase variations, providing near perfect, diffraction-limited radio seeing, and yielding images with an angular resolution of ~40 mas (~4 AU at a distance of 100 pc). The extraordinary sensitivity will allow accurate measurements of fundamental stellar parameters, including the radius and brightness temperature, which will be compared with model predictions and other multi-wavelength observations. Four of the sample stars have been imaged previously at centimeter wavelengths, and two show clear evidence for deviation from spherical symmetry. The new observations (taken at different phases of the stellar pulsation cycle) will reveal whether the photospheric shape is time-variable and will be used to distinguish between possible causes of non-spherical shapes. For the stars exhibiting SiO maser emission, simultaneous observations will provide complementary information on the atmospheric dynamics. These will provide insight into the maser pumping and excitation processes and radial variations in density and temperature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    As stars like the Sun near the end of their lives, depletion of the hydrogen that supplies their nuclear fuel leads to their transition into a type of red giant star known as an asymptotic giant branch or "AGB" star. This transition involves a significant increase in the size (by up to a factor of 100). This expansion cools the outer layers of the star, dramatically lowering the temperature and causing the star to transform from yellow to red in color.  At this point, the star's nature becomes significantly more dynamic and variable. For example, AGB stars undergo pulsations with periods of order one year that cause the star to shrink and expand, leading to periodic variations in brightness by as much as a factor of 1000. AGB stars also launch stellar winds up to a billion times more powerful than the solar wind, leading to a high rate of mass loss. This dramatic shedding of material has a profound impact on the subsequent evolution of the star. Furthermore, the material shed by the star is enriched in heavy elements that in turn help to seed future generations of stars.  Despite the importance of the AGB stars to the ecology of the Milky Way Galaxy, many crucial aspects of their inner workings remain poorly understood, including the process by which they lose mass. To address these questions, this award utilized high-resolution observations of AGB stars at radio and millimeter wavelengths to gain new insights into their atmospheric physics, including the processes by which these stars power their winds and shed mass at such high rates.   Although most stars apart from the Sun appear as mere pinpoints of light when viewed through telescopes, the technique of radio interferometry can be used to resolve the surfaces of the closest AGB stars, as was done for the present study. In AGB stars, radio continuum emission (i.e., radiation at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths) arises from a region of the atmosphere known as the radio photosphere, lying at approximately twice the distance from the star as the portion of the star's atmosphere observed in visible light. The radio photosphere thus lies at the crucial juncture between the stellar "surface" and the higher regions of the atmosphere from which the stellar wind is launched.  Images of nearby AGB stars taken at radio wavelengths several years earlier had revealed the surprising result that the shapes of some of the stars were distinctly non-spherical. These shapes could have several possible origins, including rotation, tidal effects from a companion, distortion from a magnetic field, or non-radial pulsations. To distinguish between these possibilities, it was crucial to determine whether the shapes vary with time or remain fixed. To address this question, new observations of five AGB stars were obtained using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), including four previously observed stars. Additional high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) were also analyzed for one of the stars.   An analysis of these data showed that none of the observed stars appears perfectly spherical. Furthermore, the observed shapes of the four previously observed stars had changed with time. Distortions in shape caused by a companion, rotation, or a magnetic field are all expected to be relatively stable in time, implying that none of these effects are responsible for the observed deviations from sphericity. On the other hand, new data for one of the stars, Mira (&omicron; Ceti), obtained with the VLA and ALMA spaced 8 months apart show that the star's shape appears to be relatively stable on this shorter timescale.  An additional discovery from the recent observations was that several of the stars show clear evidence for brightness irregularities across their surfaces. This is consistent with a decades-old prediction that red giant stars should have giant convective cells on their surfaces (caused by the rise and fall of parcels of gas at different temperatures and densities within the stellar atmosphere).
