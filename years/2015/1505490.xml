<AbstractNarration>Many of the deepest problems in theoretical physics revolve around combining Einstein's theory of general relativity with quantum theory, two of the major intellectual achievements of the twentieth century. The resulting theory is called "quantum gravity" and is needed to better understand the origin of the universe, the nature of space and time on small scales, what happens inside black holes, and the very origin of our universe, the big bang.  By enabling graduate students and post-docs to participate in frontier physics, and to interact with other research groups, this award will have a broad and long-term impact on the development of future scientists. The results of the research will be disseminated to the scientific community through peer reviewed publication and scientific lectures, as well as to the general public through public lectures and other means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much remarkable progress in understanding the big bang has occurred through the use of loop quantum cosmology, a simplified version of loop quantum gravity which models the universe as a whole.  This award seeks to bridge the gap between this simplified model and full loop quantum gravity in order to solidify confidence in the predictions of the former.  This involves a number of interesting conceptual questions for which the principal investigator already has preliminary answers. A second part of this research aims to answer key questions regarding the Feynman sum-over-histories formulation of loop quantum gravity, in which space and time are treated in a more unified way, and to bring this formulation closer to completion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  An important question facing fundamental physics is how the well-tested laws of Einstein's theory of gravity and quantum mechanics become consistent at the Planck scale -- the question of quantum gravity.  This question is central to any attempt to understand the very origin of our universe, the big bang.  Much remarkable progress in understanding the big bang has occurred through the use of loop quantum cosmology, a simplified version of loop quantum gravity which models the whole universe, to a first approximation, as homogeneous and isotropic. This progress in understanding has led to new potential contact of quantum gravity with observation.   The first outcome of the research funded by this grant is a definition of homogeneity and isotropy in a full theory of quantum gravity, specifically loop quantum gravity (LQG). More precisely, a definition was found which (1.) is "background independent", that is, is invariant under arbitrary deformations of space (a condition required for it to make sense in any final theory of quantum gravity), (2.) respects the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, and (3.) respects the structure of continuum, non-truncated loop quantum gravity. Achieving all three of these criteria was highly non-trivial and had never been done before.   This definition of quantum symmetry was used to clarify a number of issues which, in particular, strengthened confidence in loop quantum cosmology (LQC), the prevailing quantum cosmological model based on LQG. This strengthened confidence in LQC can be regarded as a second principal outcome of the research. Indeed, this outcome was confirmed through independent means, again as part of the work of this grant, by directly applying the principle of background independence (invariance under spatial deformations) to show that various technical choices in the construction of LQC do not matter and all lead in the end to the same quantum cosmological model, namely that which has been used up until now in the LQC community.  The third principal outcome of this research regards a refinement of the prevailing model of the dynamics of LQG, the so-called `EPRL model?. This model defines the dynamics of LQG via the Feynman sum-over-histories formulation of quantum mechanics, in which space and time are treated in a more unified way &ndash;- an approach to LQG dynamics known as `spin-foams?. Specifically, it was shown that the EPRL model has more than one gravitational sector which interfere with each other in such a way as to produce results which seem to be not consistent with Einstein?s theory of gravity in the large-scale limit. As part of this grant, this prevailing model of dynamics was modified to eliminate all but one gravitational sector in order to correct the problem, leading to a spin-foam model which the PI has named the `proper? spin-foam model. Various consequences of this new model were then calculated, including the predicted statistical correlation between the gravitational field at different pairs of points in flat space-time -- the so-called `graviton propagator?. As was the case with the prior EPRL model, the resulting graviton propagator was found to be consistent with that predicted by linearized quantum gravity, which one expects because one is in the near-flat regime.  The fourth principal outcome of this research is the calculation of the `Hartle-Hawking? wave-function of the universe as predicted by the proper spin-foam model, including calculation of the predicted long-range correlations between values of the gravitational field at different points of space in the early universe.

This probability then leads to a new predicted lifetime for primordial black holes, expected in the early universe, that is much shorter than that predicted by Hawking evaporation alone, and may lead to predictions which might be compared with observation.   Broader Impact:  Through partial financial support, this grant enabled four doctoral students and one post-doc to participate in the research described above, contributing in an essential way to the professional development of the next generation of scientists. In addition, the grant in part enabled the PI to engage in other activities of broader impact, including (1.) giving a public lecture on quantum gravity which included parts of the research described above, and (2.) teaching an undergraduate course on quantum gravity which again touched upon parts of the above research.
