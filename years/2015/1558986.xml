<AbstractNarration>SES-1558986&lt;br/&gt;Karthick Ramakrishnan &lt;br/&gt;University of California-Riverside  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial group in the United States, and there are important gaps in our understanding of their social and civic integration. In addition, Asian Americans exhibit significant socioeconomic diversity, making them ideal for answering larger theoretical questions on immigrant incorporation in the United States, as it is shaped by differences in national origin, residential concentration, and educational and labor market outcomes. This project will build a data resource for public release in June 2017 that will have widespread utility among scholars in social science disciplines, most notably in sociology, political science, and public policy, as well for journalists and bloggers versed in social science data and trends.  The survey of Asian Americans will provide important data for questions related to immigrant incorporation, attitudes on economic inequality and race-relations, and civic and political engagement. In addition to providing comparisons within the Asian American racial category, we will include cross-racial comparisons (to African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and non-Hispanic whites) using the same instrument and mode of interview. This project advances the mission of the National Science Foundation to promote the progress of science, particularly the social sciences, as well as to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare. In particular, this project has relevance in terms of broader impacts as specified by Congress in 2010: Asian Americans have a disproportionately large number of high-skilled workers in STEM fields. Understanding their experiences, attitudes, opportunities, and barriers, will be critical to ensuring the economic competitiveness of the United States and the development of a globally competitive STEM workforce&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This survey of Asian Americans will: 1) be contemporaneous with the 2016 General Social Survey (GSS) and American National Election Study (ANES), 2) replicate key questions from those surveys, and 3) build on the pioneering efforts of past surveys of Asian Americans.  The project produces a dataset for public release in June 2017 through ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for&lt;br/&gt;Political and Social Research) that will have widespread utility among scholars in social science disciplines as well for journalists and bloggers versed in social science data and trends. The survey will provide data to address questions related to immigrant incorporation, attitudes on economic inequality and race-relations, and civic and political engagement. In addition to providing comparisons within the Asian American racial category (samples of approximately 400 adults each among major national origin groups), it will include cross-racial comparisons using the same instrument and mode of interview (approximately 400 adults each among whites, Latinos, and African Americans).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A growing number of studies focus on Asian Americans. However, existing surveys tend to be limited to a small number of national origin groups or to a relatively specific geographic area. More general studies such as the GSS and ANES do not have the requisite sample size or language support to accurately capture the experiences and attitudes of Asian Americans. The primary innovation of the 2016 National Asian American Survey is to replicate questions on important general surveys, specifically the GSS and the ANES, with a large sample of Asian Americans in a well-designed study. With this commitment to question replication, the 2016 National Asian American Survey will allow researchers, for the first time, to compare Asian Americans to the U.S. public on key social and political measures, and to make important comparisons within the racial group.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Asian Americans comprise the fastest growing racial group in the United States, and one characterized by considerable occupational, linguistic, and national origin diversity. The 2016 National Asian American Survey represents a unique source of survey data on this population. The survey is based on more than 4,000 telephone interviews of Asian American adults conducted between mid-November 2016 and mid-March 2017.  The survey included ten Asian national origin groups, including Chinese, Asian Indian, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Hmong, and Cambodian respondents.  White, Black and Hispanic respondents were also included in the study to facilitate cross-group comparisons. Interviews were offered in English and Spanish, as well as in a range of Asian languages. The survey questions focus on immigrant incorporation, attitudes on economic inequality and race-relations, and civic and political engagement.  One major contribution of the survey is the production of a dataset archived with the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR).  The dataset represents a public good accessible to scholars in social science disciplines, most notably in sociology and political science, as well for communication specialists and members of the broader public interested in the Asian American population.  A second major contribution is the inclusion of questions that overlap with questions in the 2016 General Social Survey and 2016 American National Election Study.  These surveys do not include a representative sample of Asian Americans. The Asian American samples are relatively small and interviewed in English-only.  With more than 40 percent of Chinese, Vietnamese, and Koreans in the U.S. reporting limited English proficiency, interviewing respondents in-language is essential to improving these groups? representation in surveys. The 2016 National Asian American Survey sample can now be compared to respondents who participated in the 2016 General Social Survey and 2016 American national Election Study on these overlapping questions.   Key findings from this research effort include  1)  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders were less likely than Whites or Blacks to be contacted by political parties  2) The most serious problems facing Asian Americans include the affordability of college, health care, and elder care  3) In terms of relations with other groups, Asian Americans are more likely to have contact with Whites than with Blacks or Latinos; there are some significant national origin differences among Asians on this group contact measure  4) The question of Asian American identity is contested; even though Indians and Pakistanis classify their own groups as Asian, in line with official U.S. racial classifications, other groups are significantly less likely to view them as Asian  5) Experiences with discrimination and micro-aggression vary significantly across groups  In terms of broader social impact, the results of the survey will advance society in terms of enhancing our understanding of intra- and inter-group relations, policy support, and civic and political participation in the United States.
