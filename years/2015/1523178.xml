<AbstractNarration>This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project is investigating the formation of brown carbon in the atmosphere. The identification of important photochemical sources of brown carbon are important because light-absorbing particles in the atmosphere (black and brown carbon) are the second largest anthropogenic driver of climate change, after CO2 emissions.  At least 20 diverse undergraduate students will participate in this research as part of this project, making it more likely that they will choose careers in science.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the research are: (1) to characterize aqueous-phase browning processes in droplets and in aerosol particles, with and without light and/or oxidants, (2) to measure the effect of dissolved SO2 on aldehyde partitioning and aerosol-phase products, (3) to determine the atmospheric significance of these reactions, and (4) to mentor and train a diverse cohort of undergraduate students, especially freshmen and sophomores, in atmospheric chemical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brown carbon formation will be quantified using cavity-attenuated phaseshift single-scattering albedo (CAPS-ssa) spectroscopy on evaporating droplets and aging aerosol particles with and without added aqueous-phase oxidants in a lab chamber, in rooftop photochemistry experiments, and at the CESAM cloud chamber at University of Paris East at Creteil.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Aldehydes are produced in the atmosphere through the oxidation of carbon-containing gases.  In this project, we tested the ability of common atmospheric aldehydes to form aerosol particles in the presence of sunlight and pollutants such as SO2 and amines.  We determined that two of the most common atmospheric aldehydes, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, can combine with glyoxal or methylglyoxal and amine species in clouds.  This forms positively-charged imidazole products that increase the amount of aerosol particles left over after clouds or fog evaporate ? a potential health hazard.  We estimated that formaldehyde may form up to 1 Tg of carbon / year of aerosol through this pathway, limited by the amounts of glyoxal and methylglyoxal present.  Overall, the formation of imidazoles may explain up to 7 Tg of secondary organic aerosol formation per year, or about 5% of the total estimated global formation.  Thus, aerosol pollution, which causes millions of deaths per year worldwide, could be decreased by limiting emissions of ammonia and amines.  Browning of aerosol particles, a major focus of this project, is a climate-relevant process because brown particles absorb incoming sunlight and therefore contribute to increasing temperatures.  Experiments funded by this project revealed that aerosol particles that contain ammonium salts (very common), methylammonium salts, or glycine (an amino acid, less common) rapidly turn brown when exposed to methylglyoxal gas, but without growing larger.  (The same thing happens if the methylglyoxal starts out in the aerosol particle and methylamine is in the gas phase.)  This browning happens at least 500 times faster in aerosol particles than in bulk liquid ?test tube? experiments.  Similarly, we discovered that aerosol particles that contain dissolved SO2 rapidly turn brown when exposed to glyoxal gas.  We believe this is the first time that SO2 has been implicated in the formation of brown carbon aerosol.  These same experiments also unexpectedly showed that brown carbon formation in evaporating cloud droplets is enhanced by sunlight.  While previous ?test tube? experiments showed that sunlight ?bleached? or destroyed brown carbon, our aerosol cloud chamber studies found the opposite to be true in many cases.  Apparently, sunlight can break apart light-absorbing molecules at aqueous aerosol surfaces, temporarily destroying them, but in evaporating droplets the broken pieces combine with nearby molecules to form larger molecules that absorb light even more strongly than before.  This effect was especially pronounced in aerosol particles exposed to both glyoxal and SO2.   Over the past four years, this project has allowed 19 University of San Diego undergraduates, 3 Harvey Mudd College undergraduates, one REU participant, one community college student, and 3 postdoctoral researchers to be mentored and trained in atmospheric chemistry research.  This diverse group of 27 included 16 females, 12 underrepresented minority researchers, and one military veteran.  To date, this group has 17 publication co-authorships and has made a total of 13 research presentations at national or regional conferences.  Seven undergraduate researchers participated in the international measurement campaigns at the CESAM cloud chamber at Universit? Paris Est Cr?teil.  In summary, results from this grant create a better understanding of brown aerosol formation by atmospheric aldehyde reactions, which can improve climate and air pollution models, and suggest that reductions in ammonia and amine emissions will provide both climate and human health benefits.
