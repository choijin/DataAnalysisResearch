<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project will examine the political and economic context that determines how, when, and where discussions related to hydraulic fracturing are produced.  Focusing specifically on North Dakota's Bakken Formation, the doctoral student will examine how everyday experiences of individuals who have resided in the region for at least five years influence the creation and understanding of written and spoken claims, arguments, and ideas.  The student also will measure the effect of these discourses on the decision making of planners, local officials, and business leaders in regards to hydrocarbon extraction and economic development.  The results of this project will contribute to theoretical discussions surrounding the production of scientific and lay knowledge and will provide new insights regarding the longer-term outcomes of boom and post-boom communities.  Project results will be shared with municipal, industry, and non-governmental groups in North Dakota, and an online undergraduate instructional module will be created to expose science, technology, engineering, and mathematics students to societal impacts of technology development.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daily experiences with resource extraction influence how residents think, talk, and write about resources, but little is known about how knowledge of hydraulic fracturing is generated in areas undergoing "boom" conditions.  During the conduct of this project, the doctoral student will use content analysis of oil and gas coverage in North Dakota newspapers as well as GIS visualization techniques to measure variation in land use and policy preferences among community leaders.  Qualitative interviews will be conducted to gauge the opinions of longer-term residents regarding hydrocarbon-related development.  Results from this project will contribute to theoretical and empirical literatures dealing with geographies of energy (particularly geographies of fossil fuel production), the formation of ideas and arguments in zones of extraction, and the social and cultural dimensions of hydraulic fracturing.  Furthermore, this project will generate empirical data about activities and attitudes in the Bakken shale region, which has received scant attention in the social science literature compared to shale plays in Texas and Appalachia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Thomas Loder (co-PI, under the supervision of PI Christian Brannstrom) has completed research for his dissertation "Environmental Attitudes and Policy Formulation Associated with Rapid Energy-Related Development" supported by the NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant. During his funding period, Loder spent 12 months conducting field research in North Dakota. Loder was interested in understanding how various stakeholders in North Dakota understood the environmental, economic and social changes that were taking place in the state as a result of increased use of hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production. He  focused on the differences between how fracking was discussed by policy makers and by ordinary, long-term North Dakota residents.  Loder sought to contribute to existing bodies of scholarship examining citizen attitudes towards hydraulic fracturing, how hydraulic fracturing has been discussed in print media, and the social impacts for small towns undergoing rapid energy booms. These objectives were accomplished through interviews and focus groups with a range of individuals including politicians, oil and gas business people, Native American tribespeople and local non-industry-affiliated residents. Topics addressed included individuals? knowledge of oil and gas drilling, opinions on oil and gas media coverage and personal interactions with the oil and gas industry. Additionally, Loder analyzed editorials on oil and gas policy published in North Dakota newspapers in order to gauge how oil and gas was discussed in popular media.  One key finding from this research was that policy makers and those directly connected with the oil and gas industry largely viewed oil and gas expansion through an economic lens.  Non-industry individuals were more concerned with the long-term environmental and social impacts caused by rapid expansion of drilling and the related population and employment changes related to this expansion.  In addition to contributions to academic bodies of knowledge, Loder has conducted outreach activities aimed at sharing research results with the public in order to foster better understanding of the effects of oil and gas expansion in North Dakota. Loder participated in two educational conferences in North Dakota where he shared results with groups as varied as oil and gas executives, educators, and environmental activists. He has also served as a guest lecturer in two courses at Texas A&amp;M University, where he spoke to students about the social and environmental changes caused by oil and gas expansion.  Loder?s research in North Dakota formed the basis of his dissertation. Completed in August 2018, this dissertation contributes to human geography through its examination of the linked environmental and social transformations inherent in rapid energy expansion.
