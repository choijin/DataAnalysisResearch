<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Philip Engel is "Degenerations of Algebraic Surfaces, Integral-Affine Geometry, and Mirror Symmetry." The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Joseph Harris.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The PI was funded by the NSF in the form of an MSPRF grant, award DMS-1502585, throughout his postdoctoral studies at Harvard University. This support led to the writing and publishing of five research works. In addition, the PI spoke to wider audiences on aspects of the completed research, for instance presenting to undergraduate math clubs and presenting to postdoctoral scholars across the sciences. The PI lectured on tilings at the PROMYS program, a summer program at BU for mathematically gifted high school students. He also organized interdisciplinary seminars at Harvard that sought to unify areas of math that rarely overlap.  One research area developed by the PI during the tenure of the grant was the study of tilings of surfaces. For instance, a geodesic dome is a tiling of the sphere by triangles. Tilings have been appreciated for their aesthetic beauty for centuries, and there is deep mathematics underlying them.  One theorem about tilings proven by the PI is of interest outside of math, for instance to chemists. It gives a formula for the number of geodesic domes with n triangles. This the the same as the number of buckyballs with n carbon atoms---these are spherical carbon molecules where every carbon atom is bonded to three others, and the carbon atoms form rings of length five or six. The formula says that the number of ways is, up to mutliplying by a specific constant, the sum of the ninth powers of the numbers dividing n.  Such simple and aesthetically pleasing formulas can be understood by mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike, and stimulate interest in STEM fields. They also have led to possible collaboration between computational chemists and mathematicians.          Last Modified: 12/17/2019       Submitted by: Philip Engel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
