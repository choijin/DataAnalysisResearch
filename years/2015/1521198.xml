<AbstractNarration>1521198&lt;br/&gt;Guldberg, Robert E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award supports a three day Regenerative Medicine Workshop at Hilton Head.  It brings together national and international regenerative medicine experts from a variety of engineering and scientific disciplines in a small conference setting to effectively convey knowledge, stimulate new ideas critical to advancing the development of regenerative medicine applications and therapies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the workshop is to share new research in the developing field of regenerative medicine that will accelerate science and engineering discoveries applicable to the field of biomedicine and promote research collaborations.  The topics will include stem cell biology and regeneration, immunological responses to engineered cellular systems, applications and advances in wound healing, regeneration of cardiovascular tissues, regenerative medicine and the pediatric population, bone regeneration to combat osteoarthritis, and bio-inspired materials and their clinical applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 19th Annual Regenerative Medicine Workshop at Hilton Head was held on May 13-16, 2015 at the Harbour Town Inn and Conference Center in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. The Hilton Head Workshop is an annual three and a half-day workshop series that has been organized and led by regenerative medicine leaders from Georgia TechÆs Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience since 1997. The goal of the workshop is to share new research discoveries with the regenerative medicine community, to continue to build a regenerative medicine community and foster research collaborations, and to promote academic-industry partnerships specific to the development of new biomedical technologies. The number of workshop attendees is intentionally kept small to facilitate interaction with attendance typically around 160 participants.  Registered workshop participants for this yearÆs workshop totaled 167 comprised of academic professionals (46%), pre-doctoral and postdoctoral trainees (38%), and industry representatives (16%). Additionally, twelve international registrants participated in the workshop.  It should be noted that the percentage of trainees attending the 2015 workshop compared to the 2014 workshop increased from 29% to 38%.  This yearÆs conference theme was "Discovery, Technologies and Translation" and focused on the translation of research into innovative bioengineering technologies.  The conference organizing partners were the Georgia Tech-Emory Regenerative Engineering and Medicine Center, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Pittsburgh/McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine.   The workshop format was a single plenary session that promotes interaction among a diverse body of participants.  Session topics included: immunoengineering; biomaterials for orthopedic applications; biomimetic materials; synthetic biomaterials; stem cell morphogens; and controlling stem cell fate.  There were a total of 50 lectures, 69 posters, and a panel discussion focused on precision regenerative medicine.  The program keynote lecturers included: Farshid Guilak, Duke University School of Medicine; Darrell Irvine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Kevin Healy, UC Berkeley; Joel Collier, University of Chicago; Laura Niklason, Yale University; and Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic, Columbia University.  Pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees had the opportunity to participate in podium talks, poster sessions, and the highly popular "rapid-fire" talks that allow for a brief five-minute presentation followed by facilitated discussion. In addition, trainees had the opportunity to connect with national and international regenerative medicine leaders throughout the workshop, and a special trainee networking session was held to connect graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.
