<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides support to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research at HBCUs. The project at Delaware State University seeks to "change the equation for science and mathematics" by focusing on introductory mathematics and science courses and the critical transition from the freshman to the sophomore year. The project focuses particularly on the College Algebra course, a preparation course for Calculus, since currently 89% of first time, first year students at Delaware State University place into a no-credit, developmental mathematics course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities that are part of this project are:  a virtual summer bridge program focusing on mathematics for all incoming freshmen declaring a STEM major; study hall for all freshmen STEM majors; and research opportunities for freshmen and sophomore STEM majors.  The activities are built on pilot results from previous projects and on intervention models shown to be effective at Delaware State University. The project will be guided by an on-going evaluation and external and internal steering committees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Virtual Summer Bridge  We implemented a virtual summer bridge program for STEM freshmen that included an on-line, for-credit mathematics course.  In year 1 we ran the virtual bridge program for 46 incoming STEM freshmen who took an on-line mathematics class, either College Algebra or Intro to Algebra.  In year 1 the virtual bridge program culminated with an on-campus training camp in which STEM students arrived on campus two days earlier than other freshmen. The students had a math review the first day and then took the final exam for their on-line math course and attended some workshops on college skills  (time management, note-taking, reading textbooks, using Excel for calculations and to make graphs and to use Powerpoint to make posters and presentations). In both years, similar to the pilot program during our HBCU-UP grant, students were placed in Introduction to Algebra if their placement test results, high school transcripts and math SAT scores indicate a particular weakness in mathematics, otherwise they took College Algebra.              In year 1, 15 students were placed in the on-line Intro to Algebra class and 12 out of 15 passed the course for a passing rate of 80%. For College Algebra, 21 students took the on-line summer course and all but two of them passed it for a passing rate of 90%.              In year 2, with carryover funds, we offered the on-line mathematics courses to 40 incoming  STEM freshmen, but were unable to provide online tutoring/mentoring support or offer the residential training camp at the end of the summer.  Instead, the students participated in the regular "Freshman Welcome Days" run by the Office of Admissions, and a block of time was set aside for the students to take the common final exam in person.  As in years past, all of the students placed into Introduction to Algebra by the Accuplacer test, but a total of 11 students were advanced into the on-line College Algebra course based on their score on the quantitative section of the SAT and success in high school mathematics course.  For the students in College Algebra, 7 out of 11 students passed the course for a passing rate of 64%. A total of 29 students took the on-line Introduction to Algebra course, and of these 16 received a passing grade and 13 did not successfully complete enough of the course material to pass, resulting in an overall passing rate of 55%.        The disappointing results from the no-cost extension year when we were not able to offer the additional supports to students show how crucial they are for student success in the summer on-line mathematics classes.  With the supports in place, passing rates were 80-90% over four years (3 years funded by our last HBCU-UP grant and one year by the Changing the Equation project). In contrast, without those supports, the passing rates were much lower (64% and 55%).  Undergraduate Research Program              Building on the success of the research component within our previous HBCU-UP grant, the Science and Mathematics Initiative for Learning Enrichment (SMILE) Project (HRD0928404), we continued to support undergraduate students in conducting cutting-edge and impactful research under the guidance of DSU faculty mentors, preferably those of junior status, for an extended period of time (beyond just a single summer).  However, in contrast to the program administered under SMILE, we supported two undergraduate students in each of the funded projects, instead of just one.  The change was designed to formally introduce a peer-mentoring component into the program, which is has been shown throughout literature to be one of the most effective high-impact practices in research education. In this new arrangement, one of the students (preferably of Junior/Senior classification with some research experience under their belts) was to be tasked with helping in mentoring of the other student (preferably of Freshman/Sophomore classification with little to no research experience). Students started in the fall semester of 2015 and worked through the summer of 2016. The research program was for the most part a success. Only one pair of students had a personal conflict and had to be separated into different labs. The other 4 pairs of students were very positive about the experience, and the faculty felt that the pair of students were more productive and learned more than students on their own in a lab.
