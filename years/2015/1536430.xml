<AbstractNarration>The first systematic worldwide campaign against vaccine-preventable diseases was the Expanded Program on Immunization (or EPI), started in 1974 by the WHO. In 2000, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) was launched specifically to extend the EPI program to the poorest countries in the world. Despite these efforts infectious diseases remain a grave, global concern and millions of children in low and middle income countries around the world remain at risk for diseases preventable via immunization. While a paucity of resources in poorer countries certainly contributes to vaccine-preventable deaths, many of the problems can be attributed to waste and inefficiencies associated with how the WHO-EPI vaccine distribution chains are designed and operated.  The basic structure of the distribution network and its operation in virtually every country is identical and almost no thought has been given to fundamentally redesigning the distribution networks along the lines of other modern supply chain networks. This award supports fundamental research to address this critical issue by building and optimizing detailed mathematical models of the WHO-EPI vaccine distribution network. The proposed research will benefit society by providing alternatives that could fundamentally transform the way life-saving vaccines are distributed and administered around the world.  It has the potential to improve the efficacy of vaccine distribution networks and enable millions of additional vaccinations annually around the world, resulting in reduced public health costs and saved lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A typical EPI network is designed as a four- (or occasionally, three- or five-) level hierarchical structure with strictly arborescent flows emanating from a single source node.  The network is supplemented by flows from a subset of nodes in the network, to represent ad hoc outreach sessions to remote locations.  This research will develop mathematical programming models to (1) permit any type of flow (rather than just strictly arborescent flows), while also being able to incorporate any domain-specific constraints on flow, (2) consider vaccine flows in the context of supply chain cold storage and transportation resources, (3) allow for country-specific operating policies to be adopted into the design, and (4) account for outreach activities that supplement static immunization facilities. The proposed network and integer programming models will capture the unique objectives, tradeoffs and constraints inherent in vaccine administration. The models are not simply an application of existing theory, but rather, novel extensions of the general supply chain network design literature to the unique domain of vaccine distribution networks.</AbstractNarration>

These programs have resulted in countless lives being saved over the years, but despite their success, there are still millions of children in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) who are not covered by routine vaccines and remain at risk.  Although vaccines can now be obtained at relatively low cost, operating the distribution chain for shipping, storing and delivering vaccines in a cost-efficient fashion while ensuring that they are reliably available to end-users remains a major challenge, especially in light of the fact that we have to deal with a ?cold? chain where vaccines must always be in temperature-controlled environment. Moreover, many LMICs are also often strapped for resources (monetary and technical) and operate with less than perfect infrastructure.  In this research project, we address (1) the design and (2) the operation of the distribution chain for WHO-EPI vaccines in low and middle-income countries with the goal of making them more efficient.  With respect to the first issue of design, we hypothesize that the current, strictly hierarchical structure of the distribution system is much too rigid and that there is no reason why the structure should be identical in all countries, regardless of their geographic and demographic characteristics. In our work we developed a general mathematical model (specifically, a mixed integer programming model) to arrive at a design that would be optimal for the specific characteristics of a country.  The model becomes intractable as its size increases to represent an entire country and we therefore develop two novel algorithmic approaches to solve the model heuristically.  We also test the model using data derived in part from four different countries in sub-Saharan Africa and show that the resulting distribution network from our model is different from the ones that currently exist.  With respect to the operation of the distribution chain, we start by developing alternative vaccine ordering polices that use inner-pack quantities as opposed to vials (as is done currently) and lean related concepts to improve vaccine inventory management.  We then focus on studying and modeling ?outreach? operations: these are activities that are supplementary to fixed clinics, where teams of clinicians conduct mobile clinics in remote locations where there are no fixed healthcare facilities. Outreach is common in most LMICs and constitute an important component of vaccine delivery.  However, there are no standardized models for outreach and each country does this on an ad hoc basis.

Our models also consider uncertainty, and provide insight into the type of demographic characteristics where it is more important to obtaining accurate information and reduce uncertainty; specifically, we show that it is much more important to do so in smaller, more densely populated areas than in larger, sparsely populated regions.  Funding for this project supported one doctoral student for the majority of his dissertation work and also partially supported two other doctoral students (one of whom was female) who did the preliminary work for the project in their final year before graduation.
