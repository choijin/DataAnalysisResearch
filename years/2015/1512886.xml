<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program supports Professor Jon Camden at the University of Tennessee Knoxville to develop surface nonlinear spectroscopy as a analytical method for probing the two-photon properties of molecules, surface adsorbate structure, and ultrasensitive detection.  A method for measuring absolute SEHRS enhancement factors is presented and subsequently utilized to elucidate the respective roles of chemical and electromagnetic enhancements in SEHRS. The wavelength dependent nature of the molecule-plasmon coupling and of resonance enhanced hyper-Raman will provide information on the complex interplay of molecular excited states important in two-photon processes. Detailed comparisons between experiment and theory are pursued, which will benchmark new electronic structure methods for the calculation of nonlinear molecular properties. The studies will demonstrate SEHRS to be a powerful, routinely applicable, and ultrasensitive analytical tool.  Further, this work will provide the basis for future studies of surface-enhanced nonlinear spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the scientific objectives of this proposal, the PI seeks to increase the number of high-school students pursuing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) majors in college. The PI will collaborate to provide curricular enrichment to local public high-schools through the creation of ASPIRE teams (Aspiring Scientists Participating in Research and Education).  ASPIRE teams will deliver hands-on laboratory experiments to local high school classrooms once a month during the regular school year, for a total of six activities. The activities are aligned to meet the requirements of Tennessee State curriculum and introduce students to the properties of nanoscale materials. Regular assessments are used to refine the activities and gauge their impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has been responsible for the first observation of hyper-Raman scattering from single molecules, which was featured in C&amp;E News, the first observation of the second-hyper-Raman (2HR) effect; the extension of SEHRS to the short-wave infrared; the elucidation of two-photon molecular properties via SEHRS;and multiple sensing studies.  The PI?s contributions to the analytical applications of SEHRS was recognized by an invited review for Annual Reviews of Analytical Chemistry, which will be forthcoming in 2017.  This work has resulted in &gt;20 invited, contributed oral presentations by the PI, and supported students.  Current NSF funding has fully or partially supported two high school students, one high school teacher, &gt;10 undergraduate students, five graduate students, and one postdoctoral fellow.  Two graduate students won poster prizes for NSF supported work at National Meetings (ACS and Pacifichem). Three of the graduate students received their Ph.D. during this period, and the postdoctoral fellow (underrepresented minority) was placed into a tenure-track position.  Undergraduates co-authored three peer-reviewed publications.  Extensive collaborations were formed both nationally and internationally, which resulted in multiple joint publications: Lasse Jensen(Pennsylvania State University), David Jenkins and Michael Best (University of Tennessee), and Zachary Schultz (UND).  A new collaboration with Duncan Graham (University of Strathcylde) was recently formed via an International Supplement, which focuses on extending SEHRS to extreme-red wavelength tags and imaging.  PI Camden hosted two NSF REU students and an RET visiting professor (Prof Getahun Merga, Andrews University).  A comprehensive set of enrichment activities focused on optics and nanoparticles was created for delivery in Knox County Schools (Knoxville, TN), and Ms. Debbie Sayers, the collaborating high school teacher, completed a research experience in the PI?s lab as outlined in previously proposed work.
