<AbstractNarration>This award will provide travel support for ten students to attend the 14th annual International Ionospheric Effects Symposium (IES2015) will be held May 12-14, 2015, in Alexandria, Virginia. The meeting will bring together a broad spectrum of scientists, engineers, and program managers to review impacts of ionospheric phenomena and space weather events. &lt;br/&gt; This year the National RF Ionospheric Interactions (RFII) Workshop will be combined with the IES2015. The focus of the RFII workshop is the interaction of high-power RF waves from ground-based transmitters with the ionospheric plasma and resultant phenomena such as the generation of ELF waves, ionospheric irregularities, and induced optical emissions. There is a community of researchers dedicated to understanding these effects and an annual meeting provides a forum for communicating their results.</AbstractNarration>
