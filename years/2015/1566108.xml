<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A of the Chemistry Division, Professor Edwin Sibert is extending current theoretical models of stretching and bending vibrations of molecules.  In general, the frequencies of vibrations provide insights into the arrangements of the atoms that make up a molecule.  The model being developed by Sibert allows experimentalists to gain additional information so that they can use the frequencies of the vibrations observed in the laboratory to obtain an atomistic picture that includes the molecule's local structure and environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High resolution infrared spectra of the CH and OH stretch regions are complex; there are many spectral features, and no simple theory enables one to extract insights from the relative positions and intensities of these features.  The aim of this project is to provide experimentalists the theoretical tools required for extracting structural and environmental information from high resolution spectra.   Designing drugs and predicting outcomes of combustion reactions depend on chemists' ability to determine the relative stabilities of various chemical species and understand how environment affects those stabilities.  The broader impact of this project includes generating open source computer software to enable scientists to measure and understand these stabilities as well as to provide a training ground for students in this research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The theoretical research carried out in this NSF funded project was directed towards collaborating with experimentalists to enhance dramatically the information content of the OH, NH and CH stretching region of the infrared spectrum.  By shining laser light on gas phase molecules in just the right experimental setting, one can measure the precise frequencies of the light that is absorbed by the molecule.   When these frequencies are within certain ranges, then this light is known to lead to excitation of the vibrations of O-H, N-H or C-H bonds.  Our research combined quantum mechanical solutions of both the electrons and the nuclei in an effective way that showed that the precise values of this absorbed light can be used to lean about the local environment of these bonds.  For example, when there are multiple low energy structures of a molecule that are possible, our work has shown which structures the molecule prefers based on the frequencies of light that are absorbed. This work required making a series of approximations and then rigorously testing these approximations by comparing our results directly to experimental findings.  The systems that were studied span from small hydrocarbon radicals to large molecules complexed with water that feature multiple hydrogen bonding sites. This research will provide researchers additional molecular structure information for a wide range of biological and chemical processes.  Finally, this project has provided sound training in fundamental research of both the undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project.
