<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Drs. Edwin Lewis from Mississippi State University and Herman Sintim from the University of Maryland to develop new chemical probes for the study of G-quadruplex biology in complex biological environments.  G-quadruplexes, uniquely folded non-helical structures formed by short guanine rich sequences in DNA or RNA, have been implicated in the regulation of a number of important life processes, from gene expression and mRNA splicing, to chromosome maintenance, cell proliferation, and viral life cycles.  The development of chemical probes having very high affinity for G-quadruplex DNA over double stranded helical DNA, and having the ability to select for specific G-quadruplex folding topologies represents a new direction in biochemistry and molecular biology.  The design of the new chemical probes, their synthesis and the biophysical characterization of the probe/G-quadruplex complexes in vitro and in vivo will provide opportunities for graduate students and advanced undergraduates to acquire a diverse set of specialized skills in new compound synthesis and in the use of spectroscopic, microcalorimetric, NMR, mass spectrometry, and molecular biology methods.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to address the central issue in the in vivo study of G-quadruplex biology; the lack of selective probes that can discriminate between: a) abundant duplex nucleic acids and much less abundant G-quadruplexes; b) DNA G-quadruplexes and RNA G-quadruplexes; c) and among several G-quadruplex topologies or conformers.  In addition to these unresolved selectivity issues, most G-quadruplex ligands that have been developed to date have only moderate binding affinities with only a handful of G-quadruplex ligands exhibiting nanomolar Kd values.  The principal investigators, recently made a surprising discovery that diminazene (DMZ), a drug that is used in veterinary medicine and believed to act via binding to the minor groove of AT-rich duplexes with a Kd of about 1 micromolar, binds to selected G-quadruplexes with Kds of about 1 nanomolar - the strongest affinity reported so far for a G-quadruplex chemical probe.  Based on this discovery, this project will undertake the development of new G-quadruplex chemical probes based on the DMZ scaffold.  Various biophysical tools will be employed to study the selectivity of the new chemical probes for different G-quadruplex topologies (e.g. parallel vs. antiparallel, and small loop vs. large loop G-quadruplexes) and types (DNA vs. RNA). The interactions of nucleic acid binding proteins with various probe-stabilized G-quadruplex structures will also be investigated in this project.  Information developed in this study is expected to provide tools to study the role of G-quadruplex nucleic acid structures in a number of cellular processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In contrast to the normal and well known double helix structure formed by two complimentary DNA strands, a G-quadruplex is a structure formed by a single DNA strand which is rich in the base guanine folding back on itself.  A diagram showing a typical G-quadruplex fold in the context of a double helical DNA structure is shown in Figure 1.  Current thinking is that G-quadruplex structural motifs and other novel folded structures formed by guanine-tract DNA and RNA sequences may be important in regulating gene expression and that the common occurrence of G-quadruplex forming sequences in the promoter regions of numerous oncogenes (cancer causing genes) may represent a novel target for anti-cancer drugs.  Perhaps even more importantly, small molecules (or drugs) with a high affinity for binding (or sticking) to G-quadruplex DNA (or RNA) structures will provide a real opportunity to probe the structure and biological functions of G-quadruplexes in cells. G-quadruplex selective probes with the ability to recognize G-quadruplex structural features such as loop sequence and flexibility, and groove width in cooperation with the core, represent future opportunities for medicinal chemists and chemical biologists. Our hypothesis is that new high affinity G-quadruplex ligands, particularly ligands with the ability to recognize different G-quadruplex folding topologies, are needed to develop a better understanding of the biological functions of G-quadruplex DNA. The major goal of this project was to develop and characterize designer G-quadruplex probes that would be able to discriminate between duplex and G-quadruplex DNA, that will exhibit selectivity for specific G-quadruplex topologies (e.g. parallel vs. antiparallel), and that will also discriminate between DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes.    To address this goal we tried three different approaches.  First, we chose berenil (or DMZ) as a scaffold on which to develop new G-quadruplex topology-selective ligands.  We had previously shown that DMZ had one of the highest affinities for G-quadruplex DNA of any small molecule.  A logical way to develop DMZ-inspired ligands was to make analogs of DMZ and test them for binding to duplex versus quadruplex DNA structural motifs.  Computational studies were used to guide the search for higher affinity DMZ analogs.  Secondly, we explored the interactions of several racemic and enantiomerically pure ruthenium polypyridyl complexes (RPCs) with G-quadruplex DNA.  Again, one complex, a di-ruthenium RPC, [(phen)2-Ru-tatpp-Ru-(phen)2], was found to exhibit high affinity for a parallel G-quadruplex and in preliminary experiments seemed to exhibit a preferential binding of the &Lambda;&Lambda; isomer over the &Delta;&Lambda; and &Delta;&Delta; isomers. This di-ruthenium compound was also found to bind to specific model G-quadruplex constructs with higher affinity than to B-DNA.  The ruthenium polypyridyl complexes appear to represent an alternative avenue for the development of new G-quadruplex ligands with the ability to recognize specific G-quadruplex structures, e.g. loop structure and/or folding topology.  Lastly, in our expanded search for G-quadruplex recognition ligands, we began to investigate the binding of metallated porphyrins to G-quadruplex DNA.  In these ligands, it appears that the specific metal ion may have an influence on the affinity and structural selectivity of the ligands for G-quadruplex DNA. Metals under investigation have included most of the first row transition metals and copper seems to be most effective in increasing the affinity of the porphyrin ligand for G-quadruplex DNA motifs.  While the search for G-quadruplex selective ligands goes on, the hypothesis of the project and the major goals remain worth pursuing.  G-quadruplex selective ligands will be important to future investigations of the interactions of both DNA and RNA with G-quadruplex binding proteins that regulate gene expression.  Additionally, these and similar compounds may prove to be fundamental to the development of new anti-cancer therapies based on the specific downregulation of G-quadruplex promoted gene expression.
