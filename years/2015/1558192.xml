<AbstractNarration>Award:  0956010&lt;br/&gt;PI: Mark Parsons&lt;br/&gt;Project Title: &lt;br/&gt;Community-based Data Interoperability (INTEROP)International Network of Arctic Knowledge (INAK)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapid Arctic change has critical implications for global climate, biodiversity, geopolitics, international transportation, and local society. To understand and respond to this change and its implications, it is necessary to understand the Arctic as a system. The International Polar Year (IPY) was a huge international effort to improve our interdisciplinary understanding of the Arctic and Polar Regions, how they are changing, and their impact on the Earth system and human society. IPY produced a large, diverse array of data that increases the challenge of interdisciplinary data discovery and use. The data is enriched, but the challenge is increased, by the explicit inclusion of social science research and local and traditional knowledge of the Arctic. Yet, IPY and the rapid change in the Arctic have generated considerable international resolve and formal collaboration that can be harnessed to improve the semantic understanding and interoperability of Arctic data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSIDC, working with domain and community-building experts at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and elsewhere, use the opportunity of IPY and the developing Polar Information Commons to improve the knowledge and interoperability of sea ice and related Arctic data through the extension and enhancement of an international data management network. Through focused workshops and broad community interaction, a formal, sea-ice ontology, and an expansive interdisciplinary knowledge framework for the Arctic are developed. Proven and maturing semantic web methodologies and ontology creation tools, including visual tools like concept maps, are used to develop the underlying infrastructure. The support and ongoing evolution of this infrastructure relies on the engagement of the people and communities who use, enhance, and maintain that infrastructure?the INAK. The need for interdisciplinary understanding of the Arctic system (driven by the profound changes in the Arctic) motivates the network, and the occasion of the IPY provides a unique opportunity and mechanism to develop the network, but ultimately, the network is sustained when members see how their network activities benefit their immediate scientific and practical science needs. The project engages the diverse Arctic community, including Arctic residents and indigenous people, to contribute to and use the INAK. Ultimately, the ontologies go beyond direct data user needs and grow the INAK and Arctic semantic insights into the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes of the Semantic Sea Ice Interoperability Experiment (SSIII) occurred along two broad fronts.  The first of these was in assessing and ultimately demonstrating the utility of semantic technologies for easily integrating disparate data types of importance to the sea ice and oceanographic research communities. The second to assessing the utility of semantic technologies when collaborating with Indigenous knowledge holders.   Along the first front, the base level output products are the set of sea ice ontologies developed using the WMO Sea Ice Nomenclature along with the ontology based on the "egg code" used by ice services around the world to encode the physical characteristics of sea ice within polygons on an ice chart.  These used in conjunction with an ontology that turns SIGRID 3 formatted ice chart data into Open Linked Data, allowed development of the IceUI demonstration interface (see Figure 1) which integrates sea ice chart time series data with the locations of a research vessel during a particular cruise with both displayed on a map of Arctic regions. This demo  integrates data from 3 different repositories into a single user interface where a user can answer questions like "What was the sea ice like around my ship on Dec. 5th last year when the data from my instrument looked so strange?" or "Remind me how the sea ice around my research vessel changed over the course of the cruise" Sea ice data, stored as Linked Open Data from the Tetherless World Constellation at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was combined with research vessel information from the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) located at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, along with maps of the Arctic from the National Snow and Ice Data Center?s (NSIDC?s) web map service. The IceUI also demonstrated of the ability to visually display and play back time series of Geographic Information System (GIS) data, since the sea ice data consists of a series of EsRI shapefiles along with information about the sea ice characteristics within each polygon within the files. Moreover, since each polygon is associated with information about the age, thickness, concentration, and other characteristics of the ice within the polygon, users familiar with the geoSPARQL query language can ask questions like "Show me where in the Arctic the sea ice was thicker than 3 m on such-and-such a date" or "Show me when the sea ice concentration dropped below 15% at such-and-such a location." All of the ontologies and open-linked data products described above are available on github.   In support of the second front, a knowledge model based on Lewis Brower?s knowledge as someone with decades of experience living and working on the on ice, including acting as a guide for scientists using the services of what was then the Barrow Arctic Science Consortium, has been developed.  This model includes different facets including the representation of the overall knowledge construction and decision making process (specific to Brower), understandings of different aspects of the environment (sea ice, winds, currents, clouds etc.), decisions trees involved in engaging in activity on sea ice such as decisions to use the ice or not, how to monitor conditions and decide when to change plans or return to shore, and decisions in involved in taking evasive action in the case of emergency.  A draft primary product desired by the community is a poster summarizing the various elements documented in the knowledge model.  This poster is not intended to replace knowledge or experience but to raise awareness and help people to understand the need for adequate guidance and caution.  The knowledge model is in digital form and a formal ontology will be developed as part of follow on activities.  Although the current model could be readily representing using formal methods (e.g. RDF/OWL), this step has not been taken based on methodological and ethical considerations.
