<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for a substantial number of students and young postdoctoral scientists to attend the 38th International Conference in High Energy Physics in Chicago, Illinois, August 3-8, 2016. This conference is held bi-annually and is the largest of this kind for the particle physics community, with an expected attendance of at least 1,000 persons.  Topics covered will be wide, including intensity, high energy and cosmic frontiers.  Attendance by graduate students to participate, either as members of the audience or as speakers, is the particular role for NSF funds.  Priority for this support will be given to students from under privileged communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[1. Accomplishments Major goals   The 38th International Conference on High Energy Physics (ICHEP) held in Chicago from August 3 to 10, 2016 was for physicists from around the world to gather to share the latest advancements in particle physics and accelerator science and to discuss plans for major future facilities.  This NSF project provided partial support for 61 scientists (young scientists and women and underrepresented minorities) who were accepted to give presentations but could not afford full travel expenses. Accomplished under these goals Major Activities:  ICHEP 2016 brought more than 1400 scientists, students, educators and members of industry. Fifty-one countries from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America were represented, which is the largest such conference ever held. This unexpectedly large interest caused some re-thinking of the conference agenda to include as many talks and posters as possible. A record 1600 abstracts were submitted, of which 600 were selected for parallel presentations and 500 for posters. During three days of plenary sessions, 36 speakers (13 female and 23 male) from around the world overviewed results presented at the parallel and poster sessions.  All of 61 scientists who were supported by this project gave presentations and actively engaged in all of the ICHEP programs. Specific Objectives: One of the most popular parallel-session themes concerned enabling technologies, totaling around 400 abstract submissions, and rich collaborative opportunities were discussed in the new "technology applications and industrial opportunities" track. Another innovation at ICHEP 2016 concerned diversity and inclusion, which appeared as a separate parallel track. A number of new initiatives in communication, education and outreach were also piloted. These included lunchtime sessions aimed at increasing ICHEP participants? skills in outreach and communication through news and social media, "art interventions" and a physics slam, where five scientists competed to earn audience applause through presentations of their research. The outreach program was complemented by events at 30 public libraries in Chicago and a public lecture about gravitational waves. Opportunities for training and professional development   A large fraction of scientists supported by this project were young scientists (students and postdocs). All gave oral or poster presentations. There was a network session between young scientists and industry participants, providing career opportunities beyond the academia. In addition, various training sessions were organized:  How to give 1? elevator speeches on their research How to get involved in outreach programs How to make a great physics new story  How to make science fun and exciting through social media  Disseminating to communities of interest?  Public lecture Physics Slam Outreach programs at 30 public libraries in Chicago by 60 young scientists  2.

Impacts  impact on the development of the principal discipline(s) of the project   Particle and accelerator physicists from around the world gathered to share the latest advancements in particle physics, accelerator science, and accelerator / detector / computing technologies and to discuss plans for major future facilities. This helps developing research programs with data (being taken) and developing future tools and technologies.  Impact on other disciplines   The drive to understand the world around us is a basic part of our humanity. Particle physics research provides the ideas and discoveries that form the long-term foundation for science and technology as a whole, which in turn drive the global economy and our very way of life. The short-term impact to other sciences and the society is the application of computing and data handling, detector technologies, and accelerator technologies developed by the particle and accelerator physics community.  Impact on the development of human resources   Postdocs and students trained by particle physics see at first hand how experiment and theory work together to produce a coherent understanding of phenomena at the most fundamental scale. Their experience in the design and construction of state-of-the-art electronics, simulation of the detector and data, and data analysis techniques gives them the ability to work in many areas of science and technology.  Impact on technology transfer   24 companies co-sponsored ICHEP 2016, a strong indication for potential technology transfer to industry. ICHEP 2016 organized a session that brought together industry and the particle and accelerator physics community providing industry an opportunity to seek collaborative agreement with physicists, and physicists to explore licensing or commercializing developments that have originated from the scientific community.  Impact on society beyond science and technology  Science and technology change how we live and what we believe. Particle detectors and particle accelerators have been core components of technological innovation and economic competitiveness. Each generation of detectors and accelerators builds on the previous one, pushing the level of technology ever higher. Technologies developed for particle physics have transformational applications for many areas of benefit to the nation?s well-being including medical isotope production, cancer treatments, biomedicine and drug development, national security, food sterilization, power transmission, and nuclear waste transmutation.
