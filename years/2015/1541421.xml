<AbstractNarration>The project develops and hosts hands-on advanced technology workshops for campus network engineering staff in the US.  Each CC-OIN workshop is being hosted in partnership with regional networks and tailored to their region's needs.  Participants gain the practical understanding they need to support data-intensive science projects on their campuses, and learn how to improve science performance using state-of-the-art network technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CC-OIN builds on past work with similar workshops and is open to participants around the country and abroad. Over the previous three years, collaborators have shared detailed technical content on the Science DMZ paradigm, the perfSONAR network performance measurement system, and the use of open Software Defined Networking (SDN) technologies.  The project also broadens and updates content related to emerging areas of need for supporting science on campuses. New topics include advanced cybersecurity, new SDN methods, orchestration of networks with scientific cloud applications, and an SDN-based Science DMZ for increased performance and security.  Finally, the project explores ways to broaden the reach of the workshops through alternative delivery methods like videos and cloud-based, hands-on exercises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CC-OIN project advances the expertise large and small campuses in every region of the country needs, supports technical staff to become regional resources supporting science, and brings each region's community together to collaborate on improving network capabilities for better science outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cyberinfrastructure that supports scientific innovation remains critical at our nation?s universities and national laboratories.  Most, if not all, of these needs involve a well provisioned and supported network infrastructure that is capable of addressing data movement needs between instrumentation, processing, and storage.  Given the rapid pace of development, education on the best common practices and identification needs remains a critical component for a large population of users and support staff.   CC*OIN set out to bridge two critical gaps: a lack of educational and professional development opportunities in cutting edge research support technologies and strategies, and the affordability and availability of training events near the population of users that could benefit the most.  Over the course of the 10 events between 2016 and 2017 the audience of over 700 people from more than 350 institutions spread across approximately 40 states and countries was exposed to specialized training not offered by any other entity, commercial or non-commercial.  These events were offered at no cost to participants and designed to be as close to a large population of potential attendees as possible.  The results of attendee surveys show that not only was the material relevant, but that it spurred investment and advancement beyond the initial expectations of those involved.
