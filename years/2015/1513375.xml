<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The Denmark Strait overflow is an important contributor to the deep limb of the global Meridional Overturning Circulation. However, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the source(s) of the overflow water, and the causes of its transport and temperature/salinity variability. A better description of the dense water pathways leading to Denmark Strait through the Iceland Sea is needed to understand, and ultimately predict, changes in the overflow entering the North Atlantic Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent studies have proposed that there are two pathways for dense water to enter the Denmark Strait: one from the Greenland Sea via the East Greenland Current, and another from the interior Iceland Sea via the North Icelandic Jet. A recent modeling study suggests that these pathways may alternate with changing wind conditions, in particular the wind stress curl in the region around Iceland. During years with high (low) wind stress curl, the East Greenland Current (North Icelandic Jet) is thought to be the dominant pathway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subsurface Lagrangian observations, which directly measure fluid parcel pathways, are not presently available in the Iceland Sea. This project will deploy acoustically tracked floats set at a depth of 500 m, just above the sill depth of Denmark Strait, to directly observe dense water pathways in the Iceland Sea over a two-year period. A total of 35 float trajectories, tracked with an array of six sound sources, will be combined with atmospheric, hydrographic and altimetry data to define the relationship between the observed pathways and the forcing conditions during the experiment. An ocean general circulation model simulation of particle trajectories in the Iceland Sea, forced with the conditions observed during the experiment, will be compared with the float trajectories. The field work is heavily leveraged, with the Institute for Marine Research in Bergen, Norway providing the sound source array, the ship time for sound source and float deployment and about 40% of the floats. Overall, this study will help to better understand the Denmark Strait overflow and its variability as well as shed light on the general subsurface circulation of the Iceland Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project has bearing on the variability of the lower limb of the Meridional Overturning Circulation, and thus is relevant to the broader topic of the ocean?s role in global climate change. The research is highly collaborative with several international partners, including the Institute of Marine Research in Bergen, Norway, the Marine Research Institute in Reykjavik, Iceland and the Institute of Oceanography in Hamburg, Germany. This experiment will also provide an opportunity for an early career scientist to lead her first field project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Cold, dense waters from the Nordic Seas spill over the shallow sills of the Greenland-Scotland Ridge into the North Atlantic Ocean (Figure 1). There they cascade down along the continental shelfs and contribute to the deep southward flowing limb of the ocean?s overturning circulation. There is an ongoing discussion in the field whether the dense waters cascading over the sill of Denmark Strait, between Greenland and Iceland, are mainly drawn from the East Greenland Current in the north (Figure 2) or whether there is a contribution from the Iceland Sea, in the east, through a small current called the North Icelandic Jet. This project investigated these different possible pathways of dense water using acoustically tracked subsurface floats, instruments that drift with the water at depth, and by tracking virtual particles in model simulations of the Iceland Sea.</p> <p>The observational study, for which subsurface floats were released in the Iceland Sea in the summers of 2013 and 2014 (Figure 3), showed that waters on the Icelandic shelf (considered to have an eastern source before) were in fact originally coming from the north but separated from the Greenland shelf and crossed over the narrow channel upstream of the sill (Figure 4). Floats deployed in the Iceland Sea, to the east, did not go towards the sill but circulated in the Iceland Sea gyre and eventually continued further east towards the Norwegian Sea. These were joined by other floats originally released in the East Greenland Current. At the Icelandic shelfbreak near the Kolbeinsey ridge several floats were moved up the shelf and a rim of cold water was recorded by the float?s temperature sensors. This upward motion has not been seen in previous observations here and may help explain the origin of the North Iceland Jet.</p> <p>Two model studies compared pathways of virtual particles tracked in the model?s velocity field to the tracks of the floats released in the field. Both models, a one-year very high resolution model and a 10-year high resolution model, showed particles tracks very similar to the floats. These virtual pathways were further used to study the contributions from the various sources may vary in time. The very high resolution model, which was run and investigated at Johns Hopkins University in the group of Tom Haine, showed that most (more than 80% on average) of the dense water over the sill does indeed come from the East Greenland Current, but that there is a very high very variability in time. A new contribution, from the North Atlantic Ocean south of Iceland, was also found to contribute up to 35% in the winter of the one model year. This may have been due because the chosen model year, 2008, was an especially cold winter.</p> <p>The longer model run also showed strong changes in pathways over time (Figure 5). While particles track backwards in time indeed mainly come from the East Greenland Current, their pathway to the sill can vary strongly from month to month. The example in Figure 5 shows a case where the particles either stay west of the Kolbeinsey Ridge and close to Greenland and a case where particles first make a small excursion into the Iceland Sea before coming back to the west. The study found that this type of pathways variability mostly depended on the presence of meso-scale eddies (vortices) that divert the currents in one direction or another.</p> <p>The observational and model studies show that the circulation upstream of Denmark Strait depends highly on small ocean features that are typically not captured by measurements at fixed locations (shipboard and mooring) and that pipeline diagrams of ocean currents do not capture time variability.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/31/2019<br>      Modified by: Marieke Femke&nbsp;De Jong</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513375/1513375_10269855_1567241653554_floattracks--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513375/1513375_10269855_1567241653554_floattracks--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4.
