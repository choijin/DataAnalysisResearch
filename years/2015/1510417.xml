<AbstractNarration>The field of homotopy theory is the study of mathematical invariants that are insensitive to deformations.  It is applicable whenever one is interested in studying qualitative aspects of a system, or whenever there might be imprecision in the specification of the state of a system.  In recent years the methods of homotopy theory have found use in fields as diverse as condensed matter physics and the foundations of mathematics.  This project aims to bolster these relationships with new tools from algebraic topology, and to apply them to other areas of mathematics and science.  There are applications of this work to condensed matter physics, classical algebraic geometry, and, in the long term, to education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of this project involves several interrelated areas of study.  One of these, on algebraic vector bundles, depicts a new interface between complex analysis and algebraic topology, and is intended to get at the obstruction to topological vector bundles having algebraic structures.  Another organizes tools developed for the study of differential manifolds into higher categories, in service of providing a general topological expression for the evaluation of "Gaussian integrals" in topological quantum field theories.  The two principal investigators will work jointly on a project designed to establish a striking, conjectured, structural result for "groups of units" occurring in algebraic topology.  This result has implications for the construction of topological quantum field theories and offers a potentially new approach to understanding the "homotopy groups of spheres." Three further projects involve new generalizations of ideas in homotopy theory, in the contexts of algebraic K-theory, "transchromatic homotopy theory" and in a relationship between Goodwillie calculus and the construction of "smash" products in the stabilizatons of infinity categories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Homotopy theory is a branch of geometry devoted to measurements which are insensitive to small deformations in the object under investigation.  It is used in pure and applied mathematics whenever one is interested in describing the possible states of phenomena that cannot be specified to infinite precision.  It has applications to many fields of mathematics, and to the applications of mathematics to the physical sciences.  Part of the work supported by this grant was devoted to classification of topological phases of matter in in condensed matter physics.  This resulted in a classification scheme that was confirmative (of some existing classification results in the physics literature), corrective, and predictive.  In another direction the work of this proposal led to new advances in the field of algebraic geometry, showing that many geometric constructions can be described by polynomial equations.  These equations are extremely elaborate and not currently understood in an explicit form.  Lurie continued developing his deeply influential ideas ``derived algebraic geometry'' which one can think of as studying the rich residual structure present when one encounters complex systems of equations that have not been specified to infinite precision.  In recent years Lurie's point if view has been widely adopted and lead to remarkable innovations.    With the support of this funding, Hopkins and Lurie supervised 22 PhD theses, 12 undergraduate theses, and several undergraduate summer research projects.  The outcomes of Hopkins and Lurie's research was disseminated in published form, and in lecture form both at venues for general mathematical audiences and at venues for the general public.
