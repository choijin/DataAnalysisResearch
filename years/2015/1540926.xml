<AbstractNarration>Proposal: 1402610&lt;br/&gt;PI: Willets, Katherine&lt;br/&gt;Title: Probing the location, number, and function of surface-bound antibodies on plasmonic nanoparticle biosensors using super-resolution fluorescence imaging&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanobiosensors have the potential to revolutionize both in vitro and in vivo diagnostics because they allow for targeting and signaling of biomarkers of disease in a single, nanoscale platform.  Typically, nanobiosensors are based on a nanoparticle core, such as a 20- 50 nm gold nanoparticle, which is then functionalized with molecules, such as antibodies, that capture and report the presence of specific biomarkers.  In the ideal case, the bound antibodies should cover the entire surface of each nanoparticle core while retaining their function, in order to maximize the chance of capturing and reporting on biomarkers of interest. A great deal of effort has gone into developing new synthetic strategies for preparing antibody-functionalized metal nanoparticles. However, the small size of both the antibodies and the nanoparticle core makes it incredibly difficult to measure where individual antibodies are bound on the nanoparticle surface and whether each retains its ability to capture its target.  The proposed work will use super-resolution single molecule fluorescence imaging to measure the location, number, and function of antibodies bound to metal nanoparticles, in order to determine how different preparation strategies impact the particle-to-particle heterogeneity and function of this important class of nanobiosensors. Successful completion of this project will result in development of better, more sensitive and specific nanobiosensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: &lt;br/&gt;In super-resolution single molecule fluorescence imaging, fluorescent molecules are toggled between an emissive and non-emissive state via careful control of their chemical environment and the intensity of the excitation laser.  By allowing only a single molecule to be emissive at a time, its diffraction-limited emission can be fit to a model function, such as a 2-dimensional Gaussian, to locate the position of the emitter with resolution better than 10 nm.  In the proposed experiments, antibodies bound to the surface of metal nanoparticles will be labeled with fluorescent molecules, and the position of each fluorescent emitter (and thus each antibody) will be determined using the super-resolution approach described above.  Target antigens will also be labeled with a different fluorescent dye.  If surface-bound antibodies retain their ability to capture their target antigen, co-localization between the positions of the different fluorescent tags will be observed, signaling retention of function.  By working at the single molecule level, individual antibodies bound to single nanoparticles will be probed one at a time, allowing a complete mapping of the function retention and heterogeneity across the nanobiosensor population.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied nanobiosensors comprised of target-sensing ligands attached to the surface of noble metal nanoparticles, focusing on where the ligands attached to the surface of the nanoparticle and the extent of binding heterogeneity across different nanoparticles within the same sample.  This is an important problem when using nanoparticles as platforms for biosensors, because the reproducibility and reliability of the sensor response depends strongly on the ability to make homogeneous samples.  To study these systems, ligands were labeled with fluorescent molecules to report the location of each ligand.  Super-resolution imaging was used to locate each fluorescently-tagged ligand bound to the nanoparticle surface with &lt;20 nm spatial resolution.  By locating individual ligands bound to the nanoparticle surface, it is possible to determine whether binding occurs uniformly or at preferential sites on the nanoparticle surface, as well as observe whether the number of bound ligands is uniform between different nanoparticles within the sample.     The results of this project were twofold.  First, significant heterogeneity was observed in the binding of ligands to noble metal surfaces, indicating that the sensing capability of the nanobiosensors varies widely from particle-to-particle.  The intellectual merit of this result is that there is not only a need to optimize ligand binding strategies to achieve improved reproducibility for sensing applications, but there is also a demand for single particle-sensitive techniques such as super-resolution imaging to reveal heterogeneity that may be masked in traditional ensemble measurements.  The results also showed that in solutions with mixtures of ligands with fixed ratios (e.g. a 1:1 ratio of ligand A to ligand B), the solution-phase ratio was not necessarily preserved on the nanoparticle surface, indicating preferential or cooperative binding.  This has important implications for samples in which mixtures of both targeting and therapeutic ligands are introduced to provide quantitative dosing.  The second major result was the observation that the fluorescence from the labels showed strong coupling to the metal nanoparticle as revealed by a shift between the true and the apparent position of the fluorescent label; the intellectual merit of this result is the demonstration of a new pathway for studying and manipulating energy transfer between nanoparticles and small molecules.  The broader impact of this work is both the realization that sensor performance is highly variable when studied at the single particle level, underscoring the need to optimize synthetic strategies for sensor preparation before commercialization, as well as the potential for using hybrid nanoparticle-molecular systems for energy harvesting applications.  In addition, multiple outreach programs were established under this award, including hands-on STEM activities with GirlStart in Austin, TX (5-7th grade) and at Freire Charter School in Philadelphia, PA (9th grade).  The award also resulted in the training of one graduate student, one postdoc, and one undergraduate student, with two coming from under-represented groups in the sciences.
