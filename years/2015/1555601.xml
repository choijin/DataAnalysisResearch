<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the potential to change the way gold mining is carried out by improving the process economics and reducing the environmental impact of mining operations. Current gold isolation methods involve the consumption of vast quantities of sodium cyanide, where cyanide is contained in large tailing dams, posing an environmental threat as exemplified by documented breaches. In the United States there are gold deposits which have not been exploited because of technology limitations and environmental concerns. The technology being developed in this project will improve the profitability of existing mines, as it can be employed with only minor changes in plant design. It will also  but will also lead to new jobs. Another opportunity is to extract gold from copper tailings dams. The proposed technology will potentially make cleanup of these sites profitable and can be applied worldwide. In the longer term, the process could be adopted in third world countries which still rely on mercury which pollutes, not only the environment, but also the food chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this Phase II research project are to (i) scale up the extraction of gold using both the heap and vat leach processes, (ii) optimize the crystallization of Au(III) in the presence of the natural product รก-cyclodextrin, and (iii) isolate the gold. For heap leaching, it is proposed to operate at the 400-MT level, concentrate the gold salt and crystallize the gold-cyclodextrin complex. Scale-up will require designing the process to utilize existing equipment (built originally for the sodium cyanide process) and introducing new chemicals. For vat leaching, a small pilot system will be built to accept crushed ore as the feed, and the resulting gold-containing extract will be taken through the crystallization process. Optimization of the leaching agent, mass transfer, kinetics and materials consumption will be ongoing.  Regulatory approval for vat leaching, once secured, can be applied on-site globally to demonstrate the environmental and economic benefits of the process. This technology has the potential to significantly make existing and new mining operations more environmentally sustainable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to develop a new process for the isolation of gold and silver from gold mines using environmentally friendly reagents in a cost-effective manner to replace the existing process which uses sodium cyanide. The challenge is then to convince gold mining companies to use the new process and replace sodium cyanide, a practice which has been used since Victorian times.  The initial research involved isolating gold from ore samples collected from eighteen mines worldwide and sudying the reactions and optimizing the conditions. The key to the process was to use hydrogen peroxide together with a salt and some acid and the finding confirmed our initial proposal that the process gave better yields and was cheaper than using sodium cyanide. It was important to make sure any waste streams were completely environmentally safe and, together with a detailed recycle process, we were able to show that not only that the waste streams were safe but the spent ore was also environmentally clean.  The process was scaled up at the Comstock Gold Mine where we are based and worked as well at scale as it did in the laboratory and we are now moving  towards commercialization. The first scale-up will be in Central America and it will help to solve another environmental issue which is the use of mercury in gold isolation. The plan is to set up a plant and to process ore produced by artisinal miners (small, indigenous, independent miners)  in a central facility. This will not only reduce the use of mercury but the clean spent ore will be coupled to a mobile brick making machine to provide bricks for infrastructure in the local community.  The long term target is to license the technology to gold and silver mining companies worldwide to improve economics, provide jobs yet reduce the environmental impact of gold and silver mining.
