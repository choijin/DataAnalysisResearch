<AbstractNarration>SUSY 2015 (The 23rd International Conference on Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions) is the primary yearly conference for the presentation of ideas regarding new physics beyond the Standard Model (not just supersymmetry) and experimental results relevant thereto. It covers not only high energy physics but also related areas of cosmology and the early universe. It attracts 300-400 top researchers (both theorists and experimentalists, students through senior faculty) in all new physics areas. The conference lasts for 6 days and includes both plenary talks (about 25 thirty-minute talks) and seven daily parallel sessions (in combination containing of order 150 talks, each being of order fifteen minutes). The conference is essential for all researchers in the various fields to remain fully up-to-date with respect to the progress made by and ideas being developed by other researchers in the many sub-fields of relevance. It is the critical venue for dissemination of recent and planned research.  This symposium will take place for five days during the week prior to SUSY 2015.   It is a series of pedagogical talks by prominent physicists working in areas covered by the SUSY 2015 Conference.  It is designed to prepare advanced graduate students and junior postdocs in the subject areas that will be covered by the conference.  Pre-SUSY symposia have been an important and much needed component in the preparation of these young physicists for a productive research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Society benefits in many direct and indirect ways from support of theoretical and experimental physics in the areas on which the SUSY 2015 conference focuses. The conference re-inforces and motivates the newest generations of physicists pursuing research careers in this and related very highly sophisticated fields. It is focused on ideas that potentially explain the most elementary particles and most basic forces of nature. Such understanding has often yielded substantial benefits to society. The developments in experimental techniques, detectors and accelerators necessary for probing the particles and forces, have frequently led to very substantial spinoffs. Many medical advances have resulted from the very sophisticated detector and accelerator developments needed for the field to progress.  This pre-conference symposium will help educate graduate students and postdocs in the areas covered by the conference, allowing them to fully participate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Award Number:1524244  Project Title:"Pre-conference symposium for the 23rd International Conference on Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions " in Tahoe City, California, August 23-29, 2015.  Report Type: Project Outcomes     The pre-conference symposium comprised a series of lectures designed to bring students up to the "state-of-art" in the theory and phenomenology of Supersymmetry (SUSY) and related topics.  The lecturers and their lecture topics are listed below.     Lecturers  Introduction to Supersymmetry: Yael Shadmi (3 lectures) Higgs Physics--Standard Model and Supersymmetric Extensions: Marcela Carena (2 lectures) Higgs Physics--Composite Higgs Models and Strong Electroweak Symmetry Breaking: Tony Gherghetta (2 lectures) Collider Physics in the LHC Era and Beyond: Tao Han (2 lectures) BSM Physics in the LHC Era: Michael Dine (2 lectures) Flavor Physics BSM: Yuval Grossman (2 lectures) Neutrino Physics BSM: Ann Nelson (2 lectures) Particle Dark Matter: Tim Tait (2 lectures) Astrophysical Dark Matter: Tracy Slatyer (2 lectures) Introduction to Inflation: Dan Green (2 lectures) Scattering Amplitudes: Henriette Elvang (3 lectures)         All of these lecturers are among the best in the field. The students (and some postdocs and faculty who wanted to attend) found the lectures to be of great value and repeatedly stated that the lectures really helped them to prepare for the subsequent SUSY conference.  Some 83 students attended and about a dozen postdocs and faculty level researchers also came to some or all of the lectures. The NSF funds received in support of the pre-conference were entirely used to help support the local costs and travel costs of the students.  These funds were vital to ensure that all the students who wanted to attend could attend.  Many of the students said they could not have come without support.  Overall, the success of and attendance at the pre-SUSY symposium ensures that the field of Supersymmetry will remain robust and can respond to "signals" related to SUSY in the data from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) as it comes available during 2016.
