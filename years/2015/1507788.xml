<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to experimentally study the interactions between electrons in two coupled two-dimensional (2D) sheets.  When the 2D layers are sufficiently close, interlayer Coulomb interactions result in momentum transfer so that electrons moving in one layer cause those in the second sheet to move in response, a phenomenon known as Coulomb drag. This work will study layered heterostructures of atomically thin materials -- including graphene and insulating boron nitride --to achieve atomic control over the spacing between the conducting layers.  This will allow the exploration of Coulomb drag in the strong-coupling limit, and in high-mobility devices where electrical transport is ballistic.  These structures are made possible by techniques developed by the Principle Investigators to fabricate ultraclean multi-layered heterostructures by mechanical layering of 2D materials.  The primary effort will be a systematic characterization of the drag response in monolayer graphene versus temperature, density, layer separation, and magnetic field. Drag resistance together with inter-layer tunneling will additionally be used to pursue signatures of a theoretically-predicted exciton condensate phase in which spatially indirect excitons consisting of paired electrons and holes confined to separate layers condensed into a superfluid ground state. Careful studies of the Coulomb drag response provides a unique tool in which to study electron-electron interactions in mesoscopic systems, which is expected to have significant impact beyond the study of 2D systems, since electron-electron interactions underlie the rich and complex physics of correlated materials.  If successful, this research could also enable revolutionary new low power electronic devices.  The collaborative interdisciplinary work will provide training to a postdoctoral researcher as well as providing research experience to high school and junior level undergraduate students.  Outreach efforts will focus on expanding long-term relationships with teachers at two affiliated public schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to experimentally study Coulomb drag in high mobility double layer quantum wells fabricated from 2D materials, such as graphene and related van der Waals materials, in the strongly interacting limit of small interlayer separation.  The primary goal will be a systematic characterization of the drag response in monolayer graphene heterostructures versus temperature, density and interlayer separation, under both zero and finite magnetic field, through transport measurements. Several outstanding questions will be addressed such as the anomalous density and temperature dependences reported previously, origin of the anomalous drag response at the double neutrality point, and the nature of the Hall response in the finite magnetic field regime.  Drag resistance together with inter-layer tunneling will additionally be used to pursue signatures of the exciton condensate phase in two regimes (i) electron-hole graphene layers at zero magnetic field, and (ii) electron-electron graphene layers at half filled Landau levels in the quantum Hall regime. The experimental effort will include studies of heterostructures fabricated from bilayer graphene, and mono and few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides  where the effect of a bandgap on the exciton binding has so far received no experimental attention. The Coulomb drag response in graphene is not well understood at the most basic level. Theoretical efforts to model this system have yielded conflicting results, none of which well match the few experimental studies that have been reported so far. In this regard the systematic study proposed here promises to lay important groundwork for future understanding of this system, and more generally to provide quantitative boundaries on key physical parameters necessary to accurately model electron transport in graphene such as the strength of electron screening versus density and the specific role of the dielectric environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this project was to experimentally study Coulomb drag in high mobility double layer quantum wells fabricated from graphene. Primary research goals included (i) a systematic characterization  of the coulomb drag response versus density, temperature and magnetic field, in the limit of strong interlayer interactions and (ii) realization and study of a superfluid condensate of interlayer excitons within this phase space.  Significant accomplishments under this award in the area of coulomb drag and exciton condensation include the following:  Advanced our basic understanding of the mechanism of Coulomb drag in graphene double layers, including the first identification of a non-local contribution to the anomalous drag response  Achieved better understanding of the experimental methods required for Coulomb drag measurements and observation of EC phases First drag measurements in double BLG Demonstration of EC formation in double layer graphene at total integer filling fraction in the quantum Hall regime First ever evidence of EC at fractional total filling (this potentially exotic state has been theoretically anticipated but never observed in any prior system) First ever evidence of a cross-over from a strong coupling (BEC-like) to weak coupling (BCS-like) condensate phase of interlayer excitons.   Our efforts additionally resulted in significantly advancing the fabrication techniques of graphene devices more generally,  yielding improved control over the device mobilities, electrical contact and achievable architectures (such as the corbino geometry).  This lead to unexpected opportunities to study correlated phenomenon in the quantum hall regime using graphene as an improved platform over conventional materials.  Two specific achievements include the following:  (i) Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall effect: We demonstrated the first observation of an even denominator fractional quantum Hall state in BLG, occurring at order magnitude higher temperature than any previous system. Particularly unique to the bilayer graphene platform is the ability to tune the ground state at half filling with electric field, at fixed density and magnetic field.  Thought to be a non-abelian anyon with majorana-like excitations, the discovery of this state in graphene is anticipated to motivate new research directions in the general study of parafermions.  (ii) New pairing states of composite fermions in double layer systems:  We demonstrated the emergence of new interlayer fractional quantum Hall effect states emerging in strongly interacting double layer graphene.  Our observations include two features: First we observe a sequence of states that represent a natural extension of the composite-fermion theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect, but for double layer systems.  Second we observe new states that fall outside of this sequence, which we conjecture result from a new kind of pairing of composite-fermion particles resulting from the strong interlayer interactions.  In addition to identifying potential new types of quasi-particle states, driven by interactions, our results more broadly establish the double layer system as a unique platform to study correlated states where the interaction strength can be tuned with a degree of precision not easily accessible in more conventional structures.     Six published manuscripts have resulted from this work including one appearing in Science, one in Nature Physics, three in Physical Review Letters and one in Nature Communications.  One additional manuscript is currently in press at Nature Physics, and two additional manuscripts are currently in preparation. Training was provided to one post-doc. Research opportunities were provided to one undergraduate student in each summer of the program.          Last Modified: 05/22/2019       Submitted by: Cory Dean]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
