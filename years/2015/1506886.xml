<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports computational and theoretical research and education aimed at understanding cooperative mechanisms by which magnetic materials self-assemble from nanoscale colloidal components with multiple complex interactions and in the presence of magnetic, electric, and optical fields. Concise characterization and description of conditions underlying the stabilization of a rich spectrum of self-assembled materials will provide information necessary for their reproducible preparation. Dramatic progress in the area of materials formed by self-assembled nanoscale components can proceed only through a solid understanding of all underlying principles and microscopic phenomena. The research involves developing and applying computational tools for modeling of self-assembled materials, which will be shared with the broader computational materials science community. &lt;br/&gt;Activities associated with this research will provide rich educational experiences for graduate and undergraduate students in advanced materials theory and modeling techniques. Through collaboration with experimentalists, this research will iteratively proceed towards a deep understanding of materials properties. In this integrated experimental and computational approach, the students will gain the necessary skills to design materials and technologies aiming at development of novel devices based on these materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports computational and theoretical research and education of magnetic materials formed by self-assembled superparamagnetic nanoparticles. The research necessitates development of multiscale modeling tools in the PI's group, in particular, efficient Monte Carlo codes able to describe large scale systems of interacting nanoparticles, where cooperative forces acting between the constituents will be parametrized by analytical calculations using known laws, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, and estimates of coupling strengths present in the studied systems under dynamical conditions formed during the self-assembly. These studies will focus on clarifying the roles played during the self-assembly by forces acting between the nanoparticles at different length scales, the effects of choosing different materials, sizes and shapes of the nanoparticles, their ligands and solvents, overall charging, and external magnetic, electric, and optical fields. This modeling approach should reveal the spatial and magnetic structures of nanoparticle chains, ribbons, stripes, clusters, and helices, and the origins of their arrangements observed in experiments.&lt;br/&gt;Through development of novel modeling methods, the project will advance the knowledge of experimentally prepared materials based on self-assembled nanoscale components with complex interactions leading to numerous possible final structures tunable by external fields. These materials will form a rich platform for future generations of devices with numerous applications. Activities associated with this research will provide rich educational experiences for graduate and undergraduate students in advanced materials theory and modeling techniques. Through collaboration with experimentalists, this research will iteratively proceed towards a deep understanding of materials properties.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The provided NSF-DMR funding has dramatically influenced the research done in the PI&rsquo;s group and largely affected the research done by our collaborators. With this support, we have initiated and continued collaborations with more than a dozen of experimental groups around the world in the areas of materials self-assembled from nanoscale components and nanoparticles coupling to biological complexes. Using this funding, we have published 20-30 papers in many journals, including Science, Nature Materials, Nature Chemistry, Nature Communications, Advanced materials, ACS Nano, Nano Letters, JACS, and others. The research results were also presented at numerous conferences and National Meetings, including Gordon Research Conferences, MRS and ACS Meetings, and others. The scientific results were presented at cover pages of journals and highlighted in media.</p> <p>Over the time, this funding has provided support to 5-6 graduate students, who participated at various stages of their PhD studies on the research projects. Some of these students graduated and left for postdoctoral positions or will do so in the near future. Several undergraduate students have also contributed to the solution of the research projects. Underrepresented students and students with disabilities have significantly contributed to these studies.</p> <p>The research projects also necessitated a moderate upgrading of the research infrastructure, currently formed by a fleet of ~25 workstations (nodes) running simulations on ~40 graphical processing units. We have progressed on the management of large data related to our simulations, which are currently held on a 50Tb storage capacity hard drives, which are periodically back upped. &nbsp;This computational infrastructure has served as a model unit for the establishment of similar formations by new PIs.</p> <p>We can highlight some main results obtained through the provided funding (see associated figures):</p> <p>1) We have collaborated with Prof. Rafal Klajn (WIS, Israel) by modeling the magnetic properties of self-assembled superparamagnetic nanoparticles. For this purpose, we have accelerated and modified our Monte Carlo codes to describe the magnetization curves of different nanoparticle superstructures (see Fig.1) and found a number of intriguing phenomena, which were matching the experiments performed by Prof. Vicki Colvin (Brown). With Rafal and Vicki, we have in the pipeline several publications devoted to these studies, which were delayed due to complex and intriguing behavior of the magnetization in differently assembled nanoparticles (see Fig.2). Besides magnetic studies, we have also collaborated with the Klajn group on the solvation and self-assembly of other types of nanoparticles.</p> <p>2) We have also modelled with Prof. Utkur Mirsaidov (NUS, Singapore) various nanoparticle self-assemblies observed in their in-situ experiments. For example, we have described the self-assembly of hydrophobic nanoparticles of different shapes in water, where hydrophobic and van der Waals forces are competing during the self-assembly (see Fig.3). We have also studied the self-assembly of nanoparticles at liquid surfaces, where ligand-ligand van der Waals forces in air dominate during the assembly processes, or clarified nanostructure etching processes.</p> <p>3) With Prof. Rafal Klajn, we have extended the self-assembly of nanoparticles at liquid surfaces to many different lattice types (see Fig.4). Using precise molecular dynamics simulations, we have shown that the energy of nanoparticles-liquid coupling forms an important (40%) part of the whole lattice energy. Therefore, the solvent coupling determines the lattice type formed. By our simulations, we have explained many details of the experimentally observed self-assembly processes, for example, why the nanoparticle self-assembly proceeds differently on very similar DEG and EG solvents, why the first monolayer of self-assembled nanoparticles has a very similar AB&shy;4 stoichiometry in most observed lattices, or how exotic AB11 lattices can form. These studies were published in Science.</p> <p>4) We have also studied coupling of biological molecules to nanoparticles, such as in the study of enzymatic activities of nanoparticles with Dr. Igor Medintz (NAVY), shown in Fig.5. In a similar way, we have studied a multivalent specific coupling of B12 clusters with saccharide-based ligands to protein receptors (Fig.6). Related studies were also performed in collaboration with Prof. Ehud Gazit (Tel-Aviv University), where crystallization of metabolites, their activity, and inhibition was studies in several collaborative papers.</p> <p>5) Other minor studies of molecular self-assembly, nanomedicines, and nanofluidics were also performed with the provided support.</p> <p>We believe that the above list clearly illustrates the importance of these studies, which we plan to further expand in the near future to provide computational support to many domestic and international experimentalists. This research is of fundamental importance in the development of new materials, technologies, and nanoscale material-related bio-medical approaches.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/06/2018<br>      Modified by: Petr&nbsp;Kral</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1506886/1506886_10392959_1538714243063_magnetic1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1506886/1506886_10392959_1538714243063_magnetic1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Magnetization of nanocubes"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1506886/1506886_10392959_1538714243063_magnetic1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Magnetization of nanocubes"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Magnetization studies in monolayers (150 × 15 NPs) of SPMFe3O4 NCs (a = 13 nm, d = 3 nm).
