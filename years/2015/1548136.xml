<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a set of software tools that can demonstrate the feasibility of a patent-pending technology for dramatically boosting the performance of a wide range of software systems, on very large and complex commercial-scale database management systems (DBMS). The accelerating growth in data-driven approaches to business decision-making, together with the rapidly growing volume of data being used, makes the speed of data processing an important consideration in today's business world; interviews with industry CIOs indicate that DBMS performance is a significant pain point for businesses.  The commercialization of the technology developed in this project will greatly improve data processing capacity and thereby permit faster and better business decision-making.  Given the central role played by DBMSs in enterprise IT systems, this can be expected to have a significant positive impact on businesses large and small. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of applying field specialization technology to large commercial database management systems (DBMSs), with the objective of significantly improving the performance of these systems, by developing a highly precise and scalable software analysis tool to identify field specialization opportunities in commercial DBMS software. The primary challenges to be addressed are those of scale and complexity (commercial code bases run to many tens of millions of lines of source code in size, and contain significant amounts of legacy code as well as more complex data structures and source language constructs).  The project will address these challenges by developing an automated software tool that is both (a) highly precise in its analysis of DBMS software properties, and (b) highly scalable in its ability to process large software systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In prior NSF-supported research, we have demonstrated that field specialization, a novel and promising approach to DBMS performance improvement that is orthogonal to current approaches to performance improvement, can yield dramatic speedups on realistic database queries on a widely-used open-source DBMS, by employing specialized runtime code. In order to successfully transition this approach to commercial use, it is important to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas on code bases of the size and complexity of commercial-scale DBMSs. The primary challenges that have to be addressed are those of scale and complexity (commercial code bases run to many tens of millions of lines of source code in size, and contain significant amounts of legacy code as well as more complex data structures and source language constructs). In other words, to demonstrate feasibility on commercial-scale DBMSs it will be necessary to perform sufficiently precise program analysis and optimization on significantly larger and more complex code bases with minimal developer intervention. The project aims to address these challenges by developing a suite of software tools that is both (a) highly precise in its analysis of DBMS software properties, and (b) highly scalable in its ability to process large software systems. In addition to the analysis capability, it is equally vital that our product--a runtime environment that facilitates the generation and execution of the specialized code--can be seamlessly incorporated into our customers? code base. This SBIR Phase I and IB funds helped us achieve the above objectives by accelerating our research of the software-analysis technology and the development of the tools and the runtime environment. In addition, the funding enabled us to engage in technical trials with multiple DBMS vendors. In particular, we were able to enhance our tools in terms of generality, functionality, and scalability, to the extent that they successfully supported the trials. In addition, in working closely with our customers, we have learned their concerns in incorporating our technology into their products in the future. Such concerns included debug support and the complexity of maintenance. We have addressed such concerns by developing many more features in the runtime environment with the Phase IB funding. Hence, the overall Phase I grant and the development it enabled was critical to those trials, and thus to the further customer traction that we have recently achieved. We are now working with a major DBMS vendor under a contract to incorporate the field specialization technology into their product. Thus, this Phase I grant, and in particular the customer traction that has resulted from that, has also directly enabled us to move concretely to initial revenue and to the promise of sustainable operation in the near future.
