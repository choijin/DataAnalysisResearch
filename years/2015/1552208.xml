<AbstractNarration>Title: Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop at SPLASH 2015 (PLMW@SPLASH)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) at SPLASH will take place on October 27 2015, as part of the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications (SPLASH), held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. This grant will support approximately 15 students to attend the PLMW event plus the SPLASH conference. While there is other funding available (through ACM SIGPLAN PAC) for students who are presenting papers at SPLASH, this proposal is intended specifically to target undergraduate and Masters students, with a view to increasing the numbers of such students in programming languages research. The selection process further ensures a diverse pool of applicants, paying attention to underrepresented groups, and prioritizing US citizens and permanent residents. The broader significance and importance of the grant relate to the need to broaden participation, provide opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading members of the programming languages community, and build the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this important research arena.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Major goals of the project  Attending top conferences is critical to the development of up-and-coming researchers in computer science. However, historically, the participation of undergraduates in conferences such as SPLASH/OOPSLA is minor.The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) seeks to change that statistic by encouraging undergraduates(juniors and seniors) to join the software engineering and programming language research community.  Accomplishments  We organized three workshops at SPLASH/OOPSLA 2015, 2016, and 2017. In total, we funded 34 students to attend the conference,  24 of which were undergraduate students at the time.   Opportunities for training and professional development   This was entirely a training grant. The students were exposed to top-notch research and researchers, and were introduced to the workings of research communities.  Co-organizers  Darya Kurilova, CMU Ulrik Schultz, Denmark  Co-sponsor  ACM  Impact  This workshop exposed undergraduates and early graduate students to experiences in research commmunity and networking. The field benefits from having young people involved. At this stage of their education, this exposure can have a significant impact on their decision to pursue / continue graduate studies. Although we do not have a formal mechanism to track whether the students decided to apply for graduate school, we have some anedoctal evidence that at least some of them did.
