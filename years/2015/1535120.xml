<AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will analyze the shaping of emerging sociotechnical smart energy systems, and it will explore the potential for social science engagements with alternative forms of imagination and design. The PI and his team will collaboratively engage with a distributed network of technical experts constructing smart energy systems in Phoenix, AZ and Portland, OR. The project will comparatively investigate how smart energy systems are being developed and deployed in urban centers, how they are being imagined to meet and create desirable forms of social and technological order, and to what extent engagements with diverse technical experts across these systems foster reflexive learning and deliberation over broader emerging alternative forms of social and technological order. The study has the potential to influence socially responsive expert practices and technological design choices; it will assess the effectiveness of the design and deployment of smart grid technologies in terms of whether they are currently advancing the social and public goals that have been invoked to justify them in both national and urban contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will explore the relationship between collectively imagined forms of social life including understandings of what is socially good or desirable, technological system design including its situated performance, and intervention-oriented socio-technical integration research (STIR). It combines theoretical work on sociotechnical imaginaries with empirical work on social science engagements by investigating the active performance of sociotechnical imaginaries in everyday technical expertise and the results of social science engagement therewith. The project will also provide theoretical insights into how local situations can generate distinct sociotechnical imaginaries and how they articulate with national discourses. Additionally, the project adapts a demonstrably effective form of collaborative social science engagement with the laboratory to a broad diversity of actor sites (laboratories, utilities, regulators, industry associations, civil society, etc.), and monitors the effects of this collaborative engagement on expert decisions and technological system design over significantly longer periods of time.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The STIR Cities project provides qualitative evidence that collaborations between innovators and social scientists can produce scholarly as well as practical insights in laboratories and across a variety of organizations engaged in "smart" technology development in two very different urban settings. Specifically, we find that socio-technical collaborations can build the capacities of actors in the urban innovation systems of Phoenix, Arizona and Portland, Oregon to strengthen connections between technical decisions and the broader public value contexts in which they operate. We combined discourse analysis of US national, northwestern, and southwestern regional innovation policy documents with weekly decision exercises with local actors engaged in "smart" technology innovation. Discourse analysis revealed that sociotechnical imaginaries at the national level are refracted regionally, in keeping with multi-level governance frameworks. Our two regional cases illustrate how different cultural, political, and economic contexts produce variations of national imaginaries and how these in turn shape technologies at the local level. We conducted weekly decision exercises with innovation actors using the Socio-Technical Integration Research (STIR) protocol in two laboratories, two technology start-ups, and two policy organizations. Discourse analysis STIR protocol exercises suggest that regional imaginaries are refracted through local innovation practices, supporting the idea that expert performances of public values are culturally and geographically contingent. Midstream modulation analysis identified changes in practices at each of the organizations that were correlated with the STIR protocol, as illustrated below: Portland Laboratory. STIR exercises influenced a decision by power systems engineers to talk with the homeowner on whose property a "smart" power demonstration they were designing would be located; a change in the project design process that entailed locating the demonstration inside the homeowner’s garage, where the homeowner preferred it, rather than outside on the side of the house; and a tentative decision to collaboratively design a public engagement event with the social scientist.  Phoenix Laboratory. STIR exercises led a doctoral engineering student to realize that academic demands for specialization increasingly superseded his intent to produce research that integrates social and technical dimensions of "smart" electricity grid management. While this resulted in a narrowing of the integrative aspects of his research, he reported afterwards that this reframing had longer-term, strategic effects, allowing him to graduate and subsequently co-found a center that realizes his original integrative vision.  Portland Start-up. STIR exercises helped the lead test engineer recognize the ways in which product design would impact user well-being and habit, incorporating views beyond that of the user experience ("UX") frame central to their design work. Subsequently, he began to consider benefits of design changes for laborers who install "smart home" technologies, incorporating views outside labor time to include concerns for safety and ergonomics. The engineer also expressed interest in mixed methods research to understand energy savings capabilities and user interest in these aspects of smart home technologies.  Phoenix Start-up. STIR exercises influenced the head strategist to create new management meetings, develop means to improve communication across different parts of a large "fintech" organization, and develop metrics that consider consumers’ diverse levels of digital and financial access and stability. Notably, they also helped the organization adopt an explicitly values-based decision to identify new customer populations with the "greatest need," rather than developing new markets solely on the basis of the "best fit" for their financial technology.  Portland Policy organization. STIR exercises influenced several relevant modulations including a decision in which a city official recognized that public engagement was not occurring in her procurement activities, despite a formal mandate for public engagement in the governance structure for "smart cities" work. The official subsequently expressed interest in, and hosted, a separate meeting to discuss possible public engagement projects.   Phoenix Policy organization. STIR exercises were connected to a decision by an NGO director to keep registration open for an energy policy event in order to allow for more diverse participation by community members. According to the director, the STIR process helped her to clarify, reaffirm, and focus on inclusion as a central value for her organization and to become aware of her own strategic thinking in ways she "hadn’t really thought about" before.  Previously, STIR has been documented to be effective in laboratories but has had extremely limited application in start-up environments and no known application in policy organizations.  These results show that socio-technical collaborations can help elucidate and strengthen the public value connections between innovation practices across diverse organizations in markedly different urban innovation systems. This is important from a public policy standpoint because these public values&mdash;at national, regional, and local levels&mdash;are what warrant innovation and "smart" technology practices in the first place. Furthermore, results suggest that the observed changes in practice take shape within the same refracted value contexts observed through the discourse analysis, thus supporting the idea that socio-technical collaborations can engender alternative expert performances of these same public values.
