<AbstractNarration>Every one needs to sleep. Many people may think that the purpose of sleep is a quiescent status with minimum level of brain activation to merely take a rest and passively remove fatigue accumulated during wakefulness. However, a growing body of evidence in neuroscience indicates that sleep plays much more active roles. One of the most important roles of sleep is to augment, or consolidate, learning and memory obtained during wakefulness. A better understanding of how sleep consolidates learning and memory would provide important knowledge of how students and adults can effectively learn and memorize. In the proposed research, we will specifically use visual perceptual learning (VPL), which refers to a long-term improvement of visual task performance by repetitive training on a particular visual task. By taking advantages of neural and behavioral characteristics of VPL and advanced non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, Dr. Sasaki and her team at Brown University will investigate detailed neural activation of the visual cortex during sleep. Investigations on how sleep functions to consolidate VPL may lead to better understanding of visual and brain plasticity (learning and memory) in human adults. Thus, the proposed activity will promote the progress of science in sleep and learning and advance the national health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been a controversy whether consolidation of learning and memory during sleep occurs by reactivating what was learned or memorized during wakefulness (reactivation), or by removing unimportant information (downscaling). Based on our preliminary findings, we propose a two-process model of the sleep consolidation of VPL, in which both reactivation and downscaling occur in a serial and integrative fashion. In the first reactivation process, neural circuits only for the trained visual feature are reactivated for enhancement of learning where sigma activity is mainly involved. This reactivation process is followed by the downscaling process that occurs both with the circuits for the trained and an exposed but unlearned, therefore unimportant, feature. The validity of two-process model will be tested using psychophysics, and advanced neuroimaging techniques including concurrent measurements of polysomnography and magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a decoding technique on blood-oxygen-level dependent signals as well as retinotopic mapping.  Successful research results would verify the two-process model and provide invaluable information with which the quality of learning and memory will be enhanced.</AbstractNarration>

The proposed activity supported by the funding has provided the society with both intellectual merit and broader impacts.  Intellectual merit:  During the funded period, the PI and colleagues have been successful in making important publications and research presentations at several conferences. One of our findings (Night watch in one brain hemisphere during sleep associated with the first night effect in humans), which was published in Current Biology 2016 was to a greatest degree picked by the national and international media. Its Altmetric score hit 2370 at the end of the published year. This made the top 27 most-discussed journal articles among all of the scientific papers from all the scientific fields published in 2016, and the top 4 of all of the papers published in the biological sciences. The media attention was helpful for dissemination of our work.  The funding allowed the PI and colleagues to develop a procedure to measure concentrations of each of glutamate and GABA concurrently with polysomnogram (PSG) in an MRI scanner. The concurrent measurement of concentrations of glutamate and GABA was conducted by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a new cutting-edge method. The simultaneous measurement of MRS and PSG was not routinely conducted in the research field. We made measurements with increased the temporal resolution of MRS so that we could obtain the concentrations of glutamate and GABA for each sleep stage.  Broader impacts:  The funded project has provided training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and post-doc students. The training involved programming, and data analysis, which were collected by means of psychophysics, magnetic resonance imaging and PSG. Students were also provided training for research presentation.  The project shared a commitment to increase chances of full participation of women, persons with disabilities and under represented minorities. The women ratio in the individuals who participated in the proposed activity was about 60% in average for the funded period.
