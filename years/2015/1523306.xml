<AbstractNarration>CBET-1523306 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Schneider, James &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the participation of US scientists and engineers in the 89th American Chemical Society Colloid and Surface Science Symposium, which will be held on the campus of Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA from June 15-17, 2015.  The symposium will address a broad range of topics in colloidal and surface science that are broadly relevant to many processes of technological and biological interest.  The symposium will provide a way for leading research groups to interact with researchers across academic and scientific disciplines, and it will help junior researchers, including young faculty members and graduate students, to interact with leaders in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium, which will consist of a variety of keynote lectures, technical and poster sessions, will cover a variety of timely and innovative themes that are central to recent advances in colloidal and surface science.  The topics of planned sessions include self- and directed-assembly of nanomaterials, dynamics of suspensions, nanoscale imaging and spectroscopy of interfaces, the behavior of polymers under confinement, electrokinetics and microfluidics, and the role of colloidal principles in environmental systems and in nanomedicine.</AbstractNarration>

Four student poster awards were given, including a PeopleÆs Choice Award selected on the basis of poster session attendee voting.  TuesdayÆs program began with Professor Tejal DesaiÆs plenary lecture, "Hierarchical interfaces for overcoming drug delivery barriers".  The day continued with parallel technical sessions and ended with Professor MillstoneÆs Unilever Award lecture, "Impact of surface chemistry in multimetallic nanoparticle synthesis and performance".  TuesdayÆs program ended with the conference banquet held at the Carnegie Museum of Art and Natural History with dessert served among the exhibits.  Professor ChenÆs LaMer Award Lecture began the final day of the conference.  Technical sessions ended at 5 PM on Wednesday.  In addition to the plenary and award lectures, the technical program consisted of 442 oral presentations and 84 poster presentations in 13 symposia.

The net revenue per exhibitor after the reduction by the cost of their complimentary registration was $1635.  The Exhibition ran from Monday afternoon through Wednesday afternoon in the University Center gymnasium.  Attendance was high despite competing meetings focusing on colloids on dates overlapping or very close to the Symposium.  613 registered attendants came from the U.S. and 21 other countries. 276 of the attendees were students.  Registration included continental breakfast and box lunch each day, the Sunday and Monday receptions as well as one ticket to the conference banquet.    The social events were successful.
