<AbstractNarration>Structural health monitoring is an important subject area of research because of the aging infrastructure of the nation and the desire to extend life of buildings and structures. Distress in reinforced concrete structures such as bridges, buildings, and nuclear power plants can be detected by cracks in is concrete. It is advantageous to record characteristics of the cracks remotely and mechanically to reduce use of manpower. The cracks can be recorded using digital camera. The challenge is to quantify the length and size of these cracks in computer based system. Mathematics based fractal analysis has a potential to quantify the cracks. An algorithm will be developed for fundamental fractal analysis of 2D digital visual images and apply the algorithm to surface cracks in reinforced concrete structures. The algorithm will be validated using previously collected data in laboratory tests. Research will be pursued to assess structural damage from the crack patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to create a vision-based structural health monitoring system for the automatic assessment of damage in reinforced concrete civil infrastructures. The system is based on the fractal analysis of 2D images of the visible spectrum and will be capable of retrieving surface crack patterns that can provide a quantitative measure of damage. The PI will investigate fundamental fractal properties of 2D digital visual images and apply the algorithm to surface cracks in reinforced concrete structures. The database from the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Project Warehouse will be used to validate the algorithm. It is planned to validate the hypothesis that fractal analysis can be used for nondestructive evaluation method and can provide crack pattern. The crack pattern can be used  to assess structural damage. It is planned to incorporate results of this project in existing graduate course.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The service performance of reinforced concrete (RC) structures is commonly assessed using some form of visual inspection procedure involving, among other items, the examination of crack lengths and widths. Typically, this member/structure damage information is used in combination with various condition rating systems in an effort to quantify or categorize RC member damage in terms of visually observed cracking. While such guidelines may serve as practical means of cataloguing and monitoring damage in concrete infrastructure, they do not necessarily provide inspectors with adequate information to make informed judgements regarding the structural capacity implications of the observed damage, particularly in the case of RC member cracking. Instead of manually examining visual cracking in RC members, in this project we explored an automatic approach based on the fractal analyses of images taken in the visible spectrum as a means of retrieving surface defect patterns that can be used to develop a quantitative measure of structure capacity.   This project had two distinct phases. The first phase was devoted to understand, at the fundamental level, the fractal properties of digital images. Finally, the NEES Project Warehouse data set (CMMI-0829978) was used to provide a quantitative measure of the structural damage from the concrete cracks, and test the validity of the proposed approach.   In the first phase, new algorithms based on monofractal and multifractal analysis were developed to quantify the distributions and patterns of cracks observed in RC shear walls, and to use this information to assess the impacts of these cracks on wall capacity. The performance of these algorithms was initially tested on synthetic data sets, representing typical crack patterns in a RC shear wall. We demonstrated that fractal properties can be used to discriminate crack patterns.   In the final phase, the new algorithms based on fractal analysis were applied to a set of experimental data collected during testing of two large-scale RC shear walls subjected to controlled reversed cyclic loading in the plane of their web. In particular, the available data set included detailed records of crack images and structural performance for each test specimen. The structural response data available for each specimen was used to link the fractal parameters with the structural performance of the two specimens. It was observed that as the crack patterns extend and grow, fractal parameters move toward higher values and jump as cracking mechanism changes.    Over this four-year project, we have shown that fractal analysis can be used to detect patterns of damage that can be related to the strength of a RC structure. Although the proposed approach is very promising, more tests and investigations are needed to move the technology from its infancy to an operational system.
