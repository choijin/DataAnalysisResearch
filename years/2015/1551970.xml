<AbstractNarration>Scientific advance unleashes the forces of creative destruction through innovation, which has significant economic implications for industries, workers and places.  Yet in the modern globally networked economy, local innovation systems alone are not sufficient to sustain economic vitality. The best ideas and resources may reside in distant locales. This conference explores knowledge connectivity -- collaborative R&amp;D across geographic, organizational, and technological space -- as a global division of labor. This conference brings together scholars from international business, economic geography, and innovation studies to consider the co-evolution of firms and locations and to define a research agenda to better inform policy in a changing global system of innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will encourage cross- and inter-disciplinary dialog with the view of building a holistic view of the spatial organization of economic activity. Over a two-day period (Nov. 13-14th, 2015), Temple University will host scholars from all over the world, with keynote addresses, paper presentations, and workshops. A call for submissions will invite papers for all relevant disciplines, favoring integrative approaches and novel data. Combining prominent disciplinary scholars with leading edge integrative work will give legitimacy and direction to this nascent area of study.</AbstractNarration>

The workshop attracted academics working in international business, economic geography and innovation management as well as government practitioners and representatives of funding agencies. The NSF workshop built the foundations of an ongoing research network to develop a holistic approach to the study of innovative activity across space.  Workshop participants highlighted the major megatrends underpinning change in today?s global economy: (a) the shift from trade in goods to trade in activities (or tasks); (b) the rise of knowledge-intensive intangibles; (c) the rise of emerging markets  A particularly important outcome of the workshop was the development of an integrative framework for future research and policy design. This is the co-evolutionary "flowers-and-bees" model. This model has implications for both theory and policy. The model is based on the new reality of international trade.  Thus mobile MNEs (bees) that seek resources (nectar) in immobile locations (flowers) and in so doing generate local benefits in the form of employment, innovation and value (pollination).
