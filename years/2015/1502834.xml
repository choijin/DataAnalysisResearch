<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2015 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Ila Varma is "Applications of Arithmetic Invariant Theory to Extensions of Cohen-Lenstra Heuristics and Beyond." The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Benedict Gross.</AbstractNarration>
