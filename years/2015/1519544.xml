<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will determine the feasibility of an innovation aimed at enhancing student learning in hands-on science experiments. Currently, US students' poor performance in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines is limiting their career options. The aim of this project is to provide students the best possible opportunity to succeed in high school science courses so that they may pursue rewarding, well-paid, careers in STEM fields. To that end, this project will develop technologies that will seamlessly blend hands-on experiments with virtual worlds that engage students by giving laboratory activities a real world context. These virtual worlds will immerse students in environments wherein they can develop and hone critical thinking skills. The design of this blended reality approach is based on foundational theories of learning and engagement. By testing the innovation in high schools, this project will determine whether a blended reality approach is a feasible way to meet the growing demand that schools move from content-based to skills-based instruction. In doing so, this product will  improve student learning and deliver  a skilled workforce to  industries that require STEM expertise and are vital components of the US economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop technologies that will transform traditional hands-on science experiments through integration of virtual worlds that place science concepts of experiments in real-world context. By engaging students in authentic inquiry and enabling students to act like real scientists, the new technologies will scaffold the learning experience such that students can practice critical thinking skills. As students progress, their performance at each stage will be sent to their teachers in real time. This allows teachers to immediately identify difficulty students may have with a specific science concept or skill. The feasibility of the product will be tested in high schools to determine whether this new approach engages students in their learning, and whether the new technologies help teachers meet their goals of increasing critical thinking during hands-on experiments. Critical thinking will be increased by emphasizing the scientific method where the product will enable students to acquire requisite knowledge, collect data, analyze and interpret data, form and test a hypothesis, refine the hypothesis, if needed, according to collected data, and communicate their findings. By blending real and virtual worlds, students will be able to visualize the inner-workings of an experiment so as to engender more accurate and sophisticated understanding.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Currently, US studentsÃ† poor performance in science disciplines is limiting their career options. The long term goal of the project is to provide students the best possible opportunity to succeed in high school science courses so that they may pursue rewarding, well-paid, science careers.  To that end, this project developed new technologies that seamlessly "blend" hands-on experiments with virtual worlds that: 1) relate science to the real world; 2) engage students in their learning in science clasrooms and 3) immerse them in virtual worlds wherein they can develop and hone critical thinking skills.    By engaging students in authentic inquiry and enabling students to act like real scientists, the new technologies scaffold the learning experience such that students can practice problem solving skills.  As students progress, their performance at each stage is sent to their teachers in real time. This allows teachers to immediately identify if a student is having trouble with a specific science concept.  The feasibility of this new approach was tested in high schools to determine whether this new approach engages students in their learning, and whether the new technologies help teachers meet their goals of increasing critical thinking during hands-on experiments.  A summary of the findings are as follows:   Students were highly engaged by the blended reality experience Student learning of concepts that are traditionally difficult for students to master (chemical reactions) improved significantly in the blended reality learning experience The inclusion of dynamic visualizations and interactive simulations of the atomic world were major contributors to the learning gains Students valued the ability to view the visualizations and simulations as they were performing hands-on chemistry experiments Teachers valued the opportunity afforded by the blended reality approach for their students to conduct authentic inquiry Teachers valued the real time data system to monitor student progress Teachers were able to use the real time data system to immediately identify students that were struggling with a specific concept in real time and help those students Students and teachers strongly agreed that using data from sensors to manipulate virtual atomic and molecular worlds would enhance their chemistry curricula        Last Modified: 01/11/2016       Submitted by: Zane Everett]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
