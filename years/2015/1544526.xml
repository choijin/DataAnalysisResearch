<AbstractNarration>Cryptoendoliths are organisms that colonize microscopic cavities of rocks, which give them protection and allow them to inhabit extreme environments, such as the cold, arid desert of the Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Fossilized cryptoendoliths preserve the forms and features of organisms from the past and thus provide a unique opportunity to study the organisms? life histories and environments. To study this fossil record, there needs to be a better understanding of what environmental conditions allow these fossils to form. A climate gradient currently exists in the Dry Valleys that allows us to study living, dead, and fossilized cryptoendoliths from mild to increasingly harsh environments; providing insight to the limits of life and how these fossils are formed. This project will develop instruments to detect the biological activity of the live microorganisms and conduct laboratory experiments to determine the environmental limits of their survival. The project also will characterize the chemical and structural features of the living, dead, and fossilized cryptoendoliths to understand how they become fossilized. Knowing how microorganisms are preserved as fossils in cold and dry environments like Antarctica can help to refine methods that can be used to search for and identify evidence for extraterrestrial life in similar habitats on planets such as Mars. This project includes training of graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little is known about cryptoendolithic microfossils and their formation processes in cold, arid terrestrial habitats of the Dry Valleys of Antarctica, where a legacy of activity is discernible in the form of biosignatures including inorganic materials and microbial fossils that preserve and indicate traces of past biological activity.  The overarching goals of the proposed work are: (1) to determine how rates of microbial respiration and biodegradation of organic matter control microbial fossilization; and (2) to characterize microbial fossils and their living counterparts to elucidate mechanisms for fossilization.  Using samples collected across an increasingly harsher (more cold and dry) climatic gradient that encompasses living, dead, and fossilized cryptoendolithic microorganisms, the proposed work will: (1) develop an instrument to be used in the field that can measure small concentrations of CO2 in cryptoendolithic habitats in situ; (2) conduct incubation experiments to target variations in microbial activity in samples containing living, dead, and fossilized microorganisms as well as limits to microbial activity by measuring CO2 evolution and delta13C signatures; and (3) use a suite of microscopy techniques (CLSM, cryo-SEM, FIB-SEM, Âµ-XFM) to correlate laboratory experimental evidence for microbial viability and activity and to identify the chemical and morphological characteristics of biosignatures and microbial fossils.  A metagenomic survey of microbial communities in these samples will be used to characterize differences in diversity, identify if specific microorganisms (e.g. prokaryotes, eukaryotes) are more capable of surviving under these harsh climatic conditions, and to corroborate microscopic observations of the viability states of these microorganisms.</AbstractNarration>

We therefore developed a simple, portable-by-hand, CO2 analyzer system than works in sub freezing temperatures in order to allow measurment of the metabolic activity of the endolithic (meaning 'inside rock'  microbial communities.  We designed, constructed and tested such a system. The system uses commerically available components such as a flow-through CO2 analyzer, vacuum pump, and valving. Custom plumbing of the system allows a gas sample to be collected into an evacuated injection loop, which can then be carried to the CO2 analyer in a CO2-free air stream.   The system allows CO2 concentrations to be determined with a reproducbility of approximately 1 part per million (for reference the CO2 concentration in Earth's atmosphere is now just over 400 pats per million) even at subfreezing ambient temperatures.  A graduate student helped design, build and test the analyzer system an was also trained in the statistical analysis of data collected in the testing of the analyzer.
