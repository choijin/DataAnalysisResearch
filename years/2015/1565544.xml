<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop new forms of tool-supported safety analyses for next-generation integrated medical systems that are based on the concept of medical application platforms (MAP). A MAP is a safety- and security- critical real-time computing platform for (a) integrating heterogeneous devices, medical IT systems, and information displays via a communication infrastructure and (b) hosting application programs ("apps") that provide medical utility via the ability to both acquire information from and update/control integrated devices, IT systems, and displays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in developing novel forms of hazard analyses (one of the primary forms of analysis used in safety critical systems) that can overcome the unique challenges posed by MAP-based systems.  The project will develop tool support that will&lt;br/&gt;(a) integrate hazard analyses with architectural models of MAP-based systems and (b) provide significant automation of analysis steps.  In&lt;br/&gt;consultation with engineers from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the project will construct mock risk management and regulatory&lt;br/&gt;artifacts associated with MAP apps.  The impact of this work centers around helping FDA engineers understand the architectural and safety issues associated with MAPs and identifying best practices that can lead to high assurance of MAP-based medical systems.  Additionally, the project will produce concrete hazard analysis examples that will provide science-based inputs into the design of a new regulatory approach and industry safety standards that support compositional regulation of heterogeneous multi-vendor MAP-based systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this research was to develop new forms of tool-supported safety analyses for next-generation integrated medical systems that are based on the concept of medical application platforms (MAP). A MAP is a safety- and security- critical real-time computing platform for (a) integrating heterogeneous devices, medical IT systems, and information displays via a communication infrastructure and (b) hosting application programs ("apps") that provide medical utility via the ability to both acquire information from and update/control integrated devices, IT systems, and displays.   This project developed analysis technologies, applied the technologies on example medical device platforms, and transitioned many of the analysis and associated process concepts into an industry standard, recognized by the US Food and Drug Administration for being useful for supporting safety reviews of interoperable medical systems.   The analysis technologies utilized the SAE standard Architecture and Analysis Definition Language (AADL) to create a model-based approach in which distributed medical system architectures are modeled in AADL. Interactions with the patient that could potentially cause harm are captured via attributes at the boundary of the system and control loops and data/control pathways are captured via formal model annotations.  Interactive and automated state-space exploration techniques help the analyst discover how problems within the system can potentially lead to patient harms.   With industrial collaborators at Adventium Labs, a reference architecture for medical devices called ISOSCELES was created with supporting hardware and software to enable device manufacturers to more rapidly build a safe and secure network-enabled medical device (supported by US Department of Homeland Security).  The analysis techniques and safety/security risk management process developed on this NSF FDA SIR grant were applied to the ISOSCELES platform.  The results fed into the ISOSCELES exemplar requirements and safety/security architecture that have been released as open-source artifacts.   The project PI for this NSF FDA SIR grant (Hatcliff) was one of the primary technical authors of the AAMI/UL 2800 standard for safety and security of interoperable medical systems -- a standard that was officially recognized by the FDA as being using for safety/security reviews of interoperable medical devices.   Many of the concepts related to processes and objectives for distributed risk management for interoperable medical systems (captured in publications associated with this grant) were summarized in an annex of the AAMI/UL 2800 standard on risk management.   In summary, the intellectual merit of this project included:   designing novel methodologies aligned with industry standards (such as ISO 14871, IEC 80001, and the emerging AAMI/UL 2800) to support distributed risk management for platform-oriented development of medical systems from reusable components  designing interface specifications and architectural models to capture hazard analysis and risk management related interfaces on component interfaces and system architectures  designing and implementing tooling that that automates important steps in medical component/system hazard analysis and risk management  developing report forms and report generation tools for reporting the results and hazard analysis and risk management activities  developing example analyses and reports for exemplar medical components and systems   The broader impacts of the work included:   working with US FDA engineers to evaluate the technical approaches on realistic integrated medical device scenarios -- which informed FDA approaches to review of interoperable medical devices  transitioning concepts from the project into industry standards  producing open source artifacts that industry engineers and academic researchers can use to understand how distributed risk management techniques can be applied in realistic medical system contexts.
