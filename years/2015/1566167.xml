<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Professor Travis Williams of the University of Southern California's Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute is studying hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis that is directed toward new approaches for carbon dioxide utilization, hydrogen storage, and fine chemical production. Catalysts are species that facilitate chemical reactions and are utilized throughout the chemical industry. This project develops catalysts for several important processes. These include a catalyst for the removal of hydrogen from formic acid, which may allow formic acid to be used as a hydrogen carrier, another to remove hydrogen from glycerol, which may allow the formation of valuable products from waste materials of biodiesel refining, and a third to convert carbon dioxide to methanol, an important industrial starting material. This project includes a K-12 outreach program that brings local high school students into the research laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three target areas. First, a diiridium catalyst supported by a chelating phosphorus (P)-nitrogen (N) ligand is being developed for formic acid dehydration. In related work, a series of iridium and ruthenium complexes containing bidentate, pyridine containing ligands are being developed as catalysts for the conversion of glycerol to lactic acid. Finally, ruthenium complexes containing a borate ligand are being designed for carbon dioxide reduction. The mechanisms of these processes are being determined by chemical, kinetic, and spectroscopic studies in order to optimize the catalytic processes.  The selected target reaction have the potential to be licensed commercially or adapted by others for industrial use.  The student-hosted colloquia program exposes graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral students to a variety of career possibilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award from the National Science Foundation enabled Dr. Travis Williams and co-workers at the University of Southern California to make fundamental contributions to catalysis science that resulted in new methods for chemical synthesis, new knowledge of how certain metals effect catalytic hydride transfer reactions, and generated intellectual property that forms the bases of 3 commercial inventions.  Intellectual Merit  This project introduced two new families of chemical reactions. One involves conversion of glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel refining, to lactate salts, environmentally benign food preservatives. The other is catalytic conversion of primary alcohols to amines or carboxylic acids with no added redox reagents. The project has also generated deep mechanistic insight into each of these new reactions and a reaction introduced recently by our lab in which stored hydrogen is released from formic acid. This work has included two papers that were respectively among the top 1% of the most cited works of chemistry in 2016 and 2017.  Broader Impacts  Our glycerol conversion chemistry has moved forward toward commercialization by Catapower, Inc., a startup venture that was organized through the NSF I-Corps program, and our amination work has produced a small molecule catalyst that is commercially available from TCI chemicals.  The PI has been engaged in outreach activities including leadership of a student-hosted colloquia series at USC that has served as an ongoing career development program for graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral students at USC. He has also been engaged in instruction in NMR spectroscopy workshops at USC and our neighboring PUIs that has enabled new tools in molecular characterization for workers at USC around Southern California.
