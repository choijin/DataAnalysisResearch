<AbstractNarration>#1510934&lt;br/&gt;Filler, Michael A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes a new type of material for not only capturing radiation energy such as that from the Sun but also manipulating the direction of the energy flow.  The research effort combines experiment and theory, and will test the hypothesis for harvesting energy from mid-infrared light.  The education effort will include (1) K-12 and undergraduate STEM education, with an emphasis on underrepresented minorities and (2) Georgia Tech summer camp activity entitled "Wearing the Sun," where Atlanta area high school students learn about solar energy harvesting by creating personalized, sunlight-activated clothing (i.e., T-shirts, etc.), will be enhanced during the proposed project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal aims to investigate the mid-infrared localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) supported in selectively doped Si nanowires by understanding the structural and synthetic parameters that influence LSPR quality factor and probing the near-field coupling of neighboring LSPRs.  It also seeks to demonstrate enhanced vibrational mode sensing in thermal radiation hot spots.   By coupling experiment and theory, the PI will test the hypothesis that mid-infrared light can be confined via doped-Si resonators to the same extent as visible/near-infrared light in conventional plasmonic materials.  The proposed efforts will develop vapor-liquid-solid nanowire growth to engineer extreme light localization and transport via precise control of resonator geometry, carrier density, and spacing, hoping to develop ultra-compact thermal radiation waveguides, modulators, and detectors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This project advanced our understanding of the infrared optical and thermal conductive properties of doped semiconductor nanowires and nanocrystals. The learning gained from this project promises to accelerate the deployment of new technologies in the areas of thermal detection, infrared energy harvesting, and switchable thermal transport. The work followed three main threads, the key outcomes of which are described below:  1) We revealed a practical material system &ndash; infrared plasmonic resonators embedded in a semiconductor nanowire &ndash; that leverages near-field electromagnetic coupling to achieve photonic thermal transport comparable to the electronic and phononic contributions.

Despite the higher optical losses in Si, its thermal performance was similar to lower loss InAs. This system outperformed plasmonic particles in isotropic environments and presents a pathway for photonic thermal transport to exceed that of phonons and electrons.  2) We used scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) to characterize axial carrier density gradients in phosphorus-doped silicon nanowires.
