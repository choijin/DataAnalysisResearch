<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to bring to bear the tools of mathematics to gain an improved theoretical and quantitative understanding of the fundamental processes underlying the function of biological organisms.  This research will examine the mechanisms underlying cell behavior including processes such as movement, direction finding, regulation of protein content, construction of complex substructures, communication between cells, information processing, and decision making.   The strategy for this investigation is to construct mathematical models of these processes that are based on the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms, with the intent of demonstrating and understanding how the individual components fit and work together to give coordinated, higher level behavior.   A major component of this project is the training of graduate students to do collaborative, interdisciplinary research and teaching.  The combined effect of these efforts will be to communicate to the broader scientific community the importance and power of mathematics to understanding biology, to help build bridges of collaboration between mathematicians and biologists, and to bring new researchers into the field of mathematical biology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research component of this proposal is to use mathematical methods to study a variety of biological problems broadly identified as the dynamics of cellular physiological processes.  Specific projects include study of ephaptic coupling of cardiac cells, regulation of the construction of flagellar rotary motors and control of their rotation direction,  protein trafficking, force generation by depolymerization of microtubules during cell division, and the beating motion of cilia.  While the details of the biology of each of the projects  are quite different, their mathematical descriptions contain many common features and rely on common principles and transferable concepts, and it is the commonality of mathematics that unifies this work.  In particular, principles of mathematical modeling, dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, asymptotic analysis, homogenization and multi-scale analysis, stochastic processes, and numerical simulation will all be used in this work. Thus, this work  brings the tools of modern applied mathematics to bear on challenging and complex problems of biology while pushing forward the frontiers of applied mathematics.  The combination of diverse biological problems and sophisticated mathematical tools is expected to result in novel and unexpected insights into the way cells function.</AbstractNarration>
