<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site, a collaborative program between Purdue University and Tuskegee University, will focus on providing high school STEM teachers from Indiana and Alabama with the knowledge and skills to equip their students to become part of a technologically adept workforce as well as informed consumers of sustainable products. The topic of environmentally sustainable electronics provides both context and application to many scientific and engineering principles. Each research project will be mapped to specific high school science standards, which will guide development of high school curricula. Environmental sustainability as a general context should help broaden female and minority participation in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RET Site will offer an intensive six week summer research program for a total of 33 high school STEM teachers, over a three year period, from school districts in Indiana and Alabama. Working alongside the faculty and doctoral students on research on the entire life cycle of electronics (design, production, packaging, distribution, use and recycling/reuse), these teachers will gain firsthand scientific knowledge of the many facets of creating sustainable electronics. The teachers and faculty will conduct experiments on such topics as using natural resins such as cellulose, lignin, and soy instead of petroleum-based resins to build circuit boards, and cost effectively recovering and reusing electronics instead of sending them to landfills. Field trips to local electronics recycling centers and to companies that design and make computers, cell phones and other electronic devices will provide the participants with insight into real-world aspects of electronics. Teachers will gain scientific proficiency in these areas and convey their new knowledge to their STEM students, hopefully arousing interest to pursue a STEM degree and career after graduation from high school. The teachers also will share their experiences with peers through district, state and national conferences and other professional development opportunities, thus helping to disseminate this knowledge more broadly beyond just their own classrooms. Complementing the research will be a series of professional development activities to enhance teacher quality and support to implement new, standards-based curricula into their science courses at their respective high schools. In addition, the project will provide opportunities for Purdue and Tuskegee graduate students who follow up with the teachers in their classrooms in the school year to observe firsthand the implementation of the principles and knowledge that the graduate students also are obtaining by working with the RET faculty on sustainable-electronics research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The NSF RET Site project on Sustainable Electronics was successfully implemented in partnership with Purdue University during the 3-year funding period on the campus of Tuskegee University. The TU RET Site project successfully recruited 4 high school science teachers to participate in all 3-years of project implementation which hosted summer research and engineering curriculum training activities at Tuskegee University and at the partnering institution ? Purdue University.&nbsp; All of the high school teachers selected to participate in the Tuskegee University RET Site project were from the Alabama Black Belt Region, which is a high-poverty within the state of Alabama.&nbsp; During each year of the RET Site summer program, each participating high school teacher received the opportunity to receive mentoring and research training from Tuskegee University faculty, staff&nbsp;and graduate&nbsp;students and was exposed to and participated in cutting edge research in sustainable electronics.&nbsp; In addition to research training, each high school teacher received professional development training related to the best practices for the implementation of engineering concepts, activities, and research in high school science curricula at Tuskegee University and at Purdue University.&nbsp; Each high school science teacher developed STEM activities and videos on the concept of Sustainable Electronics and successfully implemented these activities into their respective high school science curricula.&nbsp; Once implemented, these activities have extended the exposure of high school students in a critical needs area of science and technology to promote early awareness and readiness for undergraduate STEM programs, increased awareness towards the impact and consequences of electronic waste on the environment, and significantly increase the number of students from high-poverty backgrounds who are pursuing STEM degrees at institutions of higher learning in critical need areas such as Sustainable Electronics.&nbsp; Indeed, under this project successful partnerships were formed between high school science teachers and higher-ed research faculty at Tuskegee University and Purdue University resulting in the development of grade appropriate STEM activities and videos based on sustainable electronics that are currently implemented into the Alabama Black Belt High School Science Classrooms and high school science teachers with increased knowledge and training on the implementation of engineering research concepts in high school science curricula.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/02/2019<br>
