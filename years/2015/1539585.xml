<AbstractNarration>Growing renewable generation capacity is leading to unprecedented variability and uncertainty in power system operations, and a lack of power system flexibility threatens further increases in global sustainability in electricity sectors across the globe.  This project seeks to aggregate and control demand-side resources to provide this flexibility through a distributed control framework that is robust to failures in cyber-infrastructure, and is scalable across institutional dynamics, energy markets, and levels of power system development infrastructure.  Research objectives in this proposal will advance current applications and theories in computing, modeling and control, and the effectiveness and scalability of this work will be rigorously demonstrated through a field trial in Nicaragua.   This project will result in new tools to facilitate sustainable energy systems throughout the globe, an open data platform that strengthens the ability of global researchers to develop global solutions to challenges underling the integration of renewable sources, and advances in education to equip the workforce with new tools to tackle sustainability challenges.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The envisioned system employs a centralized computing infrastructure to produce optimal control laws for individual thermostatically controlled loads.  The control laws can operate with or without reliable cyber-infrastructure in real time; in the absence of cyber-infrastructure, control can be based on time of use and local frequency measurements only.   Control laws will be published by a central server and periodically accessed by local intelligence at each load.  Challenges to this work include creating computing infrastructure that can actively distribute control laws and validate participation, modeling and control methods that are effective on real-world loads, and identifying control strategies with effective incentive mechanisms for consumers to participate.  At the conclusion of the project the investigators will have: (1) built a framework by which an innovative, cloud-based data management platform called Mezuri can robustly track the provenance and processing of all data and disseminate control laws; (2) developed hierarchical statistical models for state estimation and prediction of large fleets of thermally controlled loads that directly include the effects of human behavior, and adapt models to require as few observations as possible; and (3) devised new stochastic optimal control formulations that account for human activity and accommodate both system- and local-level objectives.  Taken together, these contributions build a new framework for control of demand-side resources that is globally scalable in a short time horizon.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Growing renewable generation capacity is leading to unprecedented variability and uncertainty in power system operations, and a lack of power system flexibility threatens further increases in global sustainability in electricity sectors across the globe. In this work we developed tools to evaluate and manage sustainable electrification pathways.  The research objectives in this project were to advance current applications and theories in energy infrastructure sensing, modeling and decision-making.    Our accomplishments fell into three major areas.  First, we developed infrastructure uniquely suited to the challenges of energy monitoring and control in low income countries, and we deployed this infrastructure in Latin America and Africa.  Second, we developed data-driven tools for analysis and control of energy systems, focusing on settings where high resolution and / or real-time data are unavailable for analysis and decision-making.  Finally, we developed a body of work on capacity expansion planning for low carbon development in low income countries.    Our findings regarding cyber infrastructure can be broadly summarized as follows.  Energy sensing and communications infrastructure has significant positive effects on improving energy literacy and efficiency in poor countries.  In contrast, however, poor energy services -- driven in part by a lack of adequate infrastructure to identify deficiencies -- prevent electricity customers from investing in high quality, energy efficient appliances.  Taken together these results point toward an important role for sensing and communications infrastructure, both on the customer and utility side of the meter, in improving energy efficiency and access to services that grids provide.    We also developed a number of data-driven tools for energy systems analysis and control.  Across all these tools our key finding is that, with careful application of energy domain engineering knowledge, emerging statistical learning technologies are both practical and effective for supporting energy infrastructure operations.  This work was done in collaboration with a number of institutions and companies with a strong presence in this space, and in this way we developed multiple pathways to disseminate these tools beyond the confines of academic research.    Regarding energy infrastructure planning, one of our central findings is that decentralization -- whether by microgrids, distributed energy resources, or demand response -- is a central pillar of low carbon development.  This positions electricity users as central actors in system expansion.  Overall, the intellectual merit ranged from developing new machine learning-based decision-making tools for energy infrastructure to executing rigorous field studies of the impacts of cyber-infrastructure on electricity users.  The project’s broader impact includes deep insight into how people use electricity and the implications of these findings on sustainable development.  Taken together, our results contribute to the continued development of very low cost sensing and communications infrastructure and supporting algorithms, and highlight the importance of facilitating energy literacy and situational awareness among decision makers in low-income economy settings.
