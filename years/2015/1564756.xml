<AbstractNarration>Proteins are the 'workhorse' molecules of life, they participate in nearly every activity that cells carry out. It follows that understanding protein structure and function is essential to understanding life processes, and how to control or modify them. Biochemistry and biophysics experiments give the most accurate data on protein structure and function, but the experiments are often expensive and too specialized for many of the cell and molecular biologists focused on a particular interesting protein. This means that reliable computational predictions of protein structure and function are in high demand. These techniques are also specialized but can be automated, which is the focus of this project, which aims to develop an integrated platform for high-resolution protein structure prediction and structure-based function annotation that is accessible from the Web. This resource will significantly enhance studies of individual proteins as well as processes in cellular biology and other biological sciences. Through the collaboration of the two institutions, students at NCAT will learn state of the art high performance computing methods, and workshops at both institutions will provide greater understanding of the capabilities of the new resource. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proteins are complex components of biological systems, and studies on their structure and function often require multiple approaches to measurement or modeling. Many of the advanced computer algorithms used in this modeling are highly specialized, involving a number of complicated processes for each aspect of the protein modeling. Biologists whose primary interest is the final result often cannot determine which algorithm or pipeline to choose, how to enter parameters, or how to interpret the resulting models. While continuing to improve the accuracy of the core algorithms in protein structure prediction and structure-based function annotation, this project will also make improvements to domain parsing and assembly, to improve the quality of complex protein structure and function modeling. Another major focus of this project is to develop new protocols that automatically guide protein targets to the most suitable pipelines. In conjunction with this there will be new confidence scoring systems, both global and local, to assist biological users as they interpret the modeling results. In addition, advanced parallel computing and graphic processor unit techniques will be implemented in order to accelerate the pipelines and reduce user's waiting time.  New opportunities will be made for improving educational outcomes, in particular for women and minority students, in both University of Michigan and the North Carolina A&amp;T State University. The on-line protein modeling system will be accessible to the community at http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu.</AbstractNarration>

Following these goals, the PI&rsquo;s Lab has developed multiple computational algorithms that were integrated into the I-TASSER gateway system for advanced protein structure prediction and structure-based function prediction. The I-TASSER flagship server (<a href="https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/">https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/</a>) has predicted more than 500,000 protein structures for more than 100,000 registered users from 148 countries as of July 2020, while nearly 40,000 users are from the United States. Consequently, the I-TASSER server articles have been cited more than 8,000 times in scientific publications since 2016. These data demonstrate that the structure and function prediction system developed under this project has generated important positive impacts on the community for facilitating biomedical research. The project has created important opportunities for training and education at the University of Michigan. Around 20 graduate and 30 undergraduate students have been trained by fully or partially participating in the project, while nearly half of the undergraduate students trained under this project have chosen to continue their study in this or related fields at the graduate level. In addition, two bioinformatics courses have been developed and taught at the Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan.
