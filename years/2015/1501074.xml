<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the "Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory Conference" hosted by the Department of Mathematics of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, May 18 - 20, 2015. Dynamical systems, ergodic theory, and probability are important fields of modern mathematics dealing with complicated systems and their development over time. By noticing and analyzing patterns of such developments, dynamical systems and ergodic theory often allow one to describe stable states of a system, predict changes in a system, and assess their likelihood. The connection to probabilistic models often aids in these goals. The conference will bring together senior and junior researchers who will be exposed to the most recent results in the field and will participate in fruitful scientific exchanges. This will create a true synergy, push the bounds of our understanding of mathematics further, and lead to new discoveries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting features presentations by leaders in dynamical systems, ergodic theory, and their interface with probability theory. This conference will advance knowledge through communication of recent results to a wide audience that includes graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients, as well as members of groups that are not well represented in the mathematical sciences. An important contribution of the conference is the special opportunities afforded to junior participants to present their work to the international leaders in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: people.cas.uab.edu/~ablokh/Chernov-conference-2015</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On May 18-20, 2015 Dynamical Systems, Ergodic Theory and Probability  Conference was held. The conference was dedicated to the memory of  Nikolai Chernov. Plenary talks were given by L. Bunimovich (Georgia Tech),  D. Dolgopyat (Maryland), K. Khanin (Toronto), J. Lebowitz (Rutgers), R. Lyons (Bloomington), R. Markarian (Uruguay), Y. Pesin (Penn State), N. Simanyi (UAB), D. Szasz (Hungary). There were three parallel sessions (Dynamical Systems, Ergodic Theory, Probability) with 48 talks given at these sessions.  The talks covered a broad spectrum of Nikolai Chernov's  favorite topics in math (a few speakers were his former students).  The conference brought together a number of experts in Dynamical Systems,  Ergodic Theorey and Probability. The exchange of ideas among them was   very productive,  As a result  we plan to publish a volume in Contemporary  Mathemtics with articles submitted by participants in the conference.  The volume is practically ready and will be sent to AMS in September  2016; a number of particpants in the conference have submitted their   articles and almost all of them have already been refereed. We plan  to have fifteen articles published in this collection.  The conference webpage can be found at  http://people.cas.uab.edu/~ablokh/c-c-2015/  and its program (that includes abstracts of the plenary talks) can be found at  http://people.cas.uab.edu/~ablokh/c-c-2015/Conference_Program_Chernov_bl.pdf  The abstracts of all other talks can be found at  http://people.cas.uab.edu/~ablokh/c-c-2015/Conference_Program_Chernov_abstr.pdf  The conference poster can be found at  http://people.cas.uab.edu/~ablokh/c-c-2015/collage1c.jpg  The image of the poster is attached to the report.  The intellectual merit of the conference lies in that it provided platform  for a strong interaction among experts in the fields of Dynamical Systems,  Ergodic Theory and Probability. It allowed young researchers to attend  lectures by world-renown experts as well as to present their work.  There was also a lot of discussions among pure and applied mathematicians. International participation in the conference was   stong and visible as it was attended by scientists from Austria, Brazil,   Canada, Croatia, Egypt, Great Britain, Hungary,  Italy,  Portugal, and  Uruguay, as well as by many mathematicians from a number of the US  univertsities.  Broader impact of the conference lies in the fact that the interaction that took  place during the conference should result in new papers; in particular, this  concerns the papers that will be published in the aforementioned   volume of Contemporary Mathematics.
