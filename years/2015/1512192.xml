<AbstractNarration>1512192(Kanso) &amp; 1509071(Sotiropoulos)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research is to investigate, experimentally and numerically, the motion of irregularly shaped objects as they cross fluid-air interfaces and the phenomena that occur at the interface and the bulk of the fluid because of the presence of the object. Understanding the underlying phenomena could lead to controlling the process by controlling the object shape or controlling the type of fluid. Results from this research can have implications for the design of small robotic vehicles that move across fluid-air interfaces or the design of off-shore wind turbines or oil platforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This problem of object entry is generally complex, even for regularly shaped objects, such as spheres and discs, but is particularly interesting for objects with sharp leading geometries, such as cone- or pyramid-shaped objects, where the interplay between the body geometry and the complex vortical flows that develop at and near the fluid-air interface could help to dissipate the impact energy away from the body crossing the fluids' boundary. This proposal will analyze the fluid-structure interactions of objects moving in and across multi-phase incompressible fluids, and will particularly explore how the interplay between the object's geometry and material properties and the complex flow structures (waves and vortices) that develop at and near the fluid interfaces can be exploited to hinder or facilitate the motion of the solid object. During this project, carefully designed experiments as well as through mathematical and computational models will be used to investigate  the following two problems: (i) Forward problem: for a given multi-phase fluid medium and shape/material properties of the object, what is the forward dynamics of the body and the surrounding fluids? (ii) Inverse problem: two types of problems: a. For a desired response such as aiding the motion of the solid object in a given fluid environment, what geometric/materials design principles should the object fulfill?  b. For a desired response such as hindering the motion of the solid object, what properties should the fluid medium have?  Activities are also proposed that involve undergraduate curriculum development at USC and at the University of Minnesota, as well as outreach efforts to K-12 students in the greater LA area through the USC VAST program and the Cabrillo Aquarium in San Pedro.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ What are the major goals of the project?     The goal of this project was to study the motion of heavy objects, such as birds and robotic vehicles, crossing interfaces in multi-phase incompressible fluids at relatively low-speeds.  This study aimed at understanding the complex flow structures (splash and vortices) that occur at and near the interface during and after impact, and how these complex structures are affected, and even controlled, by the shape and entry conditions of the impacting body.  We used a combination of experimental techniques (Kanso?s lab) and numerical techniques (Sotiropoulos? lab) to address these problems.      What was accomplished under these goals?     Experimental work in PI Kanso group focused on:  We designed and built diving objects of various shapes: (1) wedges of various profiles and opening angles, (2) axisymmetric diving bodies, (3) diving bodies with rotating components. We tested the performance of these diving objects using three metrics: (a) impact force at water entry, (b) splash evolution, (3) drag forces when submerged.  We developed an in-house DPIV (digital particle image velocimetry) system that tracks simultaneously the fluid velocity field in air and water, providing novel insights into the flow structures at the interface. We also developed in-house image processing algorithms to track the position and orientation of the diving object.   Computational work in PI Sotiropoulos group focused on:  Conventional computational methods and numerical techniques are extremely computational demanding if large disparity of length and time scales should be resolved. We worked towards the development of new computational methods which enable fast, accurate and robust two-phase flow calculations of high Reynolds and Froude number flows. During the last annual period, we enhanced the potential of the unstructured Cartesian solver by employing the level-set method to perform two-phase flow Large Eddy Simulations (LES) on locally refined grids, using the sharp-interface immersed boundary method. We implemented high-order spatial and temporal discretization schemes to improve both accuracy and robustness of the reinitialization equation. We implemented these algorithms to two problems of water entry/exit.

The project provided opportunities for training and professional development of post-doctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students.
