<AbstractNarration>There is a long-standing scientific interest in the field of developmental biology, as development is a central biological problem, as well as an increasing public interest in issues such as evolution, stem cells and regenerative biology, highlighting the importance of the discipline both in terms of scientific advancement and public education.  The Society for Developmental Biology (SDB) annual meetings provide a forum to address these broader aspects, and to foster young scientists coming into the field, especially the under-represented and underserved populations.  The scientific sessions contribute to furthering our understanding of the processes used by a single fertilized cell to reach adult form with many cell types, in all organisms.  The education sessions offer opportunities for bench researchers to find out about more effective ways to teach and mentor the next generation. The meetings also provide an informed discussion forum on topics that are relevant to establishing national policies for research and public understanding of science.  The advances in developmental biology have contributed to beneficial practices in agriculture and animal (including human) health, to understanding evolution and preservation of species, and to the well-being of our planet and its biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SDB is the largest society devoted to the field of developmental biology, with over 2,000 members worldwide, including undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior and established investigators, many of whom hold NSF grants or fellowships. Participants present their latest, mostly unpublished findings at these annual meetings. Thus, the meeting contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the discipline and cross-fertilization of ideas. In recent years, other national societies have joined SDB in our annual meetings, confirming the leadership SDB has in the field worldwide. The proposed meetings will continue the tradition of mixing poster presentations, plenary and concurrent sessions, a postdoctoral symposium, an education symposium and workshops on new technologies, publishing, teaching and outreach, as well as on current issues. In all sessions, a special effort is made to have a diversity of speakers in terms of: model organisms, experimental approaches, career stages, gender and racial/ethnic background. The 2015 meeting, to be held in Snowbird, Utah, will cover a variety of themes and approaches, including: Epigenetic Mechanisms of Development; Imaging: Seeing is Believing; Gene Networks; Tissue Patterning/ Organogenesis; Evo-Devo Mechanisms; Quantitative Biology; Biomechanical Influences in Development; Signal Integration and Timing in Development; Growth and Metabolism.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Society for Developmental Biology Annual Meetings 2015-2017   The Society for Developmental Biology (SDB) is the largest society devoted to this field, with almost 3,000 members worldwide, including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and established investigators, many of whom hold NSF grants.  SDB has been organizing annual meetings since its founding in 1939, missing only two years during WWII.  They are the major forum where participants present their latest discoveries in the discipline, many still unpublished.  The three meetings supported by the present NSF grant were held in Snowbird, UT (2015), Boston, MA (2016) and Minneapolis, MN (2017).  The 75th Annual Meeting held in 2016 was a joint one with the International Society for Differentiation. These meetings followed the traditional format of mixing plenary sessions, concurrent symposia, awards lectures, a postdoctoral symposium, an education symposium, dedicated poster sessions, and workshops on new technologies, teaching, publishing and current issues.  In all meetings, a special effort was made to have a diversity of speakers in terms of: model organisms, experimental approaches, career stages, gender and racial/ethnic backgrounds.       In order to complement the topics presented in the meeting programs, satellite symposia were organized by SDB members on the first day of each meeting.  They also brought in speakers and registrants who might not have planned to attend the annual meeting.  The themes presented at these three meetings included: Ecology-Evolution-Development, Cell Migration, Epigenetics and Inheritance, Regenerative Biology, Neurodevelopment, Craniofacial Development.  Being primarily a field that crosses disciplinary boundaries, advances in developmental biology contribute to progress in other areas such as evolution, genetics, morphology, genomics and bioinformatics.  Although not immediately realized by the public or even by many specialists, knowledge and findings from studies of developmental processes have paved the way to emerging fields including regenerative biology, stem cell biology, development of biomaterials and treatments for reconstructive/regenerative medicine, and preservation of biodiversity on Earth.  Developmental studies using fluorescent markers presented at our meetings have also facilitated the commercialization of some of these markers for research and diagnostic uses.  Researchers also took advantage of advances in microscopy and obtaining high resolution live images contributed to further our understanding of developmental processes throughout the organisms? life span.  Potential long-range use of information collected by our meeting participants by various industries must also be acknowledged.   Education, mentoring and advancement of budding scientists are a major focus of the SDB mission and this is evidenced in our annual meetings.  The education symposia and the workshops addressed crucial current issues such as ?how to communicate science,? ?integrating inquiry-based learning into undergraduate curriculum,? ?how to publish and review manuscripts.?  Luncheon theme table topics included: careers inside and outside the academia, mentoring, the research environment, new technical advances, science and society, etc.  The junior investigators were given many opportunities at the annual meetings to showcase their work as selected postdoctoral or short talk speakers in platform sessions, besides presentations at the stand-alone poster sessions.  Competitions were held for the best postdoctoral presentation and the best student posters to draw out the best of these beginners in science.   One SDB Boot Camps for New Faculty was held the day before the start of the 2016 meeting, at Harvard University.  The Camp is targeted for new faculty and advance postdoctoral fellows to receive intensive professional development training on issues specific for early career individuals, including active learning approaches, laboratory management skills, being and finding a mentor, designing a course and syllabus, navigating through campus politics, etc.   SDB?s Choose Development! Program aims to increase the number of undergraduate students from under-represented minority and those with disabilities populations entering graduate programs.  Fellows from this program presented their research results at the three meetings and were welcome by this scientific community.    A large number of travel grants and awards (average of 70 per year) were provided for teaching faculty, students and postdoctoral fellows to help defray their meeting expenses, and priority was given to those from small budget laboratories or who had farther distances to travel.  This practice has succeeded in maintaining attendance of trainees at our meetings.  The total attendance over these three years was 2079, one-third of them students (graduate and undergraduate), and 1,225 posters were presented.
