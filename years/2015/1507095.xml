<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The efficiency of modern vehicles critically affects individual and national prosperity, national energy independence, city pollution levels (and related health) and climate change. A key element in deciding this efficiency is vehicle weight. While many ongoing efforts aim at introducing lightweight materials (such as aluminum, magnesium and carbon composites) into automotive structures, the dominant constituent, by far, is still relatively heavy steel. Hence this project focuses on the alternative light-weighting strategy of developing advanced high strength steels with improved formability; this will allow less metal to provide the same structural and safety performance. New and emerging microscopy techniques are combined with simulation to reveal the relationships between microstructure and properties of modern high-strength steels. The resulting insights lead to the deeper levels of understanding and improved models that are required for the nascence of so-called third-generation steels and a step-change in vehicle weight and efficiency. Not only does this research project provide an environment for mentoring graduate and undergraduate students in a mixed academic / industrial setting (via a strong collaboration with General Motors), but high school education is being improved via an outreach program. Teachers from local high schools spend time on the project during the summer months while receiving help in developing new and relevant curriculum components for their classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Many studies have been carried out on TRIP (Transformation Induced Plasticity) steels.  However, there is still no systematic information concerning the influence of austenite chemistry and microstructure on the resulting transformation to martensite. Such knowledge is critical to the design of texture, morphology and volume fraction of retained austenite in order to enable low-alloy TRIP steels to achieve enhanced strength, formability, and fracture resistance necessary to achieve the desired automotive structure performance. Proposed retained-austenite and martensite identification technologies (based upon emerging electron-backscatter diffraction techniques), along with meso-scale dislocation characterization, are combined with micro-digital image correlation (DIC) to provide a new 'Deformation Microscopy' capability.  The resultant framework allows for the assessment of interactions between dislocations and hard phase boundaries, while also precisely capturing the strains at which the various retained austenite islands transform. Knowledge of the fundamental links between microstructure and formability enables the formulation of a meso-scale model for transformation of austenite to martensite, and related deformation phenomena.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project employed novel characterization, modeling and forming techniques to further the science of advanced high strength steels (AHSS). These steels play a critical role in the lightweighting of automotive structures, in order to improve fuel efficiency while maintaining safety. As the alloy strength is increased, less material is required in order to provide the same structural integrity. However, as the strength is increased, the alloy typically become more brittle, making it difficult to form into the intricate shapes required by modern vehicle designs. One particular type of AHSS, known as transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steel, incorporates a metastable phase ? austenite ? in the alloy. The retained austenite transforms into the stable phase ? martensite ? when it is deformed, leading to a higher level of ductility than would otherwise have been expected. Hence, the distribution of austenite throughout the material plays a key role in the desirable properties of the steels. The details of this role have not been fully understood.</p> <p>This project advanced the scientific underpinnings of TRIP steels in four critical areas: 1. Characterization techniques for studying deformation behavior at the microstructural scale; 2. Analysis of formability behavior for two modern TRIP steels; 3. Development of a modeling environment for capturing the experimentally gained information; and 4. The study of a novel forming technique for dramatic increases in steel formability. The research was undertaken in a collaborative academic / industrial environment that positively impacted the education of numerous graduate and undergraduate students, and included a significant outreach component to local high schools. By leveraging the National Science Foundation support, nine graduate students and seven undergraduate students contributed to the progress achieved over the course of the project. Several students spent significant time with our industrial partner, General Motors, conducting research with GM scientists.</p> <p>First, novel electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) techniques were devised in order to tackle the difficult task of phase identification in the steels. The hard and soft phases in a typical steel are challenging to identify using standard microscopy, due the to similarity in their atomic structure. The new approach builds upon an open-source high-resolution EBSD environment, developed by the research team, in order to quantify subtle difference in the steel structure, thus enabling accurate mapping of the underlying microstructures. An innovative digital image correlation (DIC) technique was also developed to extract deformation and microstructural information simultaneously, and inform the modeling efforts.</p> <p>Two TRIP steels were then studied under various deformation modes, and the transformation of retained austenite in the steels was tracked. It was discovered, for example, that plane-strain deformation resulted in a slower transformation rate in one steel (Q&amp;P 1180), while inducing a much faster rate in the other (TBF 1180). This unexpected finding highlights the complex interactions of microstructure, deformation modes and resultant retained austenite transformation. The Q&amp;P &nbsp;steel was also studied in three dimensions by serial sectioning undeformed and deformed samples to extract accurate 3D feature characteristics. This enabled correlations to be observed between microstructure morphology and retained austenite transformation. Such studies have most often been performed using 2D data, potentially missing important morphological characteristics, such as the full 3D grain shape and the newly defined shear affinity factor, which were found to significantly influence transformation. These experimental observations immediately point designers of advanced steels towards ideal morphological characteristics, and help to better select optimal manufacturing processes.</p> <p>Based upon the observed material performance, a state-of-the-art kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) model of austenite transformation was developed and validated. By modeling the steel under the same conditions as the experimental observations, new insights were gained into the underlying causes of particular transformation behavior under different deformation conditions. For example, the importance of the relative proximity of austenite grains in the transformation process was highlighted for certain strain paths. The model will be available for other researchers to use for future in-depth studies.</p> <p>Finally, a continuous bending in tension forming approach was applied to the two steels, resulting in elongation increases of 400% or more, compared with standard deformation under tension. The scale of improvement promises transformative advances in the utilization of these AHSS steels.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/27/2019<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;Fullwood</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1507095/1507095_10381129_1574890029470_graphical_abstract--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1507095/1507095_10381129_1574890029470_graphical_abstract--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) Model of Retained Austenite Transformation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1507095/1507095_10381129_1574890029470_graphical_abstract--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) Model of Retained Austenite Transformation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Left to Right: Simulated grains of retained austenite in a KMC model for predicting transformation behavior in TRIP Steels; predicted transformation rate for different deformation modes; and rate of transformation of different variants, helping to explain the rate variations.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephen Cluff, BYU</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;Fullwood</div> <div class="imageTitle">Kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) Model of Retained Austenite Transformation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1507095/1507095_10381129_1574887762728_Slide3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1507095/1507095_10381129_1574887762728_Slide3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tetragonality Mapping for Phase Identification in Steel"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1507095/1507095_10381129_1574887762728_Slide3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tetragonality Mapping for Phase Identification in Steel"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Top and bottom rows contain images for two areas in a DP980 steel.
