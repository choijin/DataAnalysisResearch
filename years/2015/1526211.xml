<AbstractNarration>Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are hardware circuits that can be reconfigured by a system user after being deployed. FPGAs are a compelling alternative architecture that may allow hardware performance to continue to improve at a dramatic rate. Unfortunately, systems that incorporate an FPGA may allow a potentially untrusted user to reprogram hardware after it has been deployed. Such a scenario enables novel security attacks that can leak a user's private information or corrupt critical information stored on a system, but are performed entirely in hardware. This project develops an approach for ensuring that FPGAs satisfy strong security policies even when programmed by an untrusted user that will incur no overheard for runtime performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates techniques that automatically infer proofs of information-flow properties of circuits. This project designs and implements policy languages, proof languages, checking-circuit synthesizers, and proof generators, which in combination will dramatically improve the security of FPGA-based systems. These techniques will enable devices and data-centers to use FPGAs in novel circuit designs that satisfy strong, precise security guarantees and can be updated dynamically.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As the demand for computation increases, the gains from general-purpose processors continue to diminish. To address this challenge, research in both academia and industry has begun to focus on developing programmable accelerators. Among programmable accelerators, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide large gains in performance and energy efficiency. In particular, Microsoft has deployed FPGA&rsquo;s in its data centers to accelerate its web-search service, Bing. Intel recently acquired a major FPGA vendor for 16.7 billion USD to integrate FPGAs in their data-center products and develop new platforms for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Commercial products that integrate general-purpose cores (i.e., circuit design modules) with FPGAs have already been released by major chip producers and IoT design platforms based on FPGA&rsquo;s are becoming available to crowds of developers. While FPGAs could provide significant benefits for designing next-generation systems, they present novel security issues that have not been adequately addressed. In particular, to implement highly optimized FPGA controllers, a host system typically provides direct read and write privileges to an FPGA. With such privileges, an FPGA can access critical system resources such as memory, the system bus, and even on-chip network devices without mediation from the operating system. As a consequence, an FPGA containing a security vulnerability, perhaps due to aggressive manual optimization, could constitute a critical target for leaking sensitive information throughout a host system.

The key technical insight behind the design of SIMAREL is a novel algorithm for efficiently synthesizing relational invariants over pairs of circuit executions. We expressed expected behavior of cores designed independently for research and production as STREAMS policies and used SIMAREL to check if each core satisfies its policy.
