<AbstractNarration>The American Meteorological Society (AMS) conducts a Summer Policy Colloquium in Washington DC to develop leadership skills of attendees by providing introduction to methods for reconciling scientific opportunities with national priorities.  Annually, the Colloquium participants consist of 30 graduate students, early career scientists, and faculty.  National Science Foundation Scholarships are provided for 10 students, early-career scientists, and faculty from Minority Serving Institutions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colloquium participants are addressed by agency leaders, policy makers, journalists, and government leaders in the legislative and executive branches. The unique set of instructors in the Colloquium typically has interdisciplinary backgrounds in science, policy, and law.  The attendees are provided instruction to allow development of skills and techniques for communicating science to policymakers and the public in ways that encourage information sharing and collaboration. Additionally, through instruction, examples, and exercises, attendees learn the legislative process and the roles of science information in support of policy.  As a result, the national dialogue among scientists, policymakers, and the public will become more efficient, clear, and solution-oriented.  This benefits support of  national policy with respect to increased understanding and management of natural resources critical to food, water, energy, resilience to hazards, and environmental protection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The American Meteorological Society (AMS) Summer Policy Colloquium 2015-2017; Washington, DC  OUTCOMES  INTELLECTUAL MERIT  Each year, early in June, the American Meteorological Society runs a Summer Policy Colloquium. The ten-day experience provides 25-40 early-career scientists and engineers a structured, broadly-based dialog with: (1) policy-level scientist-leaders from both the legislative and executive branches; (2) executives from the private sector and non-governmental organizations; and (3) policy analysts, science journalists, and other actors in the policy arena. Colloquium participants are given pre-assigned reading and work through group exercises and case studies. Through these and other means they develop a new grasp of and appreciation for the way the national policy discussion shapes science, and the way science and scientists contribute to policy formulation. Colloquium participants take important first steps toward becoming as disciplined in their approach to the policy process as they are with respect to their own scientific research.  More than 570 participants &ndash; most funded by their respective host institutions &ndash; have completed the program to date. Over the years, the National Science Foundation has provided support for Colloquium participation by over 200 graduate students (and 20 HBCU or MSI faculty) selected by means of a national competitive process on the basis of their intellectual achievements and their potential for leadership.  The impact isn't confined to the participants. Over the same period, hundreds of speakers &ndash; practitioners at the nexus of science and policy &ndash; have met with Colloquium participants. Through their preparation and their engagement with participants, Colloquium speakers for their part sharpen their practical appreciation for how the geosciences contribute to their policy formulation and sustain national science and innovation.   BROADER IMPACTS  At the same time the AMS Summer Policy Colloquium helps individual scientists develop leadership skills, it builds leadership capacity across the larger geosciences community. Participants learn best practices with respect to allocating and managing resources for science and developing options for policymakers. The Colloquium experience helps them work effectively with policymakers to infuse scientific understanding into policy formulation and the national agenda. Participants hone a range of communication skills &ndash; especially their ability to listen to and respond to the needs of other scientists, policymakers, users of science and science-based services, and the general public. They become familiar with the special ethical challenges confronting scientist-leaders. They learn from journalists and policymakers how to communicate in ways that encourage information sharing and collaboration rather than confrontation and divisiveness. They build their understanding of the broader implications of their science for national security and geopolitical stability. Colloquium participants learn directly, from policy makers at the highest levels of government, in both the executive and legislative branches, and from leaders of private enterprise and NGO?s, rather than secondhand through academics. Most (though not all) of the Colloquium panelists and discussion leaders have themselves been educated as scientists. By sharing their experiences, they help Colloquium participants to spot and avoid pitfalls that often trip up novices in the policy arena.  The Colloquium experience itself isn?t self-contained. It equips participants with tools, habits, and motivation they need for lifelong learning. The Colloquium is also a portal for scientists seeking to contribute to society. As they put their knowledge into practice, Colloquium alumni help the nation become increasingly more effective in addressing aspects of the national agenda that are directly or indirectly dependent on the geosciences:natural resources, including but not limited to food, water, and energy; resilience to hazards at local and national levels; and maintaining and improving ecosystem services. By building trust and understanding with political leaders and the public, scientists over time will grow more effective in working with these partners to foster economic growth, reduce losses due to natural hazards, and foster cleaner air, water, and soil, as well as a more peaceable world.  These are critical issues not just for the United States but also for all nations and peoples. Building understanding of these challenges within the scientific community will help the United States maintain and even augment its status as the indispensable nation deep into the 21st century.  Over the seventeen-year life of the Colloquium, alumni have continued to grow professionally, assume more management responsibility, and rise within their respective organizations. Some have assumed major leadership roles in national research laboratories. Others have served and continue to serve in the White House in federal agencies, and on Capitol Hill, working for both political parties. Still others have risen through the ranks of their respective corporations or research universities.  They?re nearly unanimous in reporting the experience as "inspiring."  NSF?s investment in this program is producing national benefits that continue to grow with time.          Last Modified: 07/27/2017       Submitted by: William H Hooke]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
