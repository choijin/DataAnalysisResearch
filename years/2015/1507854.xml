<AbstractNarration>Insects and crustaceans represent critical, dominant animal groups (by biomass and species number) in terrestrial and aquatic systems, respectively. Insects and crustaceans were historically grouped under separate taxonomic classes under the Phylum Arthropoda, and for many years it was thought that myriapods might be the closest relatives to insects. New genetic data have made it clear that insects and other hexapods are nested within the crustaceans within the arthropod tree as a clade termed the Pancrustacea. This new evolutionary understanding provides the intellectual motivation to initiate a new focus in evolutionary physiology aimed at understanding commonalities and evolutionary trends in the Pancrustacea. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This award will support a new type of symposium designed to promote synthetic collaborations across taxa and disciplines at the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology meeting at West Palm Beach, Florida, January 2015.  In this symposium, researchers who work primarily on insects or crustaceans will work together on both their talks and manuscripts. In addition, each researcher will address a common set of focal, integrative questions in their talks and manuscripts. Audience participation will be a focus of the symposium and a post-seminar workshop.  Some participants, including the trainees, may even contribute to the manuscripts as a result of their participation. This explicitly integrative approach to a symposium is novel at SICB and will hopefully galvanize further innovations that promote interdisciplinary synthesis. In addition, this award will support mentoring and scientific development of a large number of diverse junior investigators and trainees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In light of recent understanding of the evolutionary relationship between crustaceans and insects, we organized a symposium for the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) that provided a comparative research venue for  insect and crustacean physiologists.  In organizing "Breaking Boundaries for Evolutionary Synthesis: An Interactive and Integrative Symposium Linking Insects with Crustaceans", we purposely paired speakers in areas of insect and crustacean physiology who could synthesize their area of research and integrate their findings through collaborative manuscripts. Our major goals of this Symposium were 1) to integrate crustacean and insect physiologists in the symposium, 2) generate thoughtful discussions during the symposium  3) hold a workshop to critically evaluate the state of knowledge in the separate fields of arthropod physiology and identify strategies to improve our understanding of this interesting and economically important group of organisms and 4) broaden participation within SICB and contribute to the training of junior faculty and graduate students.  Outcomes:  1) We paired insect and crustacean physiologists to discuss recent advances in specific field of physiology including respiratory physiology, osmoregulation, development and regeneration, endocrinology, and molting. One of the important outcomes of this pairing resulted in the submission of a total of eleven manuscripts with eight of the symposium participants collaborating on four of the manuscripts.  All of these manuscripts were peer reviewed and published in the Journal if Integrative and Comparative Biology in 2015.  2) We structured the symposium such that speakers would have only 20 of the 30 minutes designated for their research presentation, which allowed for a greater degree of audience participation through longer discussions.  In other suymposia, speakers utilize most of the 30 minutes alloted to them for their presentation, leaving time for only one or two questions.  We purposely wanted ten minutes of discussion time to increase participation of the audience.  One of the outcomes from this symposium format was a more meaningful discussion; questions that were raised by an audience member were discussed by the speaker as well as other members of the audience.  3) We held a 3-hour workshop at the end of the SICB meeting which was well attended with 36 meeting participants. Through breakout sessions and round table discussions, we identified the most important obstacle in furthering crustacean research such that we could better compare insect and crustacean sytems.  The outcome of this workshop was a manuscript coauthored by Hui and Mykles that identified a model crustacean organism (the cherry shrimp; Neocaradina denticulata) to advance the understanding of crustacean developmental biology.    4)  We included a complementary session with eight speakers in addition to the 11 speakers of the symposium.  The inclusion of a broad academic range of speakers in the symposium and the complementary session provided a mechanism to engage graduate students, post-doctoral students, and professors (junior and senior) in scientific discussions. An outcome of this funded proposal was that we were able to fund four graduate students (one of which was a symposium speaker), two post-doctoral researchers (both speakers in the symposium) and many faculty members at various stages of their careers.  We were able to bring together speakers from the USA, Canada, Israel, Sweeden, China, and Germany in the symposium which truly emphasized the international appeal of this area of comparative study.
