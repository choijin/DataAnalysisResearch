<AbstractNarration>1055889&lt;br/&gt;Yao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this proposal is to investigate stimulus-evoked intrinsic optical signals (IOSs) associated with photoreceptor and post-photoreceptor neural responses in the complex retinal neural network. This project will start with investigating fast IOSs in frog retinal slices. A retinal slice preparation exposes a cross-section of the retinal layers, and thus allow simultaneous recording of fast IOSs from the photoreceptors and post-photoreceptor neurons, with feasibility of concurrent electrophysiological recording of targeted retinal cells. This phase will test two hypotheses: 1) Fast IOSs correlated with early photoreceptor activities to light stimulation occurs immediately after the stimulus delivery; while fast IOSs associated with second- and third-order post-photoreceptor neurons may have a time delay relative to the stimulus. 2) Fast IOSs can be used to image oscillatory and spike neural activities generated by post-photoreceptor neurons. The second phase of this project is to explore simultaneous optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of photoreceptors and post-photoreceptor responses in the intact eye. In order to achieve this objective, an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) based optical coherence tomography (OCT) is proposed for pursuing vibration- and inertia-free optical dissection of retinal neural activities.</AbstractNarration>

As shown in Fig. 1, both 2-month and 1-year-old mice were measured. In 2-month-old mutant mice, time course and peak value of the stimulus-evoked IOS were significantly delayed (relative to stimulus onset) and reduced, respectively, compared to age matched WT mice. In 1-year-old mutant mice, stimulus-evoked IOS was totally absent.

However, the physiological source of ROS movement is still not well understood. In this study, concurrent near-infrared imaging of TRP and electroretinogram (ERG) measurement of retinal electrophysiology revealed that ROS movement occurs before the onset of the ERG a-wave, which is known to reflect the hyperpolarization of retinal photoreceptors (Fig. 2). Moreover, substitution of normal superfusing medium with low-sodium medium reversibly blocked the photoreceptor ERG a-wave, but largely preserved the stimulus-evoked ROS movements.

In order to investigate the physiological mechanism of confocal-IOS, comparative in vivo IOS and ERG measurements were conducted using normal frog eyes activated by variable intensity stimuli. A dynamic spatiotemporal filtering algorithm was developed to reject the contamination of hemodynamic changes on fast IOS recording. Laser-injured frog eyes were employed to test the potential of confocal-IOS mapping of localized retinal dysfunctions.

Transient IOSs, which might reflect an early stage of light phototransduction, are consistently observed in the photoreceptor outer segment almost immediately (&lt;1 ms) after retinal stimulation (Fig. 4).
