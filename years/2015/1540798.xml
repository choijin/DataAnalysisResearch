<AbstractNarration>The FASEB Summer Research Conference on Genetic Recombination and Chromosome Rearrangements will be held at Steamboat Springs, Colorado on July 19-24, 2015. This is the sixteenth in a series of bi-annual conferences devoted to promoting cross-disciplinary discussion at the leading edge of research on DNA recombination. The 2015 meeting features an increased emphasis on quantitative approaches that bring new understanding to various areas comprising genetic recombination; for example, high-throughput sequencing and copy number variation analysis to study genome rearrangements globally within organisms and across populations; mass spectrometry-based methods that globally assess protein and DNA marks; single molecule approaches to recombination biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this conference is to bring together researchers from around the world who work in recombination and the related field of genomic rearrangements, and to give young and starting investigators the opportunity to present and discuss their work. The format of the meeting involves talks from invited speakers who are leaders in the field, speakers chosen from submitted abstracts, and poster sessions. For 2015, there are 47 invited speakers, 43% of whom are women (as are 5 of 8 session chairs) and 30% of whom are new to the conference. The number of program slots to be filled from submitted abstracts has been increased significantly (to 24%) with the goal of increasing participation opportunities and visibility for underrepresented groups and young scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funds will be used for fellowships to help defray travel and meeting costs for 8 junior scientists. The organizers will prioritize support for underrepresented groups and preferentially graduate students and post-doctoral fellows with NSF funds.</AbstractNarration>
