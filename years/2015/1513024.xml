<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project is a research-based effort to make calculus conceptually accessible to more students while simultaneously increasing the coherence, rigor, and applicability of the content students are learning. Its intellectual merit rests on an ongoing program of research from which the principal investigators have conceptualized a framework for learning and teaching calculus that builds on students' intuitive reasoning about approximations and error analyses. Combining this framework with a constructivist approach, the project team is refining and disseminating lab activities that address the content of a standard course sequence in differential, integral, and multivariable calculus with supporting materials and interactive technology for students. The project is exercising broader impact through its efforts to help develop a community of practice around these ideas through a set of efforts that includes: conducting summer workshops, holding weekly video-conferences, and making available classroom video and instructor notes to support faculty professional development for implementation of the labs. Finally, a research and evaluation component is assessing the impact of the lab activities on student conceptual development of the central ideas in calculus through the use of two quantitative measures: i) a Calculus Concept Assessment (CCA) to measure shifts in students' understanding of the central concepts of calculus and ii) a Limit Models Assessment (LMA) to measure shifts in the cognitive models employed by students while reasoning with these calculus concepts. The project is further adding to the knowledge base of STEM education by studying the effectiveness of its faculty development efforts through an analysis of pilot instructors' exams using an Exam Characterization Framework (ECF) and the continuous collection of detailed feedback on all components of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  Project CLEAR Calculus is a research-based effort to make calculus conceptually accessible to more students while simultaneously increasing the coherence, rigor, and applicability of the content learned in the courses.  Curriculum Objective: Project CLEAR Calculus developed, tested, and refined 38 labs meeting specific design criteria for accessibility, coherence, rigor, and applicability spanning the content of a standard introductory sequence in differential, integral, and multi-variable calculus with supporting materials and interactive technology for students.  Faculty Development Objective: Project CLEAR Calculus refined and piloted faculty development in the form of summer workshops, weekly videoconferences, classroom video, instructor notes, and interactive computer animations to support successful implementation of the labs.  Research and Evaluation Objective: Project CLEAR Calculus assessed the impact of the labs on student conceptual development of the central ideas in calculus and the nature of support required to enable instructors to effectively incorporate CLEAR Calculus labs into their calculus courses.  All labs created for CLEAR Calculus are freeley available on the project website, https://clearcalculus.okstate.edu. Instructors can sign up for accounts that provide access to all instructor support materials.  Design Criteria  The following seven design criteria guided the development of all Project CLEAR Calculus materials:  Language, notation, and constructs used in the labs should be conceptually accessible to introductory calculus students.   The structure of students? activity should reflect rigorous limit definitions and arguments without the language and symbolism of formal &epsilon;-&delta; and &epsilon;-N notation that is a barrier to most calculus students? understanding.   The labs should present a coherent approach across all concepts defined in terms of limits and effectively support students? exploration into these concepts.   The central quantities and relationships developed in all labs should be coherent across representational systems (especially contextual, graphical, algebraic, and numerical representations).   All labs should foster quantitative reasoning and modeling skills required for STEM fields.   The sequence of labs should establish a strong conceptual foundation for subsequent rigorous development of real analysis.   All labs should be implemented following instructional techniques based on a constructivist theory of concept development.   Research and Evaluation  Project CLEAR Calculus is using three primary instruments to asses the impact on student learning and instructor assessment.  The Limit Models Assessment (LMA) provided quantitative comparisons of the cognitive models employed by students in courses using CLEAR Calculus materials with other calculus students and enables us to monitor long term shifts in students? models. We developed the LMA following Model Analysis Theory from physics education research drawing an analogy from quantum mechanics to model the structure of student thinking as a mixture of previously identified cognitive models with varying probabilities of being activated (Bao &amp; Reddish, 2001). Our prior research resulted in detailed characterizations and indicators of students? conceptual models for limits as applied throughout calculus, which served as the qualitative foundation for the LMA. Our research showed a significant and sizable shift toward using approximation models when students reasoned about limits. Simultaneously students became less likely to use surface level language about approximation without the appropriate conceptual structure.  The Calculus Concepts Assessment (CCA) is used to measure shifts in students? understanding of the central concepts of calculus. From Calculus 1 to Calculus 2, students in CLEAR Calculus courses developed a 29% normalized gain compared to 20% for students in other courses. We also  correlated students? gains with the predominance of approximation models as assessed by the post-course LMA and found that the development of approximation models was related to conceptual gains.  The Exam Characterization Framework (ECF) was created from a national MAA study of calculus courses (Tallman &amp; Carlson, 2012) and characterizes exams according to 3 dimensions: item orientation, item representation, and item format. Each dimension is broken down into several categories/levels. For example, for item orientation, exam items could require students to engage in a low level cognitive activity such as recall a definition or apply a procedure or exam items might require students to engage in a higher level activity such as applying their understanding to a contextual problem or relating different concepts together. Prior to implementing CLEAR Calculus labs in their classes, their exams resembled thenational averages in requiring conceptual understanding, using multiplerepresentations, and requiring explanations. While piloting the CLEAR Calculus materials, pilot instructors averaged a 270% increase in the proportion of exam questions requiring conceptual understanding, 162% increase in use of representations other than symbolic, and 346% increase in items requiring explanations. Half of the instructors also asked more questions involving openended responses. These shifts were large enough that many of the pilot instructor?s exams while using the labs would have constituted outliers in each category among the random national sample.
