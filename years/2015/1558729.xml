<AbstractNarration>At present, some simple "elementary" systems start to be reasonably well understood. However, passing from the understanding of microscopic objects to moderately complex configurations remains a challenging problem. This projects aims at understanding simple but basic questions for slightly complicated systems, focusing on situations and models related to macroscopic plasma physics.  A plasma is a collection of many charged particles that, because of their long range interactions exhibit a collective macroscopic behavior which is complex and remains poorly understood. This in turns limits some potential major applications, controlled fusion being perhaps the most well-known. Thus, furthering the understanding of this "small scale to large scale" cascade of information can have major possible applications. The emphasis of this proposal is on large-time questions such as "can a plasma macroscopically at rest spontaneously develop dramatic behavior such as high concentration or velocities, or spontaneously form a vacuum?". Another related question is to find possible scenarios for the large-time behavior of a plasma that remains away from the quiet neutral equilibrium. Investigating these questions involve a fine study of the deep mechanisms of transfer of energy inside different parts of the plasma as a result of collective elementary simple interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This projects aims at developing the study of two fundamental equations from physics. First we consider stability issues for the 2-fluid Euler-Maxwell equation in two dimensions. This is a fundamental equation modeling the dynamical properties of a plasma. The goal is to prove that under certain conditions, small perturbations of an equilibrium will not develop shocks and that actually, the plasma will get back to equilibrium, even in the absence of dissipation. Such a result would be of great physical and mathematical importance as it is known to be false for the compressible Euler equation in the absence of a self-consistent electromagnetic field. In a second part, we study the Schroedinger equation on a curved background.  This equation is a universal model appearing in many time reversible equations, notably in some plasma models. When this equation is posed on a nonconstant background, many classical tools from the Euclidian theory break down and one expects the appearance of various new phenomena due to the influence of the geometry. We study in particular the effect of the growth of the volume on the global behavior of the solutions and on the possibility to obtain asymptotic dynamics different from scattering. A unifying theme is to understand the asymptotic dynamics of solutions in a context where the dispersion is limited. Another unifying theme is to try to find simpler limit equations and understand their significance for the full model. A last unifying theme concerns the specificity and relevance of dispersive systems. Some tools we plan to use and develop are concentration compactness methods, study of the space and time resonances, study of dispersive systems and pseudo-products estimates with singular multipliers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main purpose of the project was to understand the behavior of certain solutions describing ``dispersive phenomena''. Roughly speaking the question asked was ``what happens when there is a small change in a system at rest (in the cases under study e.g. a plasma or a wave in water when one considers both gravity and capillary forces)''.  One of the main findings can be described as follows: if a still ocean (infinite three dimensional body of incompressible irrotational inviscid water separated from air -an inert fluid- by a flat interface) under the influence of gravity and surface tension is subjected to a small change (either in the elevation of water or in its velocity), the system will slowly revert back to the equilibrium, with some small ripples decaying more slowly than the rest of the perturbation.  The project developped a methodology to describe the solutions in a wide variety of situations when ``no dramatic change occurs'' (which in the cases considered is also a finding of the works involved), but when the solution can not be simply expressed as a solution to the linearized problem (which has been the standard method for over a century: to describe small changes by ``order one quantities''), and nonlinear effects have to be accounted for. More precisely, the project studied cases when the norm in which one can obtain some form of stability has to incorporate information from the quadratic terms (the effect of the ``space-time resonances'', i.e. of interactions of waves which have resonant modulations and travel at similar velocities). This leads to dramatic changes in some of the Fourier support of the solutions. The techniques developped proved to be robust and flexible, applying to a large variety of quasilinear problems that had previously been outside the reach of known methods and the PI (and collaborator) is currently adapting them to problems in general relativity, with the hope of obtaining results on stability of the Minkowski space (roughly speaking an empty universe) in the presence of matter fields. Another approach was to develop possible scenarios when solutions do become singular in large time (i.e. when small changes lead to large differences in large time), at least on a model problem (in this case the nonlinear Schroedinger equation on wave-guide geometries). The novelty is to understand how some (dispersive, time-reversible, nonlinear) mechanisms can be mild enough to lead to global existence of the solutions, but strong enough to lead to solutions increasing unboundedly. This informs on possible alternative scenarios to the cases considered in the previous paragraphs. The project led to the completion of five papers, some over 100 pages long and two other still under preparation. The results were widely disseminated in international conferences, many of the works were done in collaboration with graduate students and/or postdocs.
