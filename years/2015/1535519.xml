<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the theoretical study of an electrical discharge phenomenon, called multipactor, that occurs in a broad range of microwave devices. Multipactor is a pernicious electrical discharge that can damage or destroy accelerator structures and microwave components and related electronics, such as antennas, satellite payloads, or radar systems. Despite decades of study, especially in connection with rf systems for particle accelerators, it remains a problem, and no consistent way has been found to eliminate it.  The improved understanding anticipated from this work will enable more compact and higher-gradient particle accelerators. Many accelerator applications stand to benefit from this, such as compact medical accelerators, accelerator-based neutron and light sources used for basic research, and accelerator-based nuclear energy generation and transmutation of nuclear waste. Space and satellite communications will further benefit from this study. The grant will support one graduate student, and will contribute to the literature, course material, and further educational outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to analyze multipactor in multicarrier systems using a novel multipactor theory based on techniques from nonlinear dynamics and chaos. Multipactor in the presence of multiple carrier rf signals (i.e. multiple rf frequencies) is an especially challenging problem that has almost no theoretical studies. The new approach aims to identify multipacting region boundaries and stability by globally analyzing the structure of dynamical space. The theoretical results will be tested against computer simulations using a particle-in-cell code, and against experiments conducted by our collaborators at ValSpace Consortium in Valencia, Spain.</AbstractNarration>

Kishek, University of Maryland, College Park</em></p> <p>Finding directions using a GPS system, or watching television, we are daily relying on a network of satellites that serve our communication needs. Additional satellites serve our defense needs, survey the Earth, or perform space-based science. All these systems require the transmission of radiofrequency (rf) signals back to Earth. As satellite communication systems operate at increasingly higher powers, engineers are encountering a problem that has long been known to accelerator physicists, who routinely use rf waves in vacuum to accelerate particles. Multipactor is an electron avalanche that can take place when rf waves travel in a vacuum. Stray electrons are trapped and accelerated by the rf, hitting walls and ejecting other electrons. The rapid multiplication in the number of electrons ultimately creates noise, heat and possibly damage to devices. First discovered in the 1920s by Philo Farnsworth, the inventor of television, multipactor has been around so long precisely because it is a difficult problem to solve.</p> <p>Conventional theory is based on tracking trajectories of electrons in the vacuum, and imposing boundary conditions to find the rf power levels for the avalanche to occur. This procedure implicitly assumes trajectories that are compatible with a certain resonance, for example, transit time across a gap equal to half an rf period. The challenge is that there is an enormous variety of different resonant modes, and non-resonant modes as well. To identify the power limits of one or even several modes is far from sufficient to exclude the possibility of multipactor.</p> <p>From the support of this grant, we have developed a new and comprehensive theoretical approach to predict multipactor based on principles from the well-established fields of nonlinear dynamics and chaos-theory. The new theory quickly scans large areas of parameter space without any prior assumptions as to the type of multipactor. We developed the theory for a wide range of systems (i.e., parallel-plate, coaxial, multicarrier) and verified it with high-fidelity particle-in-cell simulations, modern-day industrial design standards, and published experimental data (Fig. 1). These results are summarized in six refereed journal publications [1-6]. The findings from this research revolutionize our current understanding of multipactor dynamics and provide insight on effective suppression strategies.
