<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical: This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to the University of Akron aims at discovering systematic method for controllably tethering bioactive peptides to novel polymer scaffolds for use in regenerative medicine applications. This award is also co-funded by the Biomedical Engineering program in CBET/ENG. If successful, this work will optimize peptide concentrations that enhance cell proliferation and accelerate stem cell differentiation.  This knowledge would help guide the rational design of future peptide-functionalized polymer surfaces, scaffolds and hydrogels used by the wider tissue engineering community. The biological measurements will drive the design of advanced bioactive and biomimetic materials for use in many applications where synthetic materials contact biological systems.  The research team is involved in the educational training components of the project. The effort will provide advanced, multidisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students, orthopedic surgery residents, and high school students in areas of molecular and cell biology, chemistry and polymer science.  The outcomes from the research are being directly incorporated into graduate level and undergraduate courses being taught by Professor Becker.  Undergraduate students from the University of Akron, and summer interns enrolled in the research experiences for undergraduates (REU) program will participate extensively. The research team's outreach activities include mentoring and provide educational and research experience for students from local high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research and the Biomedical Engineering program in CBET/ENG to the University of Akron aims at discovering a systematic method for controllably tethering multiple bioactive peptides to novel poly(ester urea) scaffolds post-3D printing for use in regenerative medicine applications.  The biomaterials community clearly understands that the molecular presentation and spatial distribution of peptides and growth factors can dramatically influence many important aspects of cell behavior. This award aims to translate previously discovered GRGDS and BMP-2 peptide concentrations to translationally-relevant degradable poly(ester urea) constructs in two-dimensional thin films and three-dimensional printed scaffolds.  The project will impact several fields of biomaterials including (1) developing new methods for functionalization of degradable polymer scaffolds with bioactive peptides post 3D printing and  (2) new methods for characterizing surface concentrations of these peptides and (3) identification of synergistic peptide concentrations that influence hMSC cell proliferation, lineage commitment, and differentiation.  The project offers multiple opportunities for the educational training of students (both undergraduate and graduate) and medical residents in advanced polymer science, state of the art chemical functionalization and translationally-relevant strategies for advanced manufacturing of 3D scaffolds.  These skills will be critical to public and private entities aiming to move 3D printed scaffolds into mainstream device and regenerative medicine applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The biomaterials community understands that the molecular presentation and spatial distribution of peptides and growth factors can dramatically influence many important aspects of cell behavior. Our original aims to translate previously identified BMP-2 peptide concentrations to degradable poly(ester urea) (PEU) constructs in three dimensional printed scaffolds to enhance bioactivity and stem cell differentiation were realized.    During the course of this proposal, we demonstrated that 3D printed PEUscaffolds surface functionalized with osteogenic growth peptide (OGP) or bone morphogenic-2 peptide (BMP-2 peptide) drive the up-regulation of hMSCs osteogenic differentiation. The propargyl handle survives filament generation and the 3D printing process, which facilitated the tethering of multiple species post FDM 3D printing. In vitro hMSCs differentiation analyzed by real time RT-PCR, IHC staining, ALP activity assays, and alizarin red staining reveal that both OGP and BMP-2 promote the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs.  As an extension of this proposal, we applied the functionalized scaffolds in a clinically relevant in vivo rat cranial critical size defect study.  These data and findings are being formulated into a NIH proposal for segmental bone defect repair in a canine model.  Broader Impacts: The demonstration that the propargyl groups (post-printing reactive handle) survives the thermal printing process was a significant finding.  Our demonstration that bioactive peptide sequences can be tethered reliably to the PEU scaffolds post printing and remain bioavailable and bioactive opens a window to a number of other hypothesis driven investigations across a number of unmet medical needs.  Enabling the effective and concentration specific use of tethered bioactive peptides as opposed to adsorbed full length recombinant proteins is a translationally relevant approach to enhancing bioactivity.  In addition to the publications and dissertations cited below, the outcomes were included in sophomore level "Biomaterials" course taught in Biomedical Engineering and the popular "Polymeric Biomaterials" graduate course, which was developed by Professor Becker.  The project offered excellent opportunities for the educational training of students (high school, undergraduate and graduate) and medical residents in advanced polymer science, state of the art chemical functionalization, characterization strategies and translationally-relevant approaches for additive manufacturing of 3D scaffolds.  These skills are critical to public and private entities aiming to move 3D printed scaffolds into mainstream medical device and regenerative medicine applications.          The findings in this proposal led to the founding of 21st Century Medical Technologies, a medical materials company.  21MedTech, now known as Viamer Biosciences, has licensed the family of PEU polymers described in the original proposal.  Significantly, Viamer Biosciences is advancing its first two products toward FDA 510K filings for a degradable orthopaedic pin (November 2020) and a bone hemostatic agent (December 2020) designed to arrest bleeding in orthopaedic surgery.  Additionally, success in the preclinical model led to explorations of PEU as a delivery matrix for non-opioid analgesics designed to suppress post-surgical pain.  This work received a $2M award from the Ohio Department of Development and more recently received a Notice of Award from the NIH on a follow on Direct to Phase II SBIR award on post-surgical pain management.  The preliminary data acquired in this NSF proposal was critical to support investor confidence in the PEU materials and led to raising $11M to develop the materials for clinically relevant applications.   This project has partially supported five graduate students and six undergraduates over the life of the award.  As a result, we have published 4 dissertations, 13 peer-reviewed papers with several additional manuscripts currently under review or in preparation.  The results of the work have been presented more than thirty times at national and international meetings by Dr. Becker and his graduate students, Gina Policastro, Jiayi Yu, Shan Li, Natasha Brigham and Vrushali Baghat and undergraduates Morgan Waggoner, Lindsay Robinson, Nancy Le, Laura Saraviau and Karen Domino.
