<AbstractNarration>1510314(Bigelow)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides first-year and senior engineering students meaningful design experiences that will directly improve independence and quality of life for individuals with disabilities. Teams will design assistive devices that address everyday needs. These design experiences will be driven by needs identified by the occupational therapy staff at Kettering Health Network's NeuroRehab and Balance Center, an outpatient rehabilitation center that treats individuals with neurological disorders. Fully functional prototypes will be designed and tested to ensure usefulness. These designs may evolve to impact even more potential users as students are taught how to determine when universal design approaches versus individualized orphan/assistive device design approaches are appropriate. Throughout the project first-year and senior students will be brought together for shared learning and supporting activities, enabling opportunities for mentoring and community building. The grant efforts also include the development of curriculum modules that will help students understand how to make engineering design decisions based on disability-related considerations, as well as the advantages of designing in a team where diversity of thought and experience is present. The outcomes of this grant will be disseminated broadly through professional society workshops and publications so that other instructors nationwide can adopt similar educational approaches that incorporate a focus on assistive device designs.  The students engaged in these efforts will also assist in designing hands-on assistive device design challenges that will be used to inspire K-12 students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant leverages an existing and successful partnership between the University of Dayton (UD) and Kettering Health Network (KHN) to enhance undergraduate design education at both the first-year and senior capstone level. In this three year project, students will work in small teams in established UD courses to design assistive devices that meet the needs of local individuals affected by neurological disease. Occupational therapists from KHN's NeuroRehab and Balance Center will identify these needs and serve as sponsors of the project, overseeing student teams. The objectives of this grant are to: 1) Provide meaningful, real-world engineering problems in a project-based learning environment that allow participating students to gain a greater understanding of: the engineering design and innovation process as a framework for systematically approaching engineering design problems; the importance of purposeful and regular interactions between designer, client (sponsor), and user moving from identified need to functional, tested prototype; how to make engineering design decisions based on disability-related considerations; and the advantages of designing in a team where diversity of thought and experience is present. 2) Develop and disseminate undergraduate educational materials and other curricular elements to train students to: understand and appreciate disability as a continuum of functional loss; determine when to utilize universal design approaches vs. assistive device/orphan technology approaches; develop and ask clarifying questions to assess patient need and functional abilities; make engineering design decisions based on disability-related considerations; and consider issues of manufacturing and marketing in advancing assistive device designs. 3) Improve quality of life for at least 9 patients with neurologic disease and disability annually, for each of the 3 years, through the development of clinician-driven assistive device design. This grant builds off demonstrated strengths and prior successes to enhance undergraduate engineering education, while directly improving the lives of individuals with neurological diseases. It has long been proposed that rehabilitative-type engineering design projects appeal to students traditionally underrepresented in engineering. This project will offer the unique opportunity to explore this, longitudinally, in an existing all-female Engineering Innovation class. It is envisioned that seeing how engineering can improve an individual's life through project-based learning will be a transformative engineering design experience that increases the likelihood of persistence in the field, especially for underrepresented minorities. Findings of this work and developed curricular resources will be disseminated broadly to provide others a framework for similar partnerships that bring real-world needs to engineering courses. Additionally, an educational outreach component will engage college students to inspire area K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the three year period of this grant, 211 University of Dayton undergraduate engineering students directly participated in meaningful design projects to assist individuals with disabilities in completing everyday tasks.  The students, enrolled in either a first-year design course or senior capstone course, worked in teams under the mentorship of engineering faculty and area occupational therapists to design a total of 48 assistive devices. Senior students also had the opportunity for sustained interactions and iterative testing with the individuals with disabilities whom they were designing for. This experience was found to be both motivating and critically important to the design process. First year student interactions were more limited but still enabled students to better explore and understand disability and disability-related considerations within design. Though not all of 48 devices developed were found to be effective enough to meet client needs at completion of the course, many of the products were successful and deliverable.  Examples of successful products designed by senior students include:  Portable Pediatric Arm Supports to enable increased elbow and shoulder range of motion for a young child Showering Devices that assisted independence in lathering and rinsing shampoo from hair of a young adult Modified Golf Club to enable an older adult with motor control deficits to continue his hobby Portable Light Box to enable a child with visual impairments to practice self-feeding Modified Splint for Writing to enable legible writing for critical activities such as writing checks as well as pursuit of drawing and painting as a hobby for an older adult with tremors and poor dexterity 3D Printed Wrist Orthotic with Tensioned Finger Control to enable a young adult with hemiparesis to open and close hand, grasping items Multi-Sensory Cause and Effect Unit for adults with cognitive impairment to practice causational relationships such as flipping a light switch to illuminate a light   The senior projects were more complex and had the potential for more significant impact on quality of life of the individuals they were working with. Significantly, the successful products developed by the senior students enabled two children to self-feed for the first time, and a young adult to shower independently for the first time. Such experiences helped to highlight the dual benefit of the experiences enabled by this grant - not only was independence increased for the individual with the disability but students reported in their reflections how personally motivating these experiences were.  Examples of successful products that first-year engineering students completed in their introductory Engineering Innovation course include:  Adapted Writing Easels for preschool children needing accomodations due to limited wrist extension and flexion range of motion (In)Stability Stool for preschool children who need to work on their trunk control and balance  Earring Helper to help an adult with poor dexterity insert her own earrings and secure the earring back Adjustable Hair Drying Stand to assist a young adult with limited use of one arm blow dry and brush her hair independently Multisensory Desktop Stimuli to provide various visual and tactile sensory inputs to a child with autism spectrum disorders   While not proposed in the original grant, after seeing the benefits of this project, another instructor began to incorporate assistive device design projects into a sophomore level Introduction to Biomechanics course. This engaged another approximately 50 students in meaningful design by advancing promising first-year student projects that were not sufficiently refined from the previous year. This helped to increase the impact of the grant, contribute to successful delivery of the original first-year design projects and grow the focus of engineering design across the curriculum.  In the final year of the grant, University of Dayton students working on the grant-related projects and their peers were invited to participate in a Go Baby Go event for other families at the agency who had not yet been able to benefit afforded by the grant. Approximately 40 students helped to prepare modified powered vehicles for 10 children, increasing the broader impacts of this grant for both university students and families of those with disabilities in the community.  The principal investigator disseminated best practices and lessons learned about engaging undergraduate students in partnership with clinicians on assistive device projects through a keynote address at a national workshop on broadening participation of individuals with disabilities and a conference presentation. Supporting curriculum developed during this grant was also made available through the publically-available American Society of Biomechanics Teaching Repository. A manuscript detailing some of the work is currently in-review and student work and several designed products that were outcomes of the grant were highlighted at a national capstone design conference, as well as during a televised segment.  Additional activities related to the grant included peer mentoring between first-year and senior students, the development of a new module for a high school women in engineering camp, and various outreach activities.
