<AbstractNarration>The growth of digital data, along with new social and business practices, raises new research questions about data security and privacy, knowledge production and intellectual property. Increasing digitization has altered the fundamental cost of collecting and retaining and distributing personal information. The research community has begun to examine the impact of rules, policies and institutions that govern the economic incentives to create, store, and use digital information.  New frameworks are required to provide policy relevant analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NBER Digitization Project, launched in 2010, is building the foundations for an economics oriented research community that examines the causes and consequences of digitization. &lt;br/&gt;This project supports a graduate student conference to promote the development and diffusion of economic research analyzing the effects of the rise of digital technology on the behavior of firms and households. The project fosters growth of a research community to examine the potential impact of regulation and other government initiatives on the incentives to produce and distribute digital content.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant enabled the NBER digitization program to hold a tutorial for graduate students on two days before a major academic conference on the economics of digital markets (in March 2016). Our grant proposal aspired to:  Attract thirty elite      economic graduate students to do research on the topic (up from a goal of      twenty the previous year).  Expose students to this      important research area, when they are choosing dissertation topics.  Provide visible "role      models" in their immediate environment, who pursue related topics.    The digitization program advertised across a wide network of researchers, and succeeded in the following dimensions of the goals:  Held the events on March 2nd and 3rd at Stanford SIEPR facilities.  Attracted 50 elite graduate students from 20      universities.  Most students came from economics programs, and      a group came from business or policy programs with analytical focus.      Eighteen (approximately one third) of the students were women.  There was stronger interest than anticipated.      The program had to turn down 5 applicants due to lack of funds and issues      with "fit." Generally, these students were in their first year of graduate      school.  The tutorial had four presentations by Avi      Goldfarb, Joel Waldfogel, Catherine Tucker, and Jonathan Levin.  After the tutorial, the program sent out a      survey and had a 98% response rate (49 out of 50). The participants      generally liked the choice of presenters, and liked being exposed to      frontier work that they normally would not see in their graduate program.      In this sense, the tutorial succeeded in providing visible role models.   More information on the tutorial is available at: (http://conference.nber.org/confer/2016/DTs16/DTs16prg.html).
