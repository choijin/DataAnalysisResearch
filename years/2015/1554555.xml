<AbstractNarration>Abstract - Albert - 1554555&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the next generation of technologies are ones aimed at designing medical diagnostic devices that are more accurate and portable; electronic devices that are faster, smaller, and capable of storing more information; and energy sources that are cleaner without sacrificing capacity or power. Polymers with tunable nano- and micro-structured morphologies can address the challenges associated with accomplishing these goals, and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) is becoming an increasingly important technique for controlling polymer morphology. The goal of this proposal is to show that thermodynamic equilibrium principles can enable a priori selection of SVA conditions to guide experiments aimed at achieving a specific self-assembled morphology in a polymer system of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed thermodynamic framework and high-throughput experimental methods should facilitate rapid discovery of next generation polymer materials, improve the accessibility of designer polymers, and enable morphology control in polymer films to address technology challenges in the health, energy, and environment sectors. Thermodynamic equilibrium principles will be used to enable a priori selection of SVA conditions to guide experiments aimed at achieving a specific self-assembled morphology in a polymer system of interest. The PI plans studies aimed at predicting polymer phase behavior during SVA. She will apply thermodynamic principles to describe and predict the phase behavior of block copolymers in this process. These thermodynamic equilibrium principles are proposed to enable a priori selection of SVA conditions to guide experiments aimed at achieving specific self-assembled morphologies in polymer systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to come up with an efficient manufacturing method for the production of tailor made polymer thin films, which could greatly benefit industry. Educationally, the proposed work should provide many opportunities for undergraduate students to carry out independent research projects and inspire some of them to pursue graduate studies. Activities carried out with the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) will contribute to increasing the representation of women in engineering undergraduate classes, doctoral programs, and leadership positions in industry, government, and academia. Specifically, undergraduate researchers enrolled for Independent Study have to develop research-related outreach workshops. The student-designed workshops will be integrated with existing outreach programs at Tulane such as the Girls in STEM at Tulane program, which targets 5th through 7th graders.</AbstractNarration>
