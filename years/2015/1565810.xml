<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division supports the research of Professor Samuel Gellman, who is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  Gellman's group develops new types of protein-like molecules, based on biologically-inspired designs. Biological systems contain sequence-specific oligomers and polymers that fold to particular shapes. Gellman's laboratory creates unnatural oligomers, or "foldamers", that also adopt discrete shapes.  This research employs beta- and gamma-amino acids as alternative building blocks to the natural alpha-amino acids. The protein folding process arranges key subunits into the precise three-dimensional arrays that are necessary for binding to other molecules and catalyzing chemical reactions.  A central aim of the Gellman group's research is to develop synthetic foldamers that display protein-like binding and/or catalytic properties.  These materials ultimately might surpass proteins in terms of specific functions.  This basic research may lead to new types of drug molecules or new types of nanoscale manufacturing capabilities.  Conducting this research provides outstanding interdisciplinary training to undergraduates and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of foldamers is an area of chemistry research that offers opportunities for invention in terms of basic research and practical development.  This research focuses on cutting-edge challenges in terms of molecular design.  One aim is to link understanding of small-molecule conformational propensities to the higher-order structure preferences that emerge in oligomers built from the smaller molecules.  In particular, The Gellman group creates secondary structures containing beta- and/or gamma-amino acid residues that form new helical secondary structures with large internal cavities, a feature not found among protein secondary structures.  A second aim is to leverage previously acquired knowledge of beta-peptide and alpha/beta-peptide folding behavior to arrange pairs of reactive groups in ways that catalyze synthetically useful reactions.  A third aim focuses on quantitative assessment of structure-stability relationships for foldamer helices, information that has been largely unavailable to date. The research group seeks to understand how changes in subunit structure affects the stability of foldamer secondary structures.  Progress toward each of these goals may improve understanding of relationships between molecular structure and function.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research supported by this grant enabled fundamental studies of new types of molecules intended to emulate the remarkable roles played by folded, sequence-specific polymers in biological systems.  These efforts are part of a long-term program that has spanned more than 20 years and produced a great deal of basic knowledge that provides a foundation for application-oriented efforts.  Biomedical applications include development of oligomers that inhibit viral infections or convey important biological signals.  These applied efforts represent a broader impact of basic research supported by the National Science Foundation.        One major outcome of experiments supported by this grant was the establishment of a quantitative scale of propensities for unnatural subunits to participate in a helical conformation similar to the &alpha;-helix that is prevalent in proteins.  Mimicry of natural information-bearing &alpha;-helices with oligomers that contain unnatural units provides a basis for development of new types of biological research tools and, ultimately, new therapeutic agents.  The helix propensity scale that has emerged from our NSF-supported studies should be a broadly useful tool for future efforts to develop bioactive synthetic oligomers in many laboratories.  A second major outcome of this research was the identification of an unnatural oligomer that catalyzes a reaction in which a new carbon-carbon bond is formed.  This result demonstrates that the shape control provided by our unnatural oligomers allows one to arrange a pair of functional groups in a manner that promotes coordinated promotion of a specific and useful pattern of chemical reactivity.  The intellectual merit of this achievement should inspire broad application of synthetic oligomers with defined shapes to diverse reaction processes.        The studies supported by this grant have provided excellent training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.  After these students leave our laboratory, they are well-equipped to pursue independent careers or advanced education.  Ultimately, these young scientists join the technical workforce of the US, which represents a broader impact of the NSF support.
