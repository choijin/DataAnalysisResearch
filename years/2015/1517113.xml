<AbstractNarration>A longstanding problem in astrophysics is to understand how galaxies form and develop throughout their lifetimes.  Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to study supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs).  The investigators in this project will use a pioneering new data set acquired through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey multi-object reverberation mapping project (SDSS-RM) to transform our knowledge of black hole demographics and the physics of AGNs across the observable Universe.  This project will yield the first set of reliable reverberation-mapping (RM) black hole masses (MBH) that includes targets at very large distances from Earth (with redshifts z &gt; 0.3); these RM results will allow us to investigate whether SMBH growth leads or lags galaxy star formation and to more accurately characterize the physics regulating the growth and feedback of AGNs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the investigators will use SDSS-RM data to design and execute a summer research program for high school students participating in Penn State's Summer Research Experience in the Eberly College of Science.  This program is operated in collaboration with Penn State's Upward Bound Math and Science center and targets students from underserved school districts in Pennsylvania.  The investigators will provide low-income students with the opportunity to interact with scientists and to learn basic astronomy data analysis.  This program will provide mentoring experience for postdocs, who will supervise the Penn State student leading the workshop.  This Penn State student will in turn gain experience by mentoring the high school students participating in the program.  Both faculty collaborators will mentor the participating postdocs; this will give them the opportunity to teach, strategically plan for future career goals, and become leaders in large-scale time-domain spectroscopic research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will use the SDSS-RM data to accomplish the following: (1) Measure black hole masses for 100 quasars, tripling the existing sample size and expanding it to cover the broad range in quasar parameter space missed by previous RM surveys (in redshift, luminosity, and emission-line properties), (2) Employ these black hole masses to improve substantially our understanding of black-hole/galaxy scaling relations used to characterize supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass demographics, and (3) Characterize the structure and physics of the broad line-emitting region using the responses of various emission lines and velocity-resolved reverberation methods.  Unlike previous work, which was limited by highly uncertain MBH values that resulted in largely unconstrained estimates of any possible evolution of SMBH-galaxy relationships, the SDSS-RM data set will distinguish between causal or coincidental coevolution by enabling the first study of evolution in the intrinsic scatter of the MBH-host galaxy correlations.  The response of the broad line region across various emission lines will provide crucial insights regarding the physics governing and regulating AGN and SMBH/galaxy evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project measured the masses of supermassive black holes in a large sample of quasars using a technique called reverberation mapping (RM). RM uses light echoes from the inner regions of a quasar, which contains material that is falling into the black hole, and from the surrouding regions of gas in the host galaxy, to determine the size of the entire emission region. The material plummeting into the black hole is heated by gravitational forces and emits copious amounts of radiation; this energy release is so enormous that it can be detected at distances of billions of light years. When the light emitted from the disk propagates outward, it lights up the gas that is farther out, but there is a time delay between the signal from the disk and the signal from the gas. That time delay is due to the time it takes for the light to travel between the two regions, so by measuring the time delay, we can determine how far away the gas is from the disk or the central supermassive black hole. This information, along with the velocity of the gas, allows us to measure the mass of the black hole.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the past, most RM experiments have been focused on only a handful of quasars at a time due to observational constraints. However, our program, which is a part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) program, uses a multi-object spectrograph, which has allowed us to observe 850 quasars at once. Since 2014, the SDSS Reverberation Mapping Project (SDSS-RM) has observed these quasars frequently and obtained more than 80 observations with the SDSS BOSS spectrograph, as well as accompanying observations from other telescopes.&nbsp;</p> <p>The main goals of our NSF-funded program were to use these data to obtain the first set of reliable reverberation mapping black hole masses in quasars at higher redshifts (z &gt; 0.3), and to make these measurements in about 100 sources. We successfully measured black hole masses in about 90 quasars over the course of this project, and we have about 30 more that are soon to be published. The first results, using only the first year's worth of data (Grier et al. 2017) were the first large samples of RM measurements ever to be published and generated considerable interest in the community and with the press (see accompanying images). We later combined the first four years of&nbsp; data to make longer time-delay measurements that could not be measured in a single year, and measured on the order of 50 additional black hole masses.
