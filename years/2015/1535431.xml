<AbstractNarration>This proposal was submitted in response to EHR Core Research (ECR) program announcement NSF 15-509. As part of ECR, this project is funded by the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering (GSE) program. GSE seeks to understand and address gender-based differences in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce participation through education and implementation research that will lead to a larger and more diverse domestic STEM workforce. The proposed research will support the survey and synthesis of the social, educational, and behavioral science literatures regarding the relationship of K-12 diversity to STEM outcomes in two and four-year colleges. Findings from the resulting narrative syntheses, vote-counting and meta-regression analyses will contribute to enhancing the educational infrastructure necessary to diminish gaps in US students' STEM performance and developing a globally competitive STEM workforce. Gaining insight into trajectories to college STEM success among underserved populations is particularly important because youths from these backgrounds continue to lag in their participation in STEM and they are growing as a percent of the US student population. The results of these syntheses will promote learning in STEM, the narrowing of many extant K-16 gaps in STEM outcomes, the improvement of articulation agreements between community colleges and four-year institutions so that transfer students are more likely to succeed in STEM once they matriculate to the latter, and the preparation of students as productive workers in the globalizing economy. It will also stimulate future research by developing a theoretical model of K-12 diversity's mechanisms with respect to two- and four-year college STEM outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most basic research and policy studies about college STEM outcomes investigate the roles of student, family, and teacher characteristics, or the influences of pedagogy and curricula on STEM outcomes. This study will focus on the organizational characteristics of K-12 schools and classrooms in conjunction with the former set of factors. The syntheses have the potential to illuminate the relationship of variations in organizational characteristics of K-12 schools on college STEM outcomes, especially among underserved student populations. First, the syntheses will summarize the relationship of race/ethnic, socio-economic status, and immigrant diversity in K-12 schools and classrooms to STEM outcomes in higher education, paying attention to variations in the relationships by student subpopulations. Second, the researchers will investigate higher education outcomes at both two- and four-year institutions, and the transitions to them, and thereby capture the dynamics of the full STEM educational pipeline, particularly given the critical role of community college transfer options for underserved college students. The focus on two-year institutions is important due to the growing interest in how community colleges can contribute to creating a larger pool of STEM workers. Third, the study will identify and synthesize research about populations currently insufficiently discussed in the literature: Latinos/as, Asians, immigrants, and low-income students. Fourth, the syntheses will permit the development of a much-needed testable theoretical model that accounts for school and classroom compositional effects on STEM outcomes in two- and four-year colleges for all student populations. Finally, the results of this project will be a public resource that could contribute to the advancement of STEM teaching, learning, and participation, through the Spivack Archive, an extant searchable electronic database that presently holds abstracts of 550 research studies about the relationship of K-12 socio-economic status and racial composition to K-12 outcomes. The award will enable the researchers to add studies of higher education outcomes related to STEM to this archive.</AbstractNarration>

We accomplished this goal by searching the literatures, abstracting relevant high quality research on the topic, including the fugitive literature, which is defined as research that is difficult to find for various reasons including its findings are not statistically significant and thus hard to publish. We concentrated on identifying research about the populations that have been insufficiently studied and who tend to be underrepresented in STEM majors and careers. We entered detailed abstracts of each qualified study into our searchable database the K-16 STEM Archive.  Using the Archive, we then synthesized the primary studies in several manuscripts.   The key substantive findings across the over 260 articles, books, and unpublished manuscripts we identified as qualified primary studies show that:  The weaker STEM participation among female students appears to be primarily related to an absence of an early interest in STEM subjects and their gendered learning contexts;   The underrepresentation of certain ethnic and racial minorities and lower socioeconomic status students in STEM is closely related to lower levels of academic preparation prior to secondary school, the presence of racialized learning contexts, and lower levels of confidence as STEM learners among many students who learn in less encouraging contexts.    Although there are many important individual, environmental and behavioral factors related to the STEM participation of all students, certain forces are specific to some sociodemographic groups. Therefore, one-size-fits-all reform strategies cannot successfully enhance STEM outcomes for all students.   There is insufficient research about students who transfer from a two-year to a four-year college to draw definitive conclusions. However, the studies we found suggest community college attendance contributes to higher rates of declaring a STEM major among those who transfer compared to undergraduates who entered a four-year college directly from high school. This relationship appears particularly evident for physical sciences, engineering and mathematics majors.    Low-income and first-generation college students? odds of going into biological sciences receive a significant boost from attending a community college prior to transferring to a four-year institution.     There is a paucity of literature about the role of informal learning opportunities and STEM outcomes. The few studies that address the relationship suggest the importance of informal learning opportunities from early childhood throughout a student?s entire educational trajectory.   Our second goal was to widely disseminate our findings. We used conventional strategies including paper presentations and submission of manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals. Additionally, we employed a nonconventional strategy to disseminate the findings. We developed two websites: The K-16 STEM Archive  (https://k16diversity.uncc.edu/?sfid=1721&amp;_sft_archive=stem ) is a searchable data base that holds over 260 detailed abstracts of qualified studies about the topic of this project. It is designed as a tool for scholars, students, journalists, policy makers, and citizens who wish to delve into the literature itself.  The other website, STEM for the People    ( https://sites.uncc.edu/stem-for-the-people/ ) is  a user-friendly bilingual website designed for lay audiences, particularly parents, educators, students, and policy makers who desire key information about STEM success among students of all ages, especially those who will soon transition to college.     The project outcomes are consistent with the proposed intellectual merit and potential  broader impact of the study.  The study?s findings identify the current state of scholarly knowledge about the family characteristics, community settings, and the organizational, curricular, and pedagogic features and social climates of educational contexts that foster STEM successes for students who attend two- and four-year institutions.
