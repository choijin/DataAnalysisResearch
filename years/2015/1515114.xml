<AbstractNarration>Flexible structures, such as long-span suspension bridges, can be susceptible to large amplitude vibrations and catastrophic failure above a specific wind speed.  This project will investigate the experimental methods used to analyze structures in a wind tunnel in order to avoid disasters like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse in 1940 and improve the design of vehicles to avoid overturning due to sudden crosswinds, like those from tornadoes or microbursts.  This research will be conducted at the Bridge Engineering Laboratory at Kyoto University in Japan in collaboration with Dr. Hiromichi Shirato.  Japan continues to push the limits of bridge engineering, the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge in Kobe or the Namihaya Bridge in Osaka, and can experience several extreme wind events, typhoons, tornadoes and microbursts enhancing the applicability of these studies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The aeroelastic loads and response of structures due to gusty (time dependent) winds is not possible using the traditional frequency domain methods.  Time-domain methods for both self-excited, motion-induced, and buffeting, turbulence-induced, loads have been recently developed using rational function approximations and buffeting indicial functions, respectively.  These methods are also more applicable for finite element analysis and fatigue life estimations.  The project will investigate the applications of rational function and buffeting indicial function technology as it relates to a bridge girder section and a moving vehicle subjected to a sudden crosswind.  The results from the project will provide insights to improve the safety of the design of bridges and vehicles for gusty winds like tornadoes and microbursts.  This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aeroelastic response of structures such as bridges can result in catastrophic failures like the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940) in Washington, USA.  Aeroelasticity is the study of the interaction of aerodynamic forces and elastic bodies.  The aeroelastic loads and response of structures due to gusty (time dependent) winds is not possible using the traditional frequency domain methods.  Time-domain methods for both self-excited, motion-induced, and buffeting, turbulence-induced, loads have been recently developed using rational function approximations and buffeting indicial functions, respectively.  These methods are also more applicable for finite element analysis and fatigue life estimations.  As a graduate student at Iowa State University, my research focuses on the aeroelastic loads and response of wind turbine blades and other streamlined cross-sections.  At Kyoto University, in collaboration with Professor Hiromichi Shirato, Director of the Bridge Engineering Laboratory at Kyoto University, I expanded my research to include bluff cross-sections by investigating the applications of rational function and buffeting indicial function technology as it relates to experimental tests of a bridge girder section and cables.   The tangible outcomes of this project include the development of an algorithm to extract the rational function coefficients for all three-degrees-of-freedom (vertical, horizontal, and torsional) building upon the previous algorithms which were only two-degrees-of-freedom. This algorithm will allow for a more in depth understanding and depiction of the self-excited loads of bridges, cables and wind turbine blades.  Additional research is being conducted on implementing this algorithm through wind tunnel tests at Iowa State University.  This algorithm was tested in Japan with data taken for a bridge girder section and cables.  In addition to this outcome, the international collaboration I began with Professor Hiromichi Shirato and his graduate students had the possibility of increasing the research and development of wind tunnel systems to explore this field of wind engineering.
