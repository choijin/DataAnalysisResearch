<AbstractNarration>This award will permit Dr. Sharon Stansfield and Ithaca College to acquire instrumentation that will support ongoing research into the effect of locomotor experience in typically developing infants. It has been suggested that infants' movements, such as reaching, crawling and walking, may be important for the development of certain aspects of cognition and perception.  The purpose of this research is to a) further develop a mobile robot platform and associated software that lets a baby "drive" a robot by leaning in the direction that the baby wants to travel and b) to then use this robot system in research to examine the effect of locomotor experience on cognitive development in typically developing, pre-crawling infants. If enhanced locomotor experience leads to enhanced cognitive development in typically developing infants, these results would provide the impetus for future research using the robot system to provide mobility to children with conditions that involve motor impairment, such as Down syndrome, developmental coordination disorder, spina bifida, and cerebral palsy.  Children with such impairments often also exhibit cognitive developmental delays.  This research may lead to the development of technology that provides mobility to very young children with delayed or limited independent locomotion, thus providing an avenue for mediating these cognitive development delays.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis of the current research is that infants who have experience with independent locomotion using the robot will show higher levels of cognitive development than those without this experience. Five-month old infants will be randomly assigned to an experimental group that drives the robot during each session or to a control group that does not. Infants will complete twelve 20-minute sessions, followed by a battery of tasks including versions of a Depth Perception, Means-End, A-not-B, and Switch Task that assess aspects of cognition related to movement.  Findings from this research will provide insight into the basic mechanisms involved in the cognitive development of both typically developing infants and infants with motor impairment, and may lead to the creation of an assistive technology that will benefit children with motor impairment in the course of their daily lives.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We know that when an infant starts to move on their own, for example by crawling, there is associated development in the infant?s perceptual, cognitive, social and emotional development.  At Ithaca College, we have an established research program studying the relationship between a baby?s experience moving independently and their cognitive development with respect to executive functioning.  Our research has two goals:  The first is to determine if there is a measurable effect on an infant?s cognitive development if they are given the ability to move independently.  The second goal is to use this knowledge to develop easily controlled mobility devices for children with motor impairment.  These children often have cognitive delays associated with their inability to move on their own.  We aim to use knowledge learned from studies with typically developing infants who are not yet crawling to explore whether providing early mobility to infants with motor impairment leads to improved rehabilitation and better outcomes for these children.  Our previous research has led to the development of the WeeBot, a robotic mobility device that moves in the direction that a child leans.  Our work has shown that this intuitive control can be learned by infants as young as six months of age.  Preliminary results from an on-going study show that providing mobility to these infants may positively affect their cognitive development.   This grant has allowed us to augment our current research laboratory in two important ways.  During the first year, we purchased a larger robot and programmed it to be controlled in the same way as our WeeBot.  This robot can carry children who are much older than six months.  This is important because children with motor impairment, who also have associated cognitive developmental delays, are often older than typically developing children at the same stage of cognitive development.  This means that they are sometimes too big for our previous device.  Now we can study the effect of mobility on cognition with a larger population of children. We also purchased and integrated a functional near infrared spectroscopy system (fNIR).  This allows us to measure the prefrontal cortex activity involved with executive function while a child is learning to drive or is driving the robot.  In the second year of this grant, we performed a pilot study with a child who was two and a half years old, with motor impairment and cognitive delay.  He was not yet moving independently in any significant way.  This experiment showed us that the new equipment could be used for older children, since this child would have been too big for our smaller robot.  We also collected fNIR data as the child moved the robot to "chase" a toy held just beyond his reach.  The data showed us that there was an upward trend in the amount of blood flow to the prefrontal cortex which could be interpreted a showing that he was learning to drive the robot over time.  We in a second task, the child was carried toward his father, who was holding a ball.  In this case, there was a downward trend in the amount of blood flow, perhaps because he was adapting to the activity over time and wasn?t as excited by it. This is important, because very little work has been done using fNIR on infants/children, and we hope that our future work will contribute to this novel method of gathering data pertaining to cognitive development within the behavioral sciences.  Beyond this scientific contribution, our ultimate goal is to provide powered mobility to children with motor impairment at a very early age (perhaps as young as six months old) in hopes of off-setting the cognitive delays that may be caused by lack of independent mobility.  If, as we hope, the WeeBot can be commercialized and provided to infants with motor impairment at a much earlier age than are traditional powered wheelchairs, it is possible that this work will impact the quality of life and productivity of people with motor impairment throughout their lifetimes.
