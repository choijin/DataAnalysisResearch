<AbstractNarration>This project was submitted in response to the Dear Colleague Letter for Hispanic Serving Institutions "Stimulating Research on Effective Strategies in Undergraduate STEM Education at Two-Year Hispanic Serving Institutions," NSF15-078.  It is implementing a suite of educational approaches for rising STEM majors at Miami-Dade College InterAmerican Campus in partnership with Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden. These experiences are built around two evidence-based teaching modalities applied to introductory STEM courses and authentic 8-week research experiences in biology.  The impact of this combination of approaches on improving the retention of Hispanic students in STEM fields is largely untested in a Hispanic Serving community college environment. Such colleges are particularly important to the high education of Hispanic students. The teaching modalities are Peer Led Team Learning (PLTL) and Process-oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). The project will provide early research immersion in plant biology/environmental science alongside supportive services such as peer tutoring, faculty mentoring, science lectures, research presentations, and other activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will determine the impact of these high-impact educational approaches and redesigned science curricula to engage and motivate students to persist and achieve in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
