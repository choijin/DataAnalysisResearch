<AbstractNarration>Marine technology is vital to many aspects of our national economy. This project characterizes and researches trends in the ocean workforce, identifies the knowledge and skills this workforce needs, places this information in the hands of educational institutions at all levels, and works to ensure that curricula and programs are appropriately preparing students for the workplace. MATE's programs represent unique approaches to engaging students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) learning experiences and developing the capacity for increasing the nation's technological workforce.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Support Center for marine technology education, the MATE Center will: &lt;br/&gt;1. Expand and strengthen partnerships with academic institutions, employers, and professional societies to better prepare students for the ocean workforce. &lt;br/&gt;2. Develop an international remotely operated vehicle (ROV) technician competency and assessment program endorsed by industry. &lt;br/&gt;3. Continue to improve student learning in STEM through activities such as regional and international underwater robotics (ROV) competitions that simulate the high performance workplace and build academic and industry partnerships. &lt;br/&gt;4. Offer faculty professional development institutes that focus on marine technology, create an awareness of ocean-related careers, and empower instructors to deliver interdisciplinary, technology-rich learning experiences to their students. &lt;br/&gt;5. Continue the MATE at-sea technical internship program and increase the numbers of underrepresented students participating in the program. &lt;br/&gt;6. Disseminate MATE products, including curricula, textbooks, occupational guidelines, competencies, and procedural guides, in both traditional formats and electronically through the Center's web sites www.marinetech.org and www.OceanCareers.com.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The MATE Center's breadth of academic, industry, and professional society partnerships support the development, testing, and widespread implementation of exceptional marine technical education programs, instructional materials, activities, and the dissemination of these innovative resources. This, in turn, strengthens linkages between educational programs; catalyzes other activities that provide students with additional educational opportunities and pathways to careers; and helps to address both regional and national marine technical workforce needs. These efforts will prepare a diverse workforce that will help ensure U.S. competitiveness in a global economy that is currently, and increasingly, dependent on ocean activities.</AbstractNarration>

Headquartered at Monterey Peninsula College in Monterey, California, the Center is a national partnership of community colleges, secondary schools, universities, informal educational organizations, research institutions, marine industries, professional societies, and working professionals.</p> <p>MATE's mission is to use marine technology to inspire and challenge students to learn and creatively apply science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to solving real-world problems in a way that reinforces critical thinking, collaboration, entrepreneurialism, and innovation. A hallmark of all MATE programs, products, and services is that they are aligned with ocean workforce research and trends. Over the past five years the MATE has:</p> <ul> <li>Maintained relationships with more than 900 academic institutions at all levels. Since MATE's inception approximately 12,000 students have enrolled in marine technology-related programs at its community college partners; 5,000 of these students have earned marine technology-related certificates or degrees. &nbsp;In a survey of MATE partner colleges, more than 20,000 students have benefited from the infusion of MATE workforce information and education materials into their curriculum.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>From 2003 through 2020, MATE received directly, or via its non-profit MATE II, more than $2,100,000 in funds from over 100 industry partners and over $11,000,000 in in-kind contributions (equipment, facilities, time). Our industry partners have hired MATE students and, specifically, used the ROV competition and the internship program to recruit new employees.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Held one world championship and 30+ regional competitions underwater robotics (ROV) competitions each year (except 2020 due to COVID). To date, the competitions have impacted tens of thousands of students and teachers at more than a thousand formal and informal educational institutions (middle schools, high schools, home schools, community colleges, universities, 4-H clubs, and public aquaria).

SeaMATE is a social enterprise that provides community college students with income and work experience while generating products that support marine technical education. Students participating in SeaMATE create ROV kits and other merchandise that are then sold in MATE's on-line store (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.seamate.org/">www.seamate.org</a></span>). Since 2012, SeaMATE has sold more than 6,500 ROV kits (ranging in price from $195 to $900) and has taken in $2.6 million in sales.&nbsp; SeaMATE sells four models of ROV kits. The advanced kit, the <em>Barracuda, </em>runs with an Arduino microcontroller, it can also be programed to be controlled via Bluetooth technology (such as a cell phone) and comes with relays for actuators.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The MATE Center completed its textbook, <em>Underwater Robotics: Science, Design </em>&amp; <em>Fabrication </em>in September 2010 and in January 2019 released an updated version; more than 3,500 copies had been sold as of December 31, 2020 ($120.00 retail price).</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Created <a href="www.educate.materovcompetition.org">www.educate.materovcompetition.org</a> a compendium of highly organized education resources (instructional videos, narrated presentations, and detailed instructions) that walk educators and students - step by step - through the process of engineering design, project management and ROV building.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Since its inception in 1999, MATE's technical internship program has placed 348 students in at-sea and shore-based internship positions. MATE interns work with marine technicians and scientists aboard research vessels. These experiences provide them with the opportunity to develop their technical, scientific, seamanship, and interpersonal skills.&nbsp; In a recent survey of former MATE interns (n = 91), 90% claimed their Internship was a major contributing factor in obtaining employment, being accepted into a higher degree program, or receiving a scholarship or other award.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Beginning in the summer of 1999, MATE began providing two week-long summer professional development Institutes for secondary school and college faculty focused on marine technology, ROVs, and Ocean Observing Systems and GIS topics. The Institutes provide participants with hands-on time with technology, curriculum materials, lectures, videos, demonstrations, and field trips.&nbsp; More than 1000 faculty have participated in these workshops. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>MATE partners have used and adapted MATE materials to conduct outreach in their communities.
