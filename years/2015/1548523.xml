<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides support to undertake an institutional self-analysis in preparation for a Broadening Participation Research Center.  Broadening Participation Research Centers are expected to serve as a national hub for the rigorous study and broad dissemination of the critical pedagogies and culturally sensitive interventions that contribute to the success of HBCUs in educating African American STEM undergraduates. The project at Morehouse College seeks to plan the essential research questions, experimental designs and programmatic activities for creating a large-scale STEM broadening participation research innovation center designed to research "how HBCUs can best understand and activate the particular brand of genius within a given student."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to employ this asset-based approach in partnership with HBCUs, industry, and nonprofit organizations to plan a research center that will in part utilize STEM innovation as a tool for student empowerment. Activities of the project include: networking with other HBCUs and forming partnerships with Morehouse College; soliciting involvement from innovation centers, industry and non-profit organizations; developing well defined research questions and experiments; planning a dissemination program to include a comprehensive web portal, workshops, faculty sabbaticals, summer internships for students and faculty, conferences and possibly a journal. The project will be guided by an external advisory committee.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this initiative was to plan essential research questions, experimental designs and programmatic activities for a greater vision of creating a large-scale STEM broadening participation research innovation center designed to engage and study students and faculty from HBCUs and the pedagogies they employ to empower STEM students. Approximately 17 faculty and staff members at Morehouse College were engaged in a series of meetings which resulted in a clear vision for the Center. The thematic vision of this planning initiative has been defined and titled the HBCU STEM Identity Research Center.  The HBCU STEM Identity Research Center will embrace an asset-based approach to research, education, knowledge transfer and outreach.   Published literature states that a positive science identity construction is the integration of science into one's sense of self so that it becomes a source of inspiration, promotion of science literacy and contributes to lifelong learning. This science identity construct forms the published basis of this Center?s thematic research to include studying utilitarian scientific literacy, course-based undergraduate research experiences, retention strategies such as peer led team learning (PLTL), faculty development and HBCU impact.  The organizing team of Morehouse faculty also decided to create a community of scholars that fosters a research culture which supports the Center as a national hub on the science of broadening participation.  In December 2016 a Planning Meeting was held at Morehouse College with 40 participants from 17 HBCUs.  In a post-conference assessment of participants, 87% of the faculty indicated that they perceived a moderate to strong fit with the mission of this project.  As a result of this planning meeting and subsequent communications, 21 different HBCUs and 7 other institutions have committed to participate in the HBCU STEM Identity Research Center.
