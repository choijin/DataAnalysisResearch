<AbstractNarration>It has been increasingly recognized that promoting scientific literacy must begin early while foundational attitudes, knowledge and skills are taking shape. This project, conducted by researchers at the University of Texas and Loyola University of Chicago, will explore preschoolers' attunement to causal information -- referred to as their causal stance -- as a key component of this foundation. For example, the researchers are interested in the degree to which children seek out information about how unfamiliar objects work or can be used. By advancing our understanding of the origins and outcomes associated with the strength of children's causal stance, this project will support the development of early interventions aimed at facilitating children's participation and success in science, with a particular focus on at risk children. As such, its goals are particularly well aligned with the learning and learning environments strand of the Education and Human Resources Core Research (ECR) program. The project also has implications for professional workforce development and broadening participation in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will implement a four-year longitudinal design to address two core research goals. First, with respect to outcomes, researchers will test the hypothesis that the strength of children's causal stance at 3 years of age (measured in terms of children's preferences, as well as patterns of inquiry and exploration) is predictive of their scientific literacy and interests at 5- and 6- years of age (measured by standardized tests and surveys). Second, with respect to origins, researchers will test the hypothesis that variability in the degree to which parents talk about, and otherwise highlight, causal information (in both the laboratory and in a children's museum) relates to the strength of their children?s causal stance, as well as their longer-term scientific literacy and interests. Together, these investigations will inform discussions regarding the role of early experience in shaping scientific literacy, and relatedly, when and in what ways we might optimize children?s engagement and success in science.</AbstractNarration>
