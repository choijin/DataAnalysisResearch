<AbstractNarration>Understanding how matter is distributed in the Universe is key to developing accurate models of how it evolved.  The investigators will use mapping of filamentary structures in large samples of galaxies as a new indicator of large scale structure that can then be compared to other data. They seek to trace the cosmic web from these data. Broader impacts of the work include training of a graduate student, and engagement of the broader community through public lectures at the Allegheny Observatory, online educational games, and existing programs for middle school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will cross correlate the new data with other cosmological observables like Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and study intrinsic galaxy shapes with filaments. The group has developed a method for identifying filaments in purely photometric data and, with this award, will develop a pre-existing prototype into a reconstruction tool. They will then apply the tool to simulated data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This proposal has significantly enhanced the amount of information offered by SDSS and have provided tools for researchers to apply filament finding to future surveys. In particular, our algorithm and methods are published and the relevant code is made publicly available (Chen, Ho et al. 2015a). The tools had been used by researchers in several surveys and in various institutions. The application of our methods to current data provided a completely unexplored window into large-scale structure. We detected the effects of gravitational lensing from cosmic filaments for the first time on the cosmic microwave background (He, Alam et al. , 2017 Nature Astronomy). We also investigated the effects of filaments on the effects of galaxy alignments and spin in both simulations and data (Chen, Ho et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2015c).    This proposal allowed a myriad of scientific opportunities ranging from multiple cross-correlations of filaments with other galaxies to the cosmic microwave background; improved understanding of galaxy formation; and we have placed constraints on cosmological parameters.    This project provided new tools and algorithms that have direct application to problems in several scientific disciplines, particularly cosmology and astronomy. The project also provided publicly available software and trained Ph.D. students in both physics and statistics with the cross- disciplinary expertise to be leaders in big-data-driven science.
