<AbstractNarration>Imagine a scenario in which illicit nuclear material may be in transit. How can we tell in a matter of minutes whether a truck, boat, railway car, or even a person with a backpack in a crowed street is a carrier of (possibly shielded) radioactive material? This project focuses on the underlying science behind the problem of timely detection of weak radioactive sources from a distance, by steering robots (ground and/or aerial) equipped with radiation counters. The proposed theory promotes national security objectives by providing improved decision-making algorithms. These algorithms can support both existing and future sensor technology, and help develop new detection tools which can form an effective layer of protection against radiological attacks at home, and contribute a useful tool for nuclear nonproliferation abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel features of the methodology in this project include the model-based approach to active sensing, and the formulation of the detection problem in a way that is more compatible with real-world scenarios. This approach departs from the classical active sensing approaches by querying measurement models, as opposed to merely measurement data, in order to improve the performance of decision making. The approach signifies a paradigm shift for active sensing in sensor management: instead of relying on sensor measurements (data) to decide how to sample, here the approach is to rely on measurement physics (models).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has been a preliminary investigation of an active sensing approach to a signal detection problem, where the relative position between sensor and signal source is a stochastic process.  There are therefore two sources of uncertainty that have to be resolved: one coming from the signal itself (whenever present) being buried in noise, and a second that stems from the random nature of the position of the sensor with respect to the source and the way that this position affects the statistics of measurement.  Such a problem arises in cases where a moving platform is suspected to carry a radioactive source, and the available means of detection is a mobile sensor the motion of which can be controlled.  Because of the presence of ubiquitous, low-level background radiation, weak radiation signals can be effectively hidden in noise.  At the same time, given that the radioactivity signal that the sensor picks gets significantly stronger the closer it is to its source, judiciously and dynamically repositioning the sensor can make a difference in terms of whether and how fast the sensor can detect the presence of the source.  Controlling sensor mobility, therefore, is key to improving the performance of decision-making.  This detection formulated as a binary hypothesis test, for which the optimal solution is known.  What is also known, from our previous work, is that for the case where there is no uncertainty in the relative positioning between sensor and source, the optimal motion strategy for the sensor to detect the source within a fixed time interval is to close its distance between itself and the source as fast as possible.   Our ability to obtain this optimal solution rested on the availability of explicit mathematical expressions for bounds on the probability of making incorrect decisions.  What makes the specific problem treated here particularly challenging, however, is the randomness in the relative motion between sensor and source.  Those expressions that facilitated the previous analysis are not guaranteed to bound the error probabilities anymore.  In this setting, therefore, we aimed at gaining some first insight by assuming that those same expressions are indeed bounds, and solved a stochastic optimal control problem to drive the sensor while trying to minimize the same expression that served before as a bound on the probability of failing to detect a source.  Careful analysis of that optimal control problem showed that its solution mirrors the one we had obtained when the sensor motion was not uncertain, and the optimal motion strategy remained unchanged: close the distance as soon as possible.  So as long as the expressions hold as bounds, there is a clean, closed-form mathematical solution to (stochastic) sensor motion coordination.  Another new finding is that the presence of noise in the motion has a detrimental effect on the accuracy of decision making, which is stronger the weaker the source signal is compared to background.  One way, therefore, that these new findings are expected to guide further analysis is by letting the designer know what to expect when tasked with signal detection based on controlled stochastic sensor motion, and under what assumptions the insights on sensor control obtained in the deterministic setting carry over to the stochastic regime.
