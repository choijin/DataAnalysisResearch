<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of 100 undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral students at the 42nd Annual National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE) conference, held in Orlando, FL on September 21 - 26, 2015. Selected participants are from underrepresented minority groups in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields who come from majority institutions, Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities (HBCUs), and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides opportunities for participants to engage in four major areas of focus: 1) technical and professional development; 2) networking and mentorship opportunities with professionals working in STEM fields; 3) exposure to high-profile minority role models in STEM; and 4) career advancement opportunities. Participants present their original research to a forum composed of industry, government, and academic peers while meeting colleagues from other HBCU, MSI, and majority institutions to develop research collaborations and to explore opportunities to pursue graduate degrees in the chemistry or chemical engineering disciplines.  These opportunities may not only impact these specific participating individuals, but also benefit the larger community of STEM field practitioners as these activities are useful in recruiting and retaining individuals from underrepresented talent pools. NOBCChE seeks to increase the number of minorities in the STEM workforce. Results of this activity are submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals so that the indentified best practices can be more widely adopted.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The NOBCChE 42nd Annual Conference was held September 21-26, 2015 in Orlando, Florida. The theme of the annual conference was "Bridging Generations through STEM" and each day was designed to "Inspire, Connect and Create" all participants with an adoration for STEM. NOBCChE seeked to increase the number of minorities in the STEM workforce by providing access to:  Technical and Professional Devleopment; Networking and Mentorship Opportunities with Professionals working in STEM Fields; Exposure to High-Profile Minority Role Models in STEM; and Career Advancement Opportunities.   The goal of this project was to identify and sponsor 100 minority STEM graduate and undergraduate students to participate in the NOBCChE 42nd Annual Conference.  The NSF sponsorship paid for conference registration and the cost of hotel accommodations.  The NOBCChE 42nd Annual Conference was an avenue to address ways to "Bridging Generations through STEM". As a result of the NOBCChE 42nd Annual Conference, we were able to convene in one setting underepresented minority serving institutions, key federal agencies and industries committeed to the increase of diverse persons in STEM fields to present successful, strategic pipeline programs that promote the professional advancement of underrepresented minorities and women scientists and engineers in STEM.  A total of 100 students were supported using NSF funds. The group consisted of 62% females and 38% males. 36% of the students studied at an HBCU. The level of study of the students provided funding included 29% undergraduate, 7% master students, 56% doctoral students and 8% postdoctoral fellows. Majority (38%) of the students were from the southeast region. A total of 100 students were selected from a pool of 224 completed applications.  The following information was collected and used for student selection:  Basic Demographic Information Citizenship Academic Affiliation  Major and Degree Graduation Year GPA Transcripts Resumes Overall Career Goals and Aspirations   Results were summarized and shared using a combination of print, digital, and social media. Results were presented in the following mediums:  Print and Digital  NOBCChE E-blast (http://www.nobcche.org/newsroom) NOBCChE National Website: www.nobcche.org  http://www.nobcche.org/conference2015  https://issuu.com/nobcchearchives/docs/nobcche-conference_program_2015  https://nobcche.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/ConferenceDocuments/Conference 2015/nobcche%202015%20conference%20report_public.pdf https://nobcche.memberclicks.net/asses/docs/ConferenceDocuments/Conference2015/nobcche-conference_program%202015.pdf  http://www.multibriefs.com/briefs/nobcche  Chemical and Engineering News Article (http://cen.acs.org/articles/93/i42/NOBCChE-Community.html)   Social Media   Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/NOBCChE/) Flickr (https://www.flickr.com/photos/135732462@N03/) YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spwwAGEtbhY&amp;feature-youtu.be) Twitter (https://twitter.com/NOBCChE) Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/nobcche_official/)   NOBCChE includes the phrase "professional advancement". As a result of NOBCChE's focus on expert advancement, professional development, whether student or professional development, NOBCChE has worked extensively to educate and prepare future STEM professionals. NOBCChE empowers interdisciplinary programs, research and collaborations.  In addition, NOBCChE provides experiences for students to obtain powerful learning experiences and witness integrative learning, critical thinking, analytical skills and creative problem solving. Interdisciplinary programs, research and collaborations included areas of bioengineering, chemical biology, nanoscience, bio-inspired materials, pharmacology, mathematics, physics, and business.
