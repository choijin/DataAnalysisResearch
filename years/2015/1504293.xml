<AbstractNarration>Computer science has become an essential intellectual skill that is fundamental to a broad range of academic disciplines and careers.  Colleges and universities have consistently struggled to engage a diverse population of students in computer science.  Introductory computing courses, now required at a growing number of colleges, have largely failed to engage non-majors and to entice them to further study in the field.  To rectify this problem, researchers from Georgia Tech and Georgia Gwinnett College will develop a new introductory computing course that uses a STEAM (STEM + Arts) approach to engage a diverse population of non-majors in computing.  The course will use EarSketch, a learning environment that teaches computer science in the context of music remixing and music production.  EarSketch has been proven to engage underrepresented groups at the high school level.  The goal of this project will be to demonstrate that EarSketch will be effective at the undergraduate level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will adapt the EarSketch curriculum for college-level study and develop new EarSketch features to support collaborative learning practices in college courses.  Through student engagement surveys, a content knowledge assessment, focus groups, and a comparative analysis with other courses, the team will assess the potential of EarSketch to impact engagement, learning outcomes, and future interest in computing with a diverse population of college students.  Findings from this project will contribute to a better understanding of STEAM learning environments in introductory undergraduate STEM courses and their effects on content knowledge and engagement across diverse student populations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computer science has become a core 21st century skill, and an increasing number of colleges and universities are encouraging or requiring all undergraduates -- regardless of major -- to take a computing course. Yet these introductory undergraduate computing courses often fail to engage diverse student populations, impact student attitudes, or move the needle on student content knowledge and persistence.  In this project, researchers adapted EarSketch -- a computer science learning environment that had already achieved considerable success at the high school level -- for an introductory undergraduate computing course for non-majors. EarSketch is a learning environment that engages students in computer science by contextualizing it in music composition, remixing, and production.  The project consisted of a) design and development work to adapt the web-based EarSketch learning environment to undergraduate learning contexts; b) the creation of an interactive online textbook that included text, videos, sample code, exercises, and projects aligned with the learning objectives for an undergraduate-level course; c) the development of automated and peer-based grading tools that enable instructors of large courses to efficiently grade student projects; and d) a research study that compared students' academic performance and attitudes towards computing in EarSketch classrooms against non-EarSketch classrooms.  The study showed that students in the EarSketch classrooms exhibited significantly larger gains in their attitudes towards computing, their performance on a computer science knowledge assessment, and their intention to persist in further studies of computing. Further analyses showed that female students and under-represented minority students using EarSketch exhibited significantly greater gains in their attitudes towards computing and intentions to persist in computing than their counterparts in the non-EarSketch version of the course.  The encouraging results of this preliminary study suggest that an approach to introductory undergraduate computing education that students perceive to be authentic, creative, and expressive can impact students' attitudes towards computing and their interest in further study of computing, and that it can more generally help to broaden participation in this core twenty-first century field.
