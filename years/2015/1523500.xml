<AbstractNarration>This research is focused on the study of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), very small particles condensed from the gas phase, in environmental chambers and the effects of gas and particle deposition onto the chamber walls. Modeling studies generally utilize fundamental data from environmental chambers in predicting ambient aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere.  Currently a discrepancy exists between model predictions and atmospheric measurements of SOA.  The reanalysis of historical chamber experiments indicates that prior reported SOA yields may have been underpredicted.  The information from this research is critical for understanding aerosol-induced health effects and contributions to global aerosol radiative forcing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work includes: (1) Measurements of the wall deposition rates of individual organic species on the Teflon walls of a chamber and correlation of those rates to molecular properties of the species; (2) Chamber experiments with a wide range of important biogenic and anthropogenic volatile organic compounds in which the competition between vapor transport to particles and the walls is modulated; and (3) Development of a comprehensive model of chamber vapor dynamics that allows quantitative assessment from data on individual species of the impact of vapor wall deposition and extrapolation to atmospheric "wall-less" conditions.</AbstractNarration>

Gases are emitted into the atmosphere from sources ranging from combustion of fossil fuels to organic molecules released by vegetation. Particles are likewise emitted directly into the atmosphere from motor vehicle exhaust as well as natural sources, like vegetation and fires. Once airborne, organic species undergo complex chemical reactions that lead to formation of particles themselves. Organic particles produced in this manner are referred to as Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA).  Secondary organic aerosol, the largest component by mass of organic particulate matter, plays a role in human health.  The chemical pathways that lead to SOA are highly complex and are generally studied in the laboratory, using state-of-the-science instrumentation and large laboratory reactors.  Indeed, much of the atmospheric chemistry understanding is the result of studies carried out in these large laboratory reactors, termed "chambers."  It has been recognized since the inception of laboratory chambers that both organic gases and particles can deposit on the walls of such chambers.  Such deposition, which is unavoidable, perturbs the chemistry occurring in the chamber and affects the ultimate composition and rate of production of organic aerosol. This research program has been aimed at understanding the molecular details involved in chamber atmospheric chemistry and developing experimental strategies and computational modeling to understand the effect of wall interactions on the chemistry occurring in such chambers.
