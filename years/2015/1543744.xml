<AbstractNarration>Bioinformatics and biomedicine research is fundamental to our understanding of complex biological systems, impacting the science and technology of fields ranging from agricultural and environmental sciences to pharmaceutical and medical sciences. This research requires close collaboration among multi-disciplinary teams of researchers in quantitative sciences, life sciences, and their interfaces. The 9th Annual IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM-2015; http://cci.drexel.edu/ieeebibm/bibm2015/) will provide an open and interactive forum to promote multi- and interdisciplinary research and education in Bioinformatics and biomedicine, facilitating the cross-fertilization of ideas and bridging of knowledge gaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific program of BIBM-2015 will cover synergistic themes on genomics, systems biology, translational bioinformatics, and cross-cutting bioinformatics infrastructure to promote new research collaborations. Two special panels, Big Data and Bioinformatics, and the Bioinformatics Educational Workshop will foster discussions on research and education opportunities and barriers. IEEE BIBM 2015 engages world-renowned scientists as keynote speakers and invited speakers, contributed talks at a highly competitive acceptance rate (the BIBM regular paper acceptance rate is always less than 20% since its inception), special issue publications in top scientific journals (so far, BIBM 2015 has confirmed the special issues publications with 6 journals: IEEE Transactions on NanoBiosciences, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, International Journal of Data Mining and Bioinformatics, BMC Bioinformatics, BMC Systems Biology, and BMC Genomics), as well as the board participation of the research community serving on the Program Committee and the organizing committees for workshops, tutorials and posters. As an effort to engage young researchers, IEEE BIBM 2015 has involved them in the meeting organization and has included mentoring activities in the conference program. This award provides the crucial funding needed to support the participation of early career researchers and graduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, as a training opportunity for the next generation of scientists and engineers, thereby, broadening  the scientific impact of this international conference.</AbstractNarration>
