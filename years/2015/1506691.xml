<AbstractNarration>As atmospheric relative humidity cycles, saline aerosols exist either as ionic salts, or as aqueous ionic solution. Supersaturated and undersaturated phase change typically demonstrate hysteresis behavior as a function of relative humidity. The (increasing) RH at which the phase transition abruptly changes from solid particle to a saturated aqueous solution is the deliquescence relative humidity (DRH). The decreasing RH that drying aqueous droplets remain as supersaturated sols until crystallization, is the efflorescence relative humidity (ERH). Efflorescence may differ based on the nucleation mechanism, either by contact with a seed, or immersion of that seed into the supersaturated droplet. The objective of a series of laboratory  investigations is to further study contact efflorescence compared to immersion efflorescence on aerosol types and sizes representative of atmospheric particles. Aerosol phase changes in a single droplet optical trap will be used to systematically follow efflorescence mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of accounting for aerosol particle phase changes includes effects on heterogeneous chemical processes, light scattering, and cloud formation and precipitation. Direct effects on homogeneous (gas phase) chemistry and climate also remain uncertain.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nucleation of a solid crystalline phase from a liquid solution is an important process in pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and atmospheric science. In the atmosphere, the phase state and water content of particulate matter influences visibility, the aerosol direct and indirect effect on climate and chemical reactions important for air pollution.  In comparison to solid particles, aqueous particles in the atmosphere are much more likely to grow to sizes that impact visibility and climate in response to increases in relative humidity and also are better catalysts for heterogeneous chemical reactions.  However, nucleation of crystals from aqueous droplets is poorly understood and thus it is difficult to predict aerosol phase state in the atmosphere.  This leads to uncertainties in air quality and climate predictions.  A significant fraction of aqueous atmospheric aerosol contains soluble inorganics such as chlorides, sulfates, and nitrates that can undergo efflorescence, i.e., the process of salt crystallization and water evaporation. Efflorescence often exhibits hysteresis, occurring at a significantly lower relative humidity (RH) than the reverse process of deliquescence.  However, most climate and air chemistry studies do not explicitly include the particle hysteresis effect.  Rather, it is typically assumed that inorganic particles always remain in the supersaturated aqueous state or remain aqueous until quite low relative humidity is reached.   Because pathways for efflorescence have not been fully explored, the phase state, and thus atmospheric impact of aerosols is still uncertain.  The present work examined a pathway not previously considered for aerosol efflorescence, so-called "contact efflorescence" where particle-particle collisions result in efflorescence.  While it is known that particles collide in the atmosphere and coagulate to form larger particles, the resulting phase state has not been considered.  The experimental approach to study contact induced phase changes involved levitation of single droplets in an optical trap that used two lasers to hold the particle stable.  Levitated droplets were then exposed to single collisions with small solid particles, and phase changes were observed both visually and by changes in how the droplet scattered the trapping laser light.   These studies found that a single particle-particle collision can lead to crystallization at a much higher relative humidity than would occur in the absence of such a collision.  This implies that salt particles in the atmosphere may be solid more of the time than previously assumed.  These laboratory findings may help interpret recent unexpected field observations of solid particles in the upper troposphere.  Once this new mechanism is included in atmospheric models, our work could help to lower uncertainties in the aerosol effects on modeled air quality and climate.  This work is also providing fundamental data that can be used to test nucleation theories applicable to a wide range of scientific topics.  This project has directly contributed to the development of the careers of a number of scientists at many levels.  It has provided support for the PI to move into new directions, namely optical levitation.  It has provided graduate student support for two students and helped moved their careers forward.  It has also led to new collaborations with senior scientists on projects related to water on Mars as well as bioaerosols.
