<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Michigan (UM) located in Ann Arbor, MI, will support the training of 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2016-2018. This project is supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) and the Division of Chemistry (CHE) in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS). The program will expose students to the nature of interdisciplinary research within the framework of protein structure-function studies. Participants will be engaged in experimental training and independent investigation in the areas of biochemistry, biophysics, bioinformatics, cheminformatics, molecular biology and plant biology.   In addition to the research experience, students will participate in weekly seminars focused on ethics in research, scientific communication, graduate school admissions and scientific career options as well as various cohort building activities.  Students will be recruited from across the Nation via email postings, website listings and announcements at conferences, and networking with faculty at diverse institutions.  Undergraduate students, who are US citizens or permanent residents, majoring in a STEM discipline are eligible for participation.  Special consideration will be given to students from community colleges and to those with no previous research experience.  Individuals who are from underrepresented ethnic/racial groups and those who are from institutions with limited research opportunities are encouraged to apply.  All participants will receive housing, meal and travel allowances and a stipend.  Applications will be accepted from early December - March 1st.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program.  Students will learn how research is conducted and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The student centered REU program and enrichment activities have been designed to develop key skills and attitudes, and it is anticipated that the experience will promote persistence in the STEM disciplines at the undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program.  Annual tracking surveys will be sent to program alumni to determine their level of engagement in the STEM disciplines.   More information about the program is available by visiting: http://pharmacy.umich.edu/reu or by contacting the PI (Dr. Cherie Dotson at crdotson@umich.edu) or the Co-PI (Dr. Ronald Woodard at rww@umich.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Interdisciplinary REU Program in the Structure and Function of Proteins (IREU) at the University of Michigan (UM) was initiated in 2009 and is designed to expose students to the nature of interdisciplinary research around studies of protein structure and function.  This report provides details regarding outcomes for the 2016-2018 award period.    Each year the IREU program recruits 10 students from across the nation to participate in a ten-week summer research experience at the University of Michigan.  The projects featured span a variety of disciplines (e.g. biochemistry, biophysics, cheminformatics, molecular biology and plant biology) and are representative of seven departments at the University of Michigan, which further emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of the research training offered.    The objectives of the Interdisciplinary REU Program are to: 1) enhance the educational experience of program participants, 2) assist program participants in confirming and clarifying their educational and career goals and 3) encourage participants to pursue graduate (M.S./Ph.D.) degrees and careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines.   In support of these objectives, students are provided with:  An interdisciplinary research experience Fundamental principles of effective oral &amp; written communication in science First-hand exposure to the culture of graduate school Information regarding the graduate school application process Opportunities to interact with peers, graduate students and faculty members      Key outcomes:  A program website and flier were used to promote the IREU Program broadly on national websites, at undergraduate conferences and via emails to ~300 contacts nationwide. These recruitment efforts resulted in an average of 334 applications.  The importance of scientific communication (oral and written) was emphasized through seminars and mandatory assignments.  Upon completion of the program, students were strongly encouraged to present their research at local, regional and national conferences. IREU students from the 2016-2018 cohorts collectively made 11 research presentations and they were listed on 4 co-authored publications in peer-reviewed journals and 1 co-authored published abstract.  The Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA) tool was used to assess the level of educational enhancement of the students.  The 2016-2018 students consistently reported high gains in their "ability to work independently" and in their "confidence in their ability to do research."  With regard to overall program impact, 100% of the students, who provided feedback, attributed the IREU Program to helping them to confirm, clarify or alter their educational and career goals.   With regard to persistence in STEM disciplines, 15 (47%) of the 32 NSF-funded students over this award period are currently pursuing PhD degrees, (1) is pursuing a MS degree, (4) are in industrial STEM positions, (2) are currently pursuing or planning to pursue a professional degree (MD, PharmD) and (1) will be pursuing a non-STEM PhD. The activities of 9 students are unknown.  An additional outcome was that 6 NSF-funded students are currently pursuing their PhD at the University of Michigan.   One of the intended broader impacts of the program is to provide research experiences to students from institutions with limited resources for research and to those who are from underrepresented ethnic/racial groups and disadvantaged backgrounds.  The program has achieved success in this regard as 100% of the students involved in the program over the 2016-2018 award period have been from institutions with limited resources for research, with 4 coming from a community college.  With regard to demographics,14 (44%) of the students served were from underrepresented ethnic/racial groups (Hispanic/Latino, Black/African American, Native American or Alaskan/Pacific Islander). Of the 32 NSF funded students, 10 (31%) were 1st generation college students and 8 (25%) self-reported as being economically disadvantaged.  With funding from a UM Faculty Allies for Diversity grant, the infrastructure of the REU program was leveraged to provide support to an additional student over the award period. This student was fully funded (stipend, housing, meals and travel) by the NIH MARC-USTAR - Maximizing Access to Research Careers &ndash; Undergraduate Student Training in Academic Research - Program and the grant covered miscellaneous program expenses. Three students were funded by the Center for CH functionalization program.             Last Modified: 11/12/2020       Submitted by: Cherie R Dotson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
