<AbstractNarration>NON TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel adaptive and responsive polymeric materials represent an intriguing class of soft nanomaterials with interesting properties.  The PI will investigate a class of these nanomaterials whose molecules also include molecular branches that contain electrical charges.  These provide a unique ability to alter their physical properties under weak external stimuli such as changing chemical environment, temperature, or others.  The PI will be focusing on the understanding of the molecular behavior of these soft nanomaterials using advanced characterization techniques. The morphing and self-assembly of these materials so as to adopt local macromolecular shapes and nanoscale properties makes them strong candidates for prospective applications in environmentally-friendly processing, energy harvesting, controlled drug release, adaptive surfaces, and ion-exchange selective membranes.  Another major component of this project is the involvement of the graduate students in cross-disciplinary fundamental research, as well as collaborations with national labs in the US and abroad.  The research and educational aspects of this project promote the national interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on the assembly of multi-responsive miktoarm block copolymers with dual-type responsive arms as well as novel classes of branched oligomeric and polymeric ionic liquids with peculiar ionic transport properties.  The PI adopts a comprehensive strategic approach to the understanding of global materials properties by ascertaining the behavior of individual macromolecules and their assemblies in the condensed confined state.  Special attention will be paid to molecular reorganization during phase transformations and coil-globule collapse of individual arms.  The effect of polymer arm composition and length, arm number and macromolecular topology on their global and local conformation, intramolecular state, and responsive behavior in dilute solutions and within interfacial surface layers will be investigated.  Conformation, microstructure, and morphology of these materials will be considered in conjunction with their mechanical properties and permeability with emphasis on tailored ionic and macromolecular transport.  A broader impact of this project is anticipated through the enhanced training of graduate and undergraduate students with an emphasis on their early involvement in an interdisciplinary, fundamental research with active recruitment of underrepresented groups and intense collaboration with polymer chemistry and materials labs in the USA and Europe.</AbstractNarration>
