<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project includes applications ranging from peak load shifting, grid buffering for renewable energy input, frequency regulation, and chemical conversions.  As the percentage of energy from renewables on the grid increases, energy storage will be essential to stabilize the supply and demand.  Currently, 20-40% of wind energy is often stranded due to the inability to capture the energy in the peak generation periods.  Germany, Europe, Japan, Korea, and other countries are funding significant efforts in energy storage projects.  Energy storage is also a critical need for all of the United States armed services, including microgrids for forward operating bases.  While batteries can demonstrate very good round trip efficiencies, they suffer from self-discharge, capacity fade, and high cost.  Flow batteries separate the reactant and product storage from the electrode active area, enabling higher capacities through merely adding more storage.  Many systems have not been practical in the past due to low energy density values, but fuel cell and electrolysis developments have provided pathways to higher energy density.  Advances in these areas would find immediate commercial interest, and address key strategic areas related to energy security and grid stabilization and resiliency.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this Phase II research project are: 1) flow field design for balanced fluid distribution in both operating modes and minimization of shunt currents; 2) selection of catalysts and membranes for reversibility, durability and efficiency requirements; 3) integration and testing of Proton components with the Sustainable Innovations embodiment hardware; 4) scale up to a full size stack and operation in both modes at SI; and 5) development of a performance model in collaboration with SI based on the final configuration.  These objectives address present limitations in energy storage solutions.  While traditional batteries can demonstrate very good round trip efficiencies, they suffer from self-discharge, capacity fade, and high cost.  Flow batteries separate the reactant and product storage from the electrode active area, enabling higher capacities through merely adding more storage.  Many systems have not been practical in the past due to low energy density values, but fuel cell and electrolysis developments have provided pathways to higher energy density.  Advances in these areas would find immediate commercial interest, and address key strategic areas related to energy security and grid stabilization and resiliency.  The anticipated result will be a highly efficient, durable flow battery system with high power density.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  In Phase 1 and 2 of this project, Proton Energy Systems, Inc. d/b/a Proton OnSite (?Proton?) demonstrated feasibility of developing a hydrogen-bromine electrolyzer which produces hydrogen at elevated pressure.  The device is based on proton exchange membrane cells, which enable separation of the reactants and products as they are produced.  Hydrogen bromide is fed to the anode side of the cell where it is oxidized, generating bromine and protons.  The protons selectively cross the membrane and are then recombined to form pure hydrogen gas on the other side of the membrane.  The outlet stream can be pressurized by putting a back pressure regulator on the outlet port so that the electrochemically generated hydrogen pressure builds up to the regulator value.  Thus, pure hydrogen is formed and compressed.  The cell can either be used as a flow battery, or purely for hydrogen and bromine production for industrial purposes.  The advantage of this technology over traditional water electrolysis is the efficiency of the bromine reaction, which reduces the energy required for hydrogen production while producing another value-added chemical.  In Phase 1, a test system was designed and built and feasibility was demonstrated with cells showing good early stability and performance similar to state of the art hydrogen-bromine flow batteries which were not designed for elevated pressure hydrogen.  The advanced design also enabled cost reduction vs. the water electrolysis cell.  The main goals of the Phase II program were to optimize the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) performance and bipolar plate cost to be competitive with other flow battery technologies, and scale up to a 300 cm2 stack using cell technology from Skyre.  Over the course of the 2-year Phase II program, significant progress was made in meeting cost and performance targets.  The metal components and precious metal catalysts for the electrolysis oxygen evolution electrode were successfully eliminated for the flow battery.  Material and manufacturing technology for successful production of bipolar plates with low efficiency losses and formation of required detailed features was also developed.  For the first year of the program, Kansas University worked to refine and optimize new hydrogen catalysts to improve the robustness of the catalysts to any bromine crossing over the membrane. Ultimately, the membranes selected effectively blocked bromine poisoning, and catalysts were selected for optimum performance at the lowest platinum loading.  Sustainable Innovations (now Skyre) was brought on a as a new partner to speed development of a scaled up H2/Br2 flow battery system and stack. Proton worked to develop a low cost, manufacturable bipolar plate header design which mitigated parasitic losses while optimizing fluid distribution.  The Skyre plate design was incorporated with these features and Skyre developed a 300 cm2 stack and a 5kW system to evaluate the final deliverable components.    This technology represents an alternative to current solutions for energy storage, which is becoming increasingly important as renewable energy penetration on the electrical grid grows.  Flow batteries in general are attractive from a scalability perspective, and hydrogen bromine is one of the lower cost chemical systems.  The hydrogen bromine system also has the advantage of enabling cross-linking between infrastructures such as the electrical grid, transportation grid, and chemical processing, for added flexibility and deployability of the captured energy.  Finally, electricity is the major lifecycle cost for hydrogen production via electrolysis, which is reduced by over one third by replacing the oxygen electrode with bromine.  Advances in these areas have immediate commercial interest, and address key strategic areas on the government agenda related to energy savings and green technology.
