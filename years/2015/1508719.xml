<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project employs a beam of low energy positrons (anti-matter of electrons) to provide unique information about novel nano-dimensioned materials including Graphene and nano-porous gold.  When positrons annihilate with electrons both the positron and the electron disappear and the mass of the two particles is converted completely into energy in the form of gamma rays.  The sudden removal of the electron from an atom can result in a highly excited state and the emission of electrons called Auger electrons.  The energy of the annihilation induced gamma rays and Auger electrons provide chemical information about the atoms with whose electrons the positron annihilates.  Previous NSF funded research by the investigators has shown that low energy positrons can be used to selectively probe the properties of the top layer of atoms at the surface due to the high probability of a low energy position becoming trapped at the surfaces of materials at the time of annihilation. The research in this project is aimed at exploring the use of positron spectroscopy to probe two dimensional materials like graphene.  These materials are extremely thin.  The ability to probe the topmost atomic layers of these materials provides a unique, non-destructive method for studying these materials in order to understand the mechanisms by which adsorbed atoms can be used to change important chemical and physical properties of these materials.  Another important goal of the project is to determine the feasibility of using gamma rays from positrons annihilating at the internal surfaces of nanometer sized pores inside a novel class of materials called nanoporous metals to provide the information needed to  understand the reason why these materials can greatly speed up desirable chemical reactions.  The penetrating nature of the gamma rays permits measurement to be made on internal surfaces. The outcome of the activity will ultimately enhance the usage of low energy positron beam based spectroscopic techniques for research in chemical and biological sciences as well as in engineering. The project provides training to graduate and undergraduate students in fields of great relevance to high tech industry surface science, including low dimensional physics, ultra high vacuum technology, charged particle beams, radiation detection, nanostructure synthesis, material characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low energy positrons are extremely sensitive to material surfaces due to a high probability that they will become trapped in an image potential state at the time of annihilation.  The research in this project is aimed at understanding the interaction of low energy positrons (~ 1eV) with two dimensional materials including graphene/graphene oxide sheets.  The trapping of positrons on two dimensional materials will be investigated using Auger like process called Auger mediated sticking as well as through positron annihilation induced Auger electron emission and Positronium formation. Measurements of positron sticking probability to graphene and graphene oxide surfaces are aimed at providing information on the contrasting surface properties of these materials and demonstrate the feasibility of using low energy positrons as a multi-parameter spectroscopic technique for two dimensional structures. Low background emission of electrons from graphene is expected to throw light on the physical origin of low energy electron tail seen in Auger emission produced by positron annihilation.  A second major goal of this project is to explore the ability of using Doppler broadening gamma spectroscopy to probe the internal surfaces of nano-porous metals.  The high probability that positrons will become trapped at the internal surfaces combined with the ability of gamma rays to escape from the internal surfaces indicate that positrons can be used to characterize the internal surfaces of the pores. These studies are aimed at using the unique information obtained from positron spectroscopy to understand the interaction of gases with the strained internal surfaces of nanoporous metals. These studies will allow for better control of catalytic activity of these novel materials as well as contribute to the development of high density hydrogen storage materials using nanoporous metals. The project represents the first exploration of the use of positron beams for the investigation of functionalized graphene, graphene oxide sheets and nanoporous metals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Experiments were carried out using the newly developed positron beam system at the University of Texas at Arlington. This system is capable of depositing variable energy positrons onto a sample and detecting the 511 keV gamma ray photons produced as a result of electron-positron annihilation in timing coincidence with electrons ejected from the sample as a result of the positron bombardment.   By sticking positrons on the surface and observing the signals resulting from the annihilation of the positrons with the atoms in the top-most atomic layer it was possible for us to observe the changes to surfaces during catalysis, electrochemical and photochemical reactions that are used for the storage or production of energy or for the breakdown of environmentally harmful chemicals.  Measurements from a single layer of graphene grown on polycrystalline copper resulted in the first direct observation of a unique electron emission process which was initiated by the annihilation by a positron of an electron in the valence band of graphene.   An Auger process is one in which an absence of an electron (hole) is filled by an electron from a higher energy level and the excess energy is giving to a third electron which can then have sufficient energy to escape the material.   Previous measurements using our positron beam to create holes in the valence band through an annihilation process provided the first direct evidence for a process in which all three electron states in the Auger process are in the valence band (which we have termed a VVV process.  We developed a theoretical model in conjunction with other scientists from which we derived a quantitative estimation of the efficiency of the VVV Auger process may help researchers in the field of solar cells, and photo-catalysis to increase the efficiency of the photo conversion process.  Studies of the quantum mechanical sticking of very low energy positrons to surfaces (Auger mediated positron sticking or AMPS) were also carried out for graphene, graphite, silicon and copper. In AMPS, a positron "sticks" to the surface transferring the energy of the positrons and the energy released during sticking to a surface bound electron which may escape the material.

The methods developed under this project resulted in the first experimental proof that positrons have a surface bound state on graphite and graphene. The sensitivity of the AMPS line shape to the surface electronic structure near the Fermi level has opened the doors to a new top atomic layer sensitive spectroscopic technique to investigate the surface electronic structure of samples using low energy positrons.    We performed experiments which demonstrated that the distribution of the energies of the gamma rays that are emitted when a positron annihilates with and electron can be used to determine the chemical composition of the surface.  When a positron and electron annihilate they both disappear, and their mass gets converted completely into energy in the form of gamma rays.   The motion of the electrons and positron causes a Doppler shift which broadens the range of energies emitted.  Quantification of this broadening was used to reveal chemical information at the site of positron annihilation.  Presently there are few direct methods to investigate inner surfaces of porous materials and most the techniques utilized for inner surface studies carry signals from surfaces that are obscured by information from the bulk of the sample. The annihilation gammas which are generated by annihilation of positrons can penetrate the sample and the chamber in which the chemical reactions are carried out without any loss of information.
