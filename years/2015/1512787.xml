<AbstractNarration>1512787&lt;br/&gt;Figueroa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Domestic wastewater typically contains calorific energy which represents five times the energy required for treatment. Municipal wastewater treatment plants have the potential to capture most of the energy present in the waste organic matter, but smaller utilities treating less than 10 million gallons per day, which account for 97% of the wastewater treatment systems in the US, are often reluctant to adopt complex and often costly resource recovery systems. A treatment paradigm using anaerobic mainstream wastewater treatment for primary and secondary treatment can meet secondary standards, harvest the energy from organic matter and eliminate separate sludge digestion. The anaerobic baffled reactors - expanded granular sludge bed - microscreen system represents a transformational change in the wastewater treatment paradigm from multiple separate capital-intensive energy-consuming unit processes to fewer simpler unit processes that maximize energy productivity and payback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advantage of the proposed coupled hybrid anaerobic reactor system lies in the advancement of knowledge regarding the factors that control the microbial and solids dynamics to meet the performance goals of a low complexity energy-neutral system at ambient wastewater conditions. The hypothesis is that a hybrid anaerobic baffled reactors - expanded granular sludge bed - microscreen can treat raw wastewater to meet secondary standards and produce stoichiometric amounts of methane. The supporting objectives are to: 1) optimize the hybrid anaerobic reactor system with real wastewater at bench- to demonstration-scale to produce secondary treatment quality, 2) generate stoichiometric amounts of methane from BOD removal, 3) develop a process model to predict anaerobic baffled reactors - expanded granular sludge bed - microscreen performance, and, 4) evaluate the life cycle impacts of the hybrid system by characterizing details needed to add the linked expanded granular sludge bed and microscreen to an existing anaerobic baffled reactors life cycle assessment. The expected outcome is increased process understanding for design and implementation of a low complexity hybrid anaerobic system that will generate energy while conditioning the water for autotrophic nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery. The team brings decades of experience in microbial process modeling, microbial ecology, environmental engineering, wastewater plant and utility operations. The research will facilitate state and federal regulatory acceptance and industry adoption of new energy positive technology for full-scale applications. The expected transformative results will be disseminated via numerous avenues including workshops at regional council meetings and national conferences, as well as a technology diffusion workshop that will engage change agents from the wastewater treatment industry. The proposed project will also broaden participation in STEM, as the PIs will continue their extensive history in this area by recruiting as researchers undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups, as well as low-income first-generation community college students via our partnership with a local community college. The investigators will also translate conceptual content from these studies into established pre-college outreach efforts to inspire interest in STEM fields in local disadvantaged and predominantly minority school districts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Motivation.</span> Domestic wastewater contains resources such as chemical energy containing compounds, water, and nutrients. Under the current wastewater treatment paradigm (i.e., aerobic biological treatment), resources are consumed rather than recovered. Anaerobic bioreactors are a potential alternative to traditional aerobic wastewater treatment because of their ability to generate methane-rich biogas while simultaneously reducing volumes of waste sludge and decreasing the burden of waste disposal. Multiple-compartment anaerobic bioreactors, such as the anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR), are particularly attractive due to their low complexity and ability to generate methane with no energy input. Despite these advantages, ABRs are not used for wastewater treatment in the United States because information is limited on operation and performance under colder wastewater temperatures (e.g., 10 C). The microbial, chemical and physical processes under actual operating conditions can be better understood using pilot-scale testing, which can be used to develop a more complete understanding of the microbial community dynamics for modeling and performance prediction and to inform design guidelines to facilitate to widespread implementation. In addition, the lifecycle impacts relative to conventional wastewater treatment technologies are important to study. To address these needs, this research examined the performance of two low-complexity pilot-scale multiple-compartment anaerobic bioreactors in three different areas: (1) characterizing bioreactor performance over varying temperatures for organic removal, suspended solids removal, and methane generation; (2) modeling lifecycle impacts and energy-generating potential relative to conventional wastewater treatment approaches; and (3) characterizing methanogenic community structure over time and space within both bioreactor systems. The pilot-scale anaerobic bioreactors characterized in this study were: (1) an existing four-compartment ABR located at the Plum Creek Water Reclamation Authority in Castle Rock, CO, and (2) a three-compartment ABR coupled with an anaerobic fixed film reactor, which was constructed at the Mines Park Wastewater Test Bed in Golden, CO.
