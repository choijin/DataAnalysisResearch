<AbstractNarration>Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improve research and teaching at his home institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences.  The goal of the project is to develop a new generation of agents for the control of microorganisms. This may lead to the development of novel microbial control strategies leading to the development of new techniques and protocols with applications in engineering as well as the physical, biological, medical and pharmaceutical sciences. This project will enhance the research experience and training of undergraduate students at Howard University. Additionally, it will produce knowledge, tools, and applications that will: help sustain existing scientific and educational efforts at Howard University; be integrated into existing courses; and help develop new courses with an interdisciplinary focus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to identify and characterize small-molecule inhibitors of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate phosphotransferease system (PTS). The studies specifically aim to measure specificity and potency of candidate compounds to inhibit PTS activity; to evaluate the broad-spectrum inhibition of biofilm formation by candidate compounds; and to establish the mechanism of action of selected candidate compounds. Given the connection between PTS activity and biofilm formation, this project hypothesizes that the identification of small-molecule modulators of the PTS will reveal new tools and approaches to regulate biofilm formation by interfering with microbial metabolic functions. Identification of novel interactions between chemical structures and targets will result from this project.</AbstractNarration>

The PTS also regulates several cellular functions, including chemotaxis, glycogen metabolism, and biofilm formation. Given the established connection between PTS activity and biofilm formation, this project hypothesized that the identification of small-molecule modulators of the PTS would reveal new tools and innovative approaches to control microbial biofilms. The broader goals of the project were to identify and characterize small molecule inhibitors of the PTS and to evaluate the potential application of these small molecules as chemical agents to control the formation of microbial biofilms.

Investigating these compounds may lead to the characterization of new agents for the control of microorganisms.  The intellectual merits of the study were as follows:  This study identified seven compounds suspected of inducing biofilm formation in static conditions. Four compounds were shown to affect viability, proliferation, and/or cellular activities of mammalian cells. One compound, 2-oxo-4-phenyl-2,5-dihydro-3-furancarbonitrile (MW01), particularly induced Vibrio cholerae to grow preferentially in the biofilm mode in a mechanism that involves interaction with pyruvate.  We identified that MW01 has a similar structure to two previously characterized natural products also bearing biofilm modulatory activities: the ralfuranones and flavipesins. Ralfuranones are aryl-furanone secondary metabolites that are extracellularly secreted by a soil-borne bacterium, Ralstonia solanacearum. Ralfuranones have been shown to contribute to the virulence of R. solanearum by influencing quorum-sensing signaling pathways. Flavipesins are butenolide natural products originally isolated from a marine-derived endophytic fungus, Aspergillus flavipes AIL8. Flavipesin A exhibited modest antimicrobial activity against two Gram-positive pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, as well as antibiofilm activity against mature S. aureus biofilms.  MW01 specifically impeded the planktonic mode of growth of V. cholerae cells prior to the formation of biofilms in cultures ? without manifesting bactericidal properties ? at concentrations as high as 200 ?g/mL. In minimal medium supplemented with pyruvate, MW01 at concentrations as low as 0.05 mg/mL induced biofilm formation at levels comparable to those of an Enzyme I mutant. NMR and mass spectrometry studies were used identify a change in methyl group chemical shift along with disappearance of the methylene protons of MW01 after reaction with pyruvate, leading to the formation of complex intermediary structures that may be responsible to the induced formation of biofilms in Vibrio.  Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that MW01 interacts with PTS elements upstream of the phosphotransferase cascade, through interaction with pyruvate. However, they do not preclude the possibility that MW01 promotes biofilm formation by V. cholerae through other pathways.  The broader impacts of the project were as follows:  Eight underrepresented minority undergraduate and two underrepresented minority graduate students were trained in biofilm engineering, drug discovery and biochemical engineering research at Howard University. All (5 women and 3 men) undergraduate students have successfully graduated with their B.S. in chemical engineering and now hold engineering position in industry or are enrolled in graduate and medical schools.  Two underrepresented minority female undergraduate students in chemical engineering submitted first-authored research manuscripts to peer-reviewed scientific journals.  Over 30 underrepresented minority high school students were introduced to STEM principles and biochemical engineering research through outreach projects developed from this study. The students were enrolled in three public high schools in the Washington metropolitan area: Sidwell Friends School, Phelps Architecture, Construction, and Engineering (Phelps A.C.E) High School and Friendship Public Charter School - Tech Prep (Friendship PCS Tech Prep) Academy.  Our research group held professional development days for STEM educators from Friendship Public Charter School and gave over 20 presentations at local, national and international conferences, and lectures and seminars during the length of the project.  Additionally, the research enterprise at Howard University was increased by the acquisition of a MultiFlo microplate dispenser, lectures on biofilm engineering and drug discovery facilitated by the research project, and collaborations initiated across disciplines at Howard and with researchers at California State University Dominguez Hills.
