<AbstractNarration>The Southern Ocean plays a dominant role in the oceanic uptake of excess (anthropogenic) carbon, yet the extent of this air-sea exchange process is poorly represented by earth system models, and its future projection remains highly uncertain. The O2/N2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean Study (ORCAS) seeks to advance understanding of the physical and biological controls on air-sea exchange and uptake of O2 and CO2 in the vast Southern Ocean. This will be investigated through intensive airborne surveys of atmospheric O2, CO2, related gases, their state of equilibrium, along with other ocean surface properties over diverse biogeochemical regions adjacent to the southern tip of South America and the Western Antarctic Peninsula. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ORCAS will utilize the NSF Gulfstream V (GV) aircraft equipped with a suite of high-precision in situ and remote sensing instruments, on 14 flights over a period of 6 weeks in austral mid-summer, from Punta Arenas, Chile, out over the Drake Passage, and with concurrent overflights of the ARSV LM Gould sampling the Palmer LTER site. ORCAS observations will be guided by, and used to test a suite of ocean biogeochemistry models to improve our understanding of key processes and feedbacks in this under sampled yet climatically important region of the world.</AbstractNarration>

In addition to the core O2 , CO2 , and related gas measurements supportedthrough this grant, research elements funded separately included hyperspectral remote sensing of theocean surface and characterization of the emissions of biogenic reactive gases over the Southern Ocean.  Subsequent to the campaign, the University of Colorado component of ORCAS has focused on modeling and analysis of the CO2 and CH4 gradients measured from the surface up to 12 km to better understand the magnitude and seasonal cycle of the surface ocean air-sea gas exchange of CO2. As described above, the measured vertical gradient in CO2 during ORCAS is significant considering estimates of air-sea gas exchange based on surface pCO2 measurements and estimated surface wind speeds. The lack of an observed CH4 vertical gradient during ORCAS for the surface up to 8 km and a large vertical gradient immediately above that (8 to 10 km) relative to the observed gradients in CO2 is further evidence that the measured gradient in CO2 is primarily driven by air-sea gas exchange.    The University of Colorado team has also focused on doing a similar analysis of the vertical gradient in CO2 for many other flights that have been done over the Southern Ocean over the last 9 years. This analysis shows that not only is there consistency in the observed CO2 gradient measured by ORCAS and other aircraft campaigns completed in other years but that this vertical gradient significantly decreases during the austral winter months.    Kathryn McKain (CU) has also compared ORCAS CO2 observations to those simulated by the nine different inversion models participating in the Orbiting Carbon Observatory Modeling Intercomparison Project (OCO2-MIP) to explore the role of surface versus vertically resolved (aircraft and satellite) assimilation data for reproducing the observed vertical gradient, and the subsequent impact on the Southern Ocean sink estimate among the models.
