<AbstractNarration>IEEE INFOCOM is the premier forum to showcase the latest research outcomes that cover a wide range of topics in communications, data networking and wireless networks. Researchers attend this forum to identify methods of improving their work, and seek feedback from fellow researchers on their work. For students, this is a valuable avenue to interact with other top-tier researchers in very informal and friendly manner. This award will support students at U.S. institutions to attend the 2015 IEEE INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications which will be held in Hong Kong April 26-May 1, 2015. Priority will be given to students who will benefit from attending this workshop, but are unlikely to attend due to the unavailability of travel funding. In addition, applications from female and underrepresented groups in higher education are greatly encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested travel funds will allow graduate students conducting research in the field to attend high-caliber technical presentations, be exposed to state-of-the-art research, and interact with leading researchers and fellow graduate students. The impact to the students' careers from attending INFOCOM 2015 is expected to be substantial, since they would be unable to attend this event without the support of this grant.</AbstractNarration>
