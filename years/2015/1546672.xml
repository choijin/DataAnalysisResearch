<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of researchers and their students in a symposium entitled "Life on the Edge: Biology, Physiology, and Evolution of Extremophiles" which will be held at the annual Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) meeting in January, 2016 in Portland Oregon, home to the Center for Life in Extreme Environments (OMSI) at Portland State and the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.  The aims of this symposium are to: (1) synthesize current knowledge of the biology of organisms that live in very extreme environments (extremophiles) by uniting a diverse group of researchers who do not generally attend the same meetings, and (2) provide a platform to discuss how to best use the enigmatic nature of these unique organisms as a tool for informal STEM education.  The very nature of the existence of extremophiles is often enough to pique public interest in the biological sciences.  Thus, we have partnered with OMSI to offer a workshop to SICB attendees that includes dynamic, hands-on and reflective activities designed to introduce basic science communication concepts and techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of researchers and their students in a symposium entitled "Life on the Edge: Biology, Physiology, and Evolution of Extremophiles" which will be held at the annual Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) meeting in January, 2016 in Portland Oregon, home to the Center for Life in Extreme Environments (OMSI) at Portland State and the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.  Recent advances in fields such as high-throughput sequencing, metagenomics, and transcriptomics are now uncovering some of the mechanisms by which organisms are capable of not only surviving, but also thriving, in extreme ecosystems.  One shortcoming in the field of extremophile biology is that researchers tend to collaborate largely with those studying similar taxonomic groups, resulting in a lack of overall communication in methodological and theoretical advancements.  This lack of broad-scale interaction is of particular concern in light of the potential impacts of climate change on these ecosystems. To foster new collaborations across broad disciplines in extremophile biology, researchers from diverse taxonomic and academic backgrounds have been invited to participate in a symposium.</AbstractNarration>

From the deepest corners of the ocean, to hot bubbling springs, to the freezing Polar Regions, the extent to which organisms are capable of persisting in environments uninhabitable by humans continues to push the boundaries of our understanding of life. Recent advances in genetics, physiology and sampling technologies are beginning to uncover some of the mechanisms by which organisms are capable of not only surviving, but also thriving, in extreme ecosystems. One shortcoming in the field of extremophile biology is that researchers tend to collaborate largely with those studying similar organisms, resulting in a lack of overall communication. This lack of broad-scale interaction is of particular concern in light of the potential impacts of climate change on these ecosystems.  A symposium of this scope had never been attempted before: to foster new collaborations across broad disciplines in extremophile biology, we brought together researchers using different biological approaches on a variety of organisms.  In addition to local speakers from the Center for Life in Extreme Environments, this award provided funding for five faculty (4 women, 1 man), one graduate student, one science educator and one post-doc to present their research at the symposium. Research topics included deep-sea eel evolution, physiology of invertebrates living in oxygen-minimum zones, physiology of desert pond fishes and Antarctic fishes, evolution of deep sea and polar invertebrates, evolution, ecology and symbiosis of hydrothermal vent microbes and ecology of microbes that live in lakes hidden under Antarctica.   The very nature of the existence of extremophiles is often enough to pique public interest in the biological sciences, providing scientists a good point of engagement.  Many scientists are keen to create more impactful outreach activities but lack the confidence or training to do so.  Thus, we partnered with informal education and communication specialists from the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry to offer a workshop to SICB attendees that included dynamic, hands-on and reflective activities designed to introduce basic science communication concepts and techniques.  The symposium was highly successful and well received.  On average, between 50 and 100 SICB participants attended each of the symposium talks and a complementary session of 20 speakers and 4 posters held on the following day was also well attended.  The workshop symposium had over 30 participants and attendees provided positive feedback to the OMSI science educators.  Six of eleven symposium participants had papers submitted and accepted to a special volume of Integrative and Comparative Biology, the cover of which also features extremophiles.  Several new collaborations among symposium attendees working on microbes, invertebrates and vertebrates are underway, making good advances toward bridging the gap between extremophile biologists as we look to the future.
