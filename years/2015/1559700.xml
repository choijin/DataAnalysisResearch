<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Wake Forest University (WFU) School of Medicine offers multidisciplinary biomedical engineering opportunities involving accidental trauma research that aim to prevent, mitigate, and improve the fundamental understanding of injury. Objectives of this REU program emphasize research training, education, mentorship, and focus on inspiring under-represented students to pursue biomedical research and career opportunities. Students from underrepresented groups including women, minorities, and students with minimal exposure to STEM research from community colleges or universities without undergraduate research opportunities will be recruited. The intended impact is to impart training and education on engineering research and the research process, cultivate lasting mentoring relationships, and foster an interest in research and higher education in the REU participants. Research training, education on the research process and professional development topics, and mentorship are provided to REU participants through imaging and mechanics-based projects related to the prevention, mitigation, treatment, and scientific understanding of accidental trauma. Contributions from the offered projects within this REU Site project will include development of injury prediction models, vehicle and sporting safety improvements, and advancements in osteoporosis prevention, surgical fixation of injuries, trauma resuscitation procedures, and cancer radiation therapies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a ten-week summer program, student activities will include hands-on research training that encourages participants to make creative contributions to research projects. Participants will receive mentoring from faculty and graduate students, and will attend a weekly Research Training Seminar Series, networking, outreach, and social events. Participants will write an abstract and give an oral presentation at an Undergraduate Summer Research Symposium. Twelve students each year will be selected based on evidence of academic achievement, high potential to benefit from the research experience, and the student's contribution to the geographic, ethnic, and gender diversity of the REU participant group. Students will gain a fundamental understanding of injury research, will develop into more independent researchers, and will be encouraged to pursue educational and career opportunities in biomedical research. Research findings will be disseminated via publications and presentations co-authored by REU participants. The REU Site program is based at Wake Forest University (WFU) Health Sciences, with locations of proposed research at WFU Innovation Quarter and WFU Baptist Health.</AbstractNarration>

This program has been highly successful in exposing undergraduates to trauma research and generating new ideas and engineering solutions for treating and/or managing injuries. The REU was hosted on the WFUSM campus of the joint graduate Virginia Tech-Wake Forest University School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences (VT-WFU SBES) program. It involved interdisciplinary collaborations between 12 faculty in the Biomedical Engineering, Health &amp; Exercise Science, Orthopedics, Radiology, and Radiation Oncology Departments. Students were trained in fundamental imaging and biomechanical techniques and exposed to research cases of accidental trauma. The program engaged students in biomedical engineering trauma research, via hands-on training, complex problem solving, and scientific presentation and communication. The overarching goal was to have each participant contribute to an integral piece of a research project by gaining new research skills, allowing them to see how their research ties into the big picture of preventing, mitigating, and improving the scientific understanding of accidental traumatic injuries.</p> <p>To accomplish our four <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">goals</span></strong>:</p> <p><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>12 faculty mentors provided hands-on research training in biomedical engineering to the participants with an intellectual focus on the investigation of mechanistic, physiological, anatomical, and other fundamental factors related to accidental cases of traumatic injuries.<strong></strong></p> <p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Education on the research process, ethics, scientific dissemination, and societal impacts was provided through the mentored research experience, educational seminars, and student authorship of 34 conference abstracts, 68 poster/podium presentations, 4 journal articles, and a patent.<strong></strong></p> <p><strong>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Faculty<strong> </strong>and graduate students provided daily mentorship to the participants, encouraging a more independent role in the lab as they gained knowledge, built confidence, and made creative contributions to their projects.<strong></strong></p> <p><strong>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Biomedical engineering research opportunities were provided to<strong> </strong>underrepresented groups (23 women; 10 minorities) and students at colleges without undergraduate research (5 students).<strong></strong></p> <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Intellectual Focus</strong>&nbsp;of the IMPACT REU Site was multidisciplinary engineering research in medical imaging and biomechanics to investigate mechanistic, physiological, anatomical, and other fundamental factors related to trauma.
