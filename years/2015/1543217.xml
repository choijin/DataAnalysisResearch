<AbstractNarration>This project identifies the factors of the Exploring Computer Science curriculum that affect students? future trajectory in computer science. Exploring Computer Science (ECS) is a curriculum and professional development program that was developed at UCLA, with NSF support, with the goal of broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in in computer science and establishing a national framework for public school computer science education. The ECS professional development program is designed to prepare teachers to implement the inquiry-based activities while guiding teachers to build a classroom culture that is inclusive of all students. This project investigates the extent to which the ECS curriculum and professional development program is achieving its basic outcome goal. This project addresses two research questions: (1) Does the quality of ECS implementation influence the probability that female and minority students will pursue and succeed in further computer science coursework in high school?; and (2) How do the components of ECS work together to contribute towards the probability that female and minority students will pursue and succeed in further computer science coursework in high school?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project extends current research on the relationship between teaching practices, student perceptions of teaching practice, student aspirations, and actual course selection. It provides an empirical investigation of the underlying logic model of ECS. The research involves case studies in Chicago Public Schools that have participated in the ECS professional development program and are implementing ECS. The empirical evidence from this project will be used to make enhancements to the ECS curriculum and professional development program as well as provide validation of whether the ECS program is meeting its stated goal of contributing to broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in computer science. The NSF supported ECS curriculum is the largest national effort to establish secondary school level computer science education. This work contributes to a much larger national effort.</AbstractNarration>

The Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum and professional development program serves as a core foundation for supporting enactment of this policy. ECS seeks to contribute to broadening the participation in the field of computer science through activities designed to engage students in computer science inquiry around meaningful problems. The genesis of the work that led to the graduation requirement started four years earlier in 2012 with the NSF-funded Taste of Computing project --- a teacher-led initiative bringing together CPS teachers, CPS administrators, educational researchers, and university computer science faculty. The partnership, which later became known as CAFECS, brought the ECS curriculum and professional development program to Chicago. From 2012--2019, over 45,000 students have taken the ECS course in CPS. This research project proposed to investigate two primary questions to better understand how ECS contributes to broadening participation by inspiring students to pursue further computer science. The two research questions are:</p> <ol> <li>Does the quality of ECS implementation influence the probability that female and minority students will pursue and succeed in further computer science coursework in high school?</li> <li>How do the components of ECS work together to contribute towards the probability that female and minority students will pursue and succeed in further computer science coursework in high school?</li> </ol> <p dir="ltr">Figure 1 shows the proposed logic model at the start of the research. Implementation quality would be measured through coding lesson observations using the Charlotte Danielson Framework for Teaching (FFT) and the Tripod 7C student survey. We developed our initial hypotheses about the connections between FFT and 7C based on the Measurement of Effective Teaching Study (METS) that examined these relationships across 1892 4th--8th grade math and English classrooms. While METS did not examine the relationship between 7C and Expectancy-Value-Cost (EVC), it did examine the relationship to academic outcomes and to feeling of well being in the classroom. We used the results of those analyses to develop hypotheses about the relationships between 7C scales and EVC scales. EVC is a construct that is highly correlated with future career choices, so we also hypothesized that it would be predictive of future course taking.</p> <p dir="ltr">Researchers video recorded 21 ECS lessons. At the end of each lesson, students completed a survey with the Tripod 7C and EVC scales. The videos were rated for each of the eight observable FFT dimensions by four raters that were certified in the FFT methodology. Table 1 provides the Kendall Tau correlation table between the FFT dimensions and the 7C scales. Figure 2 provides a diagram of the results showing the correlations between the FFT dimension and 7C scales. Black arrows indicate a positive correlation and red arrows indicate a negative correlation. The results indicate that the 7C Confer dimension is a key dimension as it is statistically correlated with all of the FFT dimensions. The Confer scale measures the extent to which the teachers give students time to explain their ideas and the teachers respect the ideas that students share. This construct is also a core value of the ECS Equity strand. Table 3 shows the percentage of CPS teachers in general and ECS teachers in the study achieving proficiency in each of the FFT dimensions. Both the CPS and ECS teachers are least proficient at Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques (3B), which is also the dimension that is most conceptually related to Confer. On the Engaging Students in Learning (3C), CPS teachers had a low proficiency (57%) in comparison to ECS teachers who demonstrated high proficiency (81%).&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr">Figure 2 shows the relationship of the quality of ECS implementation on the probability that students took additional computer science coursework. Several of the 7C dimensions were correlated with Expectancy, including the Confer dimension. Expectancy in turn is correlated with the probability of taking additional computer science. In addition, several of the 7C dimensions are correlated with Value and negatively correlated with Cost. In turn, Expectancy and Value are positively correlated and Cost is negatively correlated with the end of course assessment of computational thinking.&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr">Intellectual Merit: The results of this research provide evidence that the quality of ECS implementation influences the probability that students will succeed in ECS and pursue additional computer science coursework. The results also indicate that both the equity and inquiry dimensions of ECS are critical for achieving quality implementation.</p> <p dir="ltr">Broader Impacts: We have identified key Tripod 7C scales that are influential in predicting the important ECS goals of ensuring success for all students and broadening participation of students pursuing computer science. The student survey provides an economical means to track the quality of ECS implementation and provide additional resources to ensure that the course is successful in broadening participation.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/03/2020<br>      Modified by: Ronald&nbsp;I&nbsp;Greenberg</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div
