<AbstractNarration>Understanding scientific and technical progress requires measures of both the rate and direction of resources directed to innovative efforts and the outputs produced.  This project leverages advances in computational power to map the evolution of research fields based on researchers? project portfolios in ideas spaces.  The research takes advantages of shocks, such as changes in policies and research costs, to use empirical research techniques to understand the factors that affect the directions into which science and technology evolve.  This work has important implications for understanding the rate and direction of technological change.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project uses techniques based on machine learning and natural language processing that measure the incidence and configuration of keywords in published research to quantify the similarity of groups of such articles to define idea space. And to subsequently measure the ways in which idea space evolve in response to shocks in research costs and public policies. The research applies these techniques to three contexts: (a) how changes in the costs of research materials affect research trajectories in motion-sensing technology, (b) how researchers in quantum computing change their project portfolios in response to a controversial approach that differs from an established research paradigm; and (c) how pharmaceutical firm research trajectories change in response to news about rivals? drug discovery projects&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project include analyzing the impact of scientific and technical progress on the rate and direction of innovative efforts and outputs. Specifically, our goal is to leverage advances in computing power and empirical research techniques to map the evolution of research fields and researchers’ project portfolios in "ideas space."    As part of this project, our research develops machine learning based techniques that we employed to evaluate the ways in which sets of ideas evolve in response to shocks in information, research costs, and public policies. Our findings include:   The automation of research tasks that previously required substantial human labor presents opportunities for scientists to expand their research portfolios and for policymakers to accelerate the rate and broaden the direction of knowledge accumulation. Our research shows that, contrary to concerns that automating technology displaces individuals from work tasks, such an automation increased the production of ideas and induced researchers to pursue ideas more diverse than and distant from their original trajectories. Research technology costs influence cumulative innovation by altering the composition of expertise in teamwork. Sufficiently large reductions in the cost of research technology leads to greater collaborations across research domains. Risk aversion leads pharmaceutical firms to underinvest in radical innovation. Also, pharmaceutical firms are more likely to terminate clinical trials in response to learning about the failure of rival firms’ drugs and to turn to the market to acquire drug projects from other firms, rather than developing internally.
