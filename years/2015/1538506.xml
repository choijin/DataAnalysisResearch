<AbstractNarration>The recent tendency in urban excavations for high-rise buildings is the use of cofferdams which at times are responsible for the majority of the resulting ground movements.  As a result of these projects, the allowable ground movements imposed by underground regulatory agencies have been drastically reduced, calling for improvements in the observational and analytical methods used in movement control plans.  This award supports fundamental research on the methods of analysis and design of urban cofferdams and presents an opportunity for advances in soil-structure interaction behavior of deep excavations.  Design recommendations considering the proposed effects in the performance of cofferdams do not currently exist in the United States.  Two urban cofferdams serve as the test bed of this research: the first was built for a structure projected to be the tallest building in the United States, and to have the deepest basement ever built in the city where the structure was proposed; the second was built for the One Museum Park West building in Chicago, Illinois.  The fundamental knowledge developed in this research will inspire new methods of analysis and design of offshore structures, deep foundations, wharfs, and retaining structures, and will advance the understanding of the soil-structure interaction in other types of geotechnical projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge will be produced on the behavior of sheet pile interlocks in urban cofferdams under compression loading, the concrete material time-dependent effects on the behavior of cofferdams braced with reinforced concrete ring beams, and slippage and rotation at sheet pile interlocks for urban cofferdams braced with segmental steel ring beams.  Three-dimensional fully-coupled flow-deformation numerical analyses of urban cofferdams using advanced constitutive soils models and incorporating the small strain behavior of soils will be used in the analyses.  New design methodologies oriented for practice will be developed to incorporate the following factors into the design process: the material time-dependency of reinforced concrete ring beams, the structural compliance of steel ring beams and sheet piles, the slippage and rotation at sheet pile interlocks, and the installation of deep foundations and other structures inside of cofferdams.  The ultimate goal of this research is to create more sustainable and resilient urban environments by preserving and protecting existing infrastructure, which is often compromised when excessive deformations occur.</AbstractNarration>

Allowable ground movements imposed by underground regulatory agencies have been drastically reduced in recent years as urban environments get more congested, calling for improvements in the observational and analytical methods used in movement control plans. In this research, the behavior of urban cofferdams braced with segmental steel or reinforced concrete ring beams were studied. Fully coupled flow-deformation numerical analyses in two and three dimensions were developed on urban cofferdams using advanced constitutive soil models and incorporating small-strain stiffness soil behavior.</p> <p>The soil parameters that resulted from this research for the use of advanced numerical tools were determined and calibrated from conventional geotechnical tests and parameters like water content data or overconsolidation ratios. Using those parameters, the numerical simulations were capable of reproducing one-dimensional compression loading, unloading, reloading, and strength-stress-strain characteristics of compressible clays following numerous stress paths mobilized by urban cofferdams. The effect of reproducing the stress history of the materials in an urban cofferdam were studied and reproduced adequately in the numerical environments. Very small differences between computed and observed wall movements and displacements were found in this research. Slight differences were attributed to limitations of axisymmetric modeling that were superseded in the research by analyzing bracing systems and construction sequences in three dimensions.</p> <p>Interlocked connections between sheet pile sections tend to have a natural slack, which leads to additional deflections of the support system in an urban cofferdam. Interlocks are subjected to either tensile or compressive stresses which cannot be accurately calculated using equivalent rectangular cross sections. Large variations in the computed lateral wall deflections were obtained in this research by assuming either negligible or infinite rotational stiffnesses of sheet pile interlocks. Adding filler materials to close the gaps between sheet piles and bracing system, preloading ring beams, or using reinforced concrete ring beams cast in direct contact with the sheet pile walls are alternatives to prevent additional deformations arising from these construction effects that significantly affect the performance of urban cofferdams. The location and timely placement of the first level of steel ring beams in an urban cofferdam and its bracing stiffness characteristics can largely affect the performance of an urban cofferdam. Compliances in the retaining wall system arising from gaps left open during construction between segmental steel ring beams and sheet piles largely contributed to the resulting ground deformations. Predicted performance will not match measured performance if ground movements associated with every pre-excavation stage are not considered in the analyses of large excavation projects that use temporary cofferdams as part of the construction activities.</p> <p>It was also found in this project that concrete time-dependent effects in bracing systems on urban cofferdams greatly affect the excavation performance and these effects become predominant when calibrating numerical models to match observed performance and improve future designs in urban excavations. Concrete aging and shrinkage were predominant effects on the cofferdam performances since the stiffness of the bracing system is mostly derived from time-dependent strength gain of the materials, which need to be carefully controlled and evaluated in the design and construction phases of an urban cofferdam. Very low temperatures during concrete curing of bracing systems in urban cofferdams also largely affect the maximum wall deformations and ground surface settlements. Ground movements from urban excavations are prevented only when the circular bracing system is completed, and materials are allowed enough time to cure. Lack of stiffness of concrete bracings results in ground movements beyond the strict limits imposed by regulatory agencies to protect subsurface structures and utilities. Considering temperature, curing time, installation sequence, and time dependent effects of concrete bracings in the design process is crucial to the performance of deep excavations. Excavation designs ignoring the proposed effects would conceal the risk associated with potential cracking of nearby infrastructure.</p> <p>Recommendations regarding the influence of excavation rates, hydraulic conductivity of soils, cofferdam excavation geometry, and type of retaining system for the performance of urban cofferdams and deep excavations were issued and a method for predicting excess pore water pressures and groundwater behaviors was proposed in this research. Drainage conditions during excavation activities were highly influenced by the excavation rate and hydraulic conductivity of the soils. The ratio excavation rate to soil hydraulic conductivity was found crucial for the accurate predictions of the performance of deep excavations. A method to predict excess pore water pressure development was proposed and recommendations regarding the type of analysis (i.e., drained, undrained, or fully coupled) associated with the site and excavation conditions were issued and verified in light of reported excavation case histories.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/22/2019<br>      Modified by:
