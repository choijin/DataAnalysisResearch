<AbstractNarration>Just as archeologists have methods to analyze material objects to better understand human history and culture, linguists have methods to analyze recordings and manuscripts to better understand the relationship between different languages or how a single language has changed throughout time. As populations stop speaking them, languages, especially unwritten ones, become even more fragile than physical sites and all knowledge held within may easily be lost. This is true of endangered languages all over the world including Kawaiisu, a Uto-Aztecan language of Kern County, California, where just two Native American elder speakers remain. The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American languages.  This project will involve a linguist, Kawaiisu second language speakers, and the elder speakers to transcribe, translate, and analyze recordings covering fifty years of Kawaiisu speech. The broader impacts of this include broadening participation as Native American citizen scientists research their heritage language, as well as the implementation of an exemplary partnership between academic linguists and Native American communities. The resulting analyzed Kawaiisu materials will be publicly accessible and will generate data of scholarly interest to linguists and to other disciplines that depend on language-related material (i.e., anthropology, history, geography) in their research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, technology has left a record of the sounds of Kawaiisu. The oldest audio recordings, made in 1958 by Sheldon Klein, clearly present the cadence, sounds, and linguistic patterns of 60 years ago, when Kawaiisu was in more regular use. Later Klein recordings from the 1980s are the bridge between these older ways of speaking and later usage in fluent conversations video-recorded at culturally significant sites by the Kawaiisu Language and Cultural Center between 2011 and 2015. Less than 10 percent have been translated.  Kawaiisu is Uto-Aztecan language family, which has played an important role in many areas of linguistics, including linguistic classification, historical reconstruction, typology and theoretical linguistics.  Despite this importance, there are still many questions about the family, including Kawaiisu and its place in the Numic branch of the family. This project will augment scientific knowledge of Kawaiisu and its relatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will investigate language change via this newly annotated documentation. The conversational data spans a critical period in history when major shifts were occurring within indigenous communities, as well as throughout California and the United States. The involvement of Kawaiisu team members ensures that the knowledge gained will remain with the community as they mobilize data in their linguistic and cultural revitalization programs.  Recordings and transcriptions will be archived at the California Language Archive at the University of California, Berkeley, where they will be accessible to other researchers and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Of the world's approximately 7,000 known languages, three quarters are spoken by Indigenous peoples. This rich cultural diversity has been severely threatened by colonization and globalization, leading to academic and community-driven movements to document endangered languages and to bring them back into use. Nuw&auml; abigip, also known as Kawaiisu, is the Uto-Aztecan language of the nuw&uuml;m, the Kawaiisu people of the southern Sierra Nevada region in Kern County, California. Two first-language speakers remain, sibling Elders Luther Girado and Lucille Hicks. A small group of adult learners are able to converse with these Elders today.</p> <p>In 2011 Elders identified places in their homeland significant to their families and to community history.

The team focused on the conversations that KLCC had recorded and on audio interviews recorded in the 1950s and 1980s by Sheldon and Carol Klein. The goal was to compare and analyze changes to nuw&auml; abigip over the 50 years spanned by the recordings, a period during which the language changed from one that was used in the community daily to its endangered status today. Prior documentation of Kawaiisu had focused on word lists and some grammatical description of the language of earlier generations. Well-annotated natural conversations would fill the gap and shed light how speakers use the language today.</p> <p>A key strategy was to train adult learners to transcribe - to listen to and type each conversation - and then describe in linguistic terms the building blocks of nuw&auml; abigip. They could then incorporate what they discovered into their own spoken language. This very important element of the project was part of the community&rsquo;s ongoing reclamation and revitalization of their Indigenous language. Each completed transcript included a detailed analysis of each part of each word and sentence and ended with an English translation. Elders Luther and Lucille were central as teachers and as interpreters. Of tremendous benefit to transcribers was a shared, concise set of grammar definitions for quick reference that had been reviewed by fluent speakers.&nbsp;</p> <p>The time necessary to transcribe each recording, about one hour per minute, created a tremendous intimacy with community stories about the places and the history of the Kawaiisu homeland. Of the transcribers, eight were related community members who were also related to the people in the older Klein recordings. The stories that they transcribed reconnected younger Kawaiisu people with family and history that had been unknown to them. They gained a dawning understanding of the world view of the Elders. The interest and enjoyment brought about through family connections sustained the community team throughout this challenging research project. The high-level language and technical skills developed over the course of this project will remain in the Kawaiisu community, increasing capacity for future projects. In this way goals for linguistic documentation and for language revitalization and reclamation complemented each other.</p> <p>In the end, the project team accomplished three main goals.</p> <p>1. Created 24 hours of fully-analyzed Kawaiisu conversations and narratives.</p> <p>2. Added 776 new entries with to the existing dictionary.</p> <p>3.
