<AbstractNarration>The National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) Higher Education Research and Development Survey (HERD) data are collected through a survey instrument sent to approximately 900 universities and colleges annually. Each of these institutions collects data to respond to the survey in their own way. Most rely on highly labor-intensive processes to gather and classify information about expenditures and research projects in terms of the character of the work, funding sources and fields of science.  The ad-hoc expenditure classification methods employed are dependent on the individuals carrying out the task as they develop the necessary evaluation skills over time.  There is potential for a lack of consistency over time and across institutions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develop the tools necessary to leverage university administrative data to automate the essential and time-consuming step of classifying projects by science areas, purpose and sponsor type  required to respond to the NCSES HERD Survey.  The results will provide a better understanding of the similarities/differences in the data reported for HERD and STAR METRICSÂ® and provide suggestions about how data collection for each source might be improved.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project applied supervised machine learning techniques in an effort to pilot a lower-cost and more consistent methods of gathering the information collected by the Higher Education Research and Development (HERD) survey administered annually by the NSF?s National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics.  The data collected by the HERD survey are a crucial source of information about the nation?s investments in basic science.  They are the primary source of data for scholars studying the federal and private support of science and engineering at institutions of higher education.  At the same time, university administrators regularly refer to these figures to track and understand their performance relative to peers.      Using historical award information from the University of Kansas the research team developed a set of software tools to predict the scientific field and purpose of each project based on project titles and associated meta-data.  Prediction accuracy was generally greater in scientific fields for which more projects were available to train the software.  Our analysis of the results suggests that machine learning offers the potential to accurately characterize scientific fields and, if widely adopted, would enhance the consistency of classification across the approximately 700 universities that report data for the HERD survey.  Use of such methods also has the potential to reduce the cost to institutions of responding to the HERD survey.
