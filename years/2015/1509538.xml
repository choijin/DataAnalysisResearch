<AbstractNarration>The wireless communications industry has experienced exceptional growth in the past decade resulting in sleek low-power handheld devices with multi-purpose functionality such as text-messaging, voice communications, social networking, on-line shopping, internet browsing, interactive TV, and mobile video blogging.  Around 3 billion people currently use these smart handheld devices and demand is expected to grow substantially in years to come. Though the functionality these devices provide is phenomenal and far exceeds what most envisioned even a few years ago, the anticipated capabilities of next-generation devices will far eclipse what is available today.  A critical component in these devices is an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that converts radio frequency analog signals into digital signals that can be processed by powerful processors which serve as the brain of smart devices.  This research project focuses on the design of next-generation, self-testing ADCs that have superior performance and can operate at extremely low power levels.  This will extend the time between recharging of batteries in handheld devices. The significance of this work is in providing a key component necessary for the future development of smart handheld devices.  The expected outcome of this research is advanced ADC designs with enhanced performance and reliability while reducing power dissipation and increasing battery life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trend in handheld personal communication platforms is to digitize the entire spectrum thereby allowing implementation of all radio functions in software. Next-generation receivers for handheld personal communication platforms will require very broadband analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with both high resolution and low power consumption. This work focuses on the development of ADCs for radio frequency receivers with unmatched power efficiency and performance.  The goal of this research is to introduce a practical method for realizing broadband ADCs for wireless communication systems with superior resolution and low power characteristics.  To achieve this goal, five objectives have been established: 1) Develop a low-power high-resolution broadband time-interleaved hybrid successive approximation register (SAR)/pipelined architecture through the co-development of circuit structures and calibration techniques; 2) Develop a sub-ADC structure with inherent absence of non-recoverable errors suitable for at-speed background calibration of linear, nonlinear, and timing errors; 3) Develop a phase clock generator architecture with fine-phase digital control enabling accurate timing skew calibration; 4) Develop a background at-speed calibration algorithm that achieves optimal joint gain/offset/discontinuity/nonlinearity/phase-skew calibration; and 5) Design, fabricate, and test a prototype hybrid time-interleaved background-calibrated broadband ADC in a state-of-the-art process to experimentally verify performance potential of this approach.  In terms of broader impacts, this research will have significant impact on efficiency, reliability, and production costs of electronic devices and will contribute to ensuring the sustainable growth of the consumer electronics industry.  Graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be recruited and mentored under this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the design of high-performance low-power time-interleaved Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs)  with digitally-assisted calibration.  These ADCs are a critical component in the emerging wireless communication infrastructure that is essential for the predicted development of ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) technology of the next decade.   To achieve low-power, a time-interleaved Successive Approximation Register (SAR) architecture was used.  Two of the biggest challenges on the practical implementation of high-speed high-resolution SAR ADCs are timing skew in the interleave clock and mismatch between the sub-ADC structures. The timing skew challenge was addressed by developing a phase clock generator using falling-edges of the master clock to define the falling-edges for the clocks of each of the sub-ADCs so that a low-resolution digital to analog converter (DAC) could be used to trim the small residual skew for each of the sub-ADC clocks. The mismatch between the sub-ADC architectures was addressed by developing a Built-In-Self-Test (BIST) circuit that could be used to not only measure offset and gain errors but also nonlinearities in the sub-ADCs.   With a subsequent calibration based upon BIST testing results, gain errors, offset errors, and nonlinear errors in the sub-ADC were minimized by on-chip calibration.  Since the matching requirements of the sub-ADC structures in time-interleaved ADCs is critical, and since inherent mismatch of components will not provide adequate matching, calibration of the sub-ADC architectures is critical.   In this work, a test-based approach to calibration was adopted whereby the sub-ADCs are actually tested and the test results are used as input to the calibration algorithm.  Test-based calibration offers potential for better matching performance than simpler algorithmic calibration.  Testing of an ADC requires an input test signal.  Most ADC testing approaches require a test signal that is 3 or 4 bits more linear than the target performance of the ADC device under test (DUT).  Unfortunately on-chip generation of a test signal that is 3 or 4 bits more linear than the DUT is more challenging to design than the ADC itself.  In this work a relatively recent approach to testing what uses two low and unknown linearity signals as test inputs but that have a precise functionally relationship was adapted.  With this approach, the unknown test signals can be several bits less linear than the DUT and easily generated with imprecise nonlinear components.  Though different precise functional relationships can be used, a simple level-shift was used here because a precise level shift can be practically implemented with imprecise components.   With this approach, the magnitude of the shift is not critical, only the constancy of the shift over the entire input range of the nonlinear test signal.  In this work, a subradix-2 R2R DAC was used for the test signal generator.   It is shown that a 14-bit subradix-2 R-2R DAC that is only 7-bit linear can be used for testing a 15-bit ADC with required linearity performance at the ? LSB level.  The precise level shift is achieved by simply toggling one additional resistor that is connected to the R-2R network between ground and VREF.  Since performance at only the 7-bit level is needed for the test signal generator, the R-2R DAC can be implemented on-chip with minimal area overhead.                Though code-density tests are widely used for linearity testing of ADCs, code-density testing requires a large number of samples and a large memory during the testing.  Neither is an  attractive BIST solution.  To circumvent this problem, a strategy for reducing the amount of data require for testing based upon the USER-SMILE testing algorithm was adapted.   The USER-SMILE algorithm reduces data acquisition requirements by recognizing that many of the samples that are gathered in standard code-density tests contain redundant information about characteristics of the DUT.   By not gathering redundant information, the number of samples required for testing can be dramatically reduced.                The BIST circuitry based upon the 14-segment subradix-2 R2R DAC was designed and fabricated in a 40nm TSMC process.  Die area for the DAC  circuit was 0.02mm2.   Experimental results show it is suitable for testing static linearity of a 15-bit ADC to the 0.5LSB level.                This work has applications well-beyond the target application of high-speed high-resolution time-interleaved ADCs.   Testing and calibrating ADCs that are operating at the 15-bit level should have applications for non-interleaved devices as well.    The most important application of this work, however may be maintaining system performance throughout the useful service life of a system.   The performance of high-resolution ADCs naturally deteriorates gradually with time due to both normal wear mechanisms, environmental stress, and even environmental variations.  Since the BIST approach proposed here is inherently insensitive to the specific characteristics of the test signal generator, in-field test and calibration can be initiated throughout the service life of the ADC thereby providing ?as new? performance even when the ADC approaches the end of the useful service life.
