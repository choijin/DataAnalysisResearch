<AbstractNarration>1540495(Kunz)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks funds to partially cover publication costs and travel expenses for student participants to the conference entitled, "International Conference on Model Integration across Disparate Scales in Complex Turbulent Flow Simulation (ICMIDS)", to be held at The Pennsylvania State University, June 15-17, 2015.  This specialized symposium will be attended by world leaders in the area of multi-scale turbulence simulation. The symposium emphasis will be on new research ideas, methods, and directions. It will also foster cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers and collaboration in these areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research to be presented in this Symposium can lead to improved understanding of a number of problems affecting the energy, biomedical, defense, and environmental sciences that have come to depend on complex turbulent flow phenomena. The meeting topics include 1) Modeling the interfaces between surface viscous layers and outer turbulent flow regions in wall-bounded turbulent flows, 2) Fundamental distinctions among "RANS-like," "URANS-like," and "LES-like" models, 3) The physics of forced non-stationary nonequilibrium high Reynolds number boundary layer flows, 4) Simulation of meso-micro scale couplings in geophysical turbulent flows, 5) Surface flux models (momentum, heat, etc.) when the surface viscous layer(s) cannot be resolved or do not exist due to roughness, 6) Modeling the interactions between large-scale unsteady spatially varying turbulent environments and small-scale high Reynolds number boundaries, 7) Interactions between the ocean surface and internal waves, 8) Transport and mixing in highly anisotropic stratified turbulence, 9) Turbulent fluxes of biogeochemical constituents, 10) Field and laboratory experiments on the couplings among complex nonstationary disparate turbulence scales.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Financial Support for International Conference on Model Integration across Disparate Scales in Complex Turbulent Flow Simulation (ICMIDS)  Executive Summary  $15000 was requested and awarded from NSF to provide targeted financial support to the First International Conference on Model Integration across Disparate Scales in Complex Turbulent Flow Simulation (ICMIDS), which was held at Penn State University June 15-17, 2015. A conference overview of the meeting appears below.  The final program for ICMIDS appears as Appendix A of the final project report.  All submitted presentations are available through a DROPBOX link until  12/31/16. Interested parties can gain access to this list by sending an  e-mail to ICMIDS conference co-chair Robert Kunz at rfk102@arl.psu.edu  Conference Overview International Conference on Model Integration across Disparate Scales   in Complex Turbulent Flow Simulation (ICMIDS) ICMIDS, June 15-17, 2015, State College, PA, USA Considering the growing importance of complex flows that couple turbulence dynamics over disparate ranges of length and time scales, the combined modeling, algorithmic, numerical and dynamical complexities within high performance computing environments have created major challenges that will be addressed in this focused meeting of researchers who wish to exchange experiences, discuss challenges and develop solutions for future advancement. ICMIDS will comprise invited, podium and poster presentations and discussion forums:   Technical and poster presentations focused on multiscale turbulence simulation and model integration with a focus on: New ideas, methods and insights with recent and developing research. Integration of physics, modeling, numerics, gridding, simulation and data management and analysis. Communication between experiment and simulation with focus on physics.   Invited perspective presentations from leaders in turbulence modeling, numerical methods for turbulence simulation, and experimental fluid dynamics. Poster presentations focused on applications with modern computational, modeling and/or experimental methods.    The following topics are of particular interest for this conference:  Modeling the interfaces between surface viscous layers and outer turbulent flow regions in wall-bounded turbulent flows (e.g., hybrid URANS-LES, Scale Adaptive Simulation (SAS) methods, contrasting "pure URANS" and "hybrid URANS-LES") Fundamental distinctions among "RANS-like," "URANS-like," and "LES-like" and difficulties in coupling between disparate model classes. Modeling the interactions between large-scale unsteady spatially varying turbulent environments and small-scale high Reynolds number boundary dynamics (e.g., interactions between atmospheric or oceanic turbulence and utility-scale wind turbines, water turbines, aircraft and maritime vessels). Surface flux models (momentum, heat, etc.) when the surface viscous layer(s) cannot be resolved or do not exist due to roughness, and special difficulties associated with lack of horizontal homogeneity and/or non-planar topography. Field and laboratory experiments on the couplings among complex nonstationary disparate turbulence scales for physical insight and model validation and on near-surface dynamics relevant to surface models. The physics of forced non-stationary high Reynolds number boundary layer flows, including nonsteady boundary layer separation and transition. Simulation of meso-micro scale couplings in geophysical turbulent flows. Models for unsteady turbulent inflow boundary conditions.  This symposium is specifically directed at new developments for the integration of models across disparate scales coupled with grid, algorithmic and numerical requirements and at fundamental physics underlying dynamical interactions across disparate scales in complex turbulent flows. We seek a balance and strong discourse between experiment and simulation and between dynamical complexity, modeling simplification, and limitations associ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
