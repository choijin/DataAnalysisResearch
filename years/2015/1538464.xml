<AbstractNarration>Optical lens systems are ubiquitous in industry, consumer products, and scientific instruments. Conventional optical lenses control the path of light by bending it at the interfaces. This limits the degree-of-freedom available for designing a lens. The traditional solution of combining multiple lenses adds expense, size, and weight to the system. Gradient index lenses use non-homogenous materials to create a varying refractive index and continuously bend the light throughout the lens. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Indusry (GOALI) award supports fundamental research to provide knowledge needed to create a new additive manufacturing process for producing gradient index lenses using optical-quality inorganic (glass-based) materials. The new additive manufacturing process can fabricate gradient index lenses with performance that could not previously be realized. Beyond gradient index lenses, the ability to use additive manufacturing to deposit high quality glass will benefit integrated photonics and electronics packaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new additive manufacturing process utilizes a novel filament-fed, laser-heated process to deposit transparent glass. Multiple filaments, fed at different rates into the molten region, will produce spatially varying properties by changing the composition of the deposited glass. The first research objective is to test the hypothesis that bubble generation in printed glass is a result of phase separation during laser heating. Glass specimens, deposited under conditions to preclude bubble entrapment, will be sectioned to determine the onset of bubble nucleation and measure subsequent evolution. In-situ spectroscopy of the molten region will identify chemical changes during processing. These results will be compared to the temperature profile determined from modeling and pyrometery. Bubble formation will then be corroborated with thermodynamic models for gas saturation in glass. The second research objective is to test the hypothesis that mechanical agitation of the molten region during deposition will enhance mixing and lead to a smooth index profile. The feed-rate of colored filaments will be dithered at different frequencies and amplitudes. The mixing will be quantified by microscopic observation of the color distribution in printed specimens. The third research objective is to determine the effects of the thermal profile on the diffusion coefficient between layers. Prisms will be printed using different layers of optical quality glass. The local index of the printed prisms will be measured as a function of position before and after prolonged annealing in a furnace and compared to the nominal profile.</AbstractNarration>

This involves feeding one or more glass filaments into the intersection of a laser beam and workpiece.  While similar to metal wire-fed laser additive manufacturing processes, the physics of the glass process are significantly different than metals. Notably, the thermal conductivity of glass is much lower than metals and glasses retain significant viscosity up to their vaporization point, without a well-defined melting temperature.  In addition, the final properties of the glass are strongly dependent on the cooling rate and the lack of ductility requires management of the thermal stresses.  Transparent glasses have very low visible and near-IR absorptance, however, a CO2 laser excites phonon modes and efficiently heats silicate glasses.  The principal objective of the project was to print transmissive optics, particularly, gradient index optics.  This required investigating several factors; minimizing bubbles, maximizing index-homogeneity, geometrically precise deposition, in addition to the diffusion of different glasses during printing. A custom 4-axis motion system was constructed using Aerotech stages and a NI controller.  These provided a build volume with sub-&mu;m repeatability.

An analytical solution for constant properties can quickly estimate the process window while a finite-difference solution allows calculation for variable properties (including the radiation enhanced thermal diffusion captured by the Roseland approximation).  This guided exploration of other effects such as changing the laser wavelength to produce volumetric absorption in the glass which improved deposition rates.  It also allows modeling the fictive temperature of the glass in response to the heating cycles and suggests heating profiles for homogenous glass deposition.   These results were used to create several fully dense lenses using different glasses.  Smooth surfaces were created by using the laser to reflow the top surface of the glass. These lenses were tested and illustrated basic focusing behavior.  Basic modulation transfer function measurements did not detect any effects of index inhomogeneity.  These experiments also showed the importance of accurate material placement to produce figure.  An iterative learning controller was investigated using the pyrometer signal for feedback control.  Along with maintaining the constant feed direction relative to the printing velocity vector, the controller significantly improved the accuracy of the track positioning.  In parallel with these experiments, diffusion studies were conducted to measure how different glasses diffused into each other during laser heating.  Unfortunately, these studies revealed that the printing process does not support sufficient diffusion for gradient index lenses over the heating intervals required for printing.  However, these measurements suggested the possibility of using the process to deposit waveguides and SMF-28 single mode optical fiber was printed and used to guide light along non rectilinear paths on the substrate.  Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy, showed minimal diffusion of the core.  Understanding the nature of the process permitted printing free-standing structures, including trusses, non-conductive springs and tubing.  Overall, the project supported the thesis work for 1 PhD and 2 MSME students.  15 undergraduate students were supported and conducted research under the project.  The project produced 3 journal publications (4th under preparation), and 12 conference papers including one that won a Best Paper Award.
