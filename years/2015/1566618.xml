<AbstractNarration>Representation theory is a branch of algebra studying symmetries, especially symmetries of linear mathematical structures, using groups of invertible matrices. In this project the linear structures are themselves finite matrix groups, or more generally matrix groups whose entries satisfy divisibility properties with respect to a fixed prime number. Geometrical and combinatorial techniques will be brought to bear to study representations of these groups, especially in the important case when the representing matrices themselves have entries that satisfy divisibility properties.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will advance the representation theory of reductive algebraic groups. The PI will study questions stemming from a promising new method using the notion of categorical centers, as well as questions related to unipotent representations and character sheaves, canonical bases of Hecke algebras, "almost characters" of p-adic groups, and W-graphs associated to involutions.</AbstractNarration>
