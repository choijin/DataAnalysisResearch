<AbstractNarration>This award supports U.S. participants in the Research School "Second Latin American School of Algebraic Geometry and Applications (II ELGA)" held in Cabo Frio, Brazil from June 1 to 12, 2015. The school is the second of its kind in Latin America, with the first ELGA being held in Argentina in 2011. The school has several goals: to introduce a new generation of students and researchers to the subject of Algebraic Geometry, to present a broad view of recent developments in the area, to disseminate new problems and directions of research, to promote greater interaction among researchers and students, and to help young researchers build a network of collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic Geometry is a fundamental field of research, with applications and connections throughout mathematics and other sciences. The first week of the school will include four mini courses (of 5 hours each) which cover some of the most active topics in the field, as well as reflect the diversity and scope of modern Algebraic Geometry. The main speakers are prominent algebraic geometers: Robert Lazarsfeld, Olivier Debarre, Barbara Fantechi, and Burt Totaro. The second week will be a research conference, with 28 talks given by world class researchers. The hosting institution is IMPA (Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics), in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. There are 6 organizers working in several different countries: Brazil, Chile, Italy, France, Mexico, and the United States. The II ELGA is the only event in Latin America in two years devoted to Algebraic Geometry and explicitly aimed at Ph.D. students and young researchers. The organizers expect a large participation and impact for the school, as Algebraic Geometry is much on the rise in Latin America. The success of the first ELGA school, along with the high reputation of IMPA and the speakers, should guarantee a large international participation. The award funds will be used to support Ph.D. students and young researchers working in the United States. More details about the meeting can be found at http://www.impa.br/opencms/pt/eventos/store/evento_1503.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the International Science and Engineering (ISE) Section of NSF.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         Algebraic Geometry is a fundamental field of research, with applications and connections throughout mathematics and other sciences. The general goal of this research school was to train young mathematicians working in Latin America in some of the most active areas of research in Algebraic Geometry, as well as to promote greater interaction among researchers and students. The research school was the second of its kind in Latin America, with the first one being held in Argentina in 2011. The II ELGA was the only event in Latin America in two years devoted to Algebraic Geometry and explicitly aimed at PH.D. students and young researchers.   There were four mini-courses and 28 research talks given by top researchers during two weeks. There were a total of 129 participants (85 Latin America, and the rest from the US and Europe). There were a total of 67 students.  The school contributed to the training in the field of Algebraic Geometry by     connecting students to high quality current research in the field, through mini-courses and research talks, giving young researchers opportunities to present their own research through poster presentations and short talks,  promoting strong interaction among participants and helping to build new collaborations.    The NSF grant was used to cover the expenses of several young researchers (seven PH.D students, one postdoc, one Research Instructor) working in US universities. Out of the nine NSF funded participants, four were women. Three of the NSF funded participants presented their work at the conference. One student started a new collaboration and at least two papers were finished during the conference. Many participants said the mini-courses inspired them to think about new projects.
