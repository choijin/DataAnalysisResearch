<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support to a group of three PI's and an experienced senior faculty associate to work on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, a particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC machine and ATLAS, a large particle detector facility, were built as basic science tools using funds from NSF and other agencies around the world. One of their primary objectives was to find the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful "Standard Model" (SM) that accounts for so much of the existence of, and forces between, known particles forming the matter in the universe. This effort has been successful.  The next step in the experiments is to look for evidence for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) that might, for instance, account for the presence of the mysterious "Dark Matter" that makes up so much of the mass of the universe. The LHC is about to begin run 2 at almost twice the energy ever explored in detail before. It is possible that particles from BSM could materialize at the higher energy. Two Higgs decay types, whose observation relies on techniques developed by this group, could provide the key to seeing BSM for the first time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will continue to train their algorithms to search for decays of heavy neutral Higgs Bosons into tau+tau- lepton pairs. New algorithms will also be developed to compute the tau pair invariant mass (with two missing neutrinos). They will also search for long lived states seen to emanate from displaced vertices. The long-lived particle search will explore the use of boosted decision trees (BDT) to improve event selection sensitivity and ways of combining events in which the decays occur in ATLAS subsystems. The group also has a number of well-defined service roles in the overall operation of ATLAS, including maintenance of the muon system software, database and data quality. They also work in the development of the new inner pixel detector, part of the phase 2 upgrade program. The group supports a vigorous broader impact program through public dissemination of the results from ATLAS. They also focus on training under represented students. One of the PI's (Goussiou) is also a Co-PI in the NSF QuarkNet outreach program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The discovery of the Higgs boson, which is associated with the Higgs field that gives mass to the fundamental particles, was the last missing piece of the Standard Model that describes the interactions of the fundamental particles, quarks, and leptons. We know that the SM is incomplete; it does not address the dark matter, the matter-antimatter asymmetry of our universe, and neutrino masses.  To date, there is no evidence of physics not described by the SM.  During the period covered by this report, our research effort focused on evidence of physics  Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).   Part of our research team concentrated on searches for evidence of BSM physics in the Higgs sector. One aspect was a search for heavy Higgs bosons as predicted by supersymmetry or SUSY (SUperSYmmetry), which predicts a doubling of all of the fundamental particles and compensates for some serious technical problems of the SM.  The other was a search for simultaneous production of two SM Higgs bosons, predicted by several BSM models, most notably SUSY or the model of warped Extra Dimensions (ED) that gives a unified description of Gravity.   Our group made central contributions to both searches using the data collected by the ATLAS experiment up to 2016.  No evidence for SUSY or Extra Dimensions was observed, and stringent constraints were placed on various manifestations of SUSY or ED models. This resulted in published in professional journals and presentation of results at international conferences.  The other part of our team searched for evidence of long-lived particles BSM that result in displaced vertices in the ATLAS detector.   Virtually every extension of the SM that addresses the open issues noted above, either requires or includes long-lived particles that decay in the ATLAS detector far from the point where the LHC protons collide.  Many of these models include couplings of SM particles to particles that reside in a hidden sector that is not accessible except in the very high-energy collisions produced at the LHC.  For example, dark matter that has only gravitational interaction with matter in our universe could belong to a hidden sector and was trapped in our universe as it expanded and cooled following the Big Bang.  Our group developed special criteria to select candidate interactions and developed algorithms to reconstruct the decay point (vertex) for candidate displaced decay events.  We did a thorough search in the entire data collected by ATLAS up to 2014 and found no evidence of displaced decays or long-lived Particles.  We interpreted this null result in terms of several theoretical proposals for long-lived particles and set stringent constraints on the existence of such particles produced in proton-proton collisions at the center of mass energies of 13 TeV. Analysis of Run-2 data has led to the first draft of a paper that is going through the ATLAS experiment approval process  We intend to continue our searches for evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model in the upcoming LHC Run-3.
