<AbstractNarration>Software systems contain large amounts of textual information captured in various software artifacts, such as, requirements documents, source code, user manuals, etc.  The productivity of software developers and the quality of the software they produce directly depends on their ability to retrieve and understand the textual information present in software.  Since humans cannot process and comprehend so much text, researchers proposed the use of text retrieval techniques to help software developers with many of their daily tasks.  In order to be useful, these techniques need to be properly configured, which requires calibrating many parameters.  As most software developers are not experts in text retrieval, they need help in determining the best text retrieval configuration in a given software engineering context.  The configuration problem is one of the main obstacles in the adoption of such techniques in the software industry, because many approaches proposed by researchers do not generalize well.  The outcomes of this project will transform the way software developers address many of their daily tasks, allowing them to easily adopt the use of text retrieval during software development.  The results of this research will also be used in software engineering courses to support students in their projects.  The new practices that the students will acquire will help them become better software engineers.  The proposed research also brings together work from different computing research communities: software engineering and information retrieval and it will bring new knowledge in both fields.  Existing approaches using text retrieval in software engineering will become more practical, rather than just promising, facilitating migration from the lab into industry and academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this research will be: (1) a novel approach (called TRinSE2.0), which will achieve automatic, runtime query-based text retrieval configuration; and (2) improvements to important software engineering tasks, in practical settings, focusing on feature and bug location, impact analysis, traceability link recovery, and bug triage.  TRinSE2.0 will be evaluated on open source data, in the classroom, and in industrial settings.  The proposed work will transform the way text retrieval configuration is done in software engineering applications.  New, software-specific measures, as well as proven linguistic-based measures will be used to capture query properties in the context of software engineering tasks and data sets.  Machine learning algorithms will find the best configuration for a given query.  When writing a query to retrieve information from a software project, developers will get the best results, saving them time and effort, improving their productivity and the quality of their work.  The text retrieval configuration problem will no longer be heuristic-based, but it will become data-driven.</AbstractNarration>

The educational and broader impact component of the project was centered on augmenting the existing software engineering curriculum with findings from the performed research and on integrating the results of the research in educational material (tutorials and keynotes) for wide dissemination to other researchers at conferences and to students in classroom projects and teaching.  We delivered four Technical Briefings in top venues in the field, on "The Use of Text Retrieval and Natural Language Processing in Software Engineering". We also delivered keynotes and tutorials on text retrieval applications in software engineering at summer schools.  During the duration of the grant, four graduate students worked on topics related to this project under the direct advising of the PI and two of them were from underrepresented groups (Hispanic/Latino). This grant contributed to the training, professional development, and the fostering of networks for the supported graduate students, by allowing the PI to train and involve the students in research and by allowing the students to (i) present their papers at conferences and get feedback on their work from other researchers from academia and industry, (ii) attend research presentations at conferences and enrich their knowledge about the field, and (iii) interact with other students, researchers, and practitioners in the field, therefore building a professional network that can benefit their future careers.  We expect that our work on calibrating Text Retrieval techniques for specific software engineering tasks, data sets, and individual queries will have a significant impact on the large body of work in the field of software engineering, which makes use of Text Retrieval approaches. At the same time, improving Text Retrieval configuration for software engineering tasks will lead to better results returned by the tools making use of these techniques.
