<AbstractNarration>The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a powerful tool used in many big data domains, including multimedia processing, medical imaging, genomics research, astronomy, seismology for oil and gas reserve discovery, and malicious traffic detection in cybersecurity domains.  Building upon a recent breakthrough by the researchers behind this project, this award will develop the algorithmic and system foundations for practical high-spped DFT over sparse data sets. Addressing this goal involves highly interdisciplinary research encompassing ideas and techniques from mathematics, theoretical computer science, software design, and specific application areas such as wireless networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be multi-pronged, focusing on three main themes: (a) Algorithms: The PIs will develop a family of algorithms that are faster, simpler and more accurate than the current state of the art in sparse DFT. The new algorithms will be capable of incorporating priors on the structure of the data and apply to multi-dimensional data sets. (b) Software implementations: The PIs will develop software implementations of sparse FFT algorithms and explore algorithm parallelization for further reduction in power and processing time. (c) Applications: The PIs will apply these algorithms and empirically demonstrate them in the context of cost-effective networked system for delivering smart services for intelligent transportation systems using existing e-toll transponders.</AbstractNarration>

The Discrete Fourier Transform decomposes a signal (e.g., a sound wave sampled digitally) into its basic frequency components. The transform is the key component of any digital signal processing systems, and is used to process digitally sampled sound waves, images, videos or radio waves. Although fast algorithms for performing this transform (called Fast Fourier Transforms, or FFTs) have been known since the 1960s, over the last two decades much faster algorithms were developed for signals that are "sparse", i.e., consist of a small number of frequencies.  This collection of algorithms is collectively referred to as "Sparse Fourier Transforms".  The goal of this project was to obtain improved algorithms that leverage signal sparsity, and employ them in concrete application settings involving radio waves, notably localization using WiFi and direction of arrival detection in mmWave systems.   Localization: We have developed a system, called Chronos, which enables a single WiFi access point to localize clients to within tens of centimeters. The key tool is a novel algorithm that can compute sub-nanosecond time-of-flight of wireless signals using commodity WiFi cards. By multiplying the time-of- flight with the speed of light, an access point computes the distance between each of its antennas and the client, enabling localization. The key challenge faced by the system is that wireless signals typically travel along multiple paths, so the time-of-flight is not determined by a single parameter.  To recover the multipath profile of a signal, we need to efficiently solve a variant of DFT called Inverse Non-uniform Fourier Transform. To find the times of flight, Chronos adds a constraint that favors solutions that are sparse, i.e., have few dominant paths. This makes it possible to identify all significant multipath arrival times, and solve the problem. Our implementation of Chronos on commodity WiFi cards demonstrates that its accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art localization systems which use four or five access points, as opposed to a single card used by our system.     Direction of arrival detection: mmWave technology enables significantly higher transmission rates than WiFi. However, high-data-rate communication is only possible when the transmitter’s and receiver’s beams are well-aligned. This is a challenge, since any small movement of the sender device can break the alignment. To tackle this challenge, one needs to quickly detect the direction of arrival of the signal and steer the mmWave radios’ beams to keep them aligned. Our system, called Rapid-Link, accomplishes this task using the fact that in a typical setting there are only few directions (typically 2 - 3) from which a signal can arrive, even accounting for signal reflections.

In addition, the project made contributions to theoretical foundations of Sparse Fourier Transform, by developing significantly more efficient deterministic algorithms. Such algorithms are much more predictable than the current state-of-the-art randomized ones, whose behavior varies from execution to execution. The project has also made contributions to learning-based algorithms, which use machine learning techniques to improve their performance.
