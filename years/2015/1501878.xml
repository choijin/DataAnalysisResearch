<AbstractNarration>Nanotechnology encompasses subjects from physics and chemistry to emerging technologies such as photonics and biotechnology; and its market segments go beyond the traditional electronics and materials industries, to encompass segments as diversified as lubricants, paper manufacturing, cellulose, energy, consumer products and the food industry.  Forecasts of nanotechnology workforce needs cite 500,000 nanotechnology technicians needed by 2020. The ATE Regional Center, Nano-Link, will grow both an industry and education network to help meet these workforce needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nano-Link will continue and expand on the successes of the last six years by: providing nanoscience course content to an expanding set of colleges supporting the introduction of nanotechnology aware technicians into industry positions; increasing the number of multi-disciplinary educational modules to address the growing market segments; expanding outreach  to underrepresented minorities by creating culturally relevant educational content; and providing  college faculty best practices on interacting with industry as nanotechnology educational programs are updated and developed. Ongoing assessment of progress towards the project's goals will help inform the overall project evaluation, which in turn will contribute to building the knowledge base regarding the effectiveness of the network of project partners in achieving improvements in nanotechnology education and meeting regional workforce needs.</AbstractNarration>
