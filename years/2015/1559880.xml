<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this REU activity is to enhance workforce development through unique research in nanotechnology and to increase participation in graduate level education of women, underrepresented minorities, veterans, and persons from economically depressed areas. REU Site participants will be provided with interdisciplinary research opportunities that focus on the discovery of advanced performance multifunctional nanomaterials, which are designed concurrently with toxicity testing.  This emerging area of nanotechnology is significant to accommodate the dramatic increase in commercial nanoparticle production.  This is achieved through the development of enabling technology and fundamental research to generate high performance materials and address the environmental, health, and safety characteristics of nanoparticles.  This REU project leverages substantial research infrastructure as well as ongoing WVU-NIOSH collaborative research in nanotoxicology.  These initiatives have accelerated research and education in the nanosciences in West Virginia and create an exceptional nanotechnology training site.  A total of 18 faculty members from the WVU Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Physics, and Health Sciences are committed to serve as research mentors as part of a comprehensive training program that effectively fosters problem-solving skills critical to intellectual and research independence.  Participants learn about communication, collaboration, technical presentation skills, resume preparation, and graduate education.  Collegial relationships are developed through team-building activities and weekly interdisciplinary team meetings.  Several undergraduate participants will publish research results and all undergraduates present their work at the annual WVU Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium.  Involvement in this REU Site improves the scientific workforce by increasing participant retention in interdisciplinary STEM education.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;REU participants are trained on research projects that support the design of safer and more effective nanoparticles that have been characterized and assessed for potential toxicity.  The research activities focus on multifunctional nanomaterials and support improved material design with attention to properties that impact human and environmental health.  The REU Site provides a diverse pool of projects through 18 faculty advisors each supporting independent research integrated within three NanoSAFE areas of focus:  (1) design and fabrication of advanced performance nanomaterials, (2) biomolecular and inorganic material characterization, (3) and toxicity assessment.  These research foci support an iterative approach enabling researchers to realize high performance nanomaterials that can safely support manufacturing processes.  Faculty collaborate across research groups and students have access to cutting-edge technology in nanolithography, nanotemplating, material self-assembly, electrochemistry, spectroscopy, microscopy, fluidics, and unique tools required to elucidate complex facets of nanotoxicity.  Upon completing this REU experience, undergraduate students will actively contribute to innovative research that advances nanotechnology manufacturing, while receiving professional development throughout the 10-week summer activity through workshops, speakers, and scientific conferences.</AbstractNarration>

This strengthened their interdisciplinary communication skills.  Some students who participated in summer research made significant contributions to research endeavors and were co-authors on research papers.  Students also reported significant gains in their perceived skills and knowledge between the onset and conclusion of the 10-week research experience.   Notable areas of knowledge and skills included: formulating a hypothesis, developing/conducting a research project, analyzing data, giving/receiving feedback, dealing with setbacks, working independently on research, research skills, and career options in the sciences.     Broader Impacts.  A goal of the NanoSAFE REU program was to broaden participation in scientific research.  This REU program provided foundational tools that enabled students to develop and sustain practices that are necessary to engage in competitive research.  From 2016 to 2018 a total of 36 undergraduates were admitted into the NanoSAFE REU program.  Over the duration of the award the NanoSAFE REU cohort of 36 students was 72% Appalachian, 67% female, and 22% African American, Hispanic American, or Native American.  Most REU students (86%) were enrolled in predominantly undergraduate institutions.  The number of REU students who were first generation college students was significant (28%) and 22% of the participating students were rising sophomores.  Many REU participants (42%) had no prior research experience upon entering the program and 22% had only experienced limited or team based research.  During the summer program, the NanoSAFE REU students were introduced to academic labs and toured two government facilities including the research facilities at NIST in addition to NIOSH.  In addition, NanoSAFE REU students had access to professional development seminars at West Virginia University as well as NanoSAFE REU workshops.  These seminars and workshops included different sessions on research, graduate education, science communication, as well as different sessions on career mentorship led by professionals from West Virginia University.
