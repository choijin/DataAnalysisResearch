<AbstractNarration>The Dryad Digital Repository is a curated repository for data that are integral to the findings of scientific and medical publications. The repository receives data directly from original researchers, typically at the time of publication, preserves it for the long term, and makes it freely available for reuse. Through partnerships with journals, scientific societies and publishers, Dryad makes possible the successful implementation of a diverse set of data archiving policies. It is managed by the Dryad not-for-profit organization, which has a scalable and distributed source of revenue through one-time data publication charges, purchased both by organizations and individual researchers, and a secondary source of revenue, as well as a mechanism for stakeholder governance, through organizational memberships. This award will enable Dryad to achieve the scale required for sustainability through continued growth and extension to new research communities. At the same time, it will enable the continued growth of the repository's valuable collection of diverse and high-quality data for research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dryad Digital Repository is a highly customized instance of the DSpace open source repository platform. A key distinguishing feature of Dryad is the ease with which researchers can deposit their data alongside their manuscript through integration with the manuscript submission process. Another key feature is curation: data is inspected prior to release by professional data curators and, optionally, by expert peer reviewers. Success of this award can be measured by the use of the repository by the research community.  Indicators include the number of new datasets released; the number of datasets downloaded; the number of instances of data reuse that can be tracked; the number of integrated journals; the number of new members; the number of new sponsors; and the revenues received through data publication charges.  The Dryad Digital Repository is available at http://datadryad.org.</AbstractNarration>
