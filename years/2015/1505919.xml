<AbstractNarration>This award supports Optics and Photonics Training for Inquisitive eXperimentalists (OPTIX), a project to create an innovative, hands-on laboratory environment at Willamette University where undergraduate sophomores and juniors can work with research grade optics equipment in a dedicated space designed to foster deep, inquiry-based learning. Students will complete carefully designed modules that encourage creativity and independence, preparing them better for a more rigorous and meaningful senior year capstone project and giving them vital skills and motivation for a career in the STEM fields after graduation. Modules will also be developed for local community college students at Chemeketa Community College, and an optics related hands-on exhibition for the Gilbert House Children's Museum in Salem, OR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The optics modules will require different levels of student sophistication, training, and involvement. The most basic optics module will provide an introduction to optics, and serve as a gateway to the more advanced activities. Students at the sophomore level then continue taking three additional basic modules that introduce them to more sophisticated ideas and techniques. The focus at the junior level is on intermediate modules, some of which are extensions of modules encountered during the sophomore year and others which lead into the advanced modules that students can take in their senior year or as independent research projects to prepare them for the transition into research labs. The effectiveness of this initiative will be ascertained by assessing student skills and attitudes before, during, and after exposure to OPTIX modules with the help of an external evaluator.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For most physics majors, the transition from more 'cookbook style' introductory labs to open-ended research experiences is difficult. Even at undergraduate institutions that value undergraduate research training like Willamette University, where undergraduates join active, on going research programs early in their education, the transition can be challenging since the equipment and techniques that are used in research labs are vastly different than those typically used in teaching labs. Not only is research equipment more delicate, but in research labs even simple pieces like mirrors need to be handled quite differently. OPTIX (Optics and Photonics Training for Inquisitive eXperimentalists) is designed to facilitate the transition from the introductory labs that use teaching grade equipment to our ongoing state-of-the-art research projects by exposing students in their sophomore and junior year to research grade equipment in a safe environment in which mistakes (like fingerprints on delicate optics) do not lead to delays in the research.  Carefully designed modules present students with background information and ask them to actively engage with the material through three differently colored boxes (yellow for activities, e.g. data taking, data analysis, or small mathematical calculations&#894; blue for 'How to do...' instructions&#894; and green for 'Let's play with it!' guided, but open ended explorations). To our knowledge, this way of bridging the teaching lab and the research lab is novel, and we hope that our modules, which are available on our website (http://willamette.edu/cla/physics/info/nsf-optix/index.html), will help other institutions optimize their undergraduate training as well.  Over the last years, we have developed seven 3-hour and seven 12+-hour modules that more than 60 sophomores and more than 50 juniors have successfully completed.
