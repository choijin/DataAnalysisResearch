<AbstractNarration>In a world that is increasingly quantitative and one in which computers nearly are ubiquitous, it is important that all students learn how to think logically and add fundamental computing skills to their problem solving skills.  The expression of this need is underscored by the countless calls for a well-trained STEM workforce, yet, in reality, the fundamental computational skills needed for success in the STEM disciplines are not part of the liberal arts curriculum. The proposed project's significance resides in its leveraging the expertise of computer science and liberal arts educators to develop curricular recommendations that infuse computational thinking into the liberal arts curriculum. This curricular development has the potential to improve the liberal arts workforce and better prepare these students to navigate and contribute to society.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of proposed project is to identify essential computer science skills that will benefit students in the liberal arts.  Relevant literature and current liberal arts curricula and workforce needs will be assessed in order to identify gaps between curricular content and workforce needs.  Faculty from computer science and liberal arts will participate in a workshop to discuss the role of computer science skills and principles in the liberal arts and then write and disseminate an informed white paper that will be used to guide future liberal arts curricular development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The principal outcome of this workshop was a better understanding of the computational needs of liberal arts students and faculty as well as an idea of how computer scientists and liberal arts students and faculty can work together to better prepare students in both disciplines and better support research endeavors in the liberal arts.  In consultation with career placement professionals we identified two key points that will be necessary for the professional success of our graduates. First, todayÃ†s graduates must be nimble. This point is not a suggestion that may engender success, it is a requirement. The career paths of our graduates may take several directions not only immediately after graduation but throughout their careers. That nimbleness can be attained, in part, through a familiarity with computational skills and a knowledge of how they apply to their professional pursuits. The second point is that many, if not most, of our graduates will find themselves in careers that do not exist at the time they complete their undergraduate studies. Without contemporary computational skills, that range from expertise with Microsoft Office to database implementation and administration to the use of complex algorithms to understand their subject matter of interest, our graduates will not be well prepared for future professional success. They will not be nimble and therefore unable to adjust to changing professional cultures and technologies.   This conclusion about the need to be nimble was inescapable and was encountered numerous times throughout our discussions. Our graduates must be able to adapt to changing professional requirements and changing technologies. It is critical that we acknowledge that many of the jobs that are students will hold in the future do not represent traditional paths for those with either Computer Science or Liberal Arts degrees. For example, the analysis of computer threats often requires an analyst to be fluent in several spoken languages. These skills are not taught in Computer Science curricula but rather in Colleges of Liberal Arts. Similarly, Liberal Arts graduates must be able to work with quantitative data. They have become data scientists in the sense that many historical works, including but not limited to fine art, photographs and literature, are being digitized and their analysis requires database skills, the ability to work with computer scientists to write analytical algorithms and a general understanding of the tools that are available and the ability to describe the tools that are needed.  We also recognized that there are ample opportunities for collaboration within the constraints of current academic disciplinary silos, opportunities that can be exploited without curricular reform.  Undergraduate students in Computer Science programs may serve as mentors and collaborators with students and faculty in the Liberal Arts as the latter pursue and develop their respective research interests.  Similarly, students in Liberal Arts programs may collaborate and mentor Computer Science students and faculty as they in turn pursue their research interests.  In other words, there are numerous opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaboration and learning in both directions.   We anticipate that the results of this workshop, once fully disseminated, will raise awareness among the computer scientists and liberal arts professionals and, hopefully, lead to new dialogues that will enhance the career preparation we provide for all of our students.
