<AbstractNarration>Researchers will examine the fidelity and quality of their implementation of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in response to an extensive professional development program of workshops and professional learning communities.  In addition the study will investigate how individual teacher background characteristics, their personal beliefs about science teaching and learning, the characteristics of their students, and other contextual variables affect such implementation. Study findings will inform district and state policy makers about types of supports teachers need to implement NGSS successfully, and will differentiate between supports for various teacher backgrounds and student groups.  As such, the project will support improved science teaching in more sites and for more students nationwide.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NGSS classroom implementation will be observed in four California districts receiving extensive professional development and related implementation supports through a program funded by the Bechtel Foundation.  The research will include individual case studies and a cross-case analysis on a set of 20 middle school teacher leaders and 40 rank-and-file middle school teachers receiving various levels of support. Teachers will be recruited based on sampling criteria that include prior science teaching experiences, teaching conditions, teacher content backgrounds, characteristics of students served, and location.  For each teacher case, researchers will inspect lesson plans and curricular documents, conduct classroom observations, collect teaching artifacts, and interview the teachers.  In addition, researchers will conduct teacher surveys, and a survey of students' opportunities to learn. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project,&nbsp;<em>Understanding Teacher Enactment of New Science Standards and Needs for Implementation Support,</em>&nbsp;was among the first to study how science teachers in grades 6-8 across California were implementing the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in naturalistic settings (e.g., absent a particular curriculum or intervention). Researchers first developed a robust framework to examine the many crucial facets for enacting the NGSS. For starters, it is a given that the framework includes the components of NGSS three-dimensional learning (the Disciplinary Core Ideas [DCIs], Science and Engineering Practices [SEPs], and Crosscutting Concepts [CCCs]) that are largely focused on in the field. However, we also examined five more aspects of NGSS enactment: Engineering, Phenomena-based instruction, Coherence, Student Epistemic Agency, and Equity. This project studied each of these aspects of the framework as well as the interrelationships between them. We found that when instruction includes more of these aspects, it is more closely aligned with the full vision of the standards that its authors intended.</p> <p>Further, we provided rich descriptions of what naturalistic NGSS instruction looks like as a whole, as well as examples of the variations in how each of these aspects may be instantiated in classrooms.

We also examined supports that are crucial for teachers to be able to successfully enact these elements of high-quality NGSS instruction, which include school and district administrators providing a supportive environment for teacher autonomy and risk taking in implementing the NGSS in their classrooms, allowing for more purposeful teacher collaboration (i.e., beyond just lesson planning) and collective knowledge building, and developing teacher leadership structures.</p> <p>Last, we identified a large decrease in NGSS science instruction that occurred at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic across all major areas (less science instruction overall, less engagement in all essential aspects of the NGSS identified in our study framework, less use of instructional practices that align with NGSS instruction such as collaboration and discourse, and less teacher support and preparedness to teach science through distance learning). Further, by surveying teachers again in Spring 2021 (one year into the pandemic), we were able to identify areas where science instruction was beginning to improve (more instructional time devoted to science, more whole class discussions and investigations, and slightly more engineering), and some opportunities that teachers found in teaching through distance learning (more purposeful use of technology, increased student agency and confidence, different kinds of collaboration and discourse through technology, more family engagement and equity issues being addressed, and different means for assessing learning or understanding).
