<AbstractNarration>Condensed matter physics has made tremendous contributions to society over the past several decades through the study and development of novel materials such as semiconductors and computer memory devices.  Presently, however, the condensed matter physics community is at a crossroads, faced with challenges of understanding the fundamental behavior of increasingly complex materials.  This workshop brings together leading experimentalists, both junior and senior faculty and researchers from across the US, to discuss emerging trends and ideas to better measure and understand such materials. &lt;br/&gt;   The discovery of several new materials in recent years has highlighted the need for advanced experiments.  The iron pnictide superconductors, for example, exhibit a complex interplay of electronic, spin and lattice degrees of freedom that give rise to difficulties of interpretation.  In order to make progress, novel experiments to measure the response of these systems to non-traditional perturbations such as uniaxial or hydrostatic pressure, high magnetic fields, or large electric fields are vital.  This workshop brings together experimentalists in these different fields with the goal to elucidate potential new opportunities that may emerge by combining techniques that traditionally have remained disparate.  The workshop features a panel discussion on current and emerging trends, and will explore topics at the frontier of correlated electron research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On May 14-15, 2015, approximately 35  leading condensed matter experimentalists gathered in Arlington, VA for a workshop to discuss emerging frontiers in experimental condensed matter physics.  The goal of the workshop was to bring together a diverse set of scientists working on experimental studies of strongly correlated electron systems, in which strong interactions and many-body effects dominate the physics of the electronic degrees of freedom.  These materials are among the most interesting and most challenging condensed matter systems to study, exhibiting complex interplay between different ground states.   The workshop was divided into seven sessions focusing on: Novel Materials, Iron-based Superconductivity, Spectroscopy, Heavy Fermions, Novel Probes, Spin Resonance and Scattering, and Topological and Dirac Systems.   There was also a round-table discussion led by a group of senior scientists that centered on topics of how the condensed matter community can best perform public outreach, and how limited funding should be structured to foster the most creative science research.  Several different research communities were represented at the workshop from areas that typically do not interact with one another.  This workshop provided a venue for these people to find common ground and establish new collaborations.  Several attendees reported establishing new collaborations, ranging from collaboration with sample growers to the development of new approaches or techniques.  For example, the UC Davis NMR group will be collaborating with the University of Utah high pressure group to study the melting curve of Lithium under high pressure;  the UC Irvine materials synthesis group will be collaborating with researchers at the Univ. of British Colombia for high-resolution x-ray diffraction studies in diluted Kondo lattices, and the Univ. Arkansas group will provide 2D oxide heterostructures to the NMR group at Brown University.  Several new scientific results were presented during the workshop.  Highlights included the identification of a chirality density wave in the hidden order phase of URu2Si2, time-resolved femtosecond movies of electronic dispersion measured using photoemission, nanoscale thermo-imaging using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, and updates on the development of high field magnets using high-temperature superconductor tapes and wires.  There were several questions raised during the discussion periods following each talk, and discussion continued during the working lunches and dinners on both days.  The round-table discussion featured a panel discussion including Paul Canfield, Greg Boebinger, Brian Maple, Zach Fisk, and Chris Hammel.   The panelists were asked to comment on several issues facing the condensed matter physics community:    What are the key challenges for experimental CM we currently face?  Are there techniques that can/should be developed to better discern the ``elephant"?    How do you envision the future of experimental CM research? I.e., are there still interesting challenges out there to be addressed by single-PI efforts, or do we need more large-group, multi-faceted efforts like in high energy physics?   Several of the last big CM discoveries came from overseas (pnictides, cuprates, H2S under pressure).  How can we as a community prepare ourselves for the next discovery to increase US presence and contributions? Is it simply a matter of funding dollars?  Greater flexibility?     How can we as a community increase public awareness and excitement for correlated electron science? Other groups (particularly nuclear physicists) have well-organized campaigns to visit senators, etc.  Some of the most interesting discussion centered around the idea of ``Scientific Darwinism", in which multiple different PI's with different approaches and ideas are funded separately, rather than large center-type grants.  There was also significant discussion regarding the need to have better public outreach about ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
