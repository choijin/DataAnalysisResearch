<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Alabama (UA) Tuscaloosa offers research opportunities centered on innovative engineering with bamboo to undergraduate students from institutions with limited research opportunities and from populations underrepresented in engineering. Bamboo is a renewable resource and has garnered attention in Alabama as an agricultural crop that can play an important part in numerous engineering applications. Bamboo cultivation in the U.S. is not limited to Alabama. It is much more widespread in terms of farming and applications. Over 1/3 of the U.S. grows bamboo as a commercial crop. The project intends to leverage this crop because it is important but not limited to Alabama. The application areas address global sustainability problems.  It also has properties that lead to promising applications and may be a viable alternative to slower-growing timber. A wide spectrum of multidisciplinary research projects will allow undergraduate students from multiple engineering disciplines to work together on problems with broad societal impact centering around the use of a renewable resource for various engineering applications that promote healthful and sustainable living. While the project topics will engage students in multiple disciplines, the theme is focused and allows students to work collectively on exciting and relevant problems to advance their overall knowledge of renewable resources for sustainability as well as learn how to advance discovery for commercial purposes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of this 10-week REU Site program include: 1) training of undergraduates to work on problems with broad societal impact; 2) developing technical and professional skills offering increased future opportunities; 3) networking with fellow REU students at UA and participating faculty mentors; and 4) raising student interest in pursuing graduate studies.  Students will be recruited nationwide using professional contacts, programs such as the AL Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, the Florida Advanced Technological Education Center, and various listserv/websites.</AbstractNarration>

As a part of Crimson Startup, the students formed teams to develop a product idea and business model that was presented at weekly meetings, participating in the same processes that other research groups and faculty at UA were completing towards commercializing the results of their research.  In addition to their research and entrepreneurial training, REU participants had weekly professional development workshops.  Workshop topics included: Introduction to MATLAB for data visualization, effective presentations for posters and conferences, resume building, graduate school applications, and intellectual property.  The REU participants visited a local Alabama bamboo nursery (Resource Fiber, Inc.) each summer to learn about local efforts to develop and advance bamboo as a renewable resource and its economic impact.  Finally, the participants presented the results of their summer research at a poster session attended by faculty, graduate students, and participants from other REU sites on campus.
