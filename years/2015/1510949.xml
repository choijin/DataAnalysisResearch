<AbstractNarration>1510949(Cordova) &amp; 1508987(Abbott)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research is to investigate with both experiments and computations the behavior of complex, anisotropic active fluids. Active fluids are fluids that behave in unique ways, because of the presence of active particles that can self-assemble, or can move and pack in different ways, giving different macroscopic properties to the fluid. The proposed research can uncover novel phenomena that could be exploited for design new fluid materials that are responsive to their external environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past studies have focused largely on the physics of "active colloids" in isotropic Newtonian fluids, yet many future applications of active fluids would require an understanding of their behavior in complex fluids. This is the white space that this proposal covers:  how anisotropy in the viscoelastic properties of a fluid can impact fundamental transport phenomena involving active colloids. A first research thrust will focus on the effect of the anisotropic environment of a liquid crystal suspension has on the diffusivity of a self-propelled particle within the suspension. Specifically, Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations will be combined with experiments involving tracking of single self-propelled colloidal Janus particles at the interface of a nematic liquid crystal. A second thrust will focus on the effects of a suspension of active particles hosted within an anisotropic fluid on the diffusion of passive tracer particles. Motile bacteria dispersed within biocompatible liquid crystals will be used to explore how passive particles diffuse in the presence of the motion of the rod-shaped bacteria. The overall outcome of this integrated program of experiment and simulation will be new knowledge regarding fundamental transport processes driven by internally generated gradients in complex fluids. The collaborating group will establish a collaboration with the Teacher Preparation Program at the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez to develop, disseminate and assess bilingual educational modules. Educational activities are proposed to expose students to cross-cultural educational experiences and to prepare them to work in diverse settings. An interdisciplinary class on soft matter will be offered to students at both institutions.</AbstractNarration>

Broader Impacts: As part of this project, we expanded outreach and educational activities at the University of Puerto Rico - Mayag&uuml;ez to expose underpreresented minorities to theoretical soft matter and fluid mechanics. This research advances the field of smart and reconfigurable materials for usage in sensors.  Outcomes  Brownian Dynamics simulations  During this project we developed a Brownian Dynamics simulation system to numerically simulate a colloidal particle of desired shape, size and self-activity in a sea of LC particles of ellipsoidal shape. Using this system, we studied the evolution of the arrangement of the LC particles at the surface of the colloidal particle.  Our first observation was that the LC fluid attained the nematic phase, in which the LC particles are aligned roughly along the same direction, when the concentration of the LC particles by volume is 50% or greater. This agrees with previous studies in the literature. When we immersed a spherical colloidal particle of a size comparable to the LC particles into the nematic LC fluid, we found that in general the LC particles preferred to arrange themselves planar to the surface of the colloid, and not perpendicular. Even when the particles were subjected to a potential which made the perpendicular orientation more energetically favorable, the particles still arranged themselves predominantly parallel to the colloid surface, unless this potential was made very strong (with the relative potential for the perpendicular configuration 500 times as large as for the parallel one). Even in this case, there was a layer of the ellipsoids right at the surface of the colloid in which the ellipsoids were aligned tangentially, because the relatively high volume fraction causes them to snake through the gaps left by the ellipsoids which were aligned normal to the surface. When planar anchoring was stipulated at the surface of the colloid, the ellipsoids were arranged tangentially near the surface, as expected.  Experimental studies  Our collaboration with the Abbott group (Cornell University/University of Wisconsin-Madison) resulted in work shedding light on the differences in the active motion of colloids inside nematic LC fluids relative to motion in isotropic liquids.   In the publication Langmuir 2017, 33, 10917-10926, we studied the active motion of Janus particles (with their surfaces made up partly of silica and partly of palladium) at an interface formed between a nematic LC fluid (composed of 5CB) and an aqueous phase containing hydrogen peroxide. We observed that low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide promoted active motion of the Janus particles along the director (i.e. the preferred direction of alignment) of the LC fluid. In contrast, at high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide the Janus particles underwent active motion both parallel and perpendicular to the LC director. These results promote new understanding and increased control of transport within synthetic colloids.  In the publication Langmuir 2020, 36, 6948-6956, we studied the interplay between two kinds of LC fluids, one (an aqueous solution of the fluid DSCG) acting as the solution and the other (5CB) dissolved in it in the form of droplets. We found that unlike the case of passive diffusion, when the 5CB droplets were made active they tended to move primarily in a direction perpendicular to the director of the LC particles in the DSCG solution. When we replaced the LC droplets by isotropic oil droplets, the motion returned to being primarily parallel to the director of the DSCG solution. This work too helps in increasing our control of active colloids in LC fluids.  In addition to the above publications, we also collaborated with the Abbott group on studying the ways in which alive and dead bacteria flow or swim through chiral LC fluids.
