<AbstractNarration>1559379 &lt;br/&gt;Padget, Steven R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is very different from almost all other NSF workshops in that it has been conceived and organized by architects, who will also lead the on-site workshop activity. The workshop structure incorporates the classical architectural design charrette approach, as well as a kick-off symposium. In the design charrette, groups of student designers will collaborate to propose design solutions for a complex INFEWS-related problem, where INFEWS denotes Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems. The symposium component will bring together researchers from the Humanities, Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, Economics, and Design Professions for presentations, panels, and discussion groups to explore the interrelations of the social, environmental, economic, and design aspects of INFEWS in the built environment. Symposium panel experts will interact with design students to frame and stimulate design efforts, provide feedback to the students' design concepts, and discuss and evaluate the design outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop objectives include: 1) identifying new and important opportunities for multi-disciplinary research and design in INFEWS-related arenas; 2) examining how recent advances in technology and design can be employed in or adapted to INFEWS-related development and solutions; 3) identifying multi-disciplinary research, design and development challenges, knowledge gaps, and INFEWS-related research needs; and 4) identifying documentation methods to disseminate multi-disciplinary research findings for future design development. This Workshop provides a new paradigm for integrating quantitative and qualitative research (analysis) with design (synthesis) methods. It also affords interdisciplinary design teams a unique opportunity to incorporate input from experts in various aspects of the Food, Energy, and Water (FEW) systems into the prototyping process for tools and products. The interacting components of the Workshop provide a useful feedback loop for the symposium participants and the design teams. The visualization of design ideas from the design charrette will be documented in a publication. A white paper, authored by the workshop steering committee, will summarize symposium results that identify interdisciplinary INFEWS research directions. Workshop activities will be documented and disseminated using various forms of web-presence during and after the Workshop, and the committee will pursue other publication opportunities following the Workshop. Broader Impacts : The two-component Workshop format will be integrated into the educational agenda of many architecture design studios at the University of Kansas as a means to promote undergraduate and graduate research. The workshop will also help galvanize research collaboration among faculty across multiple disciplines and facilitate applied research with design professionals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Defining the Opportunities and Challenges for Research and Design Strategies to Support Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems  (INFEWS)  A Workshop was run at the University of Kansas from January 21, 2016 to January 23, 2016. This workshop included 74 professional participants and 48 student participants in the areas of "Innovations at the Nexus of Food/Energy/Water Systems" (INFEWS) research and design.  The workshop was planned and run by a committee of researchers and designers who were known for their INFEWS-related work. These committee members were also chosen in order to comprise an interdisciplinary group, representing the Humanities, Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, Economics, and Design Professions.  Each Planning Committee member was responsible for identifying and acting as the on-site sponsor for an expert in their field who were also known nationally/internationally for their IFEWS related work. These experts were brought to campus to; deliver a keynote address, take part in panel discussions, take part in the research small group working sessions, and to take part in the design discussions.  The Workshop consisted of two components:  1) Research symposium  2) Design charrette  The symposium component brought together researchers from the Humanities, Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, Economics, and Design Professions for presentations, panels, and discussion groups to explore the interrelations of the social, environmental, economic, and design aspects of INFEWS.  In the design charrette, groups of student architectural designers collaborated to propose design solutions for a complex Food, Energy, Water (FEW) problem in the built environment. Symposium panel experts interacted with design students to frame and stimulate design efforts; provide feedback to the students? initial concepts; and discuss and evaluate the design outcomes.  The Major Goals of this three day Workshop were:  1) Identify new and important opportunities for multi-disciplinary research and design solutions in INFEWS-related arenas;  2) Examine how recent advances in technology and design can be employed in or adapted to INFEWS-related development and solutions;  3) Identify multi-disciplinary research, design and development challenges, knowledge gaps, and INFEWS-related research needs; and  4) Identify documentation methods to disseminate multi-disciplinary research findings for future design development     In addition to the above, the TREMCO corporation, provided professional training sessions on the benefits and challenges of vegetative roof systems as they pertain to stormwater management, building energy management, roof materials recycling and life span, urban agriculture potential, and user benefits of roof gardens.     Following the Symposium, and the Design Charette, the Planning Committeee members developed key recommendations to the NSF for future INFEWS research support.  Key recommendations (not in order of priority) call for research support:   1.     Establish comprehensive INFEWS and Triple-Bottom-Line performance criteria that can be consistently applied to examples of the designed environment in the form of post-occupancy-evaluations (POE?s).   2.     Establish a widespread program of designed environment POE?s that include INFEWS and TBL performance criteria.   3.      Host or support an easily accessible data base of POE?s in order that design solution types and technical applications can be understood across different performance criteria and evaluated relative to other solution types and techniques. Apply big data best-management-practices to collect, organize, and share the data from these evaluations.   4.      Support the analysis of the designed environment that looks at the up-stream and down-stream INFEWS/TBL effects of design solutions and techniques over time. This analysis should include both direct and indirect costs/benefits. Life-Cycle- Analysis and Life-Cycle-costing are two methods of such an analysis.   5.      Support multi-disciplinary research that studies human factors as they relate to the INFEWS/TBL performance of the designed environment.        a.      Such studies should include how human behavior is affected by different design solutions  and techniques.        b.      Such studies should include how the INFEWS/TBL performance of the designed environment is affected by human behavior.   6.       Support the inclusion of easily accessible (both remote and local) FEW/TBL performance feedback devices (such as digital dashboards and component labelling) for users, researchers, and designers of the designed environment.   7.        Support multi-disciplinary research into the effect of feedback devices (in number 6 above) on human behavior. This should answer the general question of how the use of feedback devices (making the "invisible visible") affect user behavior.   8.        Support multi-disciplinary research to determine the most effective techniques for informing and motivating users to apply INFEWS/TBL best-management- practices.   9.         Support multi-disciplinary research into the effects of government policies (for instance, performance codes, building codes, development codes) on the TBL/FEW performance of the designed environment.   10.       Support multi-disciplinary research and development of new/refined government policies in order to enhance the TBL/FEW performance of the built environment.      Website Doculmentation:  K.U.
