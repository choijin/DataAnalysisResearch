<AbstractNarration>This project provides NSF support for students to attend and participate in the 34th IEEE 2015 International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS) to be held in Montreal, Canada on September 28-October 1, 2015. SRDS 2015 is a premier international technical event that brings together technical research papers, tutorials and workshops centered on various aspects of reliable distributed computing applications and platforms. Additionally, the conference will include multiple keynotes, panels on cutting edge topics, a Ph.D. forum and discussion sessions. The aims of the conference are manifold: 1) to provide a international forum for investigation of major challenges in addressing next-generation of mission critical distributed computing platforms; 2) to stimulate interactive discussions on research in distributed computing and reliability through panels, posters, tutorials, and discussion sessions  (3) to motivate and engage future generations of researchers via conference and workshop presentations, interactive poster sessions, panel and breakout sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will promote the next generation of students and researchers to identify scientific foundations for building large scale distributed computing environments that can work reliably and efficiently. This travel support will permit a more qualified and diverse group of student attendees. Students attending the conference benefit from both the technical content of the conference and the professional interaction with senior researchers from other universities and with industry. A Student Scholar Roundtable will be organized where selected students will get a chance to informally interact with senior researchers in the community and get feedback on their research interests. SRDS 2015 will offer many opportunities for students to meet, interact, and exchange ideas in an informal atmosphere including members of the program committee, speakers and organizers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The 34th IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS 2015), held in Montreal, Canada, provided researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government agencies with an excellent opportunity to share their research and experience at the cross-roads of reliable computing and distributed systems Technology. With the emergence of highly distributed devices, sensors and cyberphysical systems in mission critical applications, reliability of operation is of increasing concern - this is clearly having an enormous impact on science, industry, and government.. This event:    Provided an environment for discussion of major challenges in addressing next-generation reliable distributed computing platforms   Promoted collaboration and cooperation between industry, academia and researchers.  Students, researchers, developers, and users interacted and explored research ideas, presented new and upcoming technology solutions and innovations, evaluated  maturing technologies, and presented novel applications using these technologies.   Communicated experiences and visions through invited talks, plenary and panels from leading researchers and practitioners who have actively researched and deployed in this field, with the goal of identifying future challenges in reliable computing for an increasingly distributed world.    Motivated and engaged future generations of researchers via conference and workshop presentations, interactive poster sessions, panel and breakout sessions where researchers (Ph.D. students including minorities and female students) presented papers, software demonstrations, research projects and new ideas in emerging reliable distributed computing applications and technologies.    Student Attendance and Involvement  at IEEE SRDS 2015: The award enabled the SRDS 2015 organizers to provide  a  valuable forum for our next generation of student researchers; it exposed the student awardees to new topics, leaders in the community and incorporated a broad range of students  to this important and growing field of resilient distributed systems.  The SRDS 2015 event had approximately 30 student attendees who participated in  entire conference including tutorials, workshops, talks, poster/demo sessions and the associated networking events (at a much reduced or waived registration).  The SRDS  conference fostered  interactions between senior CCGRID community members and the younger generation of student attendees in multiple events that were designed to facilitate such formal and informal networking.  Given the highly international nature of SRDS, the US based students were able to interact  and network with a broader group of students and researchers  from multiple universities around the world including Japan, China, Australia, Taiwan, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, Israel and Brazil.  Student awardees attended a Ph.D.  forum where selected doctoral students (US and international) presented their proposed and ongoing work to distinguished researchers around the world in a mock thesis proposal style presentation.    Intellectual Merit Outcomes:  Specific technical activities and their outcomes are:   Talks, presentations and tutorials from leading researchers and practitioners informed students and provided insight into  specific challenges &ndash;    Keynote talks by    Prof. Bianca Schroeder, University of Toronto (Title:Programming paradigms for massively parallel computing: Massively inefficient? )   Dr. Rick Schiicting, Distinguished Scientist, AT&amp;T  (Title: Network Function Virtualization and QoS in Distributed Systems)    The NSF award was used to also enable student  attendance at the conference through travel grants/stipends to partially cover the airfare, registration and local expenses of graduate students.      An interactive poster/demonstration session was organized where student researchers presented  software demonstrations, research projects and new ideas in emerging applications and technologies,     Three workshops on state of the art topics were selected, organized and presented at the conference and were attended by students attending the conference.  These include   6th International Workshop on Dependable Network Computing and Mobile Systems (DNCMS 2015)   3rd Workshop on Planetary-Scale Distributed Systems (W-PSDS 2015):    Workshop on Dependability and Security of System Operation 2015:     During the conference, an Interactive Student Scholar Roundtable  and Luncheon was held where student participants in the conference had a chance to informally interact with senior researchers in the community and get feedback on their research interests on a one-on-one basis.  Industry and academic attendees including steering committee and  program committee members provided one-on-one feedback the  research directions and future work of selected students.   Students were able to attend the Ph.D. forum where selected students (US and international) were able to participate and present their work in a mock-defense setting.     Broader Impact Outcomes:  The SRDS?15 conference was able to  facilitate diverse participation of senior and junior US researchers, including PhD students and postdoctoral researchers. A particular attempt was made to broadening the participation of student and senior researchers from women and underrepresented groups. The conference thus helped in training the next generation of scientists, engineers and application designers who are both consumers and developers of reliable systems and distributed computing technologies. The event succeeded to foster interactivity through the ample time for poster discussions, roundtables, networking events, mock thesis presentations  and breakouts.  As is evident, attendance and exposure to the events being organized as part of  SRDS 2015 will benefit the student awardees and will potentially influence their careers in the years to come.
