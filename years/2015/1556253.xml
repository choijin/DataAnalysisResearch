<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Rutgers University New Brunswick to develop a battery powered handheld sensitive instrument whose purpose is to detect panels of proteins for field based environmental monitoring. A portable device for protein analysis virtually impacts all fields of biology and also the biomedical sciences. Protein analysis of environmental samples typically requires collecting and storing samples and returning weeks to months later in labs to begin analyzing the data. The proposed instrument will instead allow for point-of-use on the field analysis of biological samples. The result of this research will be an instrument that is handheld and generalizable to the needs of individual biological laboratories. This disruptive tool will be valuable for basic biology, as well as clinical, biotechnological, and agricultural research. This tool will also have greater societal benefits including improving agricultural practices and deeper insights into environmental biology, which is necessary for protecting the environment. This is multidisciplinary work that combines engineering, nanofabrication, chemistry, physics, and biology and provides a great opportunity to educate and train graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students.  One of the important educational outcomes of the proposed research includes building teaching modules that will be incorporated into a massive open online course (MOOC) in biosensor and bioinstrumentation development. Collaborations will be developed with the Rutgers Office for Diversity and Academic Success in the Sciences to attract under-represented students to the study of STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed sample-to-answer portable protein analyzer to be developed will utilize 1) on-chip microfluidic sample preparation, 2) decoupled digital protein detection for quantification of low abundance proteins 3) nanoelectronic barcoding of beads for enabling multiplexing capability, and 4) on-chip magnet based fluidic peristaltic pumping for maintaining an ultra-compact footprint. Nanoelectronic barcoding works by fabricating tunable nano-capacitors on the microparticle surface, effectively modulating the frequency dependent dielectric properties of the particles allowing one bead barcode to be distinguished from another, potentially on the scale of 100-fold multiplexing. By using electronic based solutions for all of the key modules of the proposed instrument, the cost and size of the readout instrumentation can be significantly reduced, thus truly enabling on-the-field analysis. The devices will be validated in the field with environmental samples, benchmarking for detection limit, accuracy, and assay time for a panel of photosynthesis proteins from the green alga Picochlorum. The results will be shared with the engineering and experimental biology communities via presentations at professional meetings and submission to peer-reviewed journals. The research value of the instrument will be broadly disseminated through partnerships with the Rutgers BioMAPS Institute for Quantitative Biology and the Rutgers Center for Integrated Proteomic Research. To prepare for commercialization of the technology and broad distribution, there will be close collaboration with the Rutgers Center for Innovative Ventures of Emerging Technologies and the Rutgers Office of Technology Commercialization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award resulted in 1) the creation of novel electrofluidic modules advancing the state of the art in bioelectrical engineering and 2) the development of an analyzer capable of analyzing organisms from field samples. Below we discuss the key outcomes of the two:     1) Electrofluidic modules  A. New method for microfluidic valves  One of the challenges with making biochips that can be miniaturized and at the same time work in conjunction with instruments that are also small and portable is the ability to control fluids accurately. We developed a novel electronic method for controlling fluid flow on micro-chips using micro-magnets as shown below.       B. New method for electronic wearable form factor  One of the challenges with doing cell analysis and biomolecular analysis is the large instrument footprint making it importable and not compatiable for field use. We developed a new electronic method for reducing electronics so that it can be carried and even placed on a wrist band as shown below.    C. New method for barcoding particles  One of the challenges of analyzing more than one bioanalyte simultaneously in a portable instrument is the fact that the electronic signals coming from different molecules are similar to each other. To tackle this, our team developed a new method to give particles an electronic barcode so that they can be purely read by electronics. Image can be seen below as featured on the prestigious journal, Lab on a Chip.    D. New method for assessing health of microrganisms in response to stress  With collaborators in environmental biology, we developed an electronic method that can be used to assess the health of microorganisms when in a stressful environment. This is extremely important for the environment.     E. New method for detecting nucleic acid strands  When interrogating microorganisms in on the field, it is important to be able to recognize them by their nucleci acid strand. We developed a novel biochip that can detect and quantify nucleic acid strands.     F. Use of machine learning for classification of nanoscale changes on microscale particles  We demonstrated the ability to use machine learning to classify particles that are experiencing nanometer sized changes. This combined use of AI and biosensos can open up many applications in environmental biology and also the biomedical domain.    2) Field sample analysis  Most recently, we developed a portable device that can be used on the field to assess the health coral reefs. We have also began testing this in aquatic environments.      In addition to the advances in the state of the art, this award resulted in the partial support of at least 6 graduate students in completing their PhDs. Additionally numerous masters degree theses were completed and undergraduate research projects leading to publications and dissemination of results with the scientific community. Technology transfer was also a notable achievement resulting from this award. At least 3 patents were filed and even a startup company was spun off out of the PI's lab based on the fundamental work performed with the support of this grant.
