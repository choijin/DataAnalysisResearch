<AbstractNarration>Infectious diseases place an enormous toll on public health, societies, and economies across the world.   Effective control of an infectious disease is made challenging by complex disease dynamics, limited resources, and the need to continually adapt interventions to the evolving status of an epidemic.  Driven by widespread recognition of the potential of big data, recent technological advances have made it possible to collect, curate, and access heterogeneous data on the evolution of an infectious disease in real-time.  In light of recent and anticipated advances in big data, this project envisions that future management of infectious diseases will rely on knowledge-transfer systems that map real-time, heterogeneous data streams to recommendations for policy-makers managing an infectious disease.  These recommendations might identify subgroups in the population that should be given highest priority for interventions or other resource allocations.  However, science is years away from creating such a system as its implementation will require significant innovations in disease modeling, data-driven decision making, computing, and optimization. This award supports initiation of a collaborative research project that takes critical first steps toward these innovations by creating a blueprint for using big data and precision medicine to inform management of an infectious disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will develop a novel class of dynamical systems models that identifies subgroups in the population with homogeneous disease dynamics.  Parameters indexing these models are estimated using maximum likelihood; then, by computing draws from the sampling distribution of these parameters, we apply Thompson sampling and model-based policy-search algorithms from precision medicine to identify optimal resource allocations to manage the spread of an epidemic.  The proposed research bridges dynamical systems models with subgroup identification and data-driven resource allocation.  This will create new knowledge and new lines of research in applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science.  This award is supported by the National Institutes of Health Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative in partnership with the National Science Foundation Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this pilot project were: (i) to explore the application of precision medicine methodologies to the management of infetious disease; (ii) to develop methodologies to combine equation-based disease dynamics models with data-driven estimators of optimal treatment allocation strategies; (iii) to create new research directions and collaborations at the intersection of precision medicine and publich health; and (iv) to identify major obstacles to the application of precision methodology to public health.   This work had two primary methodological contributions: (i) the extension of Monte Carlo Tree Search methods to large sequential decision problems on networks; and (ii) integration of equation-based disease dynamics models and estimating equations for optimal treatment allocation strategies.  These two methodologies are among the first statistically rigorous and computationally scalable methods for estimating optimal publich health interventions using methods from precision medicine.  In simulation experiments, we successfully applied these methods to networks with as many as 1 million nodes without resorting to specialized computing resources thereby providing proof-of-concept that these algorithms can scale to large, e.g,. national, public health interventions.  The results from this project have the potential to make a tremendous positive impacton public health, education, and security.   During the project period, we illustrated through simulation experiments that the developed methodologies can be used to manage infectious diseases spreading across large networks.  We are now, as the result of this pilot project, deploying these methodologies in the field to: (i) improve public health through targeted messaging for cancer screening and building new models for spread of Malaria in the Democratic Republic of Congo; (ii) improve security by using text and image data to construct network models for the flow of assets in human trafficking and to design optimal intervention strategies to rescue victims and prosecute offenders; and (iii) to improve education adherence among historically underserved populations through adaptive messaging.
