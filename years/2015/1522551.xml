<AbstractNarration>The Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign was a (May-Jun) 2012 experiment to study the impact of deep, mid-latitude continental convective systems, including their dynamical, physical, and lightning production processes, along with the regional consequences for upper tropospheric (UT) composition and chemistry.  The campaign consisted of ground-based observations in Colorado, Oklahoma, and Alabama, as well as in situ and remotely sensed sampling of the outflow and inflow of the convective storms observed from the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V (GV) and NASA DC-8 research aircraft. This proposal seeks further analysis and modeling of the chemistry associated with specific storms observed in the DC3 project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focused efforts include use of the DC3 observations to improve model representation of lightning flash rates along with the horizontal and vertical placement of lightning produced nitrogen oxide (LNOx) production, as well as the estimation of the magnitude of LNOx production. In addition, the convective transport of pollutants from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere in these storms will be investigated in models, as well as downward (intrusion)&lt;br/&gt;transport of stratospheric ozone.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A combined meteorological and atmospheric chemistry model (WRF-Chem; Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry) was used to simulate thunderstorms that were observed during the joint NSF and NASA Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field program that took place in May ? June 2012.  The objectives of our work were to better understand (1) the transport of trace gases (such as carbon monoxide, ozone, and nitrogen oxides) in the updrafts and downdrafts of thunderstorms; (2) prediction of lightning flash rates; (3) the production of nitrogen oxides by lightning; (4) the fate of trace gases that become dissolved in cloud droplets and rain drops; (5) the transport of trace gases into the stratosphere in deep thunderstorm clouds and the downward transport of ozone from the stratosphere outside the cloud; and (6) the production of ozone through chemical reactions in the presence of sunlight in the air flow out of the tops of thunderstorms as that air is transported downwind.   We found distinct differences in the transport patterns for trace gases in various types of thunderstorms such as severe supercells, squall lines, and pop-up single cell storms.  Lightning flash rates were best predicted from the amount of cloud ice transported upward in the storm and from the volume of the storm updraft.  A storm with very large flash rate was found to have relatively small production of nitrogen oxides per flash on average.  We found that some soluble gases are retained in ice after cloud droplets freeze while other gases are released to the atmosphere during the freezing process.  Both the observations and the model showed that there was significant transport of gases from near the surface into the lower stratosphere, and that ozone from the stratosphere was transported downward by 2 ? 3 km just outside the cloud.  During the first 24 hours of downwind transport of air from the storm top, ozone was produced in the sunlight at a substantial rate because of the presence of precursor gases, primarily the nitrogen oxides produced by lightning.    The broader impacts of our work include the contribution of three features to improve the community version of the WRF-Chem model.  These features include improving the vertical transport of atmospheric constituents, the treatment of nitrogen oxides from lightning, and the treatment of soluble gases when cloud droplets freeze.  Our findings are important with regard to regional and global chemistry and climate modeling, as ozone in the troposphere is the third most important greenhouse gas (after carbon monoxide and methane), and nitrogen oxides produced by lightning have a large role in controlling the amount of ozone in the upper and middle troposphere.  In addition, the characteristics of vertical transport of trace gases in our detailed simulations can be used in evaluating convective transport in global and regional chemistry/climate models.  Our grant supported the graduate-level education of three female students.  Two of them received PhD degrees and one a MS degree.
