<AbstractNarration>Recognizing the national need for significant improvement in undergraduate STEM education, collaborators from six institutions (Rochester Institute of Technology, St. Mary's University, Oral Roberts University, Hope College, Ursinus College, and California Polytechnic University) will explore a new approach to introduce students to authentic research in biochemistry laboratory courses.  The project will test the hypotheses that engaging in authentic research will improve students' abilities to master key aspects of experimentation (experimental design, data processing and interpretation, and communication of research outcomes) and visualization (use of representations to communicate various aspects of the research process).  The project is likely to be transferrable to other institutions, and is an example of a cost-effective way to introduce course-based research into the undergraduate curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biochemistry laboratory courses will be redesigned to include modules in which students will integrate computational and wet lab techniques as they characterize proteins whose three dimensional structures are known but to which functions have not been previously ascribed.  Because the project is focused on discovery, it is reasonable to expect that some of the students will produce novel results that will contribute to the field of biochemistry.  Formative and summative evaluation will address assessment of student learning gains in terms of improved conceptual understanding and visualization of experiments using a validated instrument composed of open-ended and closed-ended questions.  Faculty members and teaching assistants will be surveyed and interviewed about their satisfaction with the project, its usability, and the extent to which they see the project as part of their own and their students' development.  The project team will create and disseminate modules (promol.org) that form the core of a new curriculum for undergraduate biochemistry laboratory courses.  The results of the work will be presented at professional meetings, such as the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and submitted to scholarly journals.</AbstractNarration>

The experiments involved buffer preparation, amino acid separations by ion-exchange and paper chromatography, optical activity of carbohydrates, enzyme isolation from tissue and enzyme purification using size exclusion and affinity chromatography, enzyme quantification, and enzyme activity assays using a 96-well plate reader.  The current NSF project has resulted in numerous outcomes:  1.   The collaboration between faculty at the different institutions has helped us develop lab teaching modules that are more likely to work the first time which is an enormous benefit to faculty at a small school where lab course develop can be difficult due to high teaching loads and limited numbers of lab staff.  2.   The project has resulted in teaching modules in key areas of: computer modeling of structure-function relationships, plasmid isolation and purification, recombinant DNA modification of a competent cell line, protein expression, protein isolation, protein purification, protein quantification, and enzyme activity assay.  3.   The project has resulted in establishing working relationships among the collaborators. Being able to text or email a fellow collaborator to ask a question about best practices has led to rapid faculty development.  4.   The project has provided a teaching platform that remains skill oriented but has helped us, as a small non-PhD school, to give students a research oriented experience.
