<AbstractNarration>The research supported by this grant is in algebraic combinatorics, which is an area of mathematics that seeks to develop connections between combinatorics (the science of counting, arranging, and analyzing concrete discrete configurations) and fields of pure mathematics that involve sophisticated abstract algebraic structures. The idea is to use these connections to gain deeper insights and solve problems in combinatorics and in the other fields. The discrete configurations that are studied in combinatorics arise in various fields of mathematics, computer science, physics, biology, and engineering; DNA sequences, phylogenetic trees, and communications networks are all examples of discrete configurations. Combinatorial methods are playing an increasing role in these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common thread running through the various parts of this project is that of palindromicity and unimodality of polynomials. Many important enumerative sequences arising in algebra, combinatorics, and geometry are palindromic and unimodal, but proving unimodality can be quite challenging. Proofs of unimodality appearing in the literature have made striking use of combinatorial, analytic, algebraic, and algebro-geometric techniques. In the PI's current work, unimodality issues have led to the discovery of intriguing connections between certain combinatorial and geometric structures and to the discovery of elegant new q-analogs of classical enumerative formulas. For example, palindromicity and unimodality of a generalized Eulerian polynomial (due to De Mari, Procesi and Shayman) play a role in the PI's and Shareshian's ongoing work on chromatic quasisymmetric functions, which are a refinement of Stanley's chromatic symmetric functions. One aim of this project is to prove a conjecture of the PI and Shareshian on a relationship between the chromatic quasisymmetric functions and Tymoczko's representation of the symmetric group on the cohomology of the regular semisimple Hessenberg variety of type A. This could establish, among other things, a longstanding e-positivity conjecture of Stanley and Stembridge for chromatic symmetric functions. A property stronger than palindromicity and unimodality, known as gamma-positivity, is of current interest in combinatorics and discrete geometry, as many important classes of enumerative polynomials are gamma-positive. Part of this project is concerned with a q-analog of gamma-positivity recently studied in joint work with Dilks and Krattenthaler. Another part of the project continues the work of the PI on the interplay between poset topology and enumerative combinatorics. One aim is to prove a conjecture of the PI and her former student Gonzalez D'Leon connecting the topology of certain subposets of the poset of weighted partitions to gamma-positive h-polynomials of graph associahedra.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project makes contributions to algebraic combinatorics, a field concerned with  the interplay between combinatorics and other fields of mathematics.  Combinatorics is an area of mathematics that studies discrete configurations that arise in various fields of mathematics, computer science, physics, biology, and engineering; DNA sequences, phylogenetic trees, and communications networks are all examples of discrete configurations.       In a series of papers published between 2007 and 2010, the PI and John Shareshian studied a symmetric function analog of the classical Eulerian numbers called "Eulerian quasisymmetric functions".  The Eulerian quasisymmetric functions specialize to a q-analog of the Eulerian numbers, which enumerates permutations by certain  fundamental permutation statistics.  There is also a relationship between the Eulerian quasisymmetric functions and certain toric varieties.         In 1995 Richard Stanley introduced a symmetric function analog of the classical chromatic polynomial of a graph,  called "chromatic symmetric functions".   Motivated in part by the long-standing Stanley-Stembridge e-positivity conjecture and by their work on Eulerian quasisymmetric functions, the  PI and John Shareshian in 2012 introduced a refinement of Stanley's chromatic symmetric function, called "chromatic quasisymmetric function of a labeled graph".   This refinement also generalizes the Eulerian quasisymmetric functions.     The PI and Shareshian present an approach to proving the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture based on a conjecture  generalizing the relationship between Eulerian quasisymmetric functions and toric varieties.   This conjecture, which connects the chromatic quasisymmetric functions with Hessenberg varieties, was proved by Brosnan and Chow, and subsequently by Gay-Paquet.        1. Extensions of the work described above:     In "Gamma-positivity of variations of Eulerian polynomials",  Shareshian and the PI extend their earlier work on Eulerian quasisymmetric functions to a variation of these that specializes to a class of polynomials arising in the work of Reiner, Postnikov, and Williams on graph associahedra.       In her 2018 Ph.D. thesis under the direction of the PI, Brittney Ellzey initiates the study of a generalization of the chromatic quasisymmetric functions from labeled graphs to directed graphs.     The chromatic quasisymmetric function of the naturally labeled path is the enumerator of Smirnov words by descent number.   The chromatic quasisymmetric function of the directed cycle is the enumerator of circular Smirnov words by cyclic descent number.    In "On Enumerators of Smirnov words by cyclic descent", Ellzey and the PI extend earlier results to two new variations: (1) enumerator of Smirnov words by cyclic descent number and (2) enumerator of circular Smirnov words by descent number.  As a byproduct of this work, they show that the naturally labeled cycle is an example of a labeled graph that is not a natural unit interval graph, but whose chromatic quasisymmetric function is an e-positive symmetric function.     Prior to this work no such example was known.     2. Variations of the partition lattice and the free Lie algebra:     The partition lattice is a partially ordered set (poset) of fundamental interest in combinatorics.    It is the intersection lattice of the braid hyperplane arrangement.  It is the bond lattice of the complete graph.  It has an important relationship with the free Lie algebra.     In "Homogonized Linial arrangement and Genocchi numbers", the PI and her recent Ph.D. student Alexander Lazar study the relationship between the intersection lattice of a certain hyperplane arrangement introduced by Gabor Hetyei and the classical Genocchi numbers and median Genocchi numbers. They show that the intersection lattice is the subposet of the partition lattice consisting of partitions in which each nonsingleton block has odd minimum and even maximum. They derive formulas for the generating function of the characteristic polynomial, which reduce to known formulas for the generating functions for the Genocchi numbers and the median Genocchi numbers.  As a byproduct of their work they obtain some additional new enumerative results on the Genocchi and median Genocchi numbers.   Generalizations of this work appear in Lazar?s University of Miami Ph.D. dissertation and will be submitted for publication in a journal shortly.     In "Action of the symmetric group on the free LAnKe: a CataLanKe Theorem", Tamar Friedmann, Phil Hanlon, Richard Stanley and the PI announce a study of the representation of the symmetric group on the multilinear component of an n-ary generalization of the free Lie algebra..  Their results focus on decomposition into irreducibles. Proofs of some of these results are given in "On a generalization of Lie(k): a CataLanKe Theorem" and proofs of other results will be given in a forthcoming paper. As a byproduct of this work, a new presentation for  irreducible representations in a wide class of irreducible representations is obtained.     In "Weighted bond posets, symmetric functions, and tree associahedra", the PI and Rafael Gonzalez D?Leon introduce a weighted version of the bond poset of a graph, which generalizes the weighted partition poset studied in their earlier papers.  Symmetric function invariants associated with the weighted bond posets include the  parking symmetric function of Garsia and Haiman.  A connection with graph associahedra is also given.
