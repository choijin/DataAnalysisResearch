<AbstractNarration>The 24th international conference on parallel architectures and compilation techniques (PACT) will be held in San Francisco, CA in October 2015. PACT is a multi-disciplinary conference that brings together researchers from hardware and software areas to present ground-breaking research in parallel systems ranging across instruction-level parallelism, thread-level parallelism, multiprocessor parallelism and large scale systems.&lt;br/&gt;This award is to make travel scholarships available to students and universities not typically represented at PACT in order to improve the conference?s impact and outreach.</AbstractNarration>
