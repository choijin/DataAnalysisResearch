<AbstractNarration>Communicating STEM -- Applying the Science of Science Communication to Natural History Media Products in Development/Production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of "Communicating STEM -- Applying the Science of Science Communication to Natural History Media Products in Development/Production" is to bring standard methodology for media product development/production into better alignment with evidence-based best practices for science communication.  Presentations in the professional development science strand at the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival (JHWFF) conference will be curated to demonstrate how adhering to research-based communication strategies has been proven to increase knowledge retention in a lay audience and decrease instances of audience bias.  The strand will present emerging methods for assessing media impact beyond simply the number of viewers, as well as in depth case studies examining evidence for measurable benefits to adopting science communication strategies.   By establishing an international cohort of interdisciplinary professionals, and by recruiting ongoing engagement through dissemination of project deliverables through partner organizations and university programs, JHWFF will increase opportunities for cross-industry collaboration and provide media producers, STEM professionals and science communication experts with the resources and network necessary for informed, effective public outreach through natural history and science media products.   This conference strand is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival (JHWFF) is a premier international industry conference for natural history media professionals.  This project will establish a cross-industry, interdisciplinary professional development science strand in the upcoming 2015 JHWFF conference. The goal is to advance interdisciplinary collaborations between STEM professionals, science communication experts, media producers, and students/early career professionals. The strand will explore examples of successful science/media collaborations, and increase discourse on best practices for public engagement at the intersection of STEM research, empirically-proven communication methods, and media content for diverse audiences.  The project is divided into two phases: Phase I involves the work at the conference;  Phase II  will provide free online access to edited videos of program sessions made broadly available through partner organizations and institutions, and promoted via social networking, cohort groups, and online blogs.  The collaborating organizations (American Association for the Advancement of Science, LifeOnTERRA, and Participant Media), complemented by a broad group of expert advisors, will extend the capacity of the project, facilitate access to stakeholders, and recruit broader participation in both phases of the project.  Dr. Louis Nadelson, Director of the Center for the School of the Future at Utah State University, will conduct external evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

JHWFF is a biennial professional development conference for the media industry working in science, wildlife and natural history genres, anchored on a juried film competition and public film festival. The event brings together industry executives and content creators from film, television and online platforms, leading scientists and thought leaders, and professionals &ndash; including students and emerging professionals &ndash; from the factual media and science communication industries. The main activities of the project included five formal professional development sessions and eight informal networking events designed to foster cross-industry learning and professional relationships between media creators, science communicators and STEM professionals.

To begin to assess the need for such professional development, our project utilized surveys to quantify the perceived significance of industry conferences such as JHWFF as valuable to filmmaker professional development; and surveyed the usefulness of specific informal learning opportunities offered to the 750+ attendees. We conducted pre and post surveys of five (5) professional development sessions exploring STEM-specific topics, and one (1) informal networking event. Our results represent (to our knowledge) the first empirical research on the professional motivations and development needs of science and natural history filmmakers. Through our study we identified three areas in which science and natural history filmmakers would like more professional development: 1) stronger understanding of research-based science communication techniques, specific to storytelling techniques, 2) strategies for how to identify and successfully partner with scientists and NGO&rsquo;s on media projects, and 3) a better understanding of tools and strategies for measuring the impact of media products (e.g. films, tv shows, radio podcasts, etc). More in depth assessments examined disparity in how interested the attendees are in certain topics (e.g. measuring the impact their media products have on viewers), versus how confident they feel employing them (e.g. knowing how to use meaningful strategies in a scientifically relevant way).</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14.666666666666666px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Beyond the immediate scope of data collected through the &ldquo;Communicating STEM&rdquo; program strand at JHWFF, the project resulted in deliverables available to the public.
