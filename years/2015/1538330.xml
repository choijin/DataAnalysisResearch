<AbstractNarration>Operating buildings, for either commercial or residential use, accounts for as much as 41 percent of the energy consumption in the United States of America. Adaptive building skins are active filters between the interior environment and outside weather conditions. These skins are able to respond to changing outdoor weather conditions and indoor operational needs, potentially reducing the energy demand of a building by as much as 51 percent.  However, current adaptive building skins rely on mechanical hinges and actuation devices of high construction complexity and life cycle cost. These attributes are obstacles to their broader adoption. Therefore, this project pursues fundamental research underlying the development of lighter, more durable, and, mechanically, less complex adaptive skins. The research on building skins follows plant leaves that change their shape based on weather conditions. Changing skins will produce more energy efficient buildings. This will lead to decreased greenhouse gas emissions, less US dependency on fossil fuels, and improved well-being of individuals in society.  For this project, a team spanning the disciplines of civil and mechanical engineering, material science and botany is assembled. This project will have a broad educational impact through the curating of an exhibition at a national museum and providing research experiences at high school, undergraduate and graduate levels and outreach to the K-12 community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plants utilize elastic properties of their organs to move with minimal energy and maximum effect. The core idea for the research is to interpret, upscale, modify, and tailor elastic deformation mechanisms found in plants to mechanically less complex adaptive building skins. The research hypothesis addresses how the elastic deformation response of these bio-inspired skins can be refined and controlled in time and space through optimized geometric design to follow a trajectory defined by environmental performance criteria. The study will combine experimental and numerical methods. The research tasks are (i) identifying, interpreting and up-scaling elastic kinetics in plant movements for adaptive building skins, (ii) characterizing the elastic deformation response to meet environmental performance requirements and tailoring this response through shape optimization, and (iii) numerical and physical evaluation by constructing and testing full-scale prototypes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual merit</strong></p> <p>We have made breakthroughs in three distinct fields that each contribute to make our vision for the future of architecture, a reality. The framework we developed, uses approaches from plant biology, non-linear mechanics, optimization and building physics to propose a new methodology for the design of adaptive building skins that benefit both the environmental performance of buildings and the comfort of their occupants.&nbsp; To this day building skins still serve the same function as they did in the past. They are interfaces between the interior and the outdoor space. Indoors, occupants need controlled and constant comfort. Outdoors, variations of temperature, light and humidity (among others) occur simultaneously on several timescales. We have designed a holistic approach which allows to unbridle the creativity of designers of the built environment. The project is guided by design principles found in nature. At its core, designing better adaptive building skins is a mechanics problem since the actual shading device is a mechanical system. However, the objectives driving the design of the system&nbsp; are not mechanical but relate&nbsp; to the thermal and visual performance of buildings. To solve this wide-ranging problem, we designed a bio-inspired shading system capable of tracking the spherical movements of the sun throughout the days and seasons. The resulting adaptive building skin is able to maintain the daylight quantity on a work plane at a constant, user-dictated level whenever there is daylight outside. In addition to the visual comfort conditions being met, the adaptive skin is operated to provide the lowest operating energy possible for the building. Improving on the existing systems requires a novel mechanical approach. We used advanced mechanics of flexible thin shells to create a solution that lowers the need for maintenance and is active and controllable throughout the year. We have investigated 1) the mechanical strategies employed by plants to generate movements found in the literature of plant morphology and characterized the main five strategies for use in architecture and engineering in general, 2) the scalability of plant-inpsired structures and movements to typical building dimensions through the use of dimensional analysis, 3) reducing the stresses in a flexible thin shell for a two degree of freedom actuation leading to large displacement, and 4) a design framework to evaluate and refine the development of novel adaptive building skin systems based on techniques of machine learning accounting the geographical location, building orientation, climate, room geometry, skin typology and occupant thermal and visual comfort preferences.</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts</strong></p> <p>The project led to the production of fundamental knowledge in three distinct fields essential to adaptive building skins. Our description of plants? movements and their strategies for amplification of movements is directly applicable for the development of bio-mimetic engineering structures. Establishing the rules of physical up-scaling for shell structures may lead to progress in robotics and construction when designing bio-inspired compliant structures. Finally, the framework for designing better dynamic solar shades is conceived to be used by practitioners and academics to provide evidence that adaptive building skins can provide more benefit to people than what they currently do. By having access to more feedback data, the designers of building skins may create entirely new systems with better performance. Therefore, each contribution is relevant to architects and engineers but also to the wider scientific community. Two graduate students and two undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds,received support from the project. The work accomplished during the project resulted in publications and was presented at nternational scientific conferences. Sharing the work resulting from this award was also done at the community level with annual presentations at Princeton University on-campus science exhibitions (e.g. Research Day) and annual outreach to over 1000 female middle school and high school students interested by science at the PPPL Young Woman Science Fair.
