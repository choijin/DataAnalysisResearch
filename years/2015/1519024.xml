<AbstractNarration>This project will analyze how privately owned affordable housing - the most prevalent type of project-based subsidized housing in the US - affects low-income communities. Specifically, it will evaluate affordable housing's effect on the formation of support networks or groups of individuals who depend on each other for material, service, and information-based assistance. This project will compare support network formation in affordable housing with support network formation in market-rate rental housing. The objective in this comparison is to identify the characteristics of affordable housing, such as the physical design of housing complexes and the rules and regulations required for tenancy, which may influence the formation of support networks among neighbors.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comparison will be made using original survey and interview data collected in a low-income neighborhood in the City of San Diego. The survey data will be statistically analyzed to identify patterns of support network formation within and between the two housing environments. The interview data will then be used to explain the social processes underpinning the patterns identified in the statistical analysis. The findings will contribute to sociological theory of housing and social capital while also increasing knowledge of the US social safety net. This project will help the providers of affordable housing understand its residents' ability to access resources needed for daily life and socioeconomic mobility. This project makes available to affordable housing providers a method of collecting and analyzing data to evaluate their housing services.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     How does living in privately owned assisted housing affect residents' support networks and access to resources? Support networks are groups of individuals who depend on each other for material, informational, and emotional resources. Research on assisted housing in high poverty neighborhoods has long produced conflicting results over how assisted housing affects access to social and economic resources. This project relies on original survey and interview data to determine whether living in assisted housing has an effect on residents' access to resources, and if so, how.  Between 2015 and 2016, a survey was carried out with residents living in 10 assisted housing complexes in the City of San Diego. Another survey was carried out with residents who were waitlisted for apartments at the same 10 assisted housing complexes. Waitlisted residents are likely to be similar to assisted residents in most respects except for their housing tenure, which makes them an ideal group for comparison. In total, 219 residents responded to the survey. Follow up interviews with survey respondents were also conducted.      There were two central findings from this research. First, there is evidence that assisted housing slows the pace of residential mobility for low-income renters, which increases opportunities for assisted residents to engage in collective action with their neighbors. Low-income renters tend to move frequently due to financial insecurity, eviction, and gentrification; but the rent subsidies and the accompanying resident services in assisted housing mitigate these forms of involuntary displacement. By having a stable housing arrangement, assisted residents have more opportunities to exchange support with their neighbors in the forms of material goods, information, and services. While traditional theories of concentrated poverty contend that residents living in high poverty neighborhoods are isolated from social ties that could provide resources for mitigating material hardships, the evidence suggests that residents in assisted housing engage in reciprocated exchange with their neighbors if they live among a stable tenant population.  Second, the evidence from this research shows that residents who are able to secure a degree of stability in assisted housing may forego opportunities to move to low-poverty neighborhoods. Theories of residential mobility suggest that residents living in high poverty neighborhoods seek to move to wealthier places in order to increase their access to high quality residential amenities and services. However, there is evidence that some residents in assisted housing who have access to a stable housing arrangement may perceive more resources and opportunities to be available in their current neighborhood than in wealthier neighborhoods. This finding contradicts the expectation that residents living in high-poverty neighborhoods consistently seek to move to wealthier places and only stay in high poverty contexts because they have no alternative housing options. The decision to remain in one?s home can be a strategic decision for increasing one?s access to educational and employment opportunities, but also a decision that may contribute to the reproduction of concentrated poverty.  In conclusion, the evidence from the project suggests that residential stability is produced at assisted housing complexes by the subsidies that reduce the cost of rent for low-income residents, and that having a stable home provides low-income renters with more opportunities to access resources from local neighbors and organizations.
