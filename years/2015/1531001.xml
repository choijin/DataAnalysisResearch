<AbstractNarration>Authoritarian societies are typically marked by passivity among citizens. Although violations of rights by the state may be rampant, citizens are reluctant to challenge the state, fearing they might be targeted for persecution. Lawyers tend to be similarly cowed. This project asks whether this might be changing. Focusing on the case of Russia, the project explores how lawyers think about themselves and their role in society through a random sample of 2500 recent law graduates. Russia presents an intriguing case because the number of young people studying law exploded just as the Putin regime stepped up its curtailment of the exercise of civil rights. The survey will reveal how graduates are dispersing themselves among various types of lawyering and their attitudes towards their obligations toward clients, with particular attention to the responsibility of lawyers to support clients who want to challenge the state or other powerful actors. The results promise to provide a window into the capacity of the Russian legal profession to spur the development of civil society. The results of the survey, which will be the first to include all types of Russian lawyers, will be archived and available to other researchers for analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses mixed methods to map the Russian legal profession and investigate its political significance. The fractured nature of this group makes a survey of practicing lawyers impossible. The Principal Investigator, working in collaboration with Russian consultants, plans a panel survey of a single cohort of law school graduates. They will construct a sample of approximately 2500 law students (recipients of both bachelors and masters degrees) on the cusp of graduation in 2016, stratified by region and institutional prestige. The PI plans to return to this same group of respondents at regular 5-year intervals (though this proposal seeks funding for the first round). Among the questions that the PI will be able to answer are: how do graduates disperse among the various subgroups of the profession; and to what extent are some demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, ethnicity, religion, class) preferenced by the different subgroups of the profession in getting a job and moving up the ladder of success. As a supplement to the survey, the PI will conduct 120 follow-up interviews with respondents culled from the surveyed population with an eye to diversity in career path as well as demographic factors. These interviews will build on the survey and will be conducted in 2017. They will be concentrated in 3 regions: Moscow, Saratov, and Tomsk. The interviews will be transcribed and analyzed by the PI using NVIVO. As with the survey, future plans call for re-interviewing this same cohort of 120 respondents at regular intervals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "Rethinking the Role of the Legal Profession in Authoritarian Societies" studied young lawyers in Russia in an innovative way.  A survey of students graduating from Russian law schools in 2016 generated a dataset that, for the first time, included all potential career paths.  Prior research focused narrowly on particular types of lawyers, such as litigators or prosecutors, and left out wide swaths of the legal profession that are less accessible to researchers, such as lawyers who work for state agencies or law firms.   This new approach yielded important insights. For example, the survey documented that most young Russian lawyers emerge from law school with a strong belief in the integrity of the legal system. They believe that judges? decisions are generally grounded in law rather than being the product of political pressure. These attitudes are consistent across all types of law students, regardless of the prestige of the law school or whether they are studying on a full-time or correspondence basis. In addition, analysis of the respondents? attitudes towards the state documented a fundamental, though previously unknown, difference between those who plan to work for the state and those destined for private practice that transcends the longstanding practice specialties.  Respondents planning a career in private practice tend to have more respect for democratic principles (free speech, competitive elections, etc.) than do their colleagues who want to become judges, prosecutors, or to work elsewhere in the Russian state bureaucracy, who show a greater willingness to support policies associated with the Putin regime. In particular, those who aspire to work in the state sector are more likely to support the verdicts in politicized cases, such as those involving Mikhail Khodorkovskii and Pussy Riot. This fissure suggests that young Russian lawyers aiming for a career in private practice may be open to challenging the state. In other ways, the data show the profound effect of Soviet-era traditions.  The gender patterns of the past are clearly visible in these Russian millennials' career preferences.  Female respondents are more likely to opt for careers in the judiciary or as in-house lawyers for companies, replicating the choices of Soviet women with legal training.  The criminal justice system remains a largely male enclave.  The results from the project have been disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals.  The PI has also organized panels focusing on the role of lawyers at annual meetings of interdisciplinary organizations, such as the Law &amp; Society Association and the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies.  Several of these panels have brought together scholars of the legal profession in other authoritarian countries.  The project has provided opportunities for the training of several undergraduate and graduate students in research methods.
