<AbstractNarration>The ubiquity and accelerated growth of wireless networks and services is critically dependent on the availability and efficient use of wireless spectrum. Increasing demand for spectrum is already pushing the current commercial wireless networks to their limits and accentuates the need for transformative approaches for wireless system design. In order to meet this demand, wireless networks are rapidly evolving towards a highly dense, user-deployed, heterogeneous infrastructure characterized by aggressive spectral reuse. Such evolutionary architectures can realize high data rates although they must operate in the presence of severe interference. In traditional system design, interference is viewed as a negative externality with the end goal being its suppression or mitigation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops new approaches for embracing interference through synergistic exploitation of feedback, network dynamics and network knowledge heterogeneity. The key angle leveraged in this work is to exploit interference as side information. The project will characterize the gain provided by feedback, and analyze the scalability and dependence of such gains on network topology. In addition, the researchers investigate the impact of dynamical variations in network topology and devise algorithms that harness such variations to enhance the overall network performance. The researchers also investigate the optimal utilization of heterogeneous channel knowledge for multi-flow multi-antenna wireless systems, by considering scenarios in which network channel knowledge exhibits variability in spatial and temporal domains and developing algorithms to exploit such variability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the project were to understand how to optimally utilize feedback in wireless systems by exploiting interference as side information; harness network topological variations to improve network capacity and efficiency; exploit heterogeneous network channel knowledge by opportunistically coding across knowledge states; and make physical layer security robust by investigating the impact of such variations.   Over the course of this project, we made progress on all of these fronts and novel insights and results were obtained on how to exploit feedback, topology and channel knowledge in an unconventional manner for several problems.  In particular, for multi-antenna broadcast channels, we showed that variations in channel knowledge can be exploited to improve spectral efficiency, both with and without secrecy constraints. We found the approximate capacity of the interference channel with noisy feedback and also established the Nash equilibrium region for such channels; thus showing that feedback can be useful even in decentralized settings. The role of channel knowledge heterogeneity was studied for downlink broadcast networks and the approximate degrees of freedom were characterized for some configurations. For a class of interference networks (namely X-networks), we also explored the  fundamental tradeoff between achievable degrees of freedom and feedback delay.
