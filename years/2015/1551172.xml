<AbstractNarration>Research has shown that both children and adults differentiate between pedagogical and non-pedagogical situations, that pedagogical inferences override factual information and impede discovery learning in children, and that pedagogical demonstrations lead to predictable patterns of inferences in undergraduates. The purpose of this CAREER project is to explore the extent to which social-pedagogical context affects learning with preschool students and undergraduates. The project will contrast learning from a knowledgeable teacher with learning from a naive teacher, to explore how different inferences result from these situations, even when the exact same examples are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to use a Bayesian model of social-pedagogical learning across six laboratory-based studies to test the main hypothesis that pedagogical situations affect the inferences that learners draw from data in ways that are manipulable and predictable. For each of the six experimental studies the researcher will recruit approximately 50 preschoolers or undergraduates and randomly assign them to one of two conditions in a laboratory setting. The research will explore how inferences are drawn from a set of examples while manipulating how those examples are generated (e.g., from a knowledgeable teacher vs. at random). The goal of the project is to learn more about when, why, and how social-pedagogical context affects learning to inform a theoretical framework for understanding children and adult abilities to transmit and accumulate knowledge.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    While scientists marvel at people?s ability to rapidly learn about the world, educators observe stark limitations to human learning. This research investigated the hypothesis that the abilities critical to the impressive learning noted by psychologists also predispose people to systematic errors in educational settings. The approach included the development of mathematical models of learning from teaching and behavioral experiments with children and adults.      From a scientific perspective, this project resulted in the first model of learning from cooperative teachers. The validity of the model has been established through experiments with children and adults and documented in dozens of papers in which we show how the cooperative mechanisms that foster rapid learning in more naturalistic settings also create problems in educational settings. This mathematical model has since been further developed into a machine learning algorithm and is at the core of new efforts to develop automated algorithms whose aim is to cooperate with human learners to foster learning.      The educational approaches used in schools tend toward teacher-centric learning approaches. While many different methods are available, we have lacked knowledge about which methods to use in which situations, and why. The scientific advances in the project have established a theoretical framework within which these questions may be answered.
