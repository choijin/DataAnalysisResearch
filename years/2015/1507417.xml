<AbstractNarration>1. Nontechnical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Metals and their alloys are critically important to the production of structural components required in the complex machines supporting modern society.  Examples of metallic structural components are readily evident in automobiles, aircraft, bridges and buildings.  Less obvious are the microscopic features inside these materials that control their properties and enable them to effectively serve in the most demanding tasks, features that are collectively called the microstructure.  The microstructure includes grains, small individual crystals of the metal, that determine strength, ductility and other material properties.  The grain structure must be controlled during manufacturing of each component if it is to achieve the properties required for its technological application.  This project seeks to build the science of how grains develop and grow while metals are deformed at elevated temperatures, an important processing step in a wide variety of metals manufacturing operations.  The growth of grains under these conditions is called dynamic grain growth.  The new understanding produced under this project is expected to positively impact future manufacturing practices for the forming of metals.  Through participation in this scientific investigation, students at the graduate and undergraduate levels are trained.  An integral aspect of this project is a partnership with ASM International on enhancing the open dissemination of research results so that valuable data can most positively impact the scientific and engineering communities, as well as broader society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic grain growth is a topic of great technological importance to the manufacture of wrought metal and alloy products.  Yet, it is also a topic within metals science for which we have only a very limited understanding.  This experimental research project seeks to produce new understanding for the mechanisms that cause dynamic grain growth, better establish why grain boundary migration behaviors are different between the dynamic and static cases, and organize these new understandings to positively impact manufacturing technologies.  The mechanisms responsible for dynamic grain growth in body-centered-cubic metals are a primary focus.  Both dynamic abnormal grain growth and dynamic normal grain growth are addressed.  The materials studied include the refractory metals, molybdenum and tantalum, and iron-based alloys.  The iron-based alloys include commercially important interstitial-free steels, which provide both a nearly ideal model material for scientific investigation and a material of technological relevance.  Experiments are designed to test new hypotheses for the relationship between dynamic normal and dynamic abnormal grain growth; probe existing hypothesis for the mobility of grain boundaries under dynamic conditions; and explore questions for which no hypotheses currently exist.  Experimental methods include unique mechanical testing, modern characterization techniques, advanced computerized data analysis techniques and interpretation through numerical models.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><div id="text-2" class="outline-text-2"> <p>The goals of this project were to produce new understanding for the mechanisms that cause dynamic grain growth in body centered cubic (BCC) metals and alloys, better establish why grain boundary migration behaviors are different between the dynamic and static cases, and organize these new understandings to positively impact manufacturing technologies. Metals and their alloys are used in a wide variety of structural applications, which range from supporting bridges and buildings to providing the structures of automobiles and airplanes. These materials are composed of many tiny crystals, called grains. The microscopic structures of and within grains, referred to as microstructure by materials scientists, provide the strength and desirable properties necessary for manufactured components. The size of grains strongly influences these properties. Grain size often changes during the manufacturing of products. Of particular concern is grain growth during deformation at elevated temperatures, a process termed dynamic grain growth. This phenomenon is poorly understood, yet it is important for creating products with good properties. This project produced a new understanding of dynamic grain growth.</p> <p>The first experimental data documenting dynamic grain growth and how it differs from static grain growth (grain growth at elevated temperature without plastic deformation) were produced for an interstitial free steel material. Dynamic grain growth is significantly faster than static grain growth. This is demonstrated in Figure 1. The grain size after deformation at elevated temperature is significantly larger than the grain size after an equivalent time at the same temperature and subsequent deformation at room temperature. Dynamic grain growth produces a bimodal distribution in grain size, as shown in Figure 2, which becomes more clear with increasing plastic strain at elevated temperature. Dynamic grain growth also produces a unique distribution of crystallographic orientations among grains, termed crystallographic texture, as demonstrated in Figure 3. A mechanism that produces these unique behaviors was identified in the subgrains formed by dislocations generated during plastic deformation at elevated temperature. An example of these is presented in Figure 4. Subgrains are formed by arrays of dislocations that create boundaries within existing grains. These boundaries locally reorient the crystal that composes the grain, and these subgrain boundaries then interact with grain boundaries to drive their motion during dynamic grain growth. This specific mechanism of grain growth driven by subgrain boundaries appears to be unique to dynamic grain growth. Similar dynamic grain growth behavior was also observed in other BCC metals, including molybdenum and niobium. An example from niobium is shown in Figure 5. The establishment of this mechanistic understanding provides a basis to predict when dynamic grain growth will occur and to potentially control its effects.</p> <p>Four graduate students participated in this research, two of whom are women. One woman completed her doctoral dissertation under this project, and the second established the basis for her doctoral dissertation. Two undergraduate students and one high-school teacher participated in research activities. This study produced or contributed to five refereed journal publications and fourteen presentations at international conferences.</p> </div><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/10/2021<br>      Modified by: Eric&nbsp;M&nbsp;Taleff</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1507417/1507417_10365690_1628630996849_fig01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1507417/1507417_10365690_1628630996849_fig01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Grain structure of a steel after deformation at room and elevated temperature"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1507417/1507417_10365690_1628630996849_fig01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Grain structure of a steel after deformation at room and elevated temperature"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The grain structure of an interstitial-free steel material is shown (left) after annealing at 850�C and subsequent deformation at room temperature and (right) after an equivalent deformation at 850�C.
