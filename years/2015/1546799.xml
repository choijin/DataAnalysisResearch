<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "Recent Methods in Operator Theory" that will be held on October 15 and 16, 2015, on the campus of the University of Memphis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is a satellite event to the meeting of the American Mathematical Society's Southeastern Section that will take place in October 2015. The conference will focus attention on recent methods and advances in operator theory via a series of expository lectures on long-standing open problems in operator theory, state-of-the-art techniques, and important recent contributions to the field. The goals of the workshop are the following: (1) to disseminate mainstream trends, state-of-the-art techniques, and recent advances in operator theory to a large group of female and underrepresented graduate students and early career mathematicians; (2) to create a social environment among a diverse level of participants encouraging fruitful discussions of mathematical ideas and sharing of promising research; and (3) to initiate a network of support among participants for future research interaction.The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

The list of participants included leading researchers in Operator Theory, early career mathematicians and graduate students. There were six plenary lectures, a general audience talk and a poster session. Plenary lectures were given by an international group of female mathematicians with highly respected research work in operator theory and well recognized communication<a href="file:///C:/Users/mbotelho/Desktop/Conference-Oct-15/NSF-WORKSHOP-OUTCOME.doc#_msocom_1">[FB1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; skills.&nbsp; The plenary talks were geared to advanced graduate students and early career mathematicians. The poster session had 12 participants. The lectures, posters, meals and informal periods for discussion promoted an active and friendly environment very much appreciated by everyone present. A group of mathematicians evaluated anonymously all posters and three of those posters received an award. Presentations, abstracts and posters are available at the web location: <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/msci/2015prmo/">http://www.memphis.edu/msci/2015prmo/</a></p> <p>The conference was on Methods in Operator Theory and Applications.

The workshop presentations gave an introductory and broad view of several active research areas within Operator Theory. It also provided background information for the presentations given at the Fall Southeastern-AMS Special Session (October 17-18, 2015) on Advances in Operator Theory and Applications, in Memory of James Jamison, co-organized by the Fernanda Botelho (University of Memphis) and T.S.S.R.K.
