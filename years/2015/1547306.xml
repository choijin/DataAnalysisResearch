<AbstractNarration>As new spectrum for data communication becomes available, it is increasingly important to develop cognitive network technologies that can opportunistically use spectrum whenever available and speak different wireless protocols on demand. Full duplex wireless is an exciting new technology that allows a node to send and receive simultaneously on the same spectrum. Despite significant progress, existing work on full duplex wireless focuses on narrowband production wireless systems, such as Wi-Fi and ZigBee. This project aims to develop novel systems and algorithms to embrace full duplex for cognitive networks and support different wireless technologies. The research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate curriculum, and disseminated broadly to researchers, practitioners policy makers, high school students, parents, and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops techniques that (i) go beyond narrowband and use novel cancellation mechanisms to enable transmit-while-sensing on a wider band spectrum, (ii) support cross technologies that transmit Wi-Fi while receiving LTE and vice versa, and (iii) translate physical layer advances to end-to-end performance benefits by re-visiting upper-layer protocol design. These three thrusts will enable a holistic full duplex cognitive radio platform.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The main objective of this project is to explore how the current state of the cognitive radio research can be made richer with the latest advents in wireless physical layer technologies. Specifically, we explore how in-band full duplex can improve cognitive radio systems. Embracing full duplex for conginitive radios can translate physical layer advancements to end-to-end performance gains. To this end, one of the applications we explored was wireless multicast. Wireless multicast has not been succesful partly due to the overhead needed for feedback: Every node has to report the set of packets it has received for the transmitter to move forward. In our work, we showed that the nodes can simply send an energy pulse to indicate they don't want the transmitter to move forward. Thus, there is no need to identify exactly which node did not receive the packet and only a simple signaling is sufficient. This makes the overhead a constant, independent of the number of users. We combined this feedback with a multi-channel resource framework and showed that it can significantly improve throughput and reduce delay. Another line of work that we explored was reduction of neighborhood discovery and channel estimation using compressive sensing techniques. Throughout these explorations, we used the new physical layer feature, the full duplex capability. It shows a lot of promise in the cognitive radio network domain. Our work is repeatedly published at top networking venues such as MobiSys, MobiCom, Infocom and MobiHoc.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/10/2019<br>      Modified by: Kannan&nbsp;Srinivasan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
