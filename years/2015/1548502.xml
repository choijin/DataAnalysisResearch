<AbstractNarration>1548502(Mataric)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of adults over the age of 65 is predicted to reach 83.7 million by 2050. There is accordingly a growing need for technologies for the elderly to complement human care in addressing the fast-growing needs of the elderly population.  This project takes a novel approach to developing and evaluating an assistive technology for the elderly: it views the family unit as a team, and focuses on developing a robots as a team member (rather than individual assistant) designed to aid in the achievement of team/family goals. In the project, these goals are focused on the wellbeing of the elderly family member, and include daily social connectedness with others in the family, regular physical and cognitive activity, and medication adherence. These goals are part of the family dynamic and involve the interaction of various team members, pairwise, in subgroups, or all together. The project will develop a hardware and software infrastructure for deploying a socially assistive robot in the home and methods for enabling the robot to adapt to the family members in order to aid in facilitating team dynamics and aiding family goal achievement.  The project brings together leading experts in socially assistive robotics, gerontology, and social work, who will spend two years in a tightly knit process of technology development combined with in home system evaluation with participating families. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on engineering team interactions and dynamics, with the robot as a member of the team, embedded in a real-world environment and interacting with other team members in real time. The engineering goal is to develop data-driven robot control algorithms and the associated hardware and software infrastructure for enabling robots to serve as team members in the context of family-supported eldercare. The control algorithms, combined with the hardware and software infrastructure, will enable the robot system to perceive and understand the relevant aspects of the family interaction dynamics, be a participant/component in those team dynamics, and influence/streer those team dynamics toward desired family team goals. The project will enable and then iteratively probe the effects of the robot as team member in different interaction contexts (user-family, user-caregiver, family-caregiver). Furthermore, the project tackles three fundamental components in team goal achievement: evaluation of team performance, coordination of actions across multiple team members, and team member role assignment. It also investigates the application of unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning techniques to the domain of elderly care. The research is complemented with a K-12 STEM outreach program consisting of annual free interactive workshops for students in secondary education (grades 6-12; up to 30 students per workshop). Simple robot programming and demonstrations of the hardware and software being developed in the project will be used to discuss how assistive robots could play a role in society, starting with the students' families.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF EAGER project took a novel approach to facilitating physical and social activities of older adults by introducing a socially assistive robot (SAR) as a member of the family to support desired activities. The project produced two innovative contributions: the first is a method for using a SAR as a moderator to help family groups interact and get along, and the second is a novel approach to supporting the development of new healthy habits for older adults.  The project began with a series of interviews with older adults to inform the design of the table-top owl-like robot, Kiwi, its voice and movements, the in-home experiment setup, and the family activities and games.  In addition, the collected data served to inform the development of an approach for using the robot as part of family social interactions and indicate wellness habits older adults were interested in developing with the help of the robot. Two pilot studies were performed with three-member family groups---consisting of an older adult, their adult child, and a grandchild--to study the effect of the robot moderator on the family interactions.  The robot used personalized behaviors to promote inclusion of all family members; it kept track of who was talking and how much, then encouraged balance.   Based on the results of the two pilots, the approach was updated and refined, and then deployed and evaluation in two experiments: a study of adaptive group moderation and a study of habit formation.     The full deployment of the robot family moderator examined a socially assistive robot interacting with intergenerational family groups by playing a variety of collaborative and competitive games, and included a comparison group of adult-only groups.  The results were analyzed and reported in multiple publications.  The second full deployment involved the same robot, Kiwi, using a socially assistive approach to help older adults to form a new habit of avoiding sitting for more than an hour at a time.  The in-home setup consisted of the robot on a small table placed next to the user's favorite chair, which was equipped with a seat sensor.  The robot kept track of how much the user was sitting, cued the user to stand up as needed, and rewarded the user with jokes and dancing. The system was deployed in multiple homes with older adults who live alone, and data were collected, including pre- and post-robot periods in order to study robot-supported behavior change and habit formation.  Scientific Merit: This EAGER project was the first to develop and evaluate two novel approaches to using socially assistive robots with older adults.  One was a robot moderator for intergenerational family groups, the other was robot-supported habit formation, evaluated in multi-week in-home deployments.   The results of the moderator approach and evaluation showed that the SAR system was capable of improving group interactions and user feelings of inclusion, as well as of reducing conflict and selfishness.  The results of the habit formation approach and evaluation showed that older adults eagerly adhered to the robot's recommended wellness activities, and sat less while the robot was present in the home; they also reported enjoying having the robot in the home over multiple weeks.  Both the moderation and habit formation systems included adaptive components, enabling the robot to adjust to the user's preferences.    Broader Impacts: This work is the first to demonstrate socially assistive robots embedded in family and home settings of elderly adults and measure acceptance and successful behavior change over multiple weeks.  It therefore paves the way for continued research into SAR for the elderly, as well as technology development and commercialization for the growing elderly population.   Furthermore, the project involved K-12 STEM outreach activities by the team members, allowing young students to experience demonstrations and hands-on activities that showed research deployed in real-world settings and uses.   Finally, this EAGER project was highly interdisciplinary, involving faculty, graduate, and undergraduate researchers from engineering, computer science, gerontology, and social work. All researchers learned about concepts, literature, and methodologies used in the many fields spanned by the project, including insights on robotics, study design for in-home deployments, and design for inclusion of older adults in research.
