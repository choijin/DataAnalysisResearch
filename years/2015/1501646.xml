<AbstractNarration>Recent research shows that the gut microbial communities can have significant effects on an individual's health as well as on susceptibility to obesity. This project combines laboratory experiments with quantitative information on body size variation from 26 populations of wild house mice across North and South America to shed new light on factors contributing to the composition and the function of gut microbes. Because humans and wild mice show similar variation in their gut microbial composition across the globe, the findings in wild mice may serve as a model to help understand the role of gut microbes in digestion and human health more broadly. The project will support the research to improve a doctoral student's dissertation. Data and specimens collected in the field will be publicly available through the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at University of California, Berkeley and electroically. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;House mice are an ideal mammalian model system that can be used, through manipulative laboratory experiments, to disentangle confounding factors that are associated with microbial community variation in natural populations. Mice derived from natural populations at high and low latitudes show pronounced differences in body size. Laboratory-reared descendants of these extreme populations will be used in manipulative experiments to test the effects of two dietary types and the two host genotypes on gut microbiota. Comparative metagenomics of the cecal contents of wild and laboratory-reared individuals will quantify the differences in microbial metabolic capability (for example, efficiency in energy extraction) between populations. Results will improve current understanding of mammalian gut microbial ecology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The microbial communities living in and on our body can affect our health. Recent studies in humans and mouse models have demonstrated previously unknown roles for the gut microbiota in mammalian digestion, immunity, behavior, and development. These findings suggest that the compositional variation in gut microbiotas may play a fundamental role in host ecology and evolution more broadly. However, the determinants and implications of the gut microbiota in natural populations of mammals are less well understood. The aims of the project are to identify genetic and environmental factors shaping variation in the gut microbiota and to understand the role of gut microbiota in mammalian biology. First, we reviewed studies over the last decade that show links between variation in symbiotic microbiota and variation in host traits in natural populations of mammals to motivate the work. This work was published in Integrative and Comparative Biology. Next, to investigate the determinants of the gut microbiota and their roles in climatic adaptation, we conducted a series of studies where we combined field observations and laboratory experiments using natural populations of house mice <em>(Mus musculus) </em>as a mammalian model system. We have collected wild house mouse populations across two altitudinal and three latitudinal transects across the Americas (Fig. 1) and characterized the gut microbiota using 16S amplicon sequencing approach. From the two altitudinal transects, we found evidence that partial pressure of oxygen may affect the composition of the gut microbiota and high-altitude-associated gut microbial communities may regulate blood pressure (Fig.2). From the three latitudinal transects, we found evidence that body mass was one of the best predictors of the gut microbiota, and laboratory experiments suggested that the microbiota from colder climates facilitate greater energy harvest from diet compared to the microbiota from warmer climates (Fig.3). Furthermore, we discovered several genes in the mouse genome that were associated with variation in the gut microbiota. Many of the findings here have been replicated in other mammalian systems, including humans. Together, the results suggest general mechanisms governing the assembly and function of the mammalian gut microbiota. Three manuscripts from this work are in preparation to submit to academic journals. This project also involved the training of one Ph.D. student.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/07/2018<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;W&nbsp;Nachman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1501646/1501646_10368385_1528186138132_Fig3_Suzuki_DDIG_report--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1501646/1501646_10368385_1528186138132_Fig3_Suzuki_DDIG_report--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig.3 Latitude and microbiota"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1501646/1501646_10368385_1528186138132_Fig3_Suzuki_DDIG_report--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig.3 Latitude and microbiota"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Graphical abstract of the hypothesis generated from three latitudinal transects of wild mouse populations.
