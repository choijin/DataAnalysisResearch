<AbstractNarration>Friendship is an integral part of being human, and intimate and cooperative relationships are key to becoming an adult. Despite this, little is known about the nature of friendship, its function, and when in our species' history it arose. Answers to these questions may be found in our closest living relatives, chimpanzees. Like humans, adult male chimpanzees form strong social bonds with unrelated individuals, which confer benefits, including mutual aid. This project will investigate how and why friendship develops for male chimpanzees, how it relates to cooperation, competition, and the transition to adulthood, and when in life friendships are forged. The findings may be useful for reconstructing the evolutionary history of human friendship. This research will also employ two novel methods to assess growth non-invasively in wild chimpanzees. Because body size and growth are key life history variables, these methods will have far-reaching importance for biological anthropology and related fields. This project will also have social and conservation benefits. The investigators engage in educational activities in rural Uganda and the United States. In addition, the continued presence of researchers in Kibale National Park will help protect one of the last tropical rainforests in all of East Africa, and one of the principal strongholds of chimpanzees in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will investigate the development of social bonds in male chimpanzees living in an exceptionally large community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. Behavioral observations will be carried out to assess when, why, and how social bonds between male chimpanzees are formed. The investigators will also assess the physical transition to adulthood. Digital photography, with parallel lasers acting as a scale in the photo, will be used to measure limb lengths non-invasively across a one-year period. In addition, collagen biomarkers will be implemented for the first time to assess growth in wild chimpanzees. Through a systematic study of adolescent male chimpanzee behavior, physiology, and morphology, this research aims to elucidate the development of friendship and the meaning of adulthood.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Adolescence is a distinct social phase in male chimpanzees (<em>Pan troglodytes</em>). Until now, very little was known about this period of development. Adult male chimpanzee life is centered on jockeying for dominance rank and maintaining social bonds. Do these relationships emerge during adolescence? Our research at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda, produced four main findings. First, adolescent male chimpanzees <em>do not</em> form a dominance hierarchy with other adolescents. Second, adolescent male chimpanzees <em>do</em> form social bonds with other males. Third, these social bonds are formed with maternal brothers, peers, old males, and, surprisingly, fathers. Fourth, bonds with old males and fathers are explained by the past space use and rank of older males when adolescent and young adult male chimpanzees were infants and juveniles.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Delaying dominance, making friends</p> <p>Adult male chimpanzees seem to eat, live, and breathe to compete and to establish their dominance over others. We have shown that adolescent male chimpanzees, in stark contrast to adults, do not compete for status with their peers. This surprising finding leads to an obvious question: Why wait? One possibility is that adolescent male chimpanzees forego aggressive encounters with other males to appear less threatening to adult males, thereby reducing potential aggression from them. Since adolescent male chimpanzees must integrate into the social world of adult males, characterized by both cooperation and competition, adolescent males prioritize affiliative relationships over agonistic interactions.</p> <p>Indeed, we found that adolescent male chimpanzees form social bonds with other males. Given the importance of social bonds in adulthood, it is not surprising that bonds arise during adolescence, as had been suggested by previous studies. Both adolescent and young adult male chimpanzees form social bonds with peers and maternal brothers. This is similar to patterns displayed by older adult males. Adolescents and young adults, however, forge some of their strongest bonds with relatively old adult males. In a further twist to this story, some of the old males with whom adolescent and young adult males form friendships are their fathers. Such bonds are unexpected because chimpanzees mate promiscuously, and there is no reason to suspect that young male chimpanzees can recognize their fathers or that fathers can recognize their sons. Yet adolescent and young adults at Ngogo seek out their fathers. They spend considerable time grooming old males, especially their fathers.

They avoid dominance interactions, but form social bonds with other males, including maternal kin, unrelated males, and their fathers.
