<AbstractNarration>PI: Nie, Zhihong &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1541654 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is known as one of the most important reasons for the cytotoxicity of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) that are commonly used in medical devices. This project proposes to use electron spin resonance spectroscopy to assess potential toxicity associated with nanoparticles. It aims for new insights and mechanistic knowledge regarding nanoparticle toxicity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will meet the pressing need for identifying the potential hazards of metal and metal oxide NPs used in medical devices. The project has three expected outcomes. First, these studies will offer new insights into the fundamental understanding the ROS generation by nanomaterials in general. Second, it will, for the first time, fully elucidate the role of spatial arrangement of NPs on their ROS generation in biologically relevant environments. Finally, the mechanistic knowledge obtained from this research will guide the better design of safe and effective medical devices or products containing nanoscale materials. The PI will recruit and train students particularly from under-represented groups at both graduate and undergraduate levels into this research program. Students involved in the multidisciplinary research will acquire skills and knowledge crossing in nanomaterials, spectroscopy, nano-bio interactions, and medical safety.</AbstractNarration>
