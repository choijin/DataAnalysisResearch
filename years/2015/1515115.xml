<AbstractNarration>A longstanding problem in astrophysics is to understand how galaxies form and develop throughout their lifetimes.  Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to study supermassive black holes (BHs) at the centers of massive galaxies.  These BHs light up as quasars during the relatively brief phases when the BHs accumulate most of their mass through accretion.  Over the past half-century, considerable effort has been devoted to capturing these accretion spurts through surveys at optical wavelengths.  In general, these surveys have been limited to the most luminous sources, or small numbers within deep fields; however, quasar observations are undergoing an exponential leap in depth and breadth enabled by new and upcoming surveys.  The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III/BOSS) final data release will include about 160,000 quasars at redshifts around 2--3, and its successor, the SDSS-IV/eBOSS, will obtain spectra of over 600,000 quasars at redshifts around 1--2.  The investigators will complement the quasar samples from these cosmology surveys with their own high redshift programs to form a complete picture of the evolution of faint quasars from optical surveys. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will integrate the science program into a tiered outreach program at Pima Community College, a Hispanic-Serving Institution located in Tucson.  The outreach program includes (1) public lectures at the East Campus, a region not reached by The University of Arizona programs, (2) lectures to Astronomy 101 students at Pima integrating an overview of Active Galactic Nuclei into the regular curriculum, and (3) engagement of a small number of Pima students in the research program itself by teaching the basics of quasar spectroscopy and including the students in the eBOSS program to visually inspect quasar spectra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, exploring this method in the regime of sparse data (an important precursor for LSST), the team will utilize Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) reductions of SDSS imaging data to identify about 400 quasars at redshifts around z = 4 through variability selection.  Finally, the team will use deep CFHT imaging to reach faint quasars (i_AB = 24) at redshift around z = 5.  Together, these data will probe several magnitudes below the break luminosity over a wide redshift range and will reach nearly all objects classifiable as quasars over 5 Gyr of cosmic evolution, including the crucial epoch when both star formation and quasar activity peak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leveraging massive spectroscopic surveys as well as separate observations with large telescopes, the team will complete the census of the faint end of the quasar luminosity function to redshift around z = 5 and obtain new measurements of high-z clustering, thereby providing strong constraints for models of quasar lifetimes and feedback physics.  These measurements will also provide strong constraints on the quasar ionizing background during the epoch of He II reionization.  Finally, a key aspect of the project is to develop tools needed for an era when quasar surveys will be dominated by systematics rather than by statistics.  The team will accomplish this by building models for quasar properties constrained by existing observations but which provide useful projections for future surveys.  These models will be used to guide target selection for spectroscopic efforts, identify quasars from photometric data, and train photometric redshift estimation; furthermore, they will provide insight into intrinsic quasar properties, such as continuum and dust extinction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Luminous quasars are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes at the centers of massive galaxies. Therefore, the cosmic evolution of quasars trace the history of black hole growth and their connection to galaxy evolution in the universe. In addition, luminous quasars provide bright background light sources illuminating the diffuse gas in the intergalactic space, probing the evolution of intergalactic medium, especially in the era close to reionization at the end of cosmic dark ages. In this NSF program, our goal is to conduct new comprehensive surveys of quasar in the early universe, which will be used to trace their cosmic evolution in a statistical sense, and to develop the tools for future quasar surveys using upcoming facilities such as DESI, LSST and WFIRST.   1. Intellectual Merits. We conducted a series of quasar surveys addressing a number of missing or incomplete links in the studies of quasar evolution. We carried out the Extremely Luminous Quasar Survey (ELQS) by targeting the most luminous quasars over the entire extragalactic sky, focusing on the redshift range of 3-5, the so-called cosmic noon, when the black hole activities and star formation in the universe have peaked. We carried out deep ?pencil-beam? surveys of distant quasars at z~5, roughly two billion years after the big bang, an epoch when the contribution of quasar light to the cosmic ionization has been under intense debate. We also carried out the first large systematic survey of quasars at z&gt;6.5, less than one billion years after the big bang, at the epoch of reionization.    These surveys allow us to probe in detail the evolution of supermassive black hole population during key cosmic epochs. In particular, we found an accelerated evolution of quasar density towards earlier times at z&gt;5, in the first two billion years of cosmic history. On the other hand, our survey also revealed the existence of extremely massive black holes in the first few hundred million years after the big bang, which directly challenges the theory of black hole formation. We have also discovered some of the brightest  galaxies and quasars in the early universe, with their brightness boosted by gravitational lensing, opening up a new window to study quasar and galaxy evolution.    2. Broader Impacts.  Supported by this NSF program, we have developed a set of comprehensive tools to model the spectral and spatial evolution of quasar population. These tools are publicly available and are being used extensively in designing future quasar surveys using DESI and LSST. Our new sample of reionization-era quasars are providing both ideal targets for multi-wavelength observations using both ground- and space-based telescopes and are based used as testbed to design future studies of reionization using JWST and WFIRST.    We have involved junior scientists, including graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdocs in this NSF project. Two Ph.D. theses are based on data from this project. More than two dozen papers are led by junior scientists. The machine learning technique and dataset are used in designing a new graduate level course on data mining and machine learning in astronomy.   Studies of black holes and early universe are of general interests to the public, especially young students. We have given lectures and directly hand-on activities in K-12 school and a Tucson-are community college, including those serving underrepresented and underserved communities. Our new quasar discoveries are also highlighted in numerous press releases and media interviews both locally and internationally.
