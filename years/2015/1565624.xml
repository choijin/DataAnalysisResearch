<AbstractNarration>The conference "The p-adic Langlands Program and Related Topics" will be held May 16-20, 2016 at Indiana University Bloomington. The main theme of the conference  is the interplay between number theory and group theory, as envisioned by Robert Langlands and known as the Langlands Program. The conference will be devoted to a recently developed branch of the Langlands program that has close ties with the spectacular solution of Fermat's Last Theorem by A. Wiles. One scientific aim of the conference is to provide a roadmap of the current avenues of research in this rapidly developing field that will serve as a guide to this area for the mathematical community, in particular graduate students and young researchers. The main activity of the conference will be twenty-three lectures by leading experts from the United States and overseas that will be videotaped and made freely available on the conference website http://pages.iu.edu/~mstrauch/conference_2016/. An important purpose of the conference is to foster communication and collaboration. In particular, the organizers will publish the conference proceedings, with research articles as well as introductory surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The p-adic Langlands correspondence seeks to relate p-adic Galois representations to Banach space representations of p-adic reductive groups. The fundamental work of Pierre Colmez in the case of two-dimensional Galois representations has confirmed the expectation that such a correspondence should exist. The current focus of research is on higher-dimensional representations and on base fields other than the field of p-adic numbers. Important progress in closely related areas has recently been made, namely in the study of eigenvarieties, deformations of Galois representations, p-adic Hodge Theory, modular representations of p-adic groups, and geometric realizations of Langlands correspondences. The conference will bring together experts who have made substantial contributions in each of these areas and thereby pave the way for new insights.</AbstractNarration>
