<AbstractNarration>Computer-based models and simulations are vital technologies needed in advanced economies to guide the design of complex systems. For example, increased urbanization will necessitate investments of trillions of dollars globally in the next two decades toward the development of urban infrastructures such as transportation, water, and energy. A significant portion of this investment is needed to address concerns regarding the aging infrastructure in the United States. Computer models and simulation are essential to guide this re-design of major cities in order to realize increased sustainability and resilience to natural and human-caused disasters. Similarly, modeling and simulation are essential technologies to design complex systems in industries such as aerospace, manufacturing, logistics and supply chains, telecommunications, computer and information systems, health care, defense, and homeland security, among others. However, the development and use of reliable computer models and simulations is today time consuming and expensive. Engineered systems are continually increasing in complexity and scale. Advances in modeling and simulation technologies are essential to maximize the effectiveness of computer-based tools to engineer the increasingly complex systems needed in the future. Further, recent technological advances such as cloud computing, novel computer architectures, big data, and the Internet of Things necessitate new developments in modeling and simulation to fully exploit these capabilities. This project will convene a workshop that brings together leading researchers from disparate disciplines to identify and articulate the most important, impactful modeling and simulation research problems and questions that must be addressed to maximize the impact of new modeling and simulation technologies. The results of this workshop will inform future research investments in modeling and simulation, and ultimately, enable the creation of more effective and less costly engineered, complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will address key topical areas in modeling and simulation. Conceptual modeling will be examined to determine how teams of individuals from different disciplines can best create sophisticated, reliable models of complex systems. Advanced computational methods will examine topics such as exploitation of new computing capabilities and technologies. Techniques and methodologies to manage uncertainty in the design of complex systems will be addressed. Approaches to enable and facilitate model reuse will be explored to accelerate and reduce of cost of creating effective computational models.</AbstractNarration>

Cities face enormous challenges resulting from aging infrastructure, increased urbanization, and technological breakthroughs such as smart electric power grids, autonomous vehicles, and commercial drones, to mention a few. The healthcare delivery system faces growing demands due to an aging population while the system must adapt to an explosion in patient data, changing payment models, and advances in medical technologies. Advances in manufacturing offer dramatic increases in competitiveness and economic growth, but require rapid increases in automation and fast, seamless integration while new technologies such as additive manufacturing and new approaches to materials design come online. Advanced space missions call for stringent requirements for robustness and flexibility in the face of harsh and unpredictable environments and operation over extreme distances. Defense acquisitions face challenges from asymmetric threats, changing missions, globalization, declining budgets, a shrinking defense industrial base, and service imperatives, mandates, and regulations.  Modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) is essential to understand, assess, and optimize complex systems such as these, and to enable effective, informed decision making. However, the exploding complexity of new systems that are being developed as well as new advances in computing technology create new challenges and opportunities for the M&amp;S field. Today, the creation and use of computer models and simulations is too time consuming, expensive and can sometimes produce unreliable results for the highly complex engineered systems now being created.  A new generation of M&amp;S technologies are essential to enable creation of more effective, robust, and cost-effective engineered complex systems that are critical to modern societies. The workshop funded by this grant convened M&amp;S experts who describe technological advances in four areas as particularly important:  New computer modeling languages (aka conceptual models) and approaches are needed to enable effective collaboration among individuals with backgrounds in different disciplines, particularly in the early stages of system development. Advances are essential to enable seamless integration and cost-effective, error free translation of models into efficient computer programs. New computer algorithms and computational techniques are required to fully realize the potential and opportunities afforded by new computing technologies such as mobile and cloud computing, big data, the Internet of Things and modern supercomputer architectures. Advances are needed to enable M&amp;S technologies to address the rapidly increasing complexity and scale of the systems that need to be created today. New approaches are required to gain better fundamental understandings of uncertainty that is inherent in all yet-to-be-realized systems, and to realize practical methods to manage this uncertainty. Advances will enable the creation of robust, dynamic, complex systems that can adapt as unexpected events and phenomena arise in the future. Advances are needed to reduce the time and cost to create computer models of complex systems. In principle, integrating existing simulation models rather than developing new ones offers a means to dramatically reduce time and cost, but advances are needed to fulfill the vison of rapid creation of reliable integrated simulations.   These represent critical areas of future research in the modeling and simulation community where new approaches and techniques will have significant, societal impacts.
