<AbstractNarration>Disparities in engineering participation and achievement by women and individuals from traditionally underserved racial and ethnic groups have been persistent.  Approaches outside the context of university and school reform, including approaches to supporting interest development in early childhood, have not been fully considered by educators and policymakers. This AISL Pathways project will focus on engineering, which has emerged as a critical topic in the STEM education field and a prominent aspect of educational standards and policies. Building on a strong empirical and theoretical base, it will lay the foundation for future research efforts to advance the field's limited understanding of early childhood engineering-related interest development, especially through parent-child interactions; create research tools for studying engineering-related interest in young children; and identify effective strategies for supporting long-term engineering interest pathways. "Head Start on Engineering" is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through an asset-based approach and authentic engagement with families and community organizations, Head Start on Engineering will pilot research and program activities that are sensitive to the constraints of low-income families and build on the resources and funds of knowledge within these communities. It will test and refine an innovative, theoretical model of early childhood interest development. The overall design of the pilot study will be mixed-method and short-term longitudinal, with data collected before, during, and after program implementation from participating families. Quantitative measures will allow for consistent comparisons across groups and within families, while qualitative data will help explore complex factors and processes hypothesized in the theoretical framework and related to program implementation. This work will allow the team time to address unanswered questions and issues around how to feasibly operationalize key aspects of the revised theoretical model in preparation for more extensive, longitudinal and experimental investigations as part of the next phase of the project. Understanding and honoring parents' beliefs, knowledge, and experiences is central to this project. In developing and implementing both the programs and research activities, the team will adopt culturally responsive and asset-based perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pathways project is a collaboration between the Institute for Learning Innovation (ILI), a nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement of lifelong, free-choice learning for all communities through research, practice, and policy initiatives; Mt. Hood Community College Head Start program; the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI), a nationally renowned science museum; and the Center for STEM Education at the University of Notre Dame. The project involves families with four-year-old children who attend the Head Start program. The collaboration between educators, community organizations, and researchers and the integrated approach to research and program development will ensure that study findings translate to practical and effective education strategies and that future research efforts are well-grounded in the realities of practitioners and learners.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><em>Head Start on Engineering (HSE): Supporting Engineering Interest Development in Early Childhood </em></strong>was a two-year, National Science Foundation-funded pilot project to develop and test a program for engaging preschool children and their families from low-income backgrounds in the engineering design process. The project also used the program as a context for studying how young children and their families become interested in engineering and how these interests develop over time into long-term patterns of learning and engagement. HSE was led by the Institute for Learning Innovation in partnership with Mt. Hood Community College (MHCC) Head Start, Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, and University of Notre Dame. During the pilot, the team worked with families from the MHCC Head Start system in Portland, Oregon, all of whom live below the federal poverty line and over half of whom speak Spanish at home. These families, as well as Head Start staff members, were an integral part of the development and testing process, providing input and feedback throughout and helping to disseminate project results locally and nationally.</p> <p>&nbsp;The goal of the HSE initiative is to foster skills and learning dispositions that will help both children and families be successful in a world in which science and engineering are increasingly essential. The program focuses on the engineering design process (ask, imagine, plan, create, improve) as an approach to problem-solving that is highly relevant to young children and the everyday lives of families. Although many participants begin the program thinking that engineering is about machines and structures, HSE highlights how engineering is everywhere, both in the things we use and the way we solve problems and accomplish tasks in our everyday lives. Engineering programs are rare for preschool children, and low-income families seldom have access to high-quality engineering learning opportunities. By working in collaboration with Head Start, HSE was designed to broaden access to engineering learning for young children and their families, develop important design thinking skills, and ultimately contribute to the diversification of engineering- and other science-related fields.</p> <p>&nbsp;Through the pilot, the team developed a multi-component program model integrated within the Head Start system. Unlike other preschool engineering and science programs, HSE focuses on the family and home-based learning experiences first and then creates complementary classroom activities. The backbone of the program is a set of bilingual (Spanish and English) take-home engineering kits. Each focuses on a hands-on engineering design challenge and includes: (a) one bilingual storybook carefully selected to create a context for the engineering process; (b) simple materials that families can reuse, replace, and supplement; and (c) a parent facilitation guide. These activities then serve as the anchor for other program events, including professional development workshops for Head Start staff members, a kickoff engineering night for families, an evening parent workshop series at the Head Start community centers during which the take-home activity kits are introduced, and a culminating field trip to the science center&mdash;all of which are delivered in Spanish and English by a bicultural team that includes native Spanish speakers. Research and evaluation findings from the pilot indicated that the synergistic combination of program components helped to spark and maintain engineering-related interests for Head Start families and that the community was eager for the program to continue in the future. Lessons learned from the project have been incorporated into ongoing implementation and have informed engineering education efforts across the partner organizations.</p> <p>&nbsp;Research studies during the pilot also provided new knowledge about how families with preschool children become interested in a topic and extend this interest through ongoing engagement and learning. The project team developed a unique family-level systems perspective on interest, emphasizing how parents and children both change in parallel as the family develops deeper levels of engagement with a topic like engineering. Using this perspective, the team conducted an in-depth qualitative study with nine participating families over the course of six months, documenting: (a) the families&rsquo; experiences throughout the project, (b) evidence of interest development during and after the program, and (c) evidence of changing characteristics of parent-child interactions through analysis of video data from home visits. The study demonstrated strong evidence of engineering-related interests catalyzed by the program activities and highlighted three aspects of family-level interest development that varied across families and over time: (a) parent awareness, knowledge, and values related to engineering; (b) family re-engagement with engineering activities; and (c) family use of the engineering design process. Within each of these categories, there were important shifts observed in a subset of the families that potentially signal movement to deeper, sustained levels of engineering interest, such as families seeing engineering everywhere in their daily lives. Overall, these findings suggest HSE had a strong impact on the local community and provide a foundation to continue to expand the program and research studies in response to ongoing community support.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/27/2018<br>      Modified by: Scott&nbsp;A&nbsp;Pattison</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent"
