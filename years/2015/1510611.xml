<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1510611, Principal Investigator: Dmitri  Burago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project takes its origin at the concept of length of curves and goes on to develop familiar and important ideas for physical or dynamical systems under limited hypotheses.  Among those ideas are notions of stability, instability, and entropy that address the variations of larger geometric properties as a metric is subjected to small perturbations.  The project has a component related to discrete forms of geometric data and the Laplace operator on metric measure spaces. Two graduate students of the principal investigator will be working on experimental measurements of frequencies of vibrating bodies of unusual shapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is known that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a Riemannian manifold are approximated by eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a (suitably weighted) graph Laplace operator of a proximity graph on an epsilon-net.  One of these projects seeks to extend that result to the Laplacian on differential forms and to get better estimates for the Laplacian on metric measure spaces, including stability results.  It would be very interesting to  understand which spaces with bounded geometry can be approximated to an additive error by graphs with uniform bounds on degrees of vertices and lengths of edges. So far, we can do that only for the 2-plane and not even for 3-space, but we do not know a single counterexample to the main conjecture in this area.  One project aims to prove Michel's Conjecture on boundary rigidity under reasonable hypotheses.  Another project will study dynamical systems with positive entropy in which entropy is generated locally, that is, positive entropy is generated in arbitrarily small tubes around one trajectory. Another goal is to prove ellipticity of the Busemann surface area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Here are the main outcomes (many more are omited dues to the lack of space).   1. An Two old-standing and quite famous problems in dynamics are solved: A completely integrable Hamiltonian KAM-non-degenerate  system can be perturbed in such a way that the dynamics outside KAM tory has positiv metric entropy and entropy non-expansive (positive metric entropy is generated in arbitrarily thin tubes around one trajectory).  2. About 20 years ago, the PI reported a solution of a so called Boltzman-Sinai Conjecture: in a system of n balls moving freely and colliding ellastically in empty space, the number of collision is uniformly bounded by a function depending only on n.  The bound obtained then was poly-exponential.   3. A fish with bounded aquatic locomotion speed swims in fast waters. It can, even if the flow is time-dependent, proided that there is no big large-scale drift of the waters. .Moreover, given a prescribed sufficiently large time $t$, it can be there at exactly the time $t$. The major difference from our previous work is the time-dependence of the flow.We also give an application to homogenization of the G-equation.   4.  We show that given any Liouville direction and Finsler tori without conjugate points, one can  make a $C^{\infty}$-small perturbation on an arbitrarily small disc to get a nondense geodesic in the given direction.   5. This array of results is a continuation of our previous works where we approximated the Riemannian Laplace-Beltrami operator by discrete graph Laplacians in the spectral sense. Further on metric-measure spaces we introduced a ``Laplacian-like'' operator which is a generalization of the graph Laplacian and studied the stability of its spectrum with respect to metric-measure approximations. Now we introduced a ``Laplacian-like'' operator acting on vector bundles over metric-measure spaces, and prove that on Riemannian manifolds this operator and its discretization both approximate the classical connection Laplacian in the spectral sense, that is its discretization is a generalization of the graph Laplacian.
