<AbstractNarration>This project will synthesize more than 30 years of research on the evolutionary history and classification of the "higher" flies, including robber flies, bee flies, flower flies, fruit flies, carrion flies, bot flies, and tsetse flies, many of which are economically and ecologically important.  It will integrate exciting new fossil discoveries as well as anatomical and new genomic data. A unique feature of the fossil record for these flies is that many diverse higher flies are preserved with life-like fidelity in fossilized resin (amber) that is from 17 to 130 million years old.  This profoundly enhances the accuracy with which the timing and amount of evolutionary change can be measured. With these data, this project can address whether higher flies are diverse because their speciation is so rapid, or because their extinction rate is low, or both.  It also can address whether higher flies were affected by mass extinctions that occurred  66 million years ago, when most dinosaurs became extinct, and whether the largest group of higher flies, which represents the largest radiation of all life in the past 66 million years, also are the fastest evolving. Besides these broad questions, this study will also address the rate of evolution of fruit flies (Drosophila), based on several hundred specimens in amber.  Since fruit flies are a model system for genetic and genomic research, this will provide a unique context for research in genomics and evolution. The project also will provide research training and experience for high school students and develop a museum exhibit on the evolution of flies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will construct a comprehensive evolutionary framework through the analysis, study, and interpretation of over 30 years of accumulated data on the phylogeny, biogeography, and general evolution of the "higher" flies (Brachyceran Diptera).  It will build upon the principal investigator's experience from hundreds dissections of exemplar living species, thousands of measurements and digital images of living and fossil species, and writing descriptions for over 70 fossil species to first assemble a data matrix of 592 morphological characters from 526 taxa, including both fossil and extant species. This morphological and molecular data will be used to compile a monograph on the morphology, fossil record, and phylogeny of the Brachycera, emphasizing the Mesozoic Era.  This project also will produce a detailed descriptive study on diverse new Drosophilidae preserved in amber (42-17 million years ago) and two papers that address divergence times of lineages in lower Brachycera and in the Ephydroidea, especially Drosophila, analyzed with morphological and genomic data.  Outreach will include mentoring high school student interns in the amber laboratory and developing a traveling or permanent exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History, "Flies."</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Synthesizing 30 years of research on 200 million years of evolutionary history of flies (Insecta: Diptera)                 Notorious as vectors of disease, only about 2% of the 150,000 species of flies transmit pathogens; most others have vital but little known roles, such as in pollination, or in lab research, like Drosophila.  Through funding by OPUS the PI synthesized more than 30 years of his research on the evolutionary history of the "higher" flies (robber flies, bee flies, flower flies, fruit flies, carrion flies, bot flies, tsetse, etc.), integrating their fossil and living diversity. A unique feature of this fossil record involves diverse flies preserved with life-like fidelity in fossilized resin (amber) ranging in age from 130- to 17-million years old.  "Amberization" profoundly enhances interpretation of the fossils and measuring the amount and timing of evolutionary change.              The project has redefined the evolutionary history of the flies, which is now probably the best studied and understood of the "big four" orders of insects (which also include the Coleoptera [beetles], Hymenoptera [ants, bees, and other wasps], and Lepidoptera [moths and butterflies]).  The enormous amount of knowledge on the basic biology, genomics, development, and relationships of flies can now be viewed through a lens 200 million years into the past.              Significant discoveries were made: Higher flies are so diverse both because they form species rapidly and because their natural extinction rate is low.  These flies were affected by the end-Cretaceous extinctions 66 million years ago, but not nearly as much, for example, as the non-avian dinosaurs.  Also, many living, relict species are commonly restricted to cool temperate climates, even though tropical forests are so diverse, apparently because evolutionarily older groups have been pushed to marginal, cooler climates from younger, more competitive, tropical groups.  Perhaps most significant is establishing that the largest group of higher flies (called the Schizophora) is the largest radiation of all life in the past 66 million years.  Often called "the age of Mammals," the Cenozoic is more aptly "the age of Flies."   The Schizophora also includes Drosophila fruit flies and relatives; earliest members of the family evolving approximately 54 million years ago, but Drosophila itself not until about 35 million years ago.  This age contradicts some previous estimates and better establishes the true age of Drosophila, important for studies on rates of molecular and other aspects of evolution.              As part of the public outreach for this grant, the PI spent about 5 months preparing for and serving as an instructor at two 2-week Diptera field courses, called FlySchool (June of 2017 and 2019).  Both were held in California, with 4-5 instructors at each course.  The course is offered to anyone with sufficient interest in Diptera and some background in entomology.  Approximately 48 students overall in both courses came from around the world:  Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, and UK, with the majority from the US.  Students varied from undergraduate and graduates in entomology, collection managers of regional and major insect collections; entomologists working in agriculture, forensics, and ecology; teachers; and even botanists.  The PI provided instruction in field techniques, family-level identification (especially the notorious acalyptrates), relationships, dissection techniques, illustration techniques, and fossils (particularly ones in amber).  Based on evaluations by the students the courses were very successful, and in the opinion of the PI FlySchool will impact a future generation of entomologists.
