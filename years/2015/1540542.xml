<AbstractNarration>Steady advance in remote sensing, satellite imaging, and computing technology has enabled scientists to study geophysical phenomena of unprecedented resolutions and complexity. Earth observation data generated from space-based satellites or ground-based radar and radiometer facilities are typically time-varying, and multivariate, and can take tera- or even peta-bytes of space to preserve and process. The common practice is to choose and transfer subsets of data from multiple data archive servers to local machines and then conduct data analysis tasks. However, this approach becomes increasingly unsustainable with an exponential growth of observation data size. It becomes an increasing severe problem that scientists can gain detailed observation data but lack suitable and scalable analysis capabilities to study the full extent of data. The team will work closely to develop, evaluate,and deploy the computer infrastructure to improve the performance and scalability of geophysical analysis for scientific discovery and education. By making the system available to other researchers, it will facilitate the development of new scalable solutions.Interactive geosciences applications will be used as an effective means to promote students interest in science and engineering studies, and to attract and retain students for geosciences community growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops new techniques in support of scalable geophysical analysis in a data-intensive environment. The innovation and the basis of our technique approach are to develop an optimal data layout algorithm for indexing and placing massive heterogeneous observation data across distributed devices of a cluster. The new data layout is tailored to the spatial-temporal characteristics of Earth observation data, and can directly account for advanced compute techniques, including non-volatile storage resources and GPU- and Manycore-based computing nodes, and support high-throughput and high-resolution exploration of large-scale data. The long-term goal is to study theory and technology that enable scalable data management and analysis for the geosciences community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Earth scientists of all disciplines routinely use data to study various processes and phenomena. The sources of these data are quite diverse, but principally include observations and model simulation outputs. They are typically characterized by spatiotemporal heterogeneity, originating from different instrument (and platform) design specifications and/or computational model requirements, and preserved in data generation and packaging processes. Such inherent heterogeneity poses several onerous challenges for exploring and analyzing geoscience data.  In this project, we have developed a solution of optimal data layout to index, distribute, and place voluminous data from heterogeneous datasets across the distributed devices of a cluster of computers. The innovative data layout strategy is tailored to the spatiotemporal characteristics of Earth Science (in short, geo-spatiotemporal) data analysis, and readily facilitates advanced parallel computing approaches in support of scalable geophysical analysis for geoscience communities. We have made the following main contributions.  We evaluated existing representative loosely coupled approaches (exemplified by Spark and Hadoop) and a tightly coupled approach (exemplified by a parallel array database management system, SciDB) for large-scale geophysical analysis operations. We extended a unified data model embodied in an indexing method, named SpatioTemporal Adaptive-Resolution Encoding (STARE), to universally index diverse, heterogeneous Earth datasets for spatiotemporal data placement co-alignment and co-location of data chunks in a distributed environment. With the generality of STARE to homogenize all geo-spatiotemporal data, data preparation time for interactive analysis of diverse datasets was drastically reduced, achieving unparalleled variety scaling (or data interoperability). We integrated STARE in a prototype distributed platform capable of supporting rapid response visual analytics with a friendly graphical browser user interface. We have incorporated new and effective implementations of representative analysis operations, including connected component labeling for feature extraction and tracking, that require distributed memory parallelization and have achieved scalable performance for large geophysical data on our innovative platform. Not only have we refined the application of STARE in a parallel, distributed array database management system, i.e. SciDB, but also explored the adaptability and practicality of extending STARE to more conventional geo-data analysis tools and practice, such as using Python with HDF/netCDF files.   We believe the exceptional scalability achieved for data volume and, more importantly, for data variety with our innovations has the transformative potential to revolutionize geoscience data-intensive analysis through drastically improved geoscience research productivity.  The outcomes of our project through peer-reviewed have been reported and disseminated through journal and conference papers in premier venues. We have built a prototype platform http://odl.unl.edu incorporating our innovations to demonstrate interactive visual analytics for large-scale heterogeneous Earth Science data, capable of on-demand animation. The project has partially supported graduate students and research fellows in training them on conducting cutting-edge research, writing technical papers, and giving presentations.
