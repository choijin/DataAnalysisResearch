<AbstractNarration>This is a research project in the general area of number theory. This area of mathematics has applications to areas such as cryptography and to physics. The particular branch of number theory considered in this project is arithmetic geometry where properties of interest in number theory are studied by geometric methods. The overall theme of the research is the interplay between arithmetic geometry and the Langlands correspondence for number fields. There have been many recent breakthroughs in the field, such as new techniques for proving reciprocity (modularity lifting theorems as well as the emerging p-adic Langlands program) and the construction of Galois representations associated to torsion classes in the cohomology of locally symmetric spaces. All of these developments have depended crucially on being able to p-adically interpolate automorphic forms. The concept of p-adic automorphic forms has a natural definition in terms of the geometry and cohomology of Shimura varieties and therefore p-adic arithmetic geometry is useful for studying them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI investigates two intertwined areas: on one hand, applications of p-adic arithmetic geometry (specifically the theory of perfectoid spaces) to p-adic automorphic forms and, on the other hand, p-adic and mod p analogues of the classical Langlands program. Specifically, the PI will study a new approach to the p-adic local Langlands correspondence via the Taylor-Wiles method, to further study torsion occurring in the cohomology of Shimura varieties and the properties at p of the associated Galois representations and to develop a new approach to instances of the Tate conjecture in the context of Shimura varieties. Some of the new techniques that the PI intends to use are the Taylor-Wiles patching method applied to completed cohomology and matching parameters in local deformation rings with Hecke operators. Another key idea involves studying perfectoid Shimura varieties via their associated period domains. The research project lies at the intersection of algebraic number theory, representation theory and algebraic geometry, with a focus on the interplay between p-adic arithmetic geometry and the Langlands correspondence for number fields. A central motif in number theory is the classification of algebraic extensions of number fields. Class field theory addresses this for extensions with abelian Galois group. The Langlands program provides a framework for a vast generalization of class field theory to the non-abelian setting. At its heart is the conjectural correspondence between automorphic representations and Galois representations, which is often realized by geometric objects, such as Shimura varieties. Therefore, arithmetic geometry provides many important tools for studying Langlands correspondences.  Many of the most spectacular recent results in number theory are instances of the Langlands correspondence, such as Fermat's last theorem, the Sato-Tate conjecture and Serre's conjecture.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A primary aim of this project has been to make progress on fundamental problems in number theory, especially through the application of the geometry of Shimura varieties to automorphic forms.  The motivating problem has been to understand the arithmetic nature of the special values of L-functions of algebraic varieties and to make progress towards the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer Conjectureand its generalizations. To this end the PI (partly in collaboration with others) has:  (a) defined a class of cycles in the Galois cohomology of the representations associated with Siegel modular eigenforms and proved that they satisfy the norm relations expected of an Euler system through a novel connection with multiplicity one results for Hecke algebras;  (b) constructed a p-adic L-function interpolating the special values of L-functions of Siegel eigenforms by a new method making use of higher coherent cohomology of Siegel modular varieties;  (c) made progress toward an `explicit reciprocity law' connecting the p-adic L-functions in (b) with the cycles in (c), yielding proofs of new cases of the Bloch--Kato Conjecture for Siegel modular forms;  (d) proved one- and two-variable Iwasawa Main Conjectures for a large class of weight two modular forms and finite slope primes p, yielding proofs of the p-part of the conjectured Birch--Swinnerton Dyer formula for the special values of the L-functions of the corresponding abelian varieties;  (e) developed a novel approach to anticyclotomic Euler systems for a large class of Galois representations, reproving and generalizing Kolyvagin's ground-breaking results for modular elliptic curves;  (f) proved the existence of non-trivial solutions to systems of diagonal equations over general p-adic field whenever the number of variables exceeds a simple bound that is quadratic in the number of equations and the degree  (the first bound that is polynomial in either).   Additionally, this project has partially supported the research of PhD students working under the supervision of the PI. This includes:  (g) work by a PhD student on the p-adic variation of special cycles on the product of a Hilbert moduar surface and a modular curve, with applications to the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture for elliptic curves over quintic fields;  (h) work by a PhD student (jointly advised) on a regulator formula for p-adic L-functions of modular forms in terms of CM points that have additive or supersingular reduction at p; this makes crucial use ideas from perfectoid theory.  These results have been written up in papers that have been submitted for publication and have also been presented in invited lectures at various international conferences and workshops.
