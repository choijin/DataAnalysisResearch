<AbstractNarration>This project was submitted in response to NSF 15-006 Dear Colleague Letter on Ebola. Scientific researchers have established that efforts to contain disease are highly variable depending on how different groups of people perceive their vulnerability. Perceptions of risk and stigma can vary considerably between different cultural, linguistic and cultural settings. This project proposes to explore how ideas about stigma and risk evolve in the context of communities impacted by Ebola. The project has the potential to inform public health debates about how to improve human response to mobile health threats, while promoting public safety to reduce the threat of transmission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drs. Smith-Morris, medical anthropologist, and Dr. Faith Nibbs, cultural anthropologist, both Dallas residents with ongoing research in affected Dallas neighborhoods, have a unique vantage point from which to compare neighborhood-level experience of this infectious disease, and the experiences of stigma by residents of different socioeconomic class, ethnic and linguistic mix, and culture.  The project addresses two key questions.  First, how is human behavior changing in response to heavy media coverage of the three Dallas Ebola cases, and the neighborhoods from which those victims emerged?  And second, are there cultural patterns in the way that people change their behaviors, both individually and collectively in neighborhoods, to manage risk and stigma, or to share and respond to educational materials about Ebola? Drawing upon stigma scales that have proven effective in comparable mental and public health contexts, the researchers will adapt the prompts to include questions specific to Ebola. The researchers will then follow up with more in-depth interviews that examine the Ebola and stigma, information tracing, and the impact of the Ebola crisis on resources and actions. Quantitative and qualitative data from surveys, interviews, media analysis, and participant observation within the two communities under study will be catalogued and analyzed with concordance software widely recommended for corpus-based methods. The results are expected to create a better understanding of crisis management patterns in urban, multi-cultural neighborhoods, so that future public health and education strategies may be more efficient and more effective.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this research was to understand the culturally patterned stigma and crisis-induced xenophobia as a result of the current Dallas Ebola crisis. I compared perceptions and impacts of stigma among two key groups: residents of Vickery Meadow, the high immigrant/refugee neighborhood where Mr. Eric Duncan, the first case diagnosed in the U.S. stayed; and residents in the middle-class M Streets/Lakewood Heights neighborhood of the second identified case, a nurse who cared for Mr. Duncan.  A total of 41 neighborhood interviews were ocnducted in addition to media analysis and interviews with informed community members throughout the project.  Survey data (using Wutich et al.Æs (2014) instrument) revealed significant differences in the two neighborhoods for these key variables: neighborhood-based stigma; feelings about oneÆs neighborhood.  Interview data showed neighborhood-level differences in Ebola stigma as well. Indeed,  although neighborhood stigma was not discussed as part of, or as causing Ebola stigma, the patterned response was nevertheless neighborhood-specific. When asked whether they felt stigmatized for living in a neighborhood with a victim of Ebola, two thirds of the MS residents but only three (of 20) VM residents said "no".  These "no" responses contrast starkly with the "yes" responses that came only from VM. But the reasons they named for perceived Ebola stigma were NOT as expected.  Rather than their shared neighborhood with Mr. Duncan, these informants gave a different set of reasons for this stigma: their Liberian nationality; African appearance and/or accent; and black skin. These narratives of stigma cohered around place, notably ones that were far away; not the neighborhoods I predicted would be stigmatized for Ebola. In other words, the narrated pattern was one of felt xenophobia.  The fact that Africa and Liberia were more stigmatized than local neighborhood seems to suggest an imprecision of place in the publicÆs understanding of Ebola risk. These localities were far away and relatively undifferentiated.  Imprecision of place can lead people to generalize a remote risk factor onto others in their vicinity.  The disproportionate blame placed on Africanness, or Dallasites, regardless of actual risk of infection, are examples of "lay epidemiology" (Bailey, et al. 2006) which do not match professional models, or which reflect local re-interpretation of professional frameworks.  In this study, certain place-names gained disproportionate notoriety over local risk realities.  To describe this pattern of place-related stigma, I use the term "placism". Placism not simply a camouflage for social racism, but reflects a manipulation and twisting of epidemiological logics of place.  Through placism, a personÆs perceived association with Africa &ndash; the continent-level source of the epidemic &ndash; was more influential of having a stigma experience than a personÆs neighborhood-level risk or other markers of place.    The multiple levels and meanings of place operating in global/local public health are a major challenge for the social science of public health.  Epidemiological notions of place may be essential to prediction and tracking, but they are insufficient for infectious epidemic response going forward.   In the Dallas Ebola crisis, I documented a form of place-related stigma that seems particularly vulnerable to what Rodman described as the strategic social construction of place (Rodman 1992).  This coalescence of epidemiological and stigmatizing discourses of place surrounding an infectious disease epidemic reflects not just stubborn assumptions of place, but the entrenched and invisible authority of epidemiology.    So while public health initiatives must certainly be neighborhood-specific (Bailey, et al. 2006; Luquero, et al. 2011; Maas, et al. 2007), this level of specificity may not be enough for global infections in super-diverse settings, where people engage with multiple levels of relevant pl...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
