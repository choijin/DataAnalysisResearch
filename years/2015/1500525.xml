<AbstractNarration>The area of study of this project lies within algebraic geometry, the branch of mathematics devoted to geometric shapes called algebraic varieties, defined by polynomial equations. Algebraic geometry has significant applications in coding, industrial control, and computation. But the topics of this project are more closely related to applications in theoretical physics, where physicists consider algebraic varieties as a piece of the fine structure of our universe. This is especially true with the first topic, moduli theory. This theory studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is manifested as an algebraic variety, called a moduli space, in its own right. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a community of "organisms" as itself being an "organism" is not just a metaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. The other topic studied in this project is birational geometry, which is devoted to a certain abstract relationship, called birational equivalence, among algebraic varieties, which lies at the foundation of algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will continue studying problems in moduli theory; the main foci of the project are Moduli spaces of stable logarithmic maps and Artin fans. Additional topics include the degeneration formula for KKO invariants, the birational geometry of torus quotients, and logarithmic Kodaira dimensions of fibered powers in relation to uniformity of stably integral points.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Moduli theory is the study of the broad phenomenon, where the set of all geometric objects "of the same kind" is often parametrized by an algebraic variety. Birational Geometry is the topic of Algebraic Geometry in which one studies the fine points of the equivalence relation between algebraic varieties given by isomorphism of their function fields.  The PI and his students and collaborators contributed to these areas:  Progress was made towards a degeneration formula for lograithmic Gromov--Witten invariants. This includes a paper on the decomposition formula and work on punctured logarithmic maps and their gluing formalism.  Applications of moduli spaces to the arithmetic of torsion points on abelian varieties were established. It was shown that conjectures of Lang and Vojta imply boundedness of level structures on abelian varieties over number fields.  A collection of moduli spaces of elliptic surfaces were constructed and the transitions between them studied. This provides an example of complete wall-crossings analysis on moduli spaces appearing in birational geometry.  Factorization of birational maps between Deligne--Mumford stacks was proven. As a corollary it was shown that the strong homotopy type of the boundary complex of a smooth stack with a normal-crossings divisor does not depent on teh compactification of the open locus.  Three PhD theses were completed, largly based on this project and funded by this award.       Last Modified: 10/28/2018       Submitted by: Dan Abramovich]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
