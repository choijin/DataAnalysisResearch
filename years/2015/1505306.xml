<AbstractNarration>This project supports a small modeling workshop to be held at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (NOAA/GFDL) in Princeton, NJ to bring together a group of scientists to focus on using the data collected in 2013 during the Southeast Atmosphere Studies (SAS), a field campaign supported in part by the Atmospheric Chemistry Program at National Science Foundation, to investigate biosphere-atmosphere interactions and the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere.  The purpose of the workshop is to evaluate, diagnose and improve climate and air quality modeling of different temporal and spatial scales for improving representation of fundamental atmospheric processes. The effort will focus primarily on models that simulate the formation of SOA and other trace species in the troposphere over the Southeast US, with the ultimate goal of understanding the radiative impacts of these species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected results of the workshop are to: (1) reconcile the discrepancies on biogenic volatile organic compound emission inventories among global and regional models; (2) make recommendations for a condensed isoprene gas-phase chemistry for use in 3-D chemical models; (3) identify the extent to which major SOA precursors and production pathways can be constrained using data from SAS; (4) summarize the possible impact of atmospheric chemistry on regional climate over Southeast US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is enabling the community of US scientists to work together to utilize the massive amounts of data collected during the SAS campaign to answer some key questions of societal interest.  For example, an important question is: what are the roles of anthropogenic and biogenic emissions in contributing to high ozone and particulate matter concentrations over the Southeast US? And what is the best strategy for modeling SOA over this region?  These questions are important for gaining a better understanding of air quality and climate in the Southeast US.</AbstractNarration>

Reliable projections of the future atmosphere require models to not only accurately describe current atmospheric concentrations; but do so for the right reasons.

Efforts to properly identify and implement the fundamental and controlling mechanisms in atmospheric models benefit from intensive observation periods (IOPs), during which co-located measurements of diverse, speciated chemicals in both the gas and condensed phases are obtained. The summer of 2013, in particular the Southeast Atmosphere Studies, provides an unprecedented opportunity for the atmospheric modeling community to come together to evaluate, diagnose, and improve the representation of fundamental climate and air quality processes in models of varying temporal and spatial scales.. On June 8-10, 2015, more than sixty scientists from across the country attended a workshop at NOAA GFDL to share their understanding of the interactions between human activities, terrestrial vegetation, air quality, and climate over the Southeast US.

This effort is expected to improve understanding of the regional cooling over the Southeast US, which has been tentatively attributed to secondary organic aerosols formed by the interactions of biogenic emissions and anthropogenic pollutants. Recommendations were developed in each of the four workshop themes for atmospheric chemistry modeling over this region: Gas-phase chemistry (1) Up-to-date "standard" chemical mechanisms represent OH chemistry well over the observed range of NOx concentrations. Detailed mechanisms based on recent laboratory chamber studies (mostly at Caltech) and theoretical studies (Leuven) for isoprene chemistry result in predicted OH that is in reasonable agreement with observations. Condensed mechanisms that approximate the detailed ones are expected to do the same. (2) Given the large emissions and high chemical reactivity of isoprene, its chemistry should be treated fairly explicitly, including more detail than for most other hydrocarbons. (3) NO3 chemistry contributes significantly to both VOC oxidation and aerosol production. (4) The regions of peak NOx and BVOC emissions are not collocated. As a result, the model resolution can impact the predictions. Aerosol chemistry (1) There is high confidence that a pathway of SOA formation from isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX) should be included in models. However, since many of the parameters needed to predict IEPOX-SOA are uncertain, different modeling approaches could be beneficial. (2) There is high confidence that models should include SOA formation from nitrate radical oxidation of monoterpenes (with or without explicit nitrate functionality). Sesquiterpenes and isoprene may also contribute SOA through nitrate radical oxidation, but the contribution is expected to be smaller. (3) Models can help determine how important glyoxal (produced from isoprene, as well as from anthropogenic VOCs) is as a SOA precursor. Natural and anthropogenic emissions (1) Biogenic emissions from BEIS are generally lower and those from MEGAN, generally higher than from measurements for all campaigns. (2) Observations confirm a rapid decrease of ozone precursor emissions over past few decades. Thus, use of the correct scaling of anthropogenic emissions for a particular yea...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
