<AbstractNarration>Epigenetics (the study of physiological variation not caused by DNA) is an expanding area of great importance to the survival and health of living organisms. This research will investigate the evolutionary origin of epigenetics using an archaeal microbe as the studied organism. The results of this project could establish new ways to understand fundamental aspects of epigenetics. The project will also provide training for college students through new classroom-based efforts including hands-on laboratory modules for general microbiology courses. The modules will be adapted for use in high schools and with underrepresented minority students in the U. S. Department of Education Upward Bound program. Graduate and undergraduate students will be cross-trained in multiple disciplines, including systems biology, genetics, biochemistry, and microbiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A heritable phenotype results from transmission of a DNA allele or chromatin modification state that controls gene expression. The archaeon Sulfolobus solfatarics has chromatin proteins that are methylated and acetylated. Sophisticated chromatin-based mechanisms in eukaryotes are known to regulate gene expression, but the extent to which similar processes might be used in the archaeal kingdom is unknown. This project will test the hypothesis that archaeal chromatin protein modification and gene expression are coupled in a coordinated fashion. The anticipated results will provide a new context in which to place transcriptional regulation in the archaea and expand insight into the evolution of chromatin.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically we were tasked with sequencing DNA that had been isolated and processed from enhanced and non-enhanced strains of H. sulfataricus in ways that could reveal whether proteins involved in packaging the DNA behaved differently in various strains.  We wanted to determine if there was evidence that DNA packing proteins Cren7 and Sso7D bound to different parts of the cell?s DNA in the evolved strains than the non-evolved strains.  The main results of these specific initial experiments was to reveal no apparent differences in DNA binding patterns of Cren7 and Sso7D between normal and evolved strains.  Our simple hypothesis seemed to be disproved. If the explanation for evolved acid tolerance, involved these two proteins, a complete understanding required something other than differential binding patterns. These results led the group to pursue alternative experiments.     Work by our collaborators showed that our two main suspects, DNA-binding proteins Cren7 and Sso7D, had fewer chemical modifications called methylation - methylation modifies functions of both proteins and DNA - in the evolved strains.  In addition, experiments probing the binding of other proteins to Cren7 and Sso7D were conducted and revealed different patterns of protein-protein interactions in evolved versus non-evolved strains. These new data implicated proteins involved in the process of methylation and stress response.  Subsequent experiments to probe the reasons underlying these changes in methylation patters were conducted  and pointed to a strong link between oxidative stress (sensed by one of the proteins found to associated with Cren7) and proteins and molecules associated with the process of methylation. Based on these results, a new hypothesis was proposed in which the change in methylation status of Cren7 and Sso7D between normal and enhanced tolerance strains  is mediated through impacts of oxidative stress on the function of methylation-related proteins.  The changes in methylation to Cren7 and Sso7D subsequently change DNA packaging without changing where these proteins bind.  This change in methylation of Cren7 and Sso7D leads to changes in gene expression that enhance acid tolerance.     This work and new hypothesis has been submitted for peer-review with the following authors and titles: Sophie Payne, Marc Facciotti, Kevin Van Cott, Andrew Yao, Mark Wilson, Stephan Sutter, Kiara L.

In addition to the work described above, this project also funded a study into the  genetic decision making mechanisms used by another archaea, Halogeometricum borinquense.  Here we probed this organisms apparent ability to choose between and use different sugar sources.  This grant funded travel and partial thesis work for a MS student from Puerto Rico to UC Davis.  This student completed her thesis and has since enrolled in a PhD program at NC State.  The grant also helped to partially fund some thesis work by a second PhD student at UC Davis and 5 undergraduates who participated in a program to learn more about ways genes are regulated.  Together, these experiments provide one of the first detailed views of how genes are differentially regulated in archaea when they are grown on different sugar sources.
