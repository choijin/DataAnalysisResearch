<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to introduce and establish the foundations of a new class of electronic products - ultra-thin electronic devices embedded in thin, flexible, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly substrates such as common paper. The ultra-thin embedded electronics offer superior cost, flexibility, reliability, and security characteristics relative to conventional flexible electronics. The most significant applicable market for such products in the near term is that for Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)-based devices. In 2014, shipments of passive RFID tags will approach 7 billion having a value of about $3.5 billion and an annual growth rate of about 25%. However, the application of the ultra-thin embedded electronics technology extends well beyond RFID.  It encompasses both defense and commercial applications within the general category of flexible hybrid electronics. Examples of defense applications include wearable health monitors, disposable sensors, embedded sensors with communication capability for monitoring equipment and structural health, etc. Examples of commercial applications are counterfeit-proof 'smart' security, legal, and financial documents, wearable and disposable electronics, interactive media, and intelligent product packaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to study the feasibility of embedding ultra-thin electronic devices in thin flexible materials such as paper. Paper has been considered extensively as a substrate material for printed electronics. However, embedding ultra-thin, silicon-based flexible electronic devices inside paper during the paper making process has not been researched. Similarly, an extensive body of knowledge exists on the topic of device reliability. However, current research is almost entirely focused on the interconnection system between the chip and circuit board and on the situations where the entire device is subjected to cyclic thermal and/or mechanical stresses. Embedding hybrid electronic devices in thin flexible materials requires the semiconductor chips to be extremely thin, less than 50 microns and preferably about 20-25 microns thick.  This is significantly thinner than the conventional chips. Still, no research has exclusively considered the survivability of such chips and the entire embedded electronic device under the stress and strain conditions typical for the paper making process. The results from this study will pave the path to developing ultra-thin electronic devices embedded in other thin flexible materials such as polymers, composites, and synthetic paper.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF project[1] was conducted by Uniqarta, Inc.&mdash;a developer of novel IC assembly solutions for flexible hybrid electronics. Flexible electronics has been the subject of much attention in industry journals, trade shows, technical conferences and market research reports [2]. These all predict a new age of ubiquitous electronic devices embedded in the structures and items around us, in our clothing, and even on our bodies. The market research firm IDTechEx predicts a bright future for such devices stating, "The benefits of these new electronics are numerous&mdash;ranging from lower cost, improved performance, flexibility, transparency, reliability, better environmental credentials and much more."[3] U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter noted, "This is an emerging technology that takes advanced flexible materials for circuits, communications, sensors and power and combines them with thinned silicon chips to ultimately produce the next generation of electronic products."[4]  Flexible hybrid electronics is a specific manifestation in which thinned semiconductor dies are integrated with flexible substrates having printed conductors, passive components, and sensors. This approach leverages the fifty-plus years of semiconductor technology development to a new generation of electronic devices. However, there are currently no commercially available technologies suitable for the assembly of ultra-thin ICs.  UniqartaÆs FlexChip technology is a complete solution addressing all the steps necessary to take a standard wafer from a semiconductor fab and finish with ultra-thin, flexible ICs assembled onto flexible circuit substrates. This project aimed to further the FlexChip technology in the following respects:  Optimize the wafer thinning and dicing processes to maximize die reliability and bendability. Assembly and demonstrate functional flexible hybrid electronic device using FlexChip. Evaluate the reliability of the FlexChip-assembled devices when subjected to cyclic and static bending test. Assess the feasibility of transferring semiconductor dies using a novel single-pulse, multi-beam laser transfer process.   The major findings of this project were as follows:  Specific methods of improving wafer thinning and dicing processes were identified. These significantly increased die strength relative to bending. When prepared using optimized processes, thinned die exhibited a minimum bend radius as low as 1.7 mm and significantly higher reliability than has been reported elsewhere by others. Functional, ultra-thin RFID inlays were fabricated as demonstrators using the FlexChip process with 100% of them passing a 200 cycle cyclic bending test and a 5mm bend radius static bending/tension test. The feasibility of a single-pulse, multi-beam laser process for contactless transferring of semiconductor dies was demonstrated.   These accomplishments support the advancement of flexible hybrid electronics by addressing some key aspects of ultra-thin IC assembly. The successful completion of this project sets the stage for a full manufacturing process development program which is the objective of UniqartaÆs NSF SBIR Phase II project.       [1]  UniqartaÆs work plan was revised during the project to focus solely on ultra-thin IC assembly processes.
