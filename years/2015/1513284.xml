<AbstractNarration>This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by developing a suite of digital tools designed to support positive messaging around skill-based education and careers and to improve mentors' communication with middle school-aged youth mentees. Maintaining U.S. economic advantage requires attracting talent to high-growth, high-demand skill-based, STEM-related careers that are traditionally attained through Career and Technical Education (CTE). Replacing old negative perceptions with new, more accurate messages about CTE and then reaching youth with these messages before high school is essential.  Career-focused mentoring is a vehicle for delivering these messages and supporting youth exploration of CTE as a possible path for their own lives. Investigators will explore the hypothesis that through strong connections between those best positioned to articulate industry needs (mentors) and those most receptive to filling that need (mentees), this project will improve youth awareness and interest in CTE and the rewarding careers that are available to them. Research and development activities will be carried out collaboratively in informal learning environments in Boston and New York City that serve middle school-aged youth from underrepresented communities, through career-focused mentoring programs. The project team, led by media producers of the WGBH Education Foundation, includes market researchers and communications strategists at Global Strategy Group, learning scientists at Education Development Center, and mentorship program partners at SkillsUSA, Learning for Life's Middle School Explorer Clubs, and Boy Scouts of America's Scoutreach. If promising, the career-focused mentoring programs of SkillsUSA, Learning for Life, and Boy Scouts of America will incorporate the messaging roadmap and digital tools to support their mentoring curricula, which impact greater than one million youth in each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first phase of research, investigators will study perceptions of STEM-focused CTE from a nationwide sample of 800 middle school-aged youth and 30 mentors from skill-based STEM industries. In the second phase, investigators will work with six program leaders and 30 mentors from SkillsUSA, Explorer Clubs, Scoutreach, and other mentoring programs to document the needs of mentors for support as they enter into the mentoring process. The third phase will engage mentorship program leaders and 36 mentors in the iterative development of a suite of digital tools that would support positive messaging around skill-based education and careers and that would improve mentors' communication with youth mentees. In addition, a pre-post mentorship program pilot study will explore the promise of the digital tools for effectively supporting mentor-mentee communications that improve youth awareness and interest in STEM-focused CTE and skill-based, STEM-related careers. Thirty six mentors and 288 of their youth mentees will participate in the pilot study. Data sources for research include interviews and surveys of program leaders, mentors, and mentees, as well as tracking mentor activity within the online digital tool environment. This research would advance knowledge of how mentors influence disadvantaged youth perceptions of and interest in CTE and skill-based, STEM career pathways, in which there is currently little evidence as to how mentor preparation shapes ability to positively impact youth outcomes. Major outcomes will include a) deeper understandings of youth and mentor perceptions of CTE and mentors' needs for supporting their work with mentees, b) a messaging roadmap and digital tools that prepare mentors for their work with middle school youth, and c) empirical findings regarding the potential of the digital tools for effectively supporting mentor-mentee communications that improve youth's awareness and interest in CTE and skill-based, STEM-related careers. Outcomes will be shared widely to research, education, and industry communities, locally and nationally, through social media, partner networks, conference presentations, and research publications. An advisory board will provide independent review on the project activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of Middle Grades Career Mentors: Digital Resources for Effective CTE STEM Mentoring (MGCM) were to build an understanding about the perception of career and technical education (CTE) as an option for middle school students in pursuing skill- based STEM-related careers, and to use that information to develop an innovative suite of digital tools designed to improve mentors' and school counselors' communication with middle school-aged students.  The project had four phases of work. Phase 1: Global Strategy Group conducted qualitative research with CTE STEM professionals and surveyed middle grades students to learn about perceptions of STEM and CTE. Phase 2: EDC's researchers conducted interviews with a sample of volunteer mentors from industry about the supports they needed to mentor middle-grades students. Phase 3: WGBH's development team utilized the findings from Phases 1 and 2 to create digital tools intended to improve communication with middle grades students about careers and pathways that relate to CTE fields with a STEM focus. EDC's research team then used those tools to conduct formative research at three points during the development process, testing the tools with a small sample of mentors and a larger sample of school counselors. Phase 4: EDC researchers conducted a pilot study with school counselors to assess the impact of the digital tools.  Major outcomes were:  Research about perceptions of CTE to inform a messaging strategy, which was used to guide the creation of digital tools. Findings included:  CTE day-to-day activities are highly interesting to middle-school students, but CTE careers have an image problem.  Gender is a stronger factor than ethnicity in determining interest in tested careers.  The strongest reasons to pursue CTE are:     Working at a job you love Gaining college credit, saving you money and allowing you to graduate faster Preparing you for careers in fields that lead to high-paying jobs     A suite of digital tools for school counselors, career professional mentors, and middle grades students:   Career Stories was designed to help students see how personal interests, family life, and influences can lead to choosing a field of study within CTE STEM, and how that knowledge can be applied to numerous jobs in the real world. Professionals were encouraged to upload photos, videos, anecdotes, and other details to a template to create a "history" of their career path, describing what led them to a STEM-related career.   CTE Exploration combined animated and live action video and gifs within themed content galleries, all aimed at providing students with accurate and interesting information about CTE and STEM, with special attention paid to content that served to counteract common misconceptions.   Communication Coach offered professionals effective ways to communicate about CTE STEM, avoiding pitfalls that commonly occur between adults and middle grades students and provide those with less experience working with middle school students ways to hone their interpersonal skills. A video simulation between a school counselor and two separate students allowed the user to choose conversation topics and watch a range of scenarios play out on screen.   Digital Resource Study Guide assisted educators in framing the conversation around CTE STEM and introducing the digital tools through a classroom lesson plan and strategies for engaging middle school students in conversations.   A pilot study, conducted with 10 school counselors and their 400 students, that assessed the impact of the digital tools in improving middle school student's knowledge and interest in the STEM CTE careers. School counselors reported:  students were engaged with these tools and that they sparked discussions with students about career options positive impacts on students' knowledge of and interest in CTE STEM careers and pathways and improvements in their own knowledge about CTE STEM topics   New knowledge about the messages and images that can shift opinions about the value, relevance, and status of STEM CTE education pathways and CTE careers  This messaging can be useful to mentoring programs, school teachers and administrators, career and guidance counselors, parents, industry leaders, and other "influencers" of career pathways.  Meet middle school students where they are, matching activities they are most interested in with the opportunities that CTE can provide.  Promote the concrete benefits of CTE in STEM-related fields.  Address the misconceptions about the types of students who pursue CTE and the long-term prospects of students in related careers to combat CTE's image problem.  Broaden CTE's appeal with content that includes diverse groups and tasks.  Show, do not just tell, students what they can do through CTE and STEM fields.  Cultivate young people's self-efficacy and awareness that CTE STEM career paths are possible for them by changing how they are framed and communicated. Provide flexible resources that students can use to work at their own pace, individually or in small groups, in school or at home.
