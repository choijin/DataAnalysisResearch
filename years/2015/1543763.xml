<AbstractNarration>Digital language archives worldwide now host thousands of hours of audio and video digital recordings and linguistically analyzed data samples. The processing and storing of this material has happened so quickly that adequate attention has not been paid to whether deposited materials can be appropriately searched, analyzed, understood, and interpreted by various research and speaker communities. &lt;br/&gt;Design anthropologist Christina Wasson from the University of North Texas and linguist and language archivist Gary Holton from the University of Alaska will investigate how digital language deposits at major language archives are structured.  Bringing together language archivists, field linguists, and endangered language community members in a workshop setting, Wasson and Holton will use principles of User Center Design to evaluate the usability of archives from several perspectives including access, navigation, and database structure. The interdisciplinary dialogue at this workshop could initiate a paradigm shift for language archive designers and managers and ultimately have positive repercussions for computationally-based research methods in linguistics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project initiated a dialogue between two scientific communities which had not previously been in contact: language archiving and user-centered design (UCD). Language archiving seeks to preserve the world's endangered languages for current and future generations of scholars and language learners. The rush to document these languages before they disappear has resulted in archiving protocols and digital interfaces that neglect to consider how users will actually interact with these archives. As language archiving matures as a field, archives must expand their priorities to include user communities? needs.  User-centered design (UCD) provides a methodology for understanding user communities. Through interviews with archive users and observation of archive use, UCD can inform the development of archival technologies. UCD is already well established in the business world, where such research is routinely conducted to inform the development of new technologies and ensure that their design meets the needs of users. This NSF project represents the first step toward applying UCD principles to the design of language archives.   In February 2016 this project convened a meeting of stakeholders including language archivists, documentary linguists, indigenous language speakers, and UCD experts. The workshop developed a typology of language archives and identified key next steps, including (1) piloting UCD principles with particular language archives and (2) developing guidelines for the application of UCD principles.  During the workshop, one of the participants noted the difficulty members of indigenous groups who don?t have extensive academic training face when they look for information in a language archive: "Academics are building these archives&hellip; and so you build it for people like yourself. So the door is an academic door, right? So other academics walk along and say, ?oh! I know how to open this door. And it?s for me! And everything in there is for me!? And for other people who are not academics, they look at these archives and they?re like looking at tools from some foreign thing&hellip; the door isn?t made for them."  Interestingly, the linguists at the workshop said they didn?t feel like the door was made for them either. It became clear that none of the workshop participants felt that language archives were designed in a way that met their needs.  It was hard for users to find out whether the information they wanted was even included in the archive; hard to locate particular items; and hard to interpret the often arcane formats in which data were presented. The application of UCD principles to language archiving could address these problems, transforming the way language archiving is done. Moreover, by paying attention to the needs of linguist depositors, UCD could improve the deposit process and thereby increase the amount of data available.  Although this project focuses on language archives, the underlying methodology is broadly applicable. It addresses a challenge of major importance: how to develop online computing and data storage systems used for the scientific investigation of "big data." Often, these computing systems are intended to be accessible to diverse user groups, such as members of multiple scientific disciplines, citizen groups, and government agencies. Best practices have not yet been developed to ensure that these computing systems are designed to meet the needs of multiple user groups.  Our project contributes to this effort.
