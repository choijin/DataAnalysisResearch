<AbstractNarration>Metallic biomaterials are typically the choice for wear resistant parts in most biomedical devices towards load-bearing implants. However, concerns are growing related to metal ions in the body that can cause metallosis, and severe tissue and bone damage in some patients. Metallic devices offer greater motion, higher stability and higher than 99 percent reduction in wear debris compared to polymer components; however, use of these metallic implants dropped significantly in recent years primarily due to metal ion release concerns. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports fundamental research to gain understanding on metal-ceramic composites that can reduce the release of metal ions in human bodies due to in situ formation of self-lubricating films at the contact surface. Results from this research can offer future direction to solve long-standing metal ion release problems in load-bearing implants such as total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty, which can increase life of implants' for patients of all ages.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In load-bearing implants, when two metal surfaces come in contact, there is wear induced damage that releases metal ions inside human bodies. The goal of this project is to minimize release of metal ions from metallic implants inside human bodies using self-lubricating ceramic based tribofilms. These films are formed in situ at the contact surfaces of metal-ceramic composites, and are similar to cartilage between the two hard articulating surfaces in load-bearing implants. The project will generate fundamental knowledge related to processing of metal-ceramic composites capable of forming self-lubricating films during articulation via laser based additive manufacturing. The research objective is to understand the influence of different amounts of calcium phosphates addition to titanium on mechanical and biological properties of titanium-calcium phosphate composites. To achieve this objective, first, titanium-calcium phosphate metal-ceramic composites will be processed using laser engineered net shaping with varying amounts of calcium phosphates, from 1 to 10 weight percent of titanium. Second, mechanical properties (such as tensile and compression strengths, and elastic moduli) of titanium-calcium phosphate composites will be measured under uniaxial loading using servo-hydraulic testing set-up. Third, wear resistance of these composites will be evaluated using flat-on-flat fully automated wear testing set-up. Finally, in vitro biological properties of these composites will be evaluated using human osteoblast cells at day 3, day 7 and day 11 in culture media.</AbstractNarration>

All samples were tested with a normal load of 7N in fully immersed condition using deionized water at room temperature. All tests were run for 1000 meter distance, at a linear reciprocating speed of 1200mm/min for the entire duration of the test, forming wear tracks of length 10mm. The load and distance were used after confirming that steady-state wear regime can be established under these experimental conditions. Hardened chrome-steel balls of diameter 3mm were used to ensure electrical conductance through the samples during wear testing to measure <em>in situ</em> changes in contact resistance at the articulating surface. <em>If there is formation of any tribofilm, due to the nonconducting nature of the film, the contact resistance should increase</em>. <strong>Fig. 1c and d</strong> show scanning electron microscopy images of wear track of Ti6Al4V with and without HA.

Milestones: Following are the project specific milestones.  1.    Optimized processing parameters for uniformly distributed CaP reinforced Ti6Al4V.  Uniformly distributed CaP in Ti64 matrix composites were manufactured.   2.    Tribofilm characterization under different test condition and compositions.  It has been shown that tribofilm formation occurs during articulation via in situ contact resistance measurements.   3.    Interfacial damage evaluation under different loading conditions.  We have measured interfacial damage in coated samples.   4.    In vitro cytotoxicity assessment.  We have shown that these samples are non-toxic.    5.    Measurement of metal ion release for optimum composite coatings.  Metal ion release was measured and shown that it decreased due to tribofilm formation.
