<AbstractNarration>The Public Perception Index, published annually since 2009, states that the U.S. public greatly supports the manufacturing industry and would choose to have a manufacturing plant open in their region over other types of employers and yet is unwilling to encourage their children to pursue careers in manufacturing.  Because many jobs in the 10 county service area of the college are going unfilled due to lack of knowledge of the high-skill, high-demand careers available and the preconceived negative views of advanced manufacturing (AM) employment and careers, Southcentral Kentucky Community and Technical College (SKYCTC). and regional AM employers are collaborating to increase the number of students, including women and underrepresented populations, who are knowledgeable of and pursue education and careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM),  particularly AM.  Additional partners include Barren River Area Development District (BRADD) officials, Workforce Investment Board members, and Chambers of Commerce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to substantively change the public perception of the career opportunities available in STEM and the manufacturing sector throughout south central Kentucky, and ultimately, by replication, to other regions facing STEM deficits in the workforce pipeline. By targeting high school students and their career influencers (parents, teachers, and counselors) and exposing them to the true nature of advanced manufacturing, the college and its partners in industry and education are producing and sustaining a new pipeline of students who pursue STEM/AM disciplines by encouraging them to engage in rewarding careers in advanced manufacturing in south central Kentucky, and thus addressing the workforce needs in this high-wage, high-demand career sector. An extensive evaluation is being conducted to determine the effect of the project on increased participation in STEM/AM secondary pathways and postsecondary programs at the college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to offer a series of summer STEM camps, in-class workshops in STEM/AM during the school year, and complementary materials and activities suitable for dissemination and replication. All endeavors are designed to change the negative perceptions of career influencers such as parents, teachers and counselors and to increase the number of students pursuing STEM and AM careers. This project is based on the findings of the Mass-TEC (Massachusetts Technician Education Collaborative) project and is adapting activities of that project. Mass-TEC was a collaboration of Quinsigamond Community College and industry partners that was created to educate teachers, guidance counselors, career advisors, and families on career pathways leading to advanced manufacturing opportunities in Central Massachusetts. Integrating the proven resources of the Mass-TEC project, as well as creating regionally-based information that targets students and their primary career-influencers, this project is increasing the local STEM workforce pipeline and strengthening the economic vitality of south central Kentucky. The 10-county service area of the college is largely rural and the primary career opportunities have traditionally been in agriculture and manufacturing. Because manufacturing was historically a line job, the public continues to perceive manufacturing as consisting of mindless, repetitive work in environments that are dark, dirty, and dangerous. This public misperception is perpetuated by career influencers who discourage students from STEM and advanced manufacturing career options.</AbstractNarration>

By increasing their understandings of exciting opportunities in STEM/AM, and helping diminish possible negative perceptions of careers in manufacturing, we hoped to increase the number of students entering the STEM/AM educational pipeline and finding rewarding high paying careers in local STEM/AM business and industry.&nbsp;

During the second and third years of SKY CAM, participants included teachers and counselors who attended in prior years, teachers and counselors new to SKY CAM, and high school students.&nbsp; Teachers/counselors who attended in previous years assisted with student recruitment by identifying students who either did not have definite plans for post high school or those who might be interested in the program but were unfamiliar with the opportunities.</p> <p>SKY CAM introduced a total of 62 teachers/counselors and 37 students to local careers in advanced manufacturing.&nbsp; Participants completed online surveys before and after the camp activities to evaluate changes in knowledge and perception of AM opportunities.&nbsp; The results of the surveys conducted by our external evaluator show very positive results.&nbsp; Both student and teacher/counselor participants possessed a greater understanding of specific AM job-related tasks and technical vocabulary after the camp.&nbsp; One teacher commented that the experience will help her &ldquo;be a better advisor for careers in manufacturing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another teacher said she could now &ldquo;make more subject matter connections.&rdquo;&nbsp; Teacher responses regarding the desirability of AM careers increased from 65% pre-camp to 83% post-camp.&nbsp; Student responses imply a new awareness and potential attractiveness of AM careers.&nbsp; More students believed they could make a good living working in advanced manufacturing after the camp experience.&nbsp; Over half of the SKY CAM student participants plan to attend a technical school or community college after high school, an increase from pre-camp responses.&nbsp; One student is currently enrolled in the SKY FAME program at SKYCTC.&nbsp; Prior to attending SKY CAM, he didn&rsquo;t have any real plans for post-secondary education but was very enthusiastic to learn about manufacturing careers.&nbsp; Students and teachers/counselors recognized the need for basic reading, writing, communication, and problem solving skills in addition to math and science for AM careers after camp participation.&nbsp;
