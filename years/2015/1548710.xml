<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in enabling a new method of prototyping textiles, particularly clothing. By allowing the automated manufacturing of clothing through an electrospinning desktop device, this technology can empower more people to design and create clothing in the same way consumer 3D printers have done for other objects. As the related material science evolves over the coming years, this technology has the potential to actually allow consumers to print wearable clothes from their home or business. As the technology matures, such robust, industry-specific devices will have impacts well beyond clothing, including medicine and filtration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the development a desktop device to make clothing that uses electrospinning as an advanced textile prototyping method. The electrospinning process is capable of conforming fibers onto unique 3D shapes. The proposed Phase I project will make considerable improvements to the electrospinning process so that textile prototyping will be faster, more reliable, and less wasteful. It will also support material science work to increase the strength and durability of electrospun materials such that they can be satisfactorily used as prototyping textile materials.</AbstractNarration>

Introduction</strong></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Electroloom secured a Phase I NSF SBIR award for its work in modifying the electrospinning process to serve as a 3D printing method. The primary goal of the company is to develop a desktop device that can automatically create 3D fabrics and wearable garments. The Phase I project&rsquo;s aims were to increase throughput, make the machine mechanically easier to use, reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) in the control electronics, and to improve various properties of the fabric. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>II. Mechanical Progress</strong></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The company designed a new solution dispensing method that was able to more readily create electrospun fiber jets, thus yielding more fabric per period of time. Previously, the company was using single-needle dispensing systems, which produced 1-2 jets per orifice. A new system was designed and tested. Trials were run at higher pump speeds and the results were recorded.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Fabrics produced in each trial were compared with a control sample (labeled &ldquo;Baseline&rdquo;): a patch of fabric produced from a pre-grant, single-needle prototype. Each trial was run for 20 min. The results from Chart 1 illustrate a marked increase in the final weight of each fabric sample over a 20 min period when using the new dispensing method.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>As seen in Table 1, the new dispensing method increased the throughput by up to 11 times when compared to the baseline control sample. This represents a throughput of 0.1215 g/min, compared with the control sample&rsquo;s 0.037 g/min.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>III. Electrical Progress</strong></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>EMI has been a constant problem for development, as the team lacks expertise in this highly specialized area. Because high voltage is required for electrospinning, voltage would occasionally build up in unwanted components of the machine. Eventually, this buildup would discharge, creating an electrostatic discharge (ESD) event. The ESD events caused a significant amount of EMI which affected the low-voltage electronics in numerous ways, including creating false signals, disturbing the power lines, or destroying components. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>One of the techniques mentioned in the grant proposal was creating a printed circuit board (PCB), seen in Image 1. This offered the primary advantage of shortening electrical traces between components, thereby reducing the susceptibility of the low-voltage electronics system to EMI. Multiple iterations of a PCB were designed and tested both after the proposal and during the grant period. The susceptibility to EMI dropped significantly compared to the previous wired, breadboard version of our electronics systems. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Within the grant period, the machines and systems have been run over 30 times for various tests and producing various fabrics. There have been no issues due to electromagnetic interference during these runs using the circuit board version of the electrical systems. Thus, moving to a PCB has been a great success in this area, and the team ultimately performed 5 iterations on the PCB layout throughout the grant period.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>IV. Materials Progress</strong></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The main material goals for the grant period were improving the mechanical properties of the fabric, especially the strength and elasticity. UV-initiated photocrosslinking proved most effective. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Photocrosslinking of fibers including a polyacrylate resulted in improved elastic properties. The polyacrylate and photoinitiator system were optimized using a Taguchi orthogonal array including five different polyacrylates, seven photoinitiators, and three polyacrylate concentrations.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The fabric elasticity was evaluated by cyclically stretching samples to 100% strain and measuring the permanent deformation upon removal of the stress. Uncrosslinked fabrics retained 76% of the strain after five cycles of stretching. Use of polycondensation to crosslink the fibers reduced the permanent deformation to 42%. Fully optimized photoinitiated crosslinking improved the elastic recovery such that the permanent deformation was only 26%. Representative stress/strain curves for the uncrosslinked, polycondensation, and photoinitiated fabrics are shown in Chart 2.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>In addition to functionality, the aesthetic of the fabric was addressed. Electrospun materials in general end up white, due to light scattering off of the large surface area of the fibers. A variety of alternative dyes were tested, including a number of synthetic fabric dyes, inks, and alcohol-based dyes. The most effective in generating a variety of bright colors was powdered food dyes. Using these dyes in various concentrations, the spectrum of colors pictured in Image 2 was produced.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>V. Conclusions</strong></p> <p><span>During the 6-month Phase I NSF SBIR grant proposal period, the team made extremely positive progress on each area of focus. The mechanical and electrical subsystems as well as the fabrics produced saw marked improvements. The activities during the grant are significant because they support the company&rsquo;s goal of ultimately bringing the technology to a commercially viable point. Not only were technological barriers greatly reduced, but the company also has greater clarity on areas of focus for future work. All of the improvements made during the grant period were implemented within a desktop prototype, pictured in Image 3.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/15/2016<br>      Modified by: Aaron&nbsp;Rowley</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501948515_Image3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501948515_Image3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501948515_Image3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The ?Mini? prototype built by Electroloom</div> <div class="imageCredit">Electroloom</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;Rowley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501508136_Chart1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501508136_Chart1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Chart 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501508136_Chart1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Chart 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Weight of samples after 20mins</div> <div class="imageCredit">Electroloom</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;Rowley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Chart 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501564868_Table1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501564868_Table1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Table 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501564868_Table1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Table 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dispensing method electrospinning trials</div> <div class="imageCredit">Electroloom</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;Rowley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Table 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501336916_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501336916_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501336916_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">One PCB revision from top-down perspective</div> <div class="imageCredit">Electroloom</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;Rowley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501702132_Chart2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501702132_Chart2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Chart 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501702132_Chart2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Chart 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Stress vs. Strain of fabrics</div> <div class="imageCredit">Electroloom</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;Rowley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Chart 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501636214_Image2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501636214_Image2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548710/1548710_10404768_1472501636214_Image2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Samples of dyed fabrics</div> <div class="imageCredit">Electroloom</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;Rowley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image 2</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
