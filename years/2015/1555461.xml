<AbstractNarration>The Privacy Enhancing Technology Symposium (PETS) is a leading venue for privacy technology research. Since starting in 2000, PETS has brought together researchers in privacy-related areas including Internet and other data systems and communication networks. Student attendance at PETS is an important part of graduate education in privacy. The 2016 Symposium will be held in Darmstadt Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage participation at PETS by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by research areas. Preference will be offered to those with papers but inadequate travel funding from their organization. Organizers will make particular efforts to encourage participation of women and under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
