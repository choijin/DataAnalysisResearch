<AbstractNarration>The proposed research seeks to develop a ship-based weather radar for use in field studies at sea.  This radar will greatly improve our knowledge of oceanic weather systems, far from the reach of land-based weather radars.  The knowledge gained from this instrument will improve our understanding of how rainfall in these oceanic weather systems differs from rainfall over land.  These measurements will in turn improve our knowledge of the physics and dynamics of ocean-based precipitating weather systems.  The knowledge gained from these measurements may improve our methods to calculate rainfall over the vast oceans of the world in weather models.  While not deployed at sea on various field studies, this radar will serve as a teaching and learning platform for students and faculty interested in the latest techniques in radar meteorology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ship-based C-band, polarimetric Doppler radar will provide an oceanic capability that currently does not exist in the U.S.  Differences in precipitation processes over land versus sea are well understood but gaps still exist in our detailed knowledge of these processes.  These differences are often a function of varying aerosol concentrations and differential heating of land surfaces leading to stronger vertical motions over land versus the sea.  This radar will help fill those gaps through better precipitation estimation and microphysical parameter characterization using the dual-polarization measurement capability from the Ship-CPOL radar.  These data will also serve as ground truth for various satellite remote sensing techniques used today to estimate precipitation over the vast oceans of the world.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intense heating by the Sun and subsequent evaporation set the stage for widespread heavy rainfall over the vast tropical oceans of Earth. This deep convection and accompanying stratiform precipitation acts as a heat source for the tropical atmosphere, which in turn helps drive the large scale wind patterns in the tropics with impacts to the higher latitudes. Understanding the nature of tropical convection is paramount to improving climate and weather forecast models. Due to the remote nature of the tropical oceans, U.S. research ships have been used to investigate ocean and atmosphere processes for the last several decades. Since 1974 (GATE) some of these ship-based experiments have carried meteorological radars to probe tropical precipitation. In GATE, ship radars measured rainfall intensity only and were not stabilized for ships motions. TOGA COARE in 1992 marked the first deployment of stabilized, Doppler radars on research ships. In TOGA COARE, two Doppler radars were deployed, one on a U.S. research ship and the other on a research ship from China. A Major Research Instrumentation proposal was submitted to NSF by Colorado State University in January 2015 for the development of a 5 cm wavelength, Doppler, polarimetric radar intended mainly for ship-based operations, but also easily deployable on land. The polarimetric capability, where both horizontal and vertical polarizations are transmitted and received, allows for improved rainfall estimation and study of warm rain and ice-based precipitation processes. The polarimetric data also allow for attenuation correction in heavy rain, as well as improved data quality control. Funding was received from the NSF in August of 2015 allowing CSU to begin development of this new radar, which is named SEA-POL. During fall 2015 to late summer 2016, the radar was designed in detail, culminating with an external critical design review panel approving the design. Radar construction began in fall 2016. SEA-POL was then ready for testing in mid-summer 2017. During the test period, data from the new radar was compared to data from the CSU-CHILL National Radar Facility. As a result of this comparison, SEA-POL data was deemed to be of high quality and ready for deployment. SEA-POL was deployed for the first time in October-November 2017, sailing on the R/V Roger Revelle to the east tropical Pacific as part of the SPURS-2 field campaign. SEA-POL was used to map rainfall over portions of the ocean allowing oceanographers to study how fresh (rain) water is mixed with the denser (salt) water. SEA-POL also mapped the structure and airflow patterns associated with convective and stratiform clouds. One of the interesting findings in SPURS-2 was the significant contribution of shallow warm rain convective cells to the overall precipitation volume (~10%). These shallow cells contained very high values of differential reflectivity, caused by large oblate raindrops. Evidently, these large raindrops formed through collision-coalescence, perhaps kicked off by the presence of large sea-salt nuclei. SEA-POL performed extremely well during the SPURS-2 cruise. The first attached figure shows the SEA-POL radar installed on the R/V Roger Revelle, in advance of the SPURS-2 cruise. At the time of this writing, SEA-POL is now deployed on the R/V Thomas G. Thompson supporting the PISTON field experiment in the W. tropical Pacific Ocean region. The second attached figure shows SEA-POL installed on the forward O2 deck of that ship. SEA-POL is now a proven resource for studying tropical convection and a key instrument for improving our knowledge of tropical convection. SEA-POL is the only ship-based polarimetric radar in the U.S. instrumentation inventory.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/10/2018<br>      Modified by: Steven&nbsp;A&nbsp;Rutledge</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1531714/1531714_10386265_1536594529007_SEAPOLonR-VRogerRevellecopy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1531714/1531714_10386265_1536594529007_SEAPOLonR-VRogerRevellecopy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SEA-POL installed on the R/V Roger Revelle"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1531714/1531714_10386265_1536594529007_SEAPOLonR-VRogerRevellecopy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SEA-POL installed on the R/V Roger Revelle"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SEA-POL installed on the research ship R/V Roger Revelle docked in San Diego CA in preparation for the SPURS-2 field campaign.
