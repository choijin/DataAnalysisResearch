<AbstractNarration>This project is developing an adaptive learning environment for a wide range of students to attain skills necessary to work in high value manufacturing (HVM) aimed at the energy industry. Houston Community College's (HCC) Petroleum and Manufacturing Engineering Technology programs and Texas A&amp;M University's Department of Engineering Technology and Industrial Distribution are working to create a sustainable certificate program in HVM that provides multiple pathways for community college students while meeting the critical workforce needs of a vital industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovative pedagogical methods, such as i) competency-based learning and ii) skills needs assessment and provision through online learning modules, allow students an adaptive and personalized education. By incorporating the new Engineering Academy paradigm, as opposed to traditional articulation agreements, this project provides a novel pathway for community college students to transition to a four-year degree program. It also incorporates a new method for trying to ensure that HCC students who matriculate to TAMU receive reverse transfer credit for their associate degrees at HCC. HVM modules are being developed for high school students that are aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards as part of a summer program for teachers. HCC is an open-access institution where over 70% of the students belong to under-represented minority groups and over half of students receive Pell grants. Offering the HVM certificate program at HCC allows underrepresented students a pathway to these high demand STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, the project has offered summer research and enrichment experience in engineering (E3) to eleven secondary school teachers from multiple school districts in Texas on high value manufacturing. The project also offered four continuing education sessions to professionals from oil and gas industry in the topics related to high value&nbsp; manufacturing. The participants from both programs (continuing education for industry professionals and the summer enrichment experience for teachers) found the programs to be relevant and well organized.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>The proposed project filled a significant gap in the credit and non-credit offerings of community and technical colleges in Texas by offering the unique set skills required for technicians to effectively engage in HVM. The certificate program curriculum provides authentic experiential learning opportunities to meet the needs of industry for technician-level professionals who can contribute immediately. By incorporating the new Engineering Academy paradigm, as opposed to traditional articulation agreements, this project provides a novel pathway for community college students to transition to a four-year degree program. Some of the program?s developed courses use self-paced competency-based aspects to provide a flexible and adaptive learning environment to students.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impact: </strong>Texas ranks first in the nation with respect to manufacturing exports and manufacturing capital investment, and second in manufacturing employment. A significant portion of this HVM activity is related to oil and gas; Texas produces over a third of US crude oil. Through the certificate and continuing education programs, this project has provided an entry point (for new) and re-training opportunity (for current workforce) for a wide array of students into this critical and growing industry. HCC is an open-access institution with over 70% of the students belonging to groups historically under-represented in STEM and over half of their students receiving Pell grants. In the Division of Science and Engineering Technologies, under-represented minorities account for over 65% of the student population. Offering the HVM certificate program at HCC &nbsp;allows a diverse group of students a pathway to these high demand STEM careers. These students will have the option of pursuing an industry career, an associate degree, or transitioning to a four-year program. Lastly, through the E3 program, several high school teachers were provided with a research and curriculum development experience at Texas A&amp;M on HVM related topics. These teachers then went back to their schools and integrated their experiences and their lessons into high school curricula to improve the understanding and awareness of K-12 students about engineering or&nbsp; manufacturing careers.</p> <p class="Pa4"><strong>Key Project Objectives and Outcome</strong></p> <p class="Pa4"><em>A.
