<AbstractNarration>In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose presence we only infer gravitationally, is unknown in its nature, and is termed dark matter. Particle physics suggests that dark matter comprises relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to directly detect WIMPs are extremely challenging due to small interaction probabilities and large backgrounds. The motion of the Earth through the galaxy produces a head-wind of WIMPs. The angular distribution of recoils from WIMP interactions has a ~100% asymmetry, and is modulated at the sidereal rate on account of the Earth's rotation. No known background can mimic this signal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The practical implications of the technology being developed for such searches have promising applications to low background alpha and neutron measurements. This work also includes the training of a diverse set of undergraduates and graduate students in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of research experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) experiment leads the field of directional dark matter detection. The intellectual merit of this award resides in DRIFT's sensitivity to this modulated signature, which provides a unique window into one of the most important questions in science today. NSF-funded DRIFT-IId work over the last several years has led to enormous experimental progress. The collaboration is in the final stages of commissioning a new DRIFT-IIe detector. The operation of both detectors will test the viability of long-duration background-free exposures. This award will provide funding to continue the operations of DRIFT-II.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work was focused on the dark matter that makes up about 85% of the mass in the universe.  Dark matter was first postulated to exist in the 1930?s when an astronomer noticed that galaxies in a cluster of galaxies were moving faster in their orbits than they normally should based on the force of gravity exerted by the rest of the galaxies.  The speed of an object moving in an orbit depends on the total mass inside its orbit, and the speeds of the galaxies implied a much greater total mass than one would calculate assuming the stars in galaxies made up all the mass.   The rest of the mass was called "dark matter" because it does not absorb or emit light like our familiar atoms and molecules.  Since that time, many more measurements confirm that something is causing more gravity than just the normal matter, and scientists and engineers have been doing experiments to detect particles of dark matter since the 1980?s.     We searched for dark matter using a specialized detector deep underground in a mine in the UK.   When a hypothesized dark matter particle hits an atom, the nucleus of that atom bounces off and leaves a trail of ionization in the detector, and that ionization causes an electrical signal that we record.  Our experiment was unique in that we could measure the approximate direction of motion of the recoiling atomic nucleus.   This is a valuable property of our detector because the directions of such recoils are predicted to change during the day &ndash; based on the fact that the earth is moving through a sea of randomly moving dark matter particles. So our detector is called "directional".  One factor that is not known is how strongly the dark matter will interact with everyday matter.  No experiment has yet made a definitive detection of dark matter, so limits are set on the probability that dark matter exists based on different assumptions on how strongly it interacts with normal matter.  Our detector set the best limits in the world using a directional detector.     We also started experiments to evaluate a technical modification to our detector to simplify its construction.  We exposed a prototype to neutrons from a radioactive source.  Neutrons are a valuable tool because they make recoil nuclei in the detector identical to those from dark matter particles.  A graduate student is studying the data and writing his PhD dissertation. Finally, we have co-written a paper about a possible future experiment in which we would try to create dark matter using a beam of high-energy electrons &ndash; this paper is under peer review at this time, so it is not yet published.  This technique of using a particle beam to create dark matter has been used before, but we would explore a new region of the mass of the dark matter particle created.  The new experiment would use a detector very similar to the one we have used, and it will also be a "directional" instrument, which in this case this allows us to reduce backgrounds.
