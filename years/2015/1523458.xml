<AbstractNarration>The 2015 Social Computing, Behavioral-Cultural Modeling, and Prediction (SBP) conference will be held in Washington DC from March 31- April 3, 2015. The primary objectives are to provide an international platform for collaborative and exploratory research for a synergistic advancement of the emerging field of social computing. Social computing and behavioral modeling lie at the intersection of various disciplines, from computing and linguistics to the social sciences, economics and medicine.  SBP is a highly interdisciplinary conference offering a rare and exciting opportunity for behavioral and social science researchers to come together with computational and computer scientists and other related disciplines. Through reaching out to students from diverse backgrounds, the travel grants supported by this award will broaden the base of interdisciplinary research involving computer science; students from many of these disciplines are less likely to have other travel support options than computer scientists.  Past travel awards to SBP have been effective in attracting applicants from groups underrepresented in Computer Science.  Through paper and poster presentations, interdisciplinary tutorials, keynote presentations, technical challenge problems and cross-fertilization round table sessions involving researchers and program staff from federal agencies, the conference aims to offer training, professional development, and community building opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The proposal had one primary objective: To create avenues to help increase  disciplinary diversity and encourage minority participation in the SBP 2015  conference. The long-term goal was to increase the participation of  underrepresented groups in the SBP 2015 conference and  subsequent SBP conferences. Since 2010, the SBP Conference series has  been held yearly, in the Washington DC area. To achieve the objective, we  advertised the general conference and related activities, through direct  email lists, group lists, web presence, and social media. Our list has a direct reach to  over 2700 people, organizations, or group lists. We estimate a wider indirect  reach to over 100,000 people.    The NSF funding had a definite impact in our ability  to attract some of the targeted minority participants in the SBP conference, some  of whom may not have considered the conference without such a support.  Between the 2016 and 2017 conferences, there was a modest increase in the  participation of ethnic minorities. More progress was made with respect to  disciplinary diversity. We observed a decrease in the proportion of traditional  computational scientists (computer science, mathematics, statistics), and  an increase in the proportional of those with background/interest in  computational social science. Perhaps, equally noteworthy, is the significant  increase in the proportion of participants with background/interests in the  social sciences. Notwithstanding, more work still needs to be done. The gender  gap in conference participation is still a significant problem. There is still a  relatively low participation of researchers from the health sciences and  general healthcare field. And maintaining the relative balance with respect  to participation from the social sciences is an on-going challenge.
