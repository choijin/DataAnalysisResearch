<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a safe and effective cure for fungal nail infections. In addition, the technology developed in this project could be utilized in other healthcare treatments such as skin and wound disinfection, decontamination of teeth and gums (oral hygiene), and the sterilization of medical instruments and implanted devices.  Fungal nail infection rates are growing at an estimated 7% annually following both the general aging of the population and the rise in the incidence of diabetes. 50% of elderly over the age of 70 and 30% of all diabetics are affected. For many people, their infected nails are painful and embarrassing. Worst of all, diabetics with fungal nail infections are at increased risk for foot ulcerations, gangrene, and amputation. 38 million Americans suffer from nail fungal infections and spend over $3 billion dollars each year on treatments that are ineffective and sometimes unsafe. People suffering with nail fungal infections express widespread dissatisfaction with the limited success, side effects, high cost and inconvenience of current treatments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will complete prototype development of a novel, safe, and effective treatment option for onychomycosis (nail fungal infection).  The medical device will allow a doctor to fumigate the infected nail with gas because gas can penetrate the nail and kill the fungus where all other treatments cannot reach. The human toe nail lacks a blood supply to deliver optimal immune system protection to fight off fungal infections. This project will develop a device that converts the air above the surface of the toe nail into the same gases used by the immune system to fight infection. Hence, the gas treatment would safely mimic the normal blood supply of anti-microbial chemicals. This SBIR project will reduce technical development risks, improve the device usability by doctors, and establish the manufacturability of the device. Device prototypes will be validated in the laboratory and with users (Podiatrists). The clinical-ready prototypes developed during this project will be used in future clinical trials that will prove the efficacy and safety of the device needed to sell the product. The device promises to fulfill the unmet medical need for a safe and effective treatment option for the millions of Americans suffering with fungal infected nails.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II grant allowed DeviceFarm, Inc. to built and test the RenewalNail? prototype medical device, a topical treatment for onychomycosis (fungal nail infection).  The device works by creating room temperature plasma using electricity and air.  Plasma plus a liquid concentrator spread on the toenail allows the instrument to fumigate the human nail the way you fumigate a house using antifungal gas.  A gas-based treatment can penetrate the nail and kill the fungus where all other treatments cannot reach and is safer and more convenient than other therapies.      Fungal nail (onychomycosis) is a chronic infection that can be painful and have psychosocial effects that damage a patient's quality of life. Onychomycosis is common, affecting an estimated 38 million people in the US and an estimated 10% of the world?s population; 50% of people over the age of 70, and 30% of all diabetics. Diabetics with infected nails are three times more likely to have a limb amputated.     Current onychomycosis treatment options cover a broad range of remedies.  Oral drugs have the highest cure rates and are the preferred treatment for most doctors, as a simple prescription fits in a typical 15-min clinical visit time; however, liver toxicity risks and blood tests needed to monitor patient response have limited the oral drugs use. Prescription topical drugs are easy to apply and eliminate the systemic drug route of orals but have a 17% or less chance of success despite laborious daily treatments over the course of a year that cause patient compliance problems. Lasers are unproven, costly and can cause pain. These treatment problems contribute to an estimated 47% of US patients (more than 15 million) going untreated.  Both patients and dermatologists express widespread dissatisfaction with the limited success, side effects, high cost and inconvenient treatment time course for current fungal nail treatments.     RenewalNail? will be a physician?s office-based therapy for the effective treatment of mild to moderate onychomycosis and targeted to podiatrist and dermatologist clinics.   A series of three treatments over a week will eliminate the fungus that causes onychomycosis without systemic medical complications.  A RenewalNail? treatment cycle is performed in three 45-minute office-based secessions over a week. It is a simple and painless procedure.     Our product's primary value proposition is the topical delivery of a safe and highly effective fungal therapy that offers simpler, shorter treatment times directly at the site of infection. The short treatment duration (three 45-minute treatments over one week) will improve patient compliance. A treatment with no pain or side effects that is easy for both patients and doctors will contribute to more people seeking and receiving treatment.     The NSF Phase II grant has allowed DeviceFarm to build three clinic ready devices and collect compelling pre-clinical data.  With our versatile prototype, we demonstrated the plasma device?s effectiveness in eliminating the primary causes of onychomycosis (T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes fungi) through both bovine hoof keratin barriers and human cadaver nails showing technical validation of the concept.

The RenewalNail? treatment system and protocol showed that 50% of patients received mycological cure (all the fungus was killed) in early clinical feasibility testing. These results are better than one FDA approved oral drug and two FDA approved topical drugs for this indication.  It is equivalent to the best FDA approved topical drug that needs to be applied for a year.  Learnings from the clinical trial allowed us to improve the device with several minor modifications.  We are ready for a pivotal clinical trial to achieve FDA approval then start a commercial launch.     A commercial device will offer patients and practitioners a reliable method to treat unsightly nail fungus without toxic side effects and a more rapid treatment of the condition than is currently available in the market.  These features represent a compelling value proposition.  It will also add a physical tool to the treatment arsenal of fungal and bacterial infections of the body because of the devices broad spectrum kill of microbes.  Outside the healthcare field, the knowledge acquired in this fungal nail system development would have sterilization and decontamination uses in commercial equipment decontamination, food sterilization, and water sterilization.
