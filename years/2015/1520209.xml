<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to optimize today's segmented Internet architecture by providing a cohesive software platform that operates on WiFi Access Points. The proposed technology transforms the WiFi Access Point to provide new applications and services locally for home users and for small and medium businesses. It has many benefits for its end users, e.g. applications that can better protect privacy of users, the ability to better protect children as they browse the Internet, and the creation of new applications supporting home automation, security, and entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is creating unique technology that allows a commodity WiFi Access Point to become a multi-function device by transforming it as an edge-computing platform. It enables lightweight virtualization that allows multiple third-party services to co-exist through resource isolation and sharing. It also enables advanced RF management by which interference from diverse wireless emitters (e.g. WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, game controllers, and even microwave ovens) can be detected, quantified, and mitigated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The goal of this Phase 1 project has been to design, refine, and experiment with techniques that create new programmable services for low-end WiFi Access Point (AP) platforms. The core techniques focus on design and implementation of computational functions that can be flexibly placed within such WiFi APs. Executing these software components efficiently enables new market opportunities for the company. One of the key developments from the Phase 1 activity was the ability to scalably instantiate computational functions across different forms factors, ranging from APs to cloud servers.  It is important because from a developer?s perspective, as it is more powerful to be able to use the same framework to instantiate the computing capabilities anywhere in the cloud, in racks deeper inside networks, or at the edge like a WiFi Access Point or base station. Further, to enable efficient implementation of advanced RF interference management capabilities within WiFi APs, the project augments the AP platform with additional ability to diagnose various performance issues. Overall, the project met its main goals and allowed the company to make great progress towards a commercially viable and differentiated product in the market. The company is also making strong progress towards a commercially successful product with preliminary revenue accrued this year already.
