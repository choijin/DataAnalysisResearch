<AbstractNarration>Inventors have long viewed the agility and grace of animals that crawl, swim, and fly in all environments with awe and envy. However, the ability to replicate the versatility, stability, and efficiency of biological locomotion in engineered systems has eluded scientists and engineers alike. This project will identify fundamental principles of locomotion, with an emphasis on the role of one of the most fundamental biological attributes, compliance. Compliance is ubiquitous in biological locomotion, appearing in diverse forms of life from the elastic ribbed tail of a fish, to the membrane wings of an insect, to the sinewy muscular body of a snake;  when a human turns a door knob or picks up a spoon -- tasks that are nontrivial for robotic systems --  they can rely on compliance in the hand to passively adjust to small disturbances and uncertainties in the environment.  This project seeks to bridge the gap between classical studies in rigid body mechanics that have long been the purview of the discipline of robotics, and compliant biological strategies for locomotion. The research will rationalize compliant strategies and structures that appear in nature.  This knowledge can in turn be used to design new classes of versatile compliant machines, which may include robust strategies for locomotion and manipulation in robotic systems and new compliant mechanisms for harvesting energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research, which lies at the intersection of controls and the mechanics of continuously deformable systems, will develop two new mathematical approaches to tame the complexity associated with optimization of compliant systems.  The first takes its roots in geometric mechanics, which has already proven effective in the study of locomotion of simple systems. The second inverts the optimization problem by first solving for optimal kinematics (e.g. optimal stroke patterns for swimmers) with a dynamic cost function, and subsequently inverting the optimal kinematics to find the associated dynamic parameters (such as bending stiffness). In addition to the development of these two new mathematical tools, the project will investigate the role of compliance within the context of different biological locomotion modes. Through decades of cumulative research, the scientific community has established a reasonable understanding of the role of compliance in isolated applications, such as legged walking and running, but comparatively little is known in terms of how this concept extends to other modes such as crawling, swimming, and insect flight. This research will address the issue through investigations of the underlying physical principles that motivate the form and physiology of each of these systems.  However, the greatest contribution will come through the amalgamation of these results. By developing new insights across multiple locomotion modes, this project aims to extend the findings into a generalized framework for compliance and locomotion. This framework will then serve as a jumping off point for engineers, who can situate their own systems within a greater map of compliant design methodologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Underwater robots are widely used in ocean industry, however, current systems tend to be large and expensive, requiring significant operational support. The underwater robotics market is poised to expand through the development of small, low-cost devices for applications where the cost of larger vehicles is prohibitive. In the search for an ideal solution, the biological world presents a natural source of inspiration. Swimming animals, such as fish, exhibit a degree of speed and efficiency which is currently unmatched in the robotics realm. Many designs have been proposed; but so far, these devices still fall significantly short of their biological counterparts. Motivated by this gap in performance, our objective is to develop novel solutions for the design of flexible swimming systems that approach biologically observed efficiencies, speeds, and maneuverability.   Intellectual Merit: :   We have developed a theoretical model for undulating swimming organisms to identify optimally efficient stoke patterns at the meter, millimeter, and micrometer scales. Although the flow physics in each case are clearly distinct, our comparison revealed that the underlying mathematical structure of the problem is nearly identical among the three cases. We used this commonality to show that the behavior of undulatory swimmers at different scales can be viewed as points on a single optimal curve rather than distinct, unrelated phenomena. This new perspective makes it possible to reduce the efficient swimming problem to a single dimensionless number which characterizes the optimality of swimming behavior for organisms of all sizes. To test this prediction, we compiled a swimming dataset consisting of over 600 unique observations of swimming organisms. From microscopic swimmers such as sperm cells and nematodes, up to fish as large as eels and trout, we find that life at all scales falls within the predicted range. Given this insight, next we determined how to replicate this optimal undulating wave forms using a passive elastic "tail." Finally, we presented a novel bio-inspired swimming robot, which generates our computed nearly-optimal fish-like undulations along a thin elastic tail. We show that the speed, acceleration, and efficiency of our robot are among the highest reported to date for a flexible swimming machines.    The high performance of our swimming robot can be directly attributed to the fundamental analyses described in the first three bullets.   Broader Impact:  This work supported the training of one PhD student who is now working as an engineer at the intersection of data and hardware. The work resulted in a patent ("Actuation System for Swimming Robots") which has the potential to shift the current paradigm of large, complex machines to systems that are small and agile, but also cost-effective and reliable.
