<AbstractNarration>Laplacian growth (LG) is one of the most important types of dynamics at the boundary between two objects. For example, LG arises naturally in the study of certain  problems involving a moving boundary. As a growth process, LG is widely recognized as a model for the formation of various universal patterns observed in physics and natural sciences such as the growth of bacterial colonies.  A new exiting development in this classical area of mathematical physics was the recent discovery of the fact that on the microscopic level, the mechanism of LG is very closely related to the behavior of particles in plasma ensembles. Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter. A common form of plasma is seen in neon signs and in fact plasma is the most common state of matter in the universe. These plasma ensembles are described  in terms of mathematical objects call random matrices that have complex eigenvalues. The relation of LG and random matrices has been intensively studied on the physical level but many fundamental problems remain open on the mathematical side. The PI, Nikolai Makarov, will focus on several such problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main topics and goals of the study will be the following: the proof of the convergence of rescaled point processes and the description of the universality laws for various types of boundary points in the random normal matrix model (RNM); the proof of the laminarity of Hele-Shaw flows and the rigorous derivation of their integrability properties;the analysis of the dynamics of the Schwarz reflections associated with algebraic droplets in the RNM model. To achieve these goals, the PI will bring together tools and ideas from various areas of mathematics (complex analysis, conformal dynamics, probability theory) and theoretical physics (conformal field theory, non-equilibrium growth phenomenon, disordered systems). The educational component of the project will be the development of new graduate courses and organization of scientific workshops and conferences. The project will provide research and training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nikolai Makarov completed his project in the theory of random normal matrices (RNM), Laplacian growth, and Schwarz reflections supported by the NSF grant DMS-1500821. During the funding period, the research was focused on the problems of convergence of various natural point processes arising in the RNM model, as well as on several related fundamental open problems in classical complex analysis and logarithmic potential theory. The PI achieved the main goals of the project and made significant progress in the following directions: (i) convergence of the rescaled RNM point processes at regular and singular boundary points of the droplet (support of the equilibrium measure); (ii)  topology of algebraic droplets and applications to the inverse problem of potential theory; (iii) inverse spectral problem for canonical systems, applications to uncertainty principle; (iv) univalent polynomials: extremal polynomials and their classifications in terms of Hubbard trees;  (v)  the dynamics of the Schwarz reflections: the corresponding Julia-type and Mandelbrot-type sets; (vi) calculus of conformal fields on Riemann surfaces These results are presented in twelve full length papers (published or submitted for publication). The results and methods of the project have made an impact on several areas of analysis and mathematical physics: random normal matrices, potential theory, inverse problems, univalent functions, and complex dynamics.  Also, some results and ideas of the project should be of interest to theoretical physicists working in conformal field theory, quantum Hall effect, non-equilibrium growth phenomena, and disordered systems. The project provided research and training opportunities for several graduate students and postdocs. The PI developed and taught three new graduate courses at Caltech: "Calculus of conformal fields on compact Riemann surfaces", "Inverse spectral problem for canonical systems", and "Random normal matrix model".  In addition, he helped organize two conferences on related topics.          Last Modified: 07/05/2020       Submitted by: Nikolai Makarov]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
