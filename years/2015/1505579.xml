<AbstractNarration>This project uses homotopy theory to study questions in number theory and in algebraic and differential topology.  Homotopy theory studies those properties of mathematical objects that do not change under small deformations.  These mathematical objects are often of a geometric nature, but the methods of homotopy theory have been increasingly applied to objects of an algebraic nature as well.  Homotopy theoretic properties tend to be accessible to computation by taking advantage of the invariance under small changes.  Since they also generally retain important information about the original mathematical objects, homotopy theory is an effective tool for a wide range of mathematical problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three main foci.  The first focus concerns the algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum, which connects to both differential topology and number theory.  The research pursues a program to identify the homotopy type of the fiber of the linearization map between the K-theory of the sphere spectrum and the K-theory of the integers; a program to identify the homotopy fiber of the cyclotomic trace; and an approach to a conjecture of Hesselholt by constructing an appropriate spectral category of cyclotomic spectra. The second focus is the study of the complex cobordism spectrum as an E_infinity or more generally E_n ring spectrum.  The project investigates some concrete questions on the multiplication on cobordism and approaches to solving them.  The third focus concerns the relationship between the E_n differential graded algebras and the (unstable) homotopy theory of simply connected spaces.  The work includes a project for exploring the notion of "formal" E_n algebra, particularly the question of when the cochain complex of a space can be formal and the related question of when it is equivalent to a commutative differential graded algebra.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Euler characteristic is a precursor to a theory called "algebraic K-theory" which can be visualized as doing the same kind of thing as the Euler characteristic: It converts the operation of gluing together of basic pieces into addition and subtraction.  Algebraic K-theory has applications all through algebra and geometry.  For example, K_0 of a number field gives information about factorization and whether unique factorization holds; K_1 of a group ring gives information about the difference between homotopy equivalence and homeomorphism for manifolds with that fundamental group.  The most fundamental example of K-theory is the K-theory of the sphere spectrum.  One of the most important results of this project generalizes what is known about the algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum from regular primes to all primes.  In particular, the paper "The homotopy groups of the algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum" calculates the K-groups of the sphere spectrum in terms of the homotopy groups of some more basic and more familiar objects plus the algebraic K-theory of the integers.  The paper "The nilpotence theorem for the algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum" proves a completely new result about the K-theory of the sphere spectrum, namely that it satisfies a version of Nishida's nilpotence theorem: The multiplication on its homotopy groups is nilpotent outside of degree zero.  The paper "The fiber of the cyclotomic trace for the sphere spectrum" compares the K-theory of the sphere spectrum to the K-theory of the integers and infinite complex projective space.
