<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the goal of this research is to create a new generation of crystalline porous semiconducting materials for energy and environmental applications. The integration between high surface area and semiconducting properties makes these new materials especially useful as efficient adsorbents and photocatalysts for applications including adsorption and solar-energy-driven conversion of carbon dioxide into fuels such as methane. The research has broad impact because it blends together and contributes to various fields such as photocatalytic materials, semiconducting nanoparticles, cluster chemistry, and porous materials. The PI is actively involved in various educational and training programs for undergraduate students. The project combines diversity in materials synthesis and various characterization and measurement techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of this research is to develop highly stable crystalline porous chalcogenides that integrate high-surface area and uniform porosity with semiconductivity and optoelectronic properties and to study various properties and applications ranging from selective gas sorption, visible-light responsive photoelectrodes, to photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. By integrating synthetic and structural principles from metal chalcogenide chemistry and nanoporous solids, this research seeks to employ templated multi-component co-assembly processes to create a new generation of chemically and photochemically stable chalcogenide-based crystalline porous semiconductors. Specifically, the research aims to utilize heterometallic chalcogenide systems and structural and functional diversity of organic species to control structures of chalcogenide clusters and frameworks and to tune their semiconducting and optoelectronic properties. This project helps to develop and advance a new area of cross-disciplinary research at the interface between semiconducting materials and nanoporous solids. The project explores a new frontier dealing with unique porous and semiconducting materials based on chalcogenide building blocks. The activity provides the fundamental understanding about key factors in the synthetic design and optimization of crystalline porous semiconductors. Students in this project benefit from excellent training opportunities in synthesis, materials characterization, and property measurements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF award has enabled the PI?s group to develop new synthetic methods that have led to the synthesis and characterization of a large number of unprecedented metal chalcogenide materials. The large volume of the synthetic studies, coupled with extensive characterizations  improved the fundamental understanding about the key factors in the synthetic design and optimization of these materials. The results from this NSF project have been broadly disseminated through timely publications in high-impact journals and presentations at scientific meetings.   Intellectual Merit    Through this NSF support, the PI's group has made a significant progress in the synthetic development of new metal-chalcogenide-based materials and in the study of their various properties. Note that new crystalline materials were fully structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In addition to extensive synthetic and structural studies, we also target applications, such as photocatalysis, photoelectrochemistry, photoluminescence (PL) that can take advantage of the unique properties of these materials. Some of these properties such as tunable band gaps are obvious for chalcogenide-based materials, and the uniqueness of our work is the integration of such properties with the uniform porosity and high surface area. Some other properties that we explore are much less obvious to non-experts. For example, those materials developed by the PI's group (e.g., UCR-20) have exceptionally high negative charge on the framework (more negative than the most negative zeolite frameworks such as Zeolite Li-X used for air separation), because M4+/M3+ ratios in chalcogenides can be less than 1, which as a general rule is not possible in zeolites for Si4+/Al3+ ratio.  As a result, chalcogenides developed by the PI's group can exhibit extraordinarily high ion-exchange capacity.  Broader Impacts:     The NSF support has made a significant impact on the student education and skill training. So far, two undergraduate and three graduate students from UCR have participated in this project. Students presented their studies at ACS meetings, MRS meetings, and Gordon Research Conferences. Because this project involves many different aspects of research activities ranging from synthesis, structure analysis, to property measurements, students have had opportunities to be trained not only in materials synthesis, but also in the characterization of structural and physical properties. They have had opportunities to use various instruments including D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer, Bruker APEX II single crystal diffractometers, gas sorption and surface area analyzer, diffuse-reflectance UV-Vis spectrometer, electrochemical instruments from Solartron, and thermal analysis.  The PI has actively participated in various educational and training programs involving undergraduate students. The PI?s group has hosted and mentored a number of undergraduate summer researchers from different programs including the NSF-supported MacREU (Materials Connection Research Experience for Undergraduate Students), HSI-STEM Pathway (HIS = Hispanic Serving Institution), and RISE (the Summer Research in Science and Engineering Program). The PI?s NSF award has made a great contribution in the support of these students? research.             Last Modified: 10/01/2018       Submitted by: Pingyun Feng]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
