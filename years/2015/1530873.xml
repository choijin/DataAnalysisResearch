<AbstractNarration>This project, developing CyberCANOE (Cyber-enabled Collaboration Analysis Navigation and Observation Environment), aims to serve as an eyepiece, providing researchers with powerful and easy-to-use information-rich instrumentation in support of cyberinfrastructure-enabled data-intensive scientific discovery.  CyberCANOE will provide users with the ability to see both 2D and 3D stereoscopic content in a completely seamless display environment with almost 50 Megapixels of resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CyberCANOE provides a unique alternative approach to constructing ultra-resolution display environments by using new and completely seamless direct view Light Emitting Diode displays, rather than traditional projection technologies or Liquid Crystal Displays. The net effect is a visual instrument that exceeds the capabilities and overcomes the limitations of the current best-in-class systems such as the CAVE2 at EVL and the WAVE at CALIT2 at UC San Diego. Immediately 46 researchers, 28 postdocs, 833 undergraduates, 45 graduate students spanning disciplines that include Oceanography, Astrobiology, Mathematics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Research, Archeology, and Computational Media are poised to use the CyberCANOE for their large-scale data visualization needs. The instrument opens up new opportunities in computer science research at the intersection of data-intensive analysis and visualization, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality. It enables the Laboratory for Advanced Visualization and Applications (LAVA) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM), to provide an EPSCoR and Native Hawaiian Serving Institution, with state-of-the-art equipment, opportunities, and supervision to enhance undergraduate and graduate research and education; to provide scientific communities with highly integrated visually rich collaboration environments; to work with industry to facilitate the creation of new technologies for the advancement of science and engineering; and to continue ongoing partnerships with many of the worlds best domain scientists and computer scientists in academia and industry, who readily become early adopters of new instrumentation, and who provide students with summer internships and jobs upon graduation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The main outcome of this project is the development of cutting edge hardware to allow scientists, engineers, doctors, educators and students to examine and comprehend complex data more effectively through the use of data visualization.  Called, the CyberCANOE - for Cyber-enabled Collaboration Analysis Navigation and Observation Environment, it is device that uses an array of high resolution 3D displays to provide a three-dimensional experience that fully immerses the user in the data they are trying to comprehend.    The CyberCANOE allows researchers and students to ?swim? in the depths of the ocean to study coral reef data, or visit the International Space Station, or fly virtual all over the world to look at renewable energy deployments.  The project was able to develop 1 CyberCANOE which stands as the highest resolution (256 megapixel) hybrid-reality system in the world, allowing users to see imagery at better than 20/20 acuity. 256 megapixels is like having 32 times the image resolution of your home 4K TV. So think of it as the most powerful ?telescope? in the world for looking at data.  As a result, the instrument helped establish a formal data visualization laboratory (the Laboratory for Advanced Visualization &amp; Applications)- the first of its kind in Hawaii.   The creation of this laboratory enabled Hawaii to lead in the development of visualization software designed to enable teams of researchers to collaborate over distance using the CyberCANOEs. Called SAGE (the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment) there are approximately 4000 users in 800 sites world wide. This makes the US the leaders in this type of technological infrastructure (cyberinfrastructure).  Broad Impact  The CyberCANOE was essential in boosting Hawaii?s research competitiveness.  Specifically, the $600K investment by NSF  to build the CyberCANOE resulted in a return of investment of $8.4M in synergistic grant funding from federal, state and local industry, including: NSF, Department of Energy, Army, Navy, National Security Agency, Hawaii State Energy Office, Hawaiian Electric Company, Oceanit.  This funding enabled Hawaii to deploy 18 CyberCANOEs of varying capabilities across the University of Hawaii?s system of colleges, including community colleges.   These CyberCANOEs are used in research, development and education in areas including: Archaeology, Architecture, Art, Atmospheric Science, Biology, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, Communications, Computer Science, Education, Geoscience, Health, Library Science, Mathematics, Medical, Meteorology, Network Engineering, Neuroscience, Physics, Psychology, Statistics, and even Pacific Island Studies.
