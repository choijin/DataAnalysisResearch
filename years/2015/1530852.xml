<AbstractNarration>This research examines the links between consumption, savings, credit, and betting decisions among small business owners. Legal betting on international football matches has exploded across much of sub-Saharan Africa and is wildly popular among young men in many countries. Many of these participants are small enterprise owners and household heads. The project looks at the impacts of high intensity sports betting on participants' businesses and families. In addition the project hypothesizes that savings and credit constraints contribute to the allure of betting. While risk-aversion is a commonly made assumption about human behavior, it may not hold in a setting with severe financial constraints. The promise of a large infusion of liquidity is one of the main stated appeals of betting for participants.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field research will take place in Uganda where a pilot has showed that nearly half the men in the informal sector reported to participate in sports betting with a mean intensity among bettors of 10% of weekly earnings. The study creates a representative weekly panel of small enterprise owners in Uganda's capital while tracking earnings, consumption, and betting behavior. A set of randomized interventions allows for the identification of a causal relationship between savings and credit constraints on betting behavior as well as information treatments about rate of return. This research builds on insights from the development economics, behavioral economics, and psychology fields. The project is one of the first efforts to explore topics relating to the causes and consequences of risk-seeking betting activity in a developing country setting with a population close to the poverty line.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From August-December 2015, funding from the National Science Foundation was used for the implementation of a research project on sports betting in Kampala, Uganda.  First, in September, 2,700 respondents were included in an initial listing of males age 18-40 working in small trades in randomly selected communities around Kampala.  From this population, approximately one out of every three respondents reported that he bet regularly in most weeks.  In this group, median amounts spent on betting were reported to be just under 10% of weekly income with mean expenditures above 13%.  A sample of 330 full study participants were randomly drawn and included in the study and interviewed nine times: five times in person and four times by phone.  The study aimed to assess the impact of high intensity betting on peoplesÃ† finances (personal and business) and also to identify some of the root drivers of demand for betting.  Initial analysis suggests that demand for betting is (at least partially) driven by demand for liquidity in order to make lumpy purchases.  Experimental methods corroborate this self-reported motivation and show that betting demand increases when respondents are primed on the salience of a desired large expenditure.  This corroborates self-reported motivation for betting as a way of getting large financial payouts.  Second, mental accounting and budgeting failures also appear to influence the extent of many bettorsÃ† participation.  Providing individuals with feedback reports on their betting history resulted in 10% lower betting expenditures among those who had under-recalled their expenditures over the preceding two months.  Interventions aimed at encouraging budgeting for betting also had significant effects in reducing betting by as much as 50%.  Further research activities are being conducted that extend and expand on these intial findings in order to ensure that the preliminary results are robust, to better understand underlying mechanisms, and to further document the intensity and impacts of betting on its participants.
