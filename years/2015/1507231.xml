<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical: These awards by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Massachusetts Amherst (lead) and University of Maryland College Park (non-lead) of this collaborative project is to study the interaction of cells with their physical environment that is a key part of different conditions such as inflammation, wound healing, cancer metastasis, etc.  Study of this interaction will improve our understanding of basic cell biology and potentially lead to new disease interventions or improved implants.  The goal of this project is to examine the interaction between macrophage cells and polymeric materials having tunable mechanical properties.  The investigators will fabricate and characterize the polymeric materials, and subsequently measure cellular respones at the single-cell level.   The investigators are also involved in the educational training and outreach components of the project: (1) graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in cutting-edge materials science and bioengineering techniques and they will be trained in communication skills; (2) the development of educational videos targeting middle school students on the scientific concepts underlying this award, to be called "Kitchen Sink Science".  These videos will feature experimental demonstrations and illustrations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The objectives of this project are to examine the behavior of macrophage cells in contact with tunable viscoelastic substrates.  Macrophages are a key component of the immune system. An improved understanding of their interaction with materials will ultimately lead to better implants, sensors, and drug delivery devices. At the same time, these investigations will shed light on basic cell processes such as inflammation and the foreign body response. The investigators hypothesize that materials with time-dependent mechanical properties will give new perspectives into the relationship between material properties and cell behavior.  To that end, this research will use self-assembly methods to fabricate a series of polymer films covering a range of viscoelastic properties. The films will be characterized by several techniques such as fluorescence and microrheology. The behavior of macrophages will subsequently be examined at the single-cell level, with attention being focused on structural intracellular proteins (e.g., actin) and secreted cytokines (e.g., IL-4). As part of this proposal, our educational and outreach efforts will include: (1) the training of graduate and undergraduate students in materials science and bioengineering techniques, the design and execution of scientific experiments, and in technical writing and oral communication skills; (2) the creation of videos illustrating many of the concepts underpinning this proposal: hydrophobicity, surface tension, amphiphile spreading, and interfacial films, targeted at middle school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The objectives of this project were to examine the behavior of cells from the immune system in contact with materials having time-dependent properties (e.g., akin to the Silly Putty children's toy).  This research is important to society because the relationship between material properties and cell behavior has been found to be important in development, wound healing, and even cancer metastasis.  Therefore a better understanding of the phenomena is needed, particularly with well-defined materials.   As outcomes of this project we have developed and characterized several different materials for use with immune cells (see Figure).  One type is based on 2-D polymer films, another type is a 3-D biopolymer gel stabilized by ionic bonds, and the last type is a 3-D DNA gel stabilized by hydrogen bonds.  All these materials share the feature of noncovalent interactions, in other words, these materials have many weak and reversible interactions (e.g., akin to Velcro adhesives) which allow for dynamic behavior under different forces.  With these materials we are in position to interrogate how cells of the immune system will behave.  During the course of this project, several graduate and undergraduate students have received education and training in planning/design of experiments and advanced characterization methods.  Looking toward the future, this work will motivate similar types of investigations with other cells (cancer cells, stem cells).
