<AbstractNarration>This project develops technologies for understanding shapes and parts of a person or animal and how these relate to their surface appearance. By building models that capture the variations in shape and pose of humans and animals, it becomes possible to understand the way that a person or animal's appearance changes as its arms and legs move or its head turns.  These models can then be aligned with images, assisting in the recognition of figures and the determination of their pose. Understanding human pose and activity is a fundamental problem in computer vision with a host of interesting applications in surveillance, video retrieval, and automated video annotation. Automated systems that can identify the species of animals can form the basis for automated field guides that can be used in education and studies of biodiversity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops new algorithms for matching image features and registering 3D models with bounded distortion mappings. The research team models people and animals using a skeleton capturing their articulations, along with a deformable skin model and an appearance model encoded by classifiers that can identify body parts of an animal. Given an image, the system computes an optimal bounded distortion transformation to register the model with the image. The system identifies both the pose and shape change of the person or animal with respect to the model and provides a way to rank possible detections of the model. The research team explores the problem of identifying the species of animals. The research team further applies algorithms to determine the pose of humans in images.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project addresses the problem of building 3D reconstructions of a human or animal from a single image, or a small number of images.  For example, we have developed methods for reconstructing the pose of a person from a single image, capturing the 3D configuration of their limbs.  We have also developed a method to recover the shape and coloring of a human face from an image.  We have also developed methods for recovering the shape and pose of animals, including highly non-rigid animals such as cats.  These methods handle problems that arise from inferring 3D from 2D images, handling the effects of variable lighting, and dealing with occlusion of some parts of the body by others.  This work has many potential applications.  By recovering the pose of a human, we can better understand their actions.  This might be used to build automatic systems that interact with people.  It can also be used in image search, helping with queries like: "Find the pictures of my daughter hitting a backhand in tennis."  Similarly, recovering the pose of animals can assist systems that are designed to monitor and analyze their behavior.  By recovering the shape and reflectance properties of a human face, we can build systems that automatically edit images, perhaps relighting and improving zoom video.  These methods can also be used to build models of living things that can be used in virtual or augmented reality systems.
