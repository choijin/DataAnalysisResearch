<AbstractNarration>1511045 - Anderson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort is one of the first of its kind to pursue using a novel nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging technique to study multiphase heat transfer systems that are common in industrial applications.  The result can impact and improve understanding and design of systems.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the proposed effort.  The PIs will focus on recruiting woman and Native American students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort will use novel NMR imaging experiments to measure velocity and temperature profiles in multiphase porous media systems, including micro-encapsulated PCMs (phase change materials).  The approach is novel and offers the potential to extend the capabilities of NMR applied to the fundamental study of thermo-fluid systems. The high spatial resolution of NMR is first calibrated with well know PCM materials and will provide data to study and quantify transport at the micro-scale (pore size) in porous media systems.  The work will also incorporate CFD modeling and analysis that captures the complexity of the experiment that will produce new information to allow for a finer level of examination of the models used to relate micro-scale physical processes to macro-scale heat transfer.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project used high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), referred to as magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM), to study heat transfer and fluid flow inside opaque containers that contained particles packed together. These systems are common in applications such as catalyst beads packed in a reactor and particles contained in a cylinder to store excess heat in concentrated solar power. The packing structure in this work was composed of a packed bed of encapsulated phase change materials (PCMs). These PCMs were waxes, such as eicosane, encapsulated in a hard polymer shell. &nbsp;The MRI, which detects more signal from melted than solid wax, can be used to generate an image. As the melting point of these waxes is known, this allows the signal to be analogues to the temperature near the melting point. Thus, MRI was used for the first time to non-invasively image the heat transfer in three dimensions over time. To heat these beds, two systems were considered: forced convection and natural convection. In forced convection, the fluid is pumped through the container. In the natural convection system, the cylinder is closed and heated from below, allowing for fluid motion to occur due to density differences between the hot and cold fluid. In these experiments, the fluid was fluorinated, which allowed imaging of the fluid flow separate from the hydrogen images of the PCMs. Fluid velocity was measured in all three spatial directions in various planes of the bed. Heat transfer is directly related to the fluid flow, and this work captured this important relationship together. By using noninvasive MRI, the results were not influenced by the measurement technique, as often occurs with thermocouples. This MRI technique now allows for better and more quantitative descriptions of the thermal behavior in these complex systems. These experimental results were also compared to pore-scale numerical models. Using a technique called the discrete element method, beads could be numerically injected into a container with the same properties as the experimental system. The generated geometries were then used in computational fluid dynamics studies. The MRI results will help validate the accuracy of these numerical models, since data at this level of detail is not available via any other experimental techniques. In addition to enhancing scientific understanding of this important technological process, the work impacted several students including the successful completion of a M.S. Mech. Eng. student, the training and mentoring of a Ph.D. Mech Eng. student, and the involvement of an undergraduate who became a Goldwater Scholarship recipient due in part to his contributions to this project. Results were made available through journal articles and several major conference presentations. The data were also used in undergraduate courses to visualize coupled energy and momentum transport.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Ryan&nbsp;Anderson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511045/1511045_10366185_1575045809893_GraphicalAbstract-OutcomesReport--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511045/1511045_10366185_1575045809893_GraphicalAbstract-OutcomesReport--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Magnetic resonance microscopy of heat transfer in a packed bed"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1511045/1511045_10366185_1575045809893_GraphicalAbstract-OutcomesReport--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Magnetic resonance microscopy of heat transfer in a packed bed"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A cylinder was filled with wax beads and heated fluid entered from below.
