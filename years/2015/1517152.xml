<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the participation of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty, and other researchers in a conference on "Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics" (FACM) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) on June 5-6, 2015.  FACM 2015 is focused on mathematical fluid dynamics and applications in biomedicine and climate science.  There will be dedicated minisymposia on biofluid dynamics, the connection between mathematical modeling and experiment, geophysical fluid dynamics, wave propagation in fluids, and computational methods, including high-performance computing and multiscale methods. In addition, there will be five minisymposia on the application of statistics and data analysis to biomedicine and to atmosphere/ocean science, which are areas of great current interest.  This conference series brings together mathematicians, statisticians, scientists and engineers in an environment where significant interaction and cross-fertilization takes place. More information can be found on the conference website http://m.njit.edu/Events/FACM15/.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The FACM conference series has been organized over the past eleven years by the Department of Mathematical Sciences and Center for Applied Mathematics and Statistics at NJIT. The annual meeting is a forum for the dissemination of research in applied and computational mathematics and statistics.  FACM conferences are more intimate and student centered than large society meetings, and a goal of the organizers is to introduce future leaders of applied mathematics to established investigators and emerging research areas. Participation among graduate students and postdocs is greatly enhanced with contributed talks through which they give presentations in minisymposia alongside leading scientists. For students and postdocs, this will be a learning and networking experience that will help them with their research and career paths. Special efforts will be made to continue the participation underrepresented groups in the conference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The conference Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics 2015 was held at New Jersey Institute of Technology, in Newark, on Friday June 5th and Saturday June 6th, 2015.  The conference was hosted by NJITÃ†s Department of Mathematical Sciences and Center for Applied Mathematics and Statistics.  Contributions from all areas of applied mathematics and statistics were welcomed but the main themes of the conference were (i) the dynamics of fluids, broadly interpreted to include active and other complex fluids, biological fluid dynamics, flocking and swarming, and waves in fluids.  (ii)  Numerical methods, in various contexts and applications.  (iii) Applied statistics and biostatistics, including recent developments in big data.  Researchers in these areas addressed the development of mathematical and computational techniques for application to challenging problems.       The conference combined a broad cross-section of participants at different stages of their career paths.  Participants were drawn from universities, government laboratories, and industry, and had a wide range of interests in science, technology, engineering and mathematical fields.  This combination promoted an active cross-fertilization of ideas between researchers with different yet complementary backgrounds and interests.  The conference atmosphere was intentionally kept informal so as to encourage the interaction of students and junior researchers with more established experts in a range of fields.       The conference had one hundred and forty participants.  Four invited, one hour plenary lectures were given by recognized leaders in the conference themes.  Morning and afternoon minisymposia were given in four parallel sessions consisting of talks of either fifteen or thirty minutes.  Many of the more than seventy minisymposium speakers were early-career faculty.  Ohers were postdoctoral fellows and graduate students who were provided the opportunity to give talks in the same session as more established researchers.  Other contributions were given in poster format. There were more than forty poster presentations, of which many were given by graduate students.       More information about the conference together with an archive of previous FACM meetings can be found on the web at http://m.njit.edu/Events/FACM16/archive.html or by links from the NJIT Department of Mathematical Sciences homepage at http://math.njit.edu          Last Modified: 04/04/2016       Submitted by: Amitabha Bose]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
