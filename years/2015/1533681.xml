<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project in the School of Technology at North Carolina A&amp;T State University (NCA&amp;T) seeks to enhance students' knowledge and instruction in technological innovation using a project-based approach. This training program will be integrated as part of the undergraduate and graduate courses in innovation and technology management while preparing students for the Ph.D. program in Technology Management which is offered at NCA&amp;T through a consortium of five other universities. Undergraduate students are involved in the implementation of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of the project are to: create instructional materials for technological innovation in the context of manufacturing and services; incorporate the new content into one new course, one course in the undergraduate applied engineering technology program and one graduate course in the Master of Science in technology management program using project-based learning and case studies; and study the impact of this education and training on students' learning outcomes. Improvements in areas such as higher order cognitive skills, self-efficacy, ease of learning of subject matter, teamwork, and communication skills will be evaluated. The findings of this project will be disseminated and materials will be developed into an instructional package which will be publically available and can be adapted by other institutions to educate and train students in technological innovation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overall goal of this project is to enhance students&rsquo; knowledge and learning about technological innovation and entrepreneurship. New content was developed into one new undergraduate course in Applied Engineering Technology, one graduate course in Master of Science in Technology Management and one cross-listed (undergraduate/graduate) course using project-based learning and case studies. The education and training in innovation and entrepreneurship has two components: the theory section and the practice section. The teaching team provides lectures and teaching materials on technological innovation and related topics. The mentoring team, which is mostly innovators, innovation practitioners and serial entrepreneurs, provides coaching and mentoring to the students. The Improvements in students&rsquo; learning outcomes (higher order cognitive skills, self-efficacy, ease of learning subject matter, teamwork, and communication skills) have been evaluated. A survey instrument is developed to measures students&rsquo; skillsets in technological innovation and entrepreneurship, including risk taking, innovativeness, reactiveness, performance, appearance, social, and decision-making skills. The relationship between student skillsets in entrepreneurship and project performance has been examined through relating students&rsquo; entrepreneurship skills to their project performance in multiple courses. The relationship between innovation and risk management has been investigated, and capabilities have been identified that improve both organizational innovation and responsiveness to disruption.

This mechanism promotes synergies among key stakeholders involved in the process of innovation, which greatly enhances the technological capability and economic development of the region. Furthermore, because a critical issue in STEM education is how to train and educate students who know how to innovate and translate technologies to market, the broader outcome of this effort would be to educate professionals in a variety of STEM fields who are knowledgeable about the process of innovation, which help empower HBCUs to be leaders in the area of innovation and technology transfer. This in turn, will directly benefit the nation&rsquo;s pipeline of STEM graduates who are knowledgeable about innovation, which directly benefits the nation&rsquo;s well-being and economic prosperity.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Yi&nbsp;Cai</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533681/1533681_10374505_1603326222514_imagejpeg_0--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533681/1533681_10374505_1603326222514_imagejpeg_0--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project students won First Prize in Aggie Student Innovation Showcase at NC A&amp;T"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533681/1533681_10374505_1603326222514_imagejpeg_0--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project students won First Prize in Aggie Student Innovation Showcase at NC A&amp;T"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">In April 2019, a student team who received innovation and entrepreneurship training in the project won the First Prize in Aggie Student Innovation Showcase at NC A&T with a prototype of road condition monitoring device.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yi Cai</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yi&nbsp;Cai</div> <div class="imageTitle">Project students won First Prize in Aggie Student Innovation Showcase at NC A&T</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533681/1533681_10374505_1603326405609_Picture--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533681/1533681_10374505_1603326405609_Picture--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project student developed virtual reality training module for manufacturing education and training"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533681/1533681_10374505_1603326405609_Picture--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project student developed virtual reality training module for manufacturing education and training"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">In 2020, a student who received innovation and entrepreneurship training developed a virtual reality module for education and training of manufacturing processes in a collaborative project with Iowa State University.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yi Cai</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yi&nbsp;Cai</div> <div class="imageTitle">Project student developed virtual reality training module for manufacturing education and training</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
