<AbstractNarration>Plants form the basis of most terrestrial food webs, and insect pests consume more plant tissue than all other animals combined. Thus, understanding how plants defend against insect pests is crucial to maintaining important ecosystem services and food production. Compared to old leaves, young leaves are often more valuable to future plant success as well as more nutritious and desirable to insects, but younger tissue may have more defenses against such attack.  The mechanisms of plant growth alone might explain this pattern, or it could be an evolutionary adaptation to protect against pests. A series of experiments will test the alternate explanations of growth physiology alone or with defense response using populations of plants that have evolved separately under either low or high levels of insect attack for the last 400 years. The work will incorporate the contributions of undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will examine a cornerstone of research on plant-insect interactions, the optimal defense theory, which predicts that herbivory selects for young tissues to be better defended than old tissue. However, physiological constraints, as opposed to adaptive responses to selection imposed by herbivory, could lead to the same patterns. In this proposal, I aim to advance understanding of what drives young leaves to be so highly defended by disentangling whether adaptive evolution or physiological constraints drives differences in allocation in defense. To test the alternate hypotheses of physiological constraints versus adaptive evolution, a rigorous new framework of optimal defense will be developed that requires tests of defense to: (1) include root tissue, (2) directly measure relative tissue values, and (3) evaluate how these values change through a growing season. The framework will be tested using an intraspecific comparison between plant populations that predictably vary in their risk of attack (by using European and North American maternal lines of Verbascum thapsis) for specific tissues using pot experiments and measures of tissue value (tissue removal and seed output) and chemical defense allocations.</AbstractNarration>

Thus, understanding how plants defend against plant-feeding insects is crucial to maintaining important ecosystem services and food production.  The optimal defense theory is a cornerstone of literature on how plants defend against insect attack. One notable prediction of this theory is that young leaves should be better defended than old leaves, both because they are more valuable to future reproduction as well as more vulnerable to attack if undefended.  While we find that this prediction is true in many diverse plant species, what drives this pattern remains unclear. Optimal defense theory predicts young leaves are better defended than old leaves because of evolutionary adaptation. Compared to old leaves, young leaves are often more valuable to future plant success as well as more nutritious and desirable to insects, and plants should evolve to best protect leaves that are most valuable and/or at highest risk of attack.

For example, the concentration of defenses may decrease as a leaf expands and ages, such that although old leaves possess the same total amount of defenses as young leaves, they are spread over a greater area. How then do we disentangle between these two processes?  Here, I used the knowledge that plants often face higher risk of attack in their native than in their introduced range, and that the value of a specific plant tissue (i.e., young leaf, old leaf, or root) changes across the growing season. I combined this knowledge to present a framework for more rigorously testing the predictions of optimal defense, such that tests can disentangle the influences of (1) adaptation to herbivory, and (2) innate plant physiology.  I then used Verbascum thapsus, a common invasive weed in North America, to rigorously test the predictions of my optimal defense framework.  In line with past tests of optimal defense, my data matches the prediction that young leaves should be better defended than old leaves. However, we found that V. thapsus failed to express the more nuanced differences in defense allocation that optimal defense would predict given variation in tissue value and risk of attack. For example, when leaves, especially young leaves, are least valuable at the end of the growing season they became better defended, not less well defended as optimal defense would predict.  In addition, populations that have historically experienced a low risk of attack often expressed higher defense, not lower defense.  We also found that dilution of defense with leaf expansion explained some, but not all, of the observed variation in defense allocation.  Thus, while adaptation to herbivory (i.e., optimal defense) and dilution of defense with leaf expansion (i.e., plant physiology) have historically been posed as the two main explanations for why young leaves may be better defended than old leaves, we found that defense allocation was not fully explained by either. Our findings therefore challenge traditional assumptions by suggesting that other, yet unrecognized, factors are playing an important role in how plants defend against insects.  Overall, our findings are influential because they suggest that plants may not always be able to evolve optimal allocation of defense (as often assumed), and that evolution may instead be constrained by plant physiology or by other, yet unrecognized, factors.  This has important consequences for understanding whether specific plant species will be able to evolve in response to shifts in their insect community, as will become increasingly common in today's world of rapid environmental change.   Finally, I used this project as a platform to promote diversity within the sciences and to share my passion of scientific inquiry through my love of mentoring.  I worked with Colorado State University to sponsor eight undergraduate mentees, most of whom were from traditionally underrepresented or at-risk backgrounds.  Four of these students took responsibility for their own independent project and helped me to achieve a greater understanding of my research question than I would have attained on my own.  I continue to keep in close contact with my undergraduate collaborators, many of whom have continued into science-related careers.
