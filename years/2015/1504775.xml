<AbstractNarration>The Computer Science Living-Learning Community for Women (CS-LLCW) at Rutgers University will help address the need for a diverse computer science (CS) workforce.  While CS enrollments have risen substantially in the last five years, and degree production has increased by a double-digit percentage each year from 2010 to 2013, the percentage of graduates who are women remains low (around 14%).  The low participation of women in CS negatively impacts the diversity of the computing workforce and the level of technical innovation possible in computing focused organizations.  The CS-LLCW project will address this issue by developing a CS Living-Learning Community (LLC) for women that will provide an immersive educational experience and will enhance the recruitment and retention of women in CS.  Building on existing research on LCCs in other fields, on broadening participation in computing, and on best practices for CS education, this project will adapt successful practices to CS, develop new research to understand the effectiveness of LLCs, and provide a model for building capacity nationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's research hypothesis is that first-year women college students who are interested in CS, and who participate in the LLC, will be more likely to declare a CS major than those do who not participate in an LLC. Further, among women CS majors, LLC participants will exhibit substantially higher levels of engagement and success throughout their undergraduate years in comparison to their non-LLC peers.  In order to study research questions that address this hypothesis, the project will implement and study an LLC for Women in Computer Science at Rutgers to provide mentoring, peer support and exposure to the issues and applications of CS to two cohorts of women students with the goal of increasing their motivation to persist, thrive, and succeed in CS. The long-term goal of this project is to establish best-practice approaches to engaging students in CS during their early years in college. Once established and validated, other institutions will be able to adopt these approaches. Ultimately, the project will help diversify the computing workforce by inspiring and motivating new generations of students to pursue degrees in CS.</AbstractNarration>

The first cohort of students started in the 2016-2017 academic year.  The project studied the first three cohorts of students through the end of the 2018-2019 academic year.

CERP results also revealed challenges in sustaining students' confidence in their computing abilities and help students feel welcomed and supported within the broader computing department, with both the LLC participants and the comparison group showing a decrease in these over the course of the year, something that warrants further study.  Although it is too soon to see majors at graduation for our participants (and indeed, at Rutgers, students frequently do not declare their majors until fairly late in their studies), initial data suggests that, as the end of the 2018-2019 academic year, the second and third cohorts of LLC participants are pursuing the CS major or minor or the computing-related Information Technology and Informatics (ITI) at a higher rate than its comparison groups (though it is too soon for cohort three to have declared their major).  We note that the first cohort had a lower rate of students choosing computing majors (with only 71% choosing computing majors), which we believe was due to lack of clarity about the purpose of the program in our recruiting of the first cohort, and we adjusted for future cohorts.  For cohort 2, 71% of the LLC participants have declared a computing major or minor vs. 50% in their comparison group; an additional 24% of the LLC participants are making progress consistent with a CS or ITI major, for a total of 95% of the cohort 2 LLC participants appearing to be on track for a computing major.  The long-term goal of the project is to establish best-practice approaches to engaging students in CS during their early years in college.  Based on the outcomes to date, Rutgers plans to continue running the CS LLC indefinitely, while continuing to measure and improve the program.  It is our hope that this approach will be adopted by other institutions and that the Rutgers CS LLC and similar programs will help diversify the computing workforce by inspiring and motivating new generations of students to pursue degrees in CS and careers in technology broadly defined.
