<AbstractNarration>SES-1560544&lt;br/&gt;Joseph Galaskiewicz &lt;br/&gt;University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most scholars who study inequality focus on household income and wealth.  This is obviously important.  But families' life chances are also affected by where they live and how well they are able to access what they need.  Neighborhoods matter.  Research has documented how living in racially segregated communities, areas of concentrated poverty, and areas which are crime ridden place residents at an extreme disadvantage.  Past research shows the reason for these conditions is there are not organizational resources in these communities that can provide families basic services, e.g., supermarkets, clubs, churches, banks, restaurants,and pharmacies.   The purpose of this research is to understand why establishments locate where they do and if social factors (e.g., race/ethnicity, social class, crime), market forces (e.g., competition, housing prices, consumer demand), or political factors (e.g., planning) matter more.  Also, because the study period includes the Great Recession, it is possible to see how extreme conditions impacted neighborhoods' stocks of organizational resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research posits that residents' well-being is a function of their spatial capital.  That is, do they have the ability to access locally the organizational resources they need?  Access is a function not only of families' financial and cultural capital, but also their proximity to organizational resources, location in the transportation grid, control over spatial technologies, and social traits that allow them to gain access to facilities they seeks.  However, this study recognizes the need for a better understanding of the organizations and their movement across the metroscape. The research seeks to answer two research questions.  First, what causes establishments to locate where they do in the metropolitan community?  What leads to births and growth?  What leads to deaths and decline?  The study focuses on planning and zoning initiatives by government, ecological processes, e.g., competition among organizations and forms, and community context particularly crime.  Second, what can we learn about neighborhood resilience from one metropolitan area?s experience with financial meltdown?  This project will collect data which complements ten years of research on tens of thousands of establishments and their location in the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale urbanized area.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study has broader significance, because families' access to different types of activities is important for children's educational, emotional, and social development, yet not all children have equal access to high quality programs, activities, and opportunities.  There is a spatial mismatch between supply and demand.  By focusing this research on the supply side of the market, the investigator hopes to gain a better understanding of nonprofit, for-profit, and government behaviors.   Research outcomes could potentially inform policy makers on how to motivate providers to locate/stay in under-served areas or to empower families to advocate for and provide these services. The research furthers NSF?s mission of supporting basic research and using that knowledge to improve the human condition.  While most recognize that extreme inequality is not a desirable state, we do not know what to do about it.  While it may not be possible to redistribute wealth equitably, there should be ways of making organizational resources more spatially accessible so that all residents have a chance at a healthy, happy, and prosperous life.  This research contributes to the basic knowledge necessary to address these issues.  The research also contributes to several fields of inquiry and hopefully will stimulate further research in sociology, urban planning, geography, urban economics, transportation studies, and spatial science (GIS).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our goal is to answer two major research questions.  First, what causes establishments to locate where they do in the metropolitan community?  Does location affect the likelihood of births and growth?  What leads to organizational deaths and decline?  Our focus is on planning and zoning initiatives by government, ecological processes, e.g., competition among organizations and forms, and community context particularly crime.  Second, what can we learn about neighborhood resilience from one metropolitan area?s experience with financial meltdown, the Great Recession?  However, before we could answer these questions we needed funds to collect more data which complements ten years of research on tens of thousands of establishments and their location in the Phoenix urbanized area which was funded by NSF since 2003.  During the project period we first created a data file that identified congregations in the Phoenix urbanized area for the years 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2013.  There were approximately 2,000 to 3,000 congregations in the Phoenix area in each year.  We had to code their denomination and identify their location.  We then tracked these congregation across time and space over the ten year period.  We also coded the congregations that dissolved and those that were born.  This happened in different parts of the city over time.  The task was very challenging because congregations often change names or have the same names, e.g., Church of Christ.  The smaller congregations also move a great deal often located in shopping malls, hotels, or even other congregations.  Our next goal is to explain the organizational demographic shifts in the various neighborhoods and suburbs of Phoenix, since now we have the data to do this.  In the same project period we also created a data file that identified schools in the Phoenix Urbanized area for the years 2003, 2007, 2009, and 2016.  There were approximately 1,000 to 2,000 K-12 schools in each year.  Here we coded their grade levels, their status (district, charter, private, parochial), their location, and their parent organization (school district, management company, sponsoring congregation, etc.)  As with congregations, we were interested in closures and opening, and where schools moved.  Again, there were problems with name changes which made it difficult to track schools over time.  However, schools, unlike congregations, were much less likely to move or close.  Again, our goal is to explain the organizational demographic shifts in the various neighborhoods and suburbs of Phoenix, and, again, we have the data to do this.  Finally, we wanted to gather information on neighborhood crime, because we suspected that this both causes shifts in demographic patterns as well as is affected by organizational demographics.  The relationships between crime and the types of organizations present in the community has surprisingly received little attention.  We were able to collect crime data on the various cities and municipalities in the Phoenix metro area for 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2013, but we were unable to get precinct, track, or block level data on crime from local chiefs.  Hopefully, we will be able to get these data in the future after local municipalities digitize the point data they have on crime.
