<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET), Professor Lisa Holland of West Virginia University is developing new materials for protein separations to elucidate the subtle changes in biomolecules for applications ranging from screening enzyme inhibition to identifying post-translational protein modifications.  To meet this challenge, self-tuning phospholipid nanophases are adapted to sort, screen, or identify specific properties of biomolecules. The broader impacts are addressed through the support of the professional development of chemistry graduate students who participate in innovative and interdisciplinary research experiences earning PhD degrees and ultimately entering the workforce with the ability to work across scientific disciplines. The award also supports an outreach activity to personalize chemistry experiences and to increase public science literacy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focusses on thermally reversible phospholipid nanophases that have high utility as a chemical sieving agent and as a viscosity additive to exploit shape-based differences in frictional drag. Various additives to tune protein selectivity are examined.  The project establishes the conditions and fundamental properties of the nanophases for protein sieving and multifunctional separations. An outreach program developed by Professor Holland at area schools enables teachers to incorporate low-cost microscale experiments into introductory chemistry education. The products are made accessible to other teachers by documenting inexpensive device design, engaging educational suppliers, developing the curriculum, and reporting the educational assessment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award contributed to broader chemistry intellectual outcomes through the development of new separation media for proteins.  Separation technologies are essential to elucidate the subtle changes in biomolecules for a host of applications such as biomolecular affinity, enzyme activity, or to differentiate post-translational protein modifications. The project leveraged phospholipid nanophases for biomolecule separations as they are novel materials that are compatible with proteins.  This maintains the protein function and is particularly useful for enzyme and antibody separations.  The nanophases, which are made from commercially available phospholipids, self-assemble to form structures that can be used directly as the separation medium or can be further modified with other reagents.  This enabled the development of nanophase additives and surface modifications for protein separations.  In addition, nanophases that formed gels were used to support molecular sieving.  Moreover, nanophases enabled improved separations of heterogeneous protein standards and of protein mixtures.  These results are significant because nearly every bioanalytical investigation requires that the selectivity of the separation medium is tailored to sort, screen, or identify specific properties of biomolecules.     This award also contributed to broader chemistry educational outcomes through the development of a low cost handheld device for personalized chemistry experiments.   A handheld device was cast or 3D printed to teach chemical principles.  Stoichiometry, ideal gas law and limiting reagent are challenging principles for students to conceptualize in introductory chemistry.  Experiments were developed that utilized food grade reagents to create a safer chemistry experience and to eliminate the need for students to use the devices in a traditional teaching laboratory.  Using food-grade baking soda, vinegar, and carbonated water as reagents, the students were engaged in a hands-on learning experience.  The baking soda and vinegar were the source of sodium bicarbonate and acetic acid which were combined in a 1:1 mole ratio to form carbon dioxide gas which was then quantified using the device, thereby illustrating the ideal gas law.  Experiments were devised to support learning outcomes that involved using the ideal gas law for the conversion of moles and volume, balancing chemical equations, quantifying the amount of product generated from a known amount of reactant, conveying measurement uncertainty, and postulating sources of experimental error.  These results are significant because low-cost microscale experiments for introductory chemistry empower teachers to personalize chemistry experiences and to increase public science literacy.
