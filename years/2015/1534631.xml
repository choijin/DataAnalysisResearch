<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports development of a nanoparticle characterization instrument that will fill the critical unmet need to rapidly and accurately measure the size and distribution of nanoparticles from 30 nanometers to 1 micron. Initially the technology will target two applications: protein aggregation in biopharmaceuticals, and nanoparticles in medicine (e.g., tumor-targeted drug delivery). The importance of nanoparticle analysis, however, goes well beyond therapeutics. Currently the market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation across the life sciences is $5.6 billion, and there are increasing concerns about nanoparticles in consumer products such as food and cosmetics, as well as in drinking water, effluents, and the environment. A major challenge in understanding the health impacts of nanoparticles is simply in accurately and easily detecting their presence and size distribution. Additionally, improved nanoparticle instrumentation will enable new discoveries in biotechnology and environmental and health sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This challenge can be met by developing a practical method for counting and sizing submicron particles in polydisperse mixtures. NSF Phase I/IB funds supported development of a prototype instrument that detects individual nanoparticles and accurately measures their size, at very high count rates. This instrument has successfully demonstrated robust detection of individual particles as small as 60 nm in diameter at rates approaching 10,000 particles per second, and has already begun to deliver useful information to particle manufacturers in the pharmaceutical industry, with on-going measurements of actual customer samples. The Phase II support will considerably enhance the utility of this instrument by addressing several outstanding technical challenges; most significantly, by extending the range of detectable particles to span the full range from 30 nm to 1000 nm, and by further maximizing the range of measurable particle concentrations.  In addition, the Phase II work will drive significant improvements in functionality and ease of use, driven by innovations in its control software. Finally, the instrument will be further validated using a wide variety of particle types relevant beyond the pharmaceutical space.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Spectradyne<sup>(R)</sup>, a scientific instrumentation company based in Torrance, California, used its NSF SBIR funding to develop and commercialize a technology called Microfluidic Resistive Pulse Sensing (MRPS<sup>TM</sup>). MRPS enables high resolution size and concentration measurements of complex nanoparticle mixtures. The technology is implemented through a benchtop nanoparticle analysis instrument called the nCS1<sup>TM</sup> (Figure 1) and associated consumable cartridges (Figure 2).</p> <p>MRPS is an electrical detection method and works by measuring resistance pulses as a nanoparticle-containing liquid flows through Spectradyne's microfluidic cartridges. Each nanoparticle causes a resistance pulse as it flows through a nanoconstriction in the cartridge, while other features in the cartridge optimize the fluidics and prevent blockages from occurring. Because MRPS counts and sizes nanoparticles individually, it has superior resolution and sensitivity compared to incumbent optical detection methods such as Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA). This is important because a key part of drug formulation development is the assessment of particle content and, increasingly, manufacturers and researchers are interested in sub-micron particles.</p> <p>Through the course of its SBIR-related work, Spectradyne developed the ability to measure from 50 nanometers to 10 microns, at concentrations of 1x10<sup>4</sup> particles/ml to 5x10<sup>11</sup> particles/ml, as shown in the cartridge map in Figure 3. Each measurement uses only 3 microliters of sample, far less than is typically required by other metrologies. The low sample volume requirement means that researchers can accomplish more measurements with less drug product, which is often extremely precious during formulation development. MRPS can also measure any nanoparticle material, be it conductive or dielectric, transparent or opaque.</p> <p>An example of a measurement of a polymeric nanoparticle formulation, used in a drug delivery application, is shown in Figure 4. In this example a five-step dilution series was executed on the 65 nanometer polymeric nanoparticles while a control population of 150 nanometer polystyrene beads was spiked in as a control, at the same concentration each time. The inset of the Figure shows the excellent linearity of the concentration measurement, while the overlap in the 150 nanometer bead measurements confirms the high level of reproducibility across the five analyses.</p> <p>The fact that MRPS analyzes particles individually, electrically, means that highly polydisperse mixtures can be analyzed without loss of sensitivity. This is critically important for the accurate analysis of biological nanoparticle samples, such as extracellular vesicles and exosomes, which are often considerably complex: successful nCS1 measurements have been done on serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and cell culture media with high accuracy.</p> <p>Figure 5 shows an example of the enormous measurement range of MRPS. In this experiment, a polydisperse mixture was accurately analyzed from 65 nanometers up to 6 microns, and over nine orders of magnitude in concentration. Such a measurement is not possible with other methods.</p> <p>Nanoparticles in a drug product may be desirable, as in the case of viral vectors being used to improve drug delivery to a tumor. Or they may be undesirable, as in the case of protein aggregates. Either way, superior measurements of size and concentration allow for faster, cheaper formulation development because decisions can be made earlier in the process, with more confidence, so that time and money are not wasted on losing formulations. An example of this point is seen in Figure 6, which shows a protein aggregation measurement on four samples of a biologic with different levels of stress. As expected, higher stress leads to more aggregates. The inset illustrates that the smallest size range (R1 in the Figure) exhibits a much larger change in aggregate concentration, earlier in the analysis, than does the larger size range. This makes natural sense--because all large aggregates were once small aggregates--but the nCS1 quantifies the phenomenon and gives researchers an easy way of comparing formulation quality.</p> <p>Through its SBIR project, Spectradyne developed not only the nCS1 and its cartridges, but measurement protocols and sample prep procedures. Software was also refined so that size distributions are reported in real time, and concentration and noise analysis can be done easily. The nCS1 is now being used across many areas of the pharma industry, from studies of protein aggregates to pharmacokinetic studies of nanomedicine carriers, from biomarker discovery to gene therapy.</p> <p>The high sensitivity, high resolution, and low volume requirements of MRPS help pharmaceutical researchers to obtain better information about their formulations faster than is otherwise possible. Customers of Spectradyne improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their formulation development. As MRPS technology is deployed more widely, it stands to become a platform technology enabling better control and use of nanoparticles across the life sciences.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/22/2020<br>      Modified by: Jean-Luc&nbsp;Fraikin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1534631/1534631_10386936_1570057542079_nCS1picture--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1534631/1534631_10386936_1570057542079_nCS1picture--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1534631/1534631_10386936_1570057542079_nCS1picture--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The nCS1 instrument.
