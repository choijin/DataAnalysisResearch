<AbstractNarration>Non-technical description&lt;br/&gt;This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR* Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) involves researchers from three New England states: New Hampshire (NH), Maine (ME) and Rhode Island (RI). The research team will develop and test a framework for engaging stakeholders in understanding how the multiple functions of dams are impacted by the outcomes of management decisions. The project is led by the University of New Hampshire (UNH) in partnership with Keene State College (KSC), the University of Rhode Island (URI), Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), and the University of Maine (UM). The research team will develop role-play simulations and design charrettes to foster dialog among stakeholders with diverse perspectives. The interdisciplinary Science, Technology, Art, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEAM) research activities will be integrated with training and leadership development of 12 early-career faculty, two post-docs, two research staff, and 13 graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;The RII Track-2 FEC project will address two overarching and interrelated questions: 1) What are the major trade-offs, thresholds, and feedbacks among ecosystem services for different dam management options? and 2) How does collaborative knowledge production influence scientific understanding about dam SES, and the use of science in dam decision making? Research topics include fish migration, nitrogen flux, energy economics, media discourse analysis, choice experiment surveys, and multi-criteria decision models.  This project will contribute to sustainability science through coupling biophysical and socioeconomic research with mixed-methods social science research to understand the roles of knowledge systems in decision processes. The team will investigate the dynamic behavior of dams in the context of coupled social ecological systems (SES) and the multiple functions of dams (e.g. ecosystem services, water storage, flood control, hydroelectric power generation, and recreation). The number of high-hazard dams in New England coupled with their significant clean energy role will provide a basis for hypothesis testing and delineating the consequences and trade-offs of rehabilitating, restoring, rebuilding, removal, decommissioning, or other alternative dam futures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Hydropower is a major source of renewable energy in New England, where more than 50 dams are scheduled for relicensing in the next decade, requiring communities to make critical decisions about aging infrastructure. Mill dams no longer provide energy but are iconic of New England&rsquo;s industrial history and continue to provide recreational, water supply, and aesthetic benefits for communities. Concerns about fish passage, safety issues, water quality, and other issues place constraints on decisions to remove, relicense, or retrofit dams. Decisions about the future of dams must be made thoughtfully, integrating environmental, social, and economic tradeoffs among ecosystem services such as energy production, migratory fish populations, water quality for safe drinking water, recreational activities, and cultural uses.</p> <p>The Future of Dams was a five-year project led by the University of New Hampshire with partners at the universities of Maine and Rhode Island, Keene State College, and the Rhode Island School of Design.&nbsp; Scientists, engineers, economists, and artists collaborated with stakeholders such as property and dam owners, municipal officials, non-governmental organizations and community members to co-produce innovative, interdisciplinary research that helps society make evidence-based decisions about dam management.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual merit: </strong>We developed new approaches for using science in decision-making and made our decision-support tools publicly available. These innovative approaches will be useful to scientists, engineers, government agencies, stakeholders, and community members facing the multi-faceted problems of aging dam infrastructure that has significant ecological impacts.</p> <p>We produced regional and watershed-scale decision-support tools to help stakeholders make better, cost-effective decisions. Using a vast dataset including metrics on dam utilities, freshwater flow, and fish migration, we created a series of specific, realistic future scenarios that align with a broad diversity of stakeholder preferences, from ecological restoration by dam removal to mixed approaches that emphasize a balance between restoration, renewable energy production, water storage, property values, and river recreation. Our integrated modeling framework is a powerful method to help stakeholders understand water-energy-fish interactions and related economic and social impacts under alternative dam decision scenarios. We developed a web application for our participatory multi-criteria decision-support tool for small-to-medium scale hydropower dams to elicit stakeholder preferences for 12 decision criteria and five decision alternatives.</p> <p>We created the online New England Dams Database, with over 80 attributes, and a digital and printable Dam Atlas of Southeast New England to advance regional knowledge by providing quantitative rankings and visual tools that decision makers and the public can use to understand, describe, and manage site-specific and regional scale social, physical and ecological attributes of dams. We developed and are commercializing close-range remote sensing methods to evaluate ecosystem changes associated with dam removal using small unmanned aerial systems which can provide a high-resolution landscape perspective of how streams change over time.</p> <p>We have produced 33 peer-reviewed journal publications to date, including 11 multi-state collaborative efforts; six more are in review and 18 manuscripts are in development. We produced three technical reports, three conference proceedings, one book, and one book chapter.</p> <p>&nbsp;New awards totaling $54,402,893 will advance knowledge gained in this project.</p> <p><strong>Broader impact: </strong>We developed a science-based role-play negotiation simulation and a teaching packet which is an off-the-shelf tool for use in workshop and educational settings. The negotiation simulation is designed to teach stakeholders along cognitive, relational and normative dimensions of learning&nbsp; through role-playing, in which participants experience dam decisions from another stakeholder&rsquo;s perspective, engage in an interest-based negotiation, and work together to develop consensus-based solutions.
