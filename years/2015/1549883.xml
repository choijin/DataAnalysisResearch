<AbstractNarration>In the study of many large systems that evolve through choices made by many individuals over time, mathematical relationships have found to appear that are very similar even in different applications. These relationships are often in the form of so-called scaling laws, giving an algebraic relationship between quantities that involves an exponent of one of the quantities that may measure the size of the system. As the system size grows, another system measure will change based on the scaling law. Such phenomena can be viewed as allometric scalings, since allometry has to do with the relationship between growth of parts of an organism and the growth of the organism itself. This project will study scaling laws in electric power distribution networks, and seek to determine whether such laws could be used to design more reliable power distribution systems. The design variables that could be considered include system parameters such as cable properties and structural aspects of the overall distribution network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allometric scalings are nonlinear, power-law relationships that govern system parameters and performance. Inspired by the remarkable allometric scalings in biology, initial work by the PI in collaboration with a colleague at Oxford University has resulted in evidence of allometric scaling in observed data for blackouts in distribution networks. Moreover, the initial work suggests physics and engineering design principles that could explain these scalings and relate distribution network parameters to its reliability in terms of the possibility that customers will be disconnected from the grid. Distribution networks must be redesigned and upgraded to accommodate renewable sources and new loads. The project seeks to establish and apply the new scaling theory to help ensure the reliability of the redesigned distribution networks.</AbstractNarration>
