<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Robert Waymouth of Stanford University is developing new experimental approaches for the electrocatalytic conversion of alcohols into ketones. The conversion of chemical compounds such as alcohols into ketones can form the basis of fuel cells, which are alternatives to conventional power sources. While the alcohol/ketone fuel cells are very attractive, the chemical reaction is difficult. In this project, new catalysts that facilitate such difficult reactions are being developed. This research provides new means for the energy-efficient conversion of chemical fuels into useful forms of energy. Collaborative investigations with Professors Richard Zare and Christopher Chidsey at Stanford  University enhance the experimental and educational infrastructure for energy science and provide faculty, postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students with rich opportunities for education and collaborative research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on homogeneous catalysts bearing proton and redox-active ligands. It is guided by the hypothesis that mechanistic concepts that have been developed for chemical transfer hydrogenation catalysis, such as metal-ligand bifunctional activation of substrates, can be applied to the behavior of proton- and redox-active ligands that are effective in mediating multi-electron and proton transfers.  The experimental approach utilizes homogeneous coordination complexes and seeks to determine the key features of the metal/ligand coordination environments that mediate the hydrogen atom, proton and electron transfer steps in efficient electrocatalytic processes.  The development and application of high resolution mass spectrometry techniques, interfaced to electrochemical cells is an innovative aspect of the experimental plan. These provide new mechanistic insights on the intermediates generated during electrocatalytic reactions.  Broader impacts of this work include new approaches for the energy-efficient conversion of chemical fuels into useful forms of energy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this proposal by Professor Robert M. Waymouth of Stanford University was to develop new strategies for the reversible electrooxidation of alcohols. The long-range objective was to enable the use of alcohols as viable energy storage carriers for electrochemical energy conversion.  Electrochemical energy conversion is an attractive alternative to the combustion of fossil fuels, but the rational design of efficient electrochemical energy extraction chemistries remains beyond our reach due to limits in our understanding of the key steps in these multi-electron and multi-proton transfer chemistries. This proposal was funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of NSF's Chemistry Division (NSF-CHE 1565947).   The scientific objectives were closely integrated with training and education.  Students were encouraged to embrace an interdisciplinary scientific approach to devise new experimental and theoretical approaches, both on their own and through collaborative interactions, to address the central hypothesis of this project:  That the thermoneutrality of transfer-hydrogenation reactions provides a useful paradigm for discovery of reversible electrodehydrogenation catalysts.  The intellectual merit of this project derives from two interrelated intellectual activities: (1) the synthesis and evaluation of homogeneous transfer hydrogenation catalysts that mediate the reversible exhange of hydrogen between alcohols and ketones, and (2) the development of alcohol electrooxidation catalysts using design principles developed from these transfer hydrogenation catalysts.  A key outcome of this project was the demonstration of alcohol electrooxidation catalysts based on both a Ruthenium transfer hydrogenation catalyst and an Iron transfer hydrogenation catalyst.  These results support the guiding hypothesis that transfer hydrogenation catalysts are promising prototypes for electro-oxidation catalysts.  Broader impacts include a new scientific insights on the factors which contribute to the speed and energy-efficiency of electrochemical energy conversion reactions catalyzed by homogeneous transition metal compounds.  This program provided an outstanding opportunity for educating the next generation of scientists in the area of energy science, electrocatalysis and homogeneous catalysis. In the course of this project, students were able to acquire the intellectual and experimental expertise to address a broad range of research challenges in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, electrochemistry and electrocatalysis.  This expertise included the design and fabrication of new electrochemical cells and electroanalytical equipment, the synthesis of new families of coordination compounds and modified electrodes and the application of these complexes and modified electrodes to create new families of electrocatalysts.   Two students received their Ph.D.s during the course of the grant; one of whom also completed a Masters in Chemical Education, focused on the impact of student preparation on the academic performance of first generation and under-represented minority students.
