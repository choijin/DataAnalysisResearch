<AbstractNarration>The growing sophistication of online threats requires that the larger educated workforce understands risks posed by such threats. In recent past, the importance of infusing cyber security concepts in computer science courses has been recognized. This project will explore the viability of an approach that advocates infusion of important cyber security concepts in meaningful context in courses that are part of the general education of undergraduate students across multiple disciplines. Based on a learning sciences informed approach, the project will identify existing courses that provide suitable context for cyber security topics. These courses will range from introductory computing courses to discipline-specific courses in business and public policy colleges at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The relevance of key cyber security concepts in the professional context of various majors will be the primary consideration in identifying courses where these concepts can be infused. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary project team, with considerable expertise in the learning sciences, will work together to achieve this goal. After a rigorous evaluation and refinements, content modules and experiences will be shared with the larger community for dissemination. By developing an effective approach to infuse key cyber security concepts in courses that are part of the general education of all undergraduates, the project hopes to have impact on the education of the workforce of the future.</AbstractNarration>
