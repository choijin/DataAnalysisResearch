<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Masaru Kuno of the University of Notre Dame is developing an instrument and related techniques to conduct chemically-specific single particle infrared absorption measurements.  The development of a single particle mid-infrared absorption microscope advances the ultrasensitive quantitative identification of samples.  Potential uses include the detection of single virus particles, which is an important research topic given its close connection to human health and homeland security.  An outreach program developed by Professor Masaru Kuno for area middle schools allows students and teachers to explore infrared imaging using low cost heat imagers now available for smartphones.  This smartphone application enables the students to explore and see the practical uses of blackbody radiation (light that is emitted depending on a body's temperature).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic science problems to be addressed by Professor Kuno include investigating the intraband and intersubband transitions of individual semiconductor nanostructures.  This research focuses on the use of Single-particle infrared absorption measurements.  Such meansurements are distinguished from existing single particle microscopies in that they operate in the mid-infrared fingerprint region and exceed the optical diffraction limit.  The infrared technique is multimodal and enables both visible and infrared single particle absorption measurements.  The technique is inherently fast and can rapidly acquire large area infrared images (centimeters) as well as spectra.  The infrared absorption measurements can ultimately be applied to specimens under native conditions without the need for additional sample enrichment or purification.  This research is an important  given the potential applications of the materials in infrared photodection.  Potential uses include the detection of single virus particles, which is an important research topic given its close connection to human health and homeland security.</AbstractNarration>
