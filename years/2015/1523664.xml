<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Sarah P. Lawson is "Ecological causes and genetic effects of social plasticity in the small carpenter bee across a latitudinal gradient." The host institution for this fellowship is the University of New Hampshire, and the sponsoring scientist is Sandra Rehan.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;An important research topic in animal behavior and evolution is the shift from solitary to social living.  Both ecological and genetic differences are thought to play important roles in this transition.  Facultatively social organisms are at the transition of solitary to social groups and thus offer a unique opportunity to compare the ecological and evolutionary pressures involved in the onset of social behavior. The small carpenter bees, genus Ceratina (Hymenoptera: Apidae) exhibit a range of behaviors, including maternal care, division of labor, mutual tolerance and kin discrimination, which are often posited as emergent properties of highly social groups, making them an excellent experimental system for this research. In some Ceratina species, these behaviors and the resulting level of sociality vary both between and within populations across a latitudinal gradient. The long-term goal of the research is to determine the social plasticity across a latitudinal gradient in one such Ceratina species, C. calcarata, with the overall objective of providing a unique system for comparing social group dynamics across populations.  These bees are native pollinators and the research results promise important information for local agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fellowship also provides new opportunities for postdoctoral training within and outside the laboratory. Broader impacts include: 1) scientific and leadership training for a member of an underrepresented minority who will gain invaluable field experience working with an emerging model organism for the study of social evolution in a novel environment as well as new techniques in the field of genomics and comparative social evolution; 2) educational outreach through the University of New Hampshire Women in Science Organization by organizing a hands-on lab for students from the local middle school; and 3) collaboration with the Seacoast Science Center to develop a program to encourage girls to explore STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p> <p>One of the major transitions in the evolution of life is the shift for solitary to social groups. To begin to uncover the pressures behind this major transition, we must compare how both ecological and genetic differences explain this shift in life history. Facultatively social organisms are at the transition of solitary to social living and thus, offer a unique opportunity to compare the ecological and evolutionary pressures involved in the onset of &nbsp;social behavior. The small carpenter bees, genus <em>Ceratina</em> (Hymenoptera: Apidae) exhibit a range of behaviors, including maternal care, division of labor, mutual tolerance and kin discrimination, which are often posited as emergent properties of highly social groups. In some <em>Ceratina</em> species, research has shown that these behaviors, and thus, level of sociality, vary both between and within populations across a latitudinal gradient.</p> <p>The long-term goal of this research was to determine the social variation across a latitudinal gradient in one such <em>Ceratina</em> species, <em>C. calcarata</em>. The specific aims of this project were threefold: To determine the social group dynamics across three distinct populations of <em>C. calcarata</em>, to determine the genetic basis of behavioral differences and to explore the origins of division of labor between mother and daughter in this species. We found that across its range <em>C. calcarata </em>has a unique division of labor, where mothers will coerce their eldest daughters to become a worker for the nest. Further investigation led us to discover that the mother creates these dwarf eldest daughters by providing her with less food which contains a high diversity of pollen with low protein quantities. Using food to create division of labor is also observed in other highly social insects, like honey bees, where the workers give the a larva &ldquo;royal jelly&rdquo; to generate the new queen. We were also able to sequence the <em>C. calcarata </em>genome and methylome, which provided the first published bee genome of a subsocial bee. Our results suggested that mechanisms associated with DNA methylation and nutrition were likely involved the in the origins of more complex social lifestyles, further supporting our observations about the importance of food in the development of the dwarf eldest daughter.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts</strong></p> <p>This work provided broad opportunities for training and education and was presented in a variety of formats. With this funding, I was able to attend courses and gain new skills in environmental genomics and training to become a future faculty member. I was also able to present my research at multiple scientific conferences, including the Entomological Society of America, International Congress of Entomology, Animal Behavior and International Union for the Study of Social Insects. While attending these conferences, in addition to presenting my research, I also organized symposia, connected with collaborators and networked with members of my field. This research also provided training for 6 undergraduate researchers in the lab, 4 of which are co-authors on peer-reviewed journal articles.</p> <p>The results of this research were disseminated in a variety of ways. I gave after school presentations to local middle schools with the STEAM Middle School Academy, participated at the annual Women in Science and Technology forum for high school students and connected with students and their parents at the annual Seacoast Science Center BioBlitz. To connect with the local community, I helped organize and present at Pollinator Day. I also helped to create, organize and run the New Hampshire Bee BioBlitz. We invite researchers and the general public for a weekend collecting, pinning and identify native bees. Now in its 4<sup>th</sup> year, we have had over 60 participants collect over 2000 specimens across five families. To reach the general public, I helped to generate data which contributed to the new website http://www.nativebeesofnewengland.com/, which provides an index of the common bees and flowers of New England and participated in the PolliNation podcast run by Oregon State University.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/01/2018<br>      Modified by: Sarah&nbsp;P&nbsp;Lawson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535809210333_ceratinadev3layerbanner(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535809210333_ceratinadev3layerbanner(1)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ceratina calcarata development"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535809210333_ceratinadev3layerbanner(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ceratina calcarata development"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">These images demonstrate the main developmental phases from egg to larva to pupa to adult of the native bee Ceratina calcarata.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Cullen Franchino</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sarah&nbsp;P&nbsp;Lawson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ceratina calcarata development</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535809314970_IMG_3683--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535809314970_IMG_3683--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mother versus dwarf eldest daughter"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535809314970_IMG_3683--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mother versus dwarf eldest daughter"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A side by side comparison of a Ceratina calcarata mother  compared to her worker, dwarf eldest daughter</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sarah Lawson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sarah&nbsp;P&nbsp;Lawson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Mother versus dwarf eldest daughter</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535809416850_Foudningnestfemaleinnest2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535809416850_Foudningnestfemaleinnest2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nest founding"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535809416850_Foudningnestfemaleinnest2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nest founding"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ceratina calcarata mother founding a nest by hollowing the pith from a sumac bush</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sarah Lawson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sarah&nbsp;P&nbsp;Lawson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Nest founding</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535810126154_pheno--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535810126154_pheno--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Phenology of Ceratina calcarata"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535810126154_pheno--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Phenology of Ceratina calcarata"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Phenology of the native bee C. calcarata nesting cycle (May-September) across its range in New Hampshire (black), Missouri (dark gray) and Georgia (light gray).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sarah Lawson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sarah&nbsp;P&nbsp;Lawson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Phenology of Ceratina calcarata</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535810338046_populationdemographics--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535810338046_populationdemographics--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Population demographics"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523664/1523664_10367410_1535810338046_populationdemographics--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Population demographics"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Summary of population demographics across three populations of C. calcarata and C. strenua.
