<AbstractNarration>As the baby boomers enter retirement, medical cost becomes significant. In 2014, health care accounted for more than 20% of US spending. The wearable medical device provides a solution to alleviate this problem since it can sense, process, and transmit biomedical signals and identify abnormal signals using predefined algorithms and signal processing hardware, and call for help when necessary. It is also a critical component for the future unmanned medical nursing system. However, current wearable medical devices cannot perform real-time signal processing and transmission due to the limited battery power supply. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this I-Corps project, the team plans to explore market opportunities of its proposed non-weighted and asynchronous digital circuits in wearable medical devices. The team's proposed technology is based on pulse-based digital neuromorphic circuits and asynchronous radio systems, which replace the conventional multi-bit binary adders and multipliers in linear signal processing and the synchronization process in wireless communication, respectively. The proposed methods provide a low-power and low-complexity solution for digital and radio circuit design. These methods don't require modification of the current digital signal processing algorithm or integrated circuit fabrication technology. This allows the proposed technology to be easily adopted in current designs, extending the battery lifetime of the system, providing more processing capability and enhancing the power efficiency of the radio devices. In addition, the proposed wearable medical device can be extended to entertainment and sports training products, which are also important and promising markets.</AbstractNarration>

The proposed technology of delta-sigma based low power signal processing circuits may have the potential to be commercialized and have the impact on wearable medical sensor applications by extending the battery lifetime. The specific objective of this project includes obtaining information to evaluate whether the proposed technology has enough market value and decide whether at this stage we should put resources on commercializing the technology.

During this project, we have realized that although our proposed technology has the potential to be accepted by the market, especially for elderly people care facilities, the technology itself is not able to support the market unless enough resources are available from the ecosystem, which including reliable algorithm, supports from insurance companies, and other regulation supports. For these reasons, we decide to further investigate the technology and find new ways to link the technology and the market. We have adjusted our research direction that combines the proposed delta-sigma digital circuit with ultra wideband impulse radio to extend battery lifetime of wireless biosensors.   The key outcome of this project is that we as researchers have realized the gap between research projects and the market demands. And learned the tools to guide our future research directions so more practical and valuable research product can be realized.
