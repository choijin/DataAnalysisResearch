<AbstractNarration>The conference "Algebraic and Combinatorial Approaches in Systems Biology" (ACSB 2015) will be held at the University of Connecticut Health Center during May 22-24, 2015.  The primary goal of the conference is to provide a venue for researchers to share recent advances in applications of computational algebra and combinatorics to biology.  The conference will consist of talks by invited speakers, contributed talk,s and a poster session.  This grant helps to defray the expenses of the invited speakers and also to provide transportation and lodging for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and other junior researchers attending the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous two decades have witnessed the emergence and acceleration of a new paradigm in mathematical biology, which employs advanced methods in computational algebra and discrete mathematics toward modeling biological systems. In molecular biology in particular, rich libraries of gene regulation, protein-protein interactions and high-throughput gene expression profiling enable the construction of increasingly granular discrete models, which require the development and analysis of new algebraic and combinatorial techniques.  Whereas traditional methods in mathematical biology benefit from a robust infrastructure of journals, organizations, and conferences, such infrastructure for algebraic and combinatorial biology is still taking shape.  A core objective of this conference is to consolidate the ACSB as a national forum for the presentation, discussion, and integration of current work in the field.  ACSB 2015 will focus on diverse aspects of modeling of molecular networks, in particular gene regulatory networks, with an emphasis on discrete modeling approaches, including stochastic aspects of networks.  In addition to models of specific molecular networks, it will explore questions such as the relationship between network structure and their dynamics and design principles of molecular networks.  Both mathematical and biological aspects of molecular network modeling will be discussed, and the conference will open with talks on both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:  http://acsb2015.cqm.uchc.edu/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The Algebraic and Combinatorial Approaches in Systems Biology Conference (ACSB2015), held May 22-24, 2015 at the University of Connecticut Health Center was supported by Grant# 1503562.  The conference hosted 40 attendees with the award supplementing travel support for 37 attendees.  Of those who received travel support 18 were women, 7 junior faculty, 7 postdoctoral researchers, 7 graduate students, 4 Hispanic, and 1 Black.  Beyond diversity of ethnicity and rank, the conference brought together researchers and educators from different types of academic institutions.  Specifically, 6 attendees from small- or medium-sized institutions and 7 from junior, undergraduate or Masters (no PhDs) institutions were supported.   The conference brought together leading researchers from the biosciences, computer science, mathematics, physics, and quantitative medicine from across the country and from England.  There were 17 talks and 7 posters, spanning approaches for modeling and analysis of biological networks to new practices for undergraduate education.  Highlights include algebraic and combinatorics applications for the identification of cellular changes associated with cystic fibrosis, development of antibiotic treatment plans to reverse the evolution of antibiotic resistance, and the understanding of the impact of microRNAs on minimizing DNA damage from hypoxia.  Of the speakers, 10 were women, 4 junior faculty, 3 postdoctoral researchers, 3 Hispanic, 1 Black, and 2 were from undergraduate institutions.  Of the poster presenters, 3 were female, 2 postdoctoral researchers, and 4 graduate students. ACSB2015 received positive feedback from conference attendees.  Comments from participants include the following. "It was well planned and truly sparked my curiosity in new subject areas." "There was also a very good mixture of talks and breaks so we had time for serious math." "... it was a centralized meeting of a small scattered community &hellip;" The conference website is http://acsb2015.cqm.uchc.edu/.
