<AbstractNarration>1551591&lt;br/&gt;Neimark, Alexander V.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel funds are requested to partially support approximately 25 graduate students and young faculty to participate in the 12 International Conference on Fundamentals of Adsorption (FOA12) in Germany from May 29-June 3, 2016. In order to encourage US participation in this critical conference,funding is requested to partially defray the travel costs of US participants from academia and nonprofit research institutions. The goal is to provide partial support to about 25 US researchers from this grant &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technological advances in energy, biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and environmental applications of adsorption will be facilitated by FOA12 through sharing of new adsorption-related scientific information at the highest level. Additional broader impacts will be associated with the participation of young faculty and graduate students (facilitated by the proposed travel funds), and their exposure to the frontiers of adsorption science and technology in a truly interdisciplinary and international scientific gathering.</AbstractNarration>
