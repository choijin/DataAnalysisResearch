<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on professional networking outcomes among faculty in the geotechnical engineering community which will lead to broader impacts for the nation by improving retention, advancement and scientific collaboration of especially female geotechnical engineering faculty.  Networking improvements will be facilitated by developing a cohesive intellectual community that provides access to mentoring, novel information and new resources, as well as collaboration partners.  Using an intervention into the existing - largely disconnected - scientific community, female faculty will participate in networking workshops, as well as pre- and post-intervention surveys to understand their current networking needs, improvement of their networking abilities over time, and the impact their network ties have on academic collaboration.  The goal of the intervention process is to lower isolation of female faculty in geotechnical engineering by creating and sustaining a supportive national network that drives career success in academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will apply social network analysis and professional development activities to improve networking and collaboration among geotechnical engineering faculty in order to bridge the geographical distance and connectivity gaps faced especially by female geotechnical engineering faculty.  Building on past efforts of NSF and others, the project will create a network that fosters active tie creation and provides access to collaboration opportunities among geotechnical engineering faculty in the U.S.  The intervention into the existing network combines face-to-face networking meetings and virtual networking practices to increase collaboration opportunities.  The core challenges are: (a) how to sustain the attention network, (b) how to maintain strong connections among female faculty in their immediate professional environments and, (c) how to create weak ties that will help them in situations where their strong ties are unable to provide the social support, collaboration and information that they need.  The outcomes of the research will improve the faculty's understanding of the importance of networking, provide opportunities for sustaining collaborative connections with colleagues across the nation, and equip participants with the knowledge and skills to collaborate in a networked world.  The summative evaluation, including a before and after social network analysis, will evaluate the effectiveness of the purposeful interventions into the existing network of mostly weak ties among geotechnical women faculty and recommend promising practices for use in other disciplines where women face similar challenges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The number of women in the geotechnical engineering profession has increased exponentially in the past 30 years. Even so, women only comprise about 20% of the geotechnical faculty in the U.S.  The overarching goal of this project was to build on past efforts and create an enduring network for geotechnical senior and junior faculty that fosters career success and resilience through active network building, mentorship, and connectivity. The project was able to build a greater understanding among GTWF (Geotechnical Women Faculty) of how to develop and maintain a vital community that serves as a resource for support and information, as well as a means to address personal and group challenges in academia, and to equip women and junior faculty with the knowledge, skills and tools necessary to thrive professionally.   The impact of this project includes improved access to mentoring and collegial support for junior geotechnical faculty, increased collaboration across the geotechnical engineering faculty network, and enhanced research outcomes through the development of a more cohesive intellectual community.

More than 25 seed grants were awarded ($5K/grant) to a total of more than 45 faculty in geotechnical engineering to facilitate activities such as visiting with colleagues in different institutions for the exchange of ideas, use of unique laboratory facilities, collaboration on preparing research proposals and designing new courses.  Seed grant activities that promote closer connections and more diverse networks between geotechnical faculty members or with other researchers in other disciplines or sectors (industry, government, or other organizations) were also encouraged.

In order to continue increasing the number of women and the diversity of the profession as a whole, we must:  &bull; Provide more opportunities for women geotechnical faculty and professionals to meet and form relationships with other geotechnical engineers, both women and men.  &bull; Provide more detailed training on the nuts and bolts of network building and maintenance as well as collaboration.  &bull; Provide more detailed training regarding establishing your brand or reputation, including the effective use of social media.  &bull; Critical to these efforts, professional organizations must advocate for greater inclusion of women in professional events as keynote speakers and panelists, as well as supporting balance between work and life and improving opportunities for more accommodations for family needs for both women and men. DFI has made a great start by recognizing that the retention of women benefits the entire profession.
