<AbstractNarration>The proposal seeks to understand and re-design high-temperature water-gas shift (WGS) catalysts so as to avoid the use of chromium (an element with potential environmental and health risks).   Currently, chromium-containing catalysts are used almost exclusively for this important reaction that generates hydrogen from carbon monoxide and water, thereby contributing to a sustainable hydrogen-based energy economy.  The project will utilize state-of-the art catalyst characterization and mechanistic tools to understand the detailed surface reactions that occur under high-temperature water-gas shift reaction conditions, and then propose new formulations based on known properties of potential low-cost substitute materials.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The study will examine both conventional and model HT-WGS catalysts for both their bulk and surface chemical and physical states under reaction conditions.  The PI has many state-of-the-art characterization tools at his disposal that should allow unprecedented insight into the mechanism by which the current chromium-based catalyst functions.  He will then attempt to emulate the properties of chromium by using a novel "controlled synthesis" method that will be employed with various earth-abundant candidate catalyst materials.  The fundamental understanding obtained on the commercial chromium-containing catalyst should provide guidance on the structure, composition and redox properties needed to match the chromium-containing catalyst.  In additional to a suite of spectroscopic tools, the PI will employ standard reactivity testing methods and studies with isotopically labeled species to gain detailed understanding of both the working catalyst composition and the WGS reaction mechanism.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research, if successful in all aspects, could transform the industrial process for HT-WGS while avoiding environmental and health issues associated with the current use of chromium. The project would also contribute to the realization of a sustainable hydrogen economy, which would improve U.S. energy security and help ensure competitiveness of the U.S. chemical industry. From an educational standpoint, the project will train one graduate student and 4-6 undergraduate students. In addition the PI will continue his longstanding involvement in a number of educational outreach programs in the Lehigh Valley area, including the Lehigh University CHOICES program that annually brings middle-school female students to the campus for a day to interact with faculty and students engaged in STEM activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Manufacture of hydrogen is required for production of ammonia that is further converted to fertilizer for the food supply required by humans, as well as chemicals, fuels and pharmaceuticals. The current industrial process for hydrogen production employs a chromium-containing catalyst that speeds up the reaction, but poses environmental challenges since hexavalent chromium is carcinogenic (causes cancer). The objectives of the project were to determine the function of chromium in the hydrogen production catalyst and employ these new insights to rationally design a new non-toxic catalyst.  Employing a modern catalysis research approach to this problem with state-of-the-art instrumentation, it was found that the function of chromium was only to stabilize the catalyst at elevated temperatures and not promote the catalytic reaction. These fundamental insights suggested that chromium can be replaced with an earth abundant non-toxic promoters to thermally stabilize the catalyst.  In the future, thus, it will be possible to replace the toxic chromium-containing catalyst with an earth abundant non-toxic promoter. Society will benefit from such a development since it will minimize society's exposure to carcinogenic hexavalent chromium.  The research project involved the participation of two graduate PD students (one female and one male), an undergraduate student (underrepresented male), and collaborators from other universities (domestic and international). The students involved received skill training in catalyst synthesis, catalyst characterization and catalyst testing. In addition, the students were exposed to lectures on critical thinking, and how to produce effective oral and written communications.   The findings were disseminated in 16 science and engineering conference presentations, with several receiving awards for top presentations, and 6 peer-reviewed publications in high impact journals.
