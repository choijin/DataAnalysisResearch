<AbstractNarration>This project addresses urgent challenges in high confidence validation and verification of automotive vehicles due to on-going and anticipated introduction of advanced, connected and autonomous vehicles into mass production.  Since such vehicles operate across both physical and cyber domains, faults can occur in traditional physical components, in cyber components (i.e., algorithms, processors, networks, etc.), or in both.  Thus, advanced vehicles need to be tested for both physical and cyber-related fault conditions. The goal of this project is to develop theory, methods, and novel tools for generating and optimizing test trajectories and data inputs that can uncover both physical and cyber faults of future automotive vehicles.  The level of vehicle reliability and safety achieved for current vehicles is remarkable considering their mass production, low cost, and wide range of operating conditions.  If successful, the research advances made in this project will enable achieving similar levels of reliability and safety for future vehicles relying on advanced driver assistance technologies, connectivity and autonomy. The project will advance the &amp;#64257;eld of cyber-physical systems, in general, and their lifecycle management, in particular. The validation and veri&amp;#64257;cation theory and methodology for cyberphysical systems will be expanded for uncovering anomalies and faults, especially using comprehensive case-based and optimization-based techniques for test scenario generation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical advances and case studies will contribute to the state-of-the-art in optimal control theory, game theory, information theory, data collection and processing, autonomous and connected vehicles, and automotive control. Sampling-based vehicle data acquisition and vehicle-aware data management strategies will be developed which can be applied more broadly, e.g., to cloud-based vehicle prognostics / conditional maintenance and mobile health-monitoring devices.  Finally, approaches for efficient on-board data collection and aggregation will be implemented in a Cyber-physical system (CPS) Black Box prototype.  The development of a vehicle-aware data management system (VDMS) will be pursued, leading to optimized use of data mining and compression inside the CPS Black Box to aggressively reduce the communication and computational costs. Synergistically with theoretical and methodological advances, automotive case studies will be undertaken with both realistic simulations and real experiments in collaboration with an industrial partner (AVL).</AbstractNarration>
