<AbstractNarration>This proposal will identify the main degrees of freedom of sulfur dioxide (SO2) injections in creating radiative forcing that has the potential to limit the impacts of climate change.  The capability to inject SO2 in the stratosphere will be added to the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM-WACCM), a fully coupled land, ocean, ice, and atmospheric model extending through the stratosphere, which includes full interactive tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry.  The study will derive the most reasonable injection location(s) that can be used as degrees of freedom in a wel-designed geoengineering scenario.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project outcomes report represents projects funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and awarded through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Cooperative Agreement to the University Corporation for Atmospheric  Research (UCAR) for the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  Climate change resulting from anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gas concentrations is one of the greatest challenges facing the world today. Global warming causes 300,000 deaths per year and is affecting 300 million people. Climate change increases the severity of heat waves, flood, storms, and fires.

Estimations state that by the year 2030, climate change will be responsible for as many as 500,000 deaths per year and economic losses of $600 billion per year (Human Impact Report: Climate Change 2009). The research conducted under this award contributed to the development of a climate intervention strategy that could save millions of lives and avoid billions in economic losses if applied intelligently, and in concert with significant mitigation and efforts to decrease greenhouse gas concentrations.   A specialized algorithm was created for an Earth System Model that varies the amount and location of geoengineering &mdash; in this case, injections of sulfur dioxide high into the atmosphere &mdash; that would, in theory, be needed, year to year, to effectively cap global warming. Visiting graduate students had the chance to help evaluate the model and other students will be able to examine the results. The project provided the community with new and comprehensive data sets of strategically geoengineered state-of-the-art climate simulations. Results of the research are an important step towards understanding the bene&#64257;ts, side effects, and risks associated with geoengineering, and supports the continued development of strategies that aim towards reducing risks and uncertainties of a potential future application, which is an essential first step in informing society and decision makers.  Research data communicated to the UCAR Center for Science Education's staff allows them to utilize project results to enhance the public's understanding of greenhouse gas concentrations during tours they perform at NCAR.  A series of papers published in a special issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres details the research findings.
