<AbstractNarration>This award supports the transition of the World Wide Telescope (WWT) project from Microsoft Research to the American Astronomical Society (AAS).  Amateur astronomers support an industry of considerable value and are involved in research through citizen science efforts such as the Zooniverse.  The WWT software provides a uniquely capable platform for involvement of amateur and professional astronomers alike in research, education, publishing, outreach, and communication.  Keeping this package available is a valuable service for the country.  The investment to ensure a smooth transition from its current state of being proprietary, albeit free, to an open source project led by the AAS, is clearly very worthwhile and at the same time extremely cost-effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microsoft supported the WWT software system up until the fall of 2014, when they decided to release WWT to the open source community.  The AAS is keen to assume a leadership role in a project of such evident value, but needs time to arrange for long-term support of WWT in aid of the US astronomical community.  Microsoft funding ended on June 30, 2015, so this project will bridge the gap, although supporting only maintenance activities.  This will ensure both that the WWT remains available to AAS and that the system remains available for existing users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As noted, WWT is currently used widely by many constituencies.  This software has unique capabilities, including the creation of video abstracts for publications.  It is used in many schools, planetariums and museums across the country and the world.  Under a community-driven open source model, these activities will be supported by experts from the respective constituencies, and connections between the various activities can leverage the work in one community for the benefit of all.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ WorldWide Telescope is currently used by astronomers in education, outreach, research, publishing and communication.  On June 30, 2015, Microsoft, who created and supported WWT for the past ten years, finished open sourcing the project and stopped direct support of WWT. The NSF Transition Bridge grant has allowed the existing WWT user community to develop a plan for the continued community-based support of WWT under the leadership of the American Astronomical Society (AAS).  This plan was proposed to the AAS Council at the AAS spring meeting in January of 2016.  The Council voted to accept the proposal and has taken on WWT as a project.  The plan also involved the creation of an organizational structure including a WWT Steering Committee appointed by the AAS Council and Executive Office and a WWT Advisory Board of external partners.   The NSF WWT Transition Bridge grant has ensured that the use of WorldWide Telescope in various aspects of astronomy: research, publication, education and outreach has been able to continue without interruption.  This NSF WWT Bridge Grant was critical to maintain the existing user base through the period following the support of Microsoft and before the support of the American Astronomical Society.  The NSF WWT Transition Bridge grant supported both the development of community-created plan for longer term future under the AAS, as well as short term support of services and developer time to fix bugs and respond to user inquiries.
