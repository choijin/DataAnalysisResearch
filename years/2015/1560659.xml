<AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to explain how rule-based social policy can lead to citizen empowerment. Specifically, this research examines whether the extension of guaranteed public service access to rural-based citizens severs over time the relationship between these citizens and rural political leaders who use clientalistic methods to exert political control. The PI examines the effect of national policies (like the conditional cash transfer Bolsa Familia program in Brazil) affect local politics. This research will collect household survey data on local political attitudes and behavior in Northeast Brazil. The PI collects a targeted stratified sample of 2,040 people in 30 municipalities in three states will facilitate controlled comparisons between the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of national rule-based social programs. The data will be analyzed using a hierarchical regression model to identify (1) whether political relationships, citizen practices and voting behavior are affected by experiences with national rule-based social policies, and (2) to what extent this relationship varies depending on the municipal and state governance context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to understand whether secure access to social policy can turn dependent clients into autonomous and active citizens. It is also designed to help resolve debates about the political effects of rule-based social policy, the project will provide new evidence, tools and datasets to help policymakers understand how policies can shape downstream policy demands and help build effective local democracy. The PI gathers data on citizens' experiences with government, their autonomy and their voting behavior. The PI collects a targeted stratified sample of 2,040 people in 30 municipalities in three states in Northeast Brazil will facilitate controlled comparisons between the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of national rule-based social programs. This data collection strategy facilitates controlled comparisons between the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of national rule-based social programs. List and conjoint survey experiments are performed to uncover sensitive measures such as voting motivations, political autonomy and exposure to clientelism. Inferential leverage will be improved by screening for respondents who are close to the eligibility thresholds for social policy, and by exploiting the fact that some respondents are on waiting lists where they are eligible but have not yet received a benefit. The data will be analyzed using a hierarchical regression model to identify (1) whether political relationships, citizen practices and voting behavior are affected by experiences with national rule-based social policies, and (2) to what extent this relationship varies depending on the municipal and state governance context.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research provides primary evidence that the extension of guaranteed public benefits by Brazil?s federal government over the past decade has empowered voters in local politics and helped to make politics more inclusive and programmatic. While many voters in Brazil?s northeast have been subject to clientelist threats by politicians with monopoly control over public resources, voters who receive the Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia conditional cash transfer ``from Brasilia?? are more confident that government will be responsive, more likely to reject hypothetical offers to buy their votes, and more likely to agree that government is run in the interests of all.  These insights were made possible by an innovative household survey design that sampled 1,881 respondents 27 municipalities in Alagoas, Bahia and Cear&aacute; states. While plans to use a regression discontinuity design on income to identify the effect of Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia were not feasible due to the weakness of compliance around the discontinuity, a secondary inferential method of comparing transfer recipients with those on the scheme?s waiting list permitted identification of the policy?s effects, since both groups met the same eligibility criteria and differ in recipient status only due to idiosyncrasies in timing and implementation.  The survey then used novel conjoint survey measures to measure citizens? expectations about others? attitudes, allowing the team to isolate the mechanism by which policies can shape local politics as a shift in citizens? mutual expectations. Respondents believed that hypothetical voters who received Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia are substantially more likely to vote against clientelist candidates. Since voting against clientelism is a collective action problem in which each wishes to avoid the punishment of voting against a clientelist winner, confidence that other voters will vote for reform can provide a potential route out of the clientelist trap.  However, the survey also revealed that the empowering effects of policy are heavily mediated by the pre-existing content of local politics. Only in Cear&aacute; &ndash; a state with a 20-year history of governance reform &ndash; was the policy able to generate collective confidence among voters that clientelism is unlikely to succeed, to encourage political participation, and to deter voting for clientelist candidates.
