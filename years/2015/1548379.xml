<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The NSF ICSE 2016 Travel Award Program (TAP) helped further the research directions and careers of diverse students and junior faculty members in software engineering at US-based colleges and universities.  Specifically, it supported  38 students and early career faculty to attend the premier research conference in the field of software engineering, the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2016); participate in ICSE 2016?s mentoring, networking, and professional development programs (Doctoral Symposium, New Faculty Symposium, and Student Volunteers); and attend one or more ICSE 2016 workshops and colocated events, which serve as incubators for scientific communities that form and share a particular research agenda.  It also supported a new female faculty member in computer science to attend ICSE 2017 and the ICSE 2017 New Faculty Symposium. Post surveys support that travel award recipients valued the opportunity to: 1. Meet and interact with leading researchers, educators, and practitioners who are pioneering new directions in software engineering research and practice. 2. Gain an appreciation for the norms of the research community, an understanding of challenging research problems, and an understanding of the strengths and limitations of approaches for addressing these problems. 3. Establish a network of researchers and educators with whom they can share ideas and collaborate to contribute to the body of knowledge of software engineering. 4. Present and discuss their research ideas with both their peers and leading researchers in the field. Demographic data shows that  82% of travel award recipients met at least one indicator for broadening diversity; 39% were female; and 51% had never attended a prior ICSE.  Moreover, travel award recipients came from 32 different schools.  37% of travel award recipients reported that they could not have attended ICSE if they had not received a travel award.
