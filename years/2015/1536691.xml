<AbstractNarration>Understanding and predicting spatial patterns of biodiversity and turnover in space and time is central to understanding the interplay between ecology and evolution. Despite the appeal of broadly integrative research programs, advances in biodiversity science have been constrained by the isolation of these fields within biology, as well as between biology and related fields such as geology and climate science. This symposium seeks to identify and broadcast new ways to overcome the challenge of effectively uniting the fields of earth sciences, evolution and ecology through research, teaching, and outreach. Participants will include graduate students, postdocs, and principle investigators associated with the NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity program from the US, and from partner funding agencies in Brazil and China. This meeting will provide a unique opportunity to disseminate new and promising integrative approaches to biodiversity studies, and to brainstorm and discuss the best strategies to educate and train the next generation of integrative scientists. This research is of high priority for developing viable approaches to conservation and sustainability in the neotropics that can be applied in diverse geographic regions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This funding will support the participation of US-based graduate students and postdocs from diverse backgrounds who are conducting cutting-edge research in integrative approaches to biodiversity studies, as well as four undergraduate minority students involved with or interested in similar topics. All student awardees will attend the symposium and be invited to actively participate in the symposium discussions and a joint publication emerging from it. Student posters will be advertised to the symposium audience to maximize their attendance. The poster session will use the scientific networks of our speakers to foster new connections and collaborations between attendees from South America and those from other continents, thereby fostering new scientific links across countries. Local outreach efforts in Brazil will feature new integrative studies that either focus on or encompass tropical biotas, or that develop novel frameworks that can be readily applied to these regions.</AbstractNarration>
