<AbstractNarration>Additive manufacturing, such as 3D printing, enables the realization of complex shapes that are otherwise impossible to manufacture.  The urgent need for maturity and robustness of this technology has rapidly initiated a great deal of research in this area from the engineering community.  There is a need for experts to come together, to share the state-of-the-art in additive manufacturing and discuss advances in the theoretical and predictive simulation tools that can facilitate the development of new materials and products based on additive manufacturing processes.  Additive manufacturing methods have great potential for promoting transformative research in many fields across the vast spectrum of engineering, e.g., advanced manufacturing, biomedical applications, materials design, meta-materials, and energy-absorbing device design.  The U.S. National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics will host a workshop in Washington, DC, on October 7-9, 2015, to address the challenges and opportunities in theoretical and computational methods to advance additive manufacturing in a holistic, multifaceted, and interdisciplinary way. At this meeting, experts from different sectors and industries will share their best practices and ideas.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While workshops on additive manufacturing have been held in the past, this workshop will focus on theoretical and computational approaches.  The accuracy and reliability of these approaches lay the foundation for the predictive characteristics of any modeling techniques spawned from them.  This unique workshop will involve such areas as simulation based engineering and science, integrated computational materials engineering, mechanics, materials science, manufacturing processes, and other specialized areas.  The emphasis will be technical, but it will also address policy, or other issues related to this topic.  The goal of this workshop is to develop an integrated framework or manufacturing methodology for additive manufacturing considering the computational and theoretical approaches and digital materials available.  The current and future trends in theoretical, mathematical, and computational approaches for additive manufacturing processes will be thoroughly investigated and disseminated through the workshop.  A planning committee of six experts appointed by the National Academies will prepare the agenda and identify the speakers.  It is expected that 40 participants will attend the workshop in person and many others via webinar.  The meeting organizers will provide a life webcast of the meeting to the research community and enable community input via web-based tools.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit  AM methods have great potential to transform many fields across the vast spectrum of engineering and materials science, e.g., advanced manufacturing, biomedical applications, materials design, meta-materials, and energy-absorbing device design. This workshop gave researchers in industry, academia, and in the governmental sectors from around the world the opportunity to learn additive manufacturing processes and promote rapid scientific advancement of this subset of processes. The conversation as a whole sparked international collaboration and communication and helped to improve theoretical and predictive simulation tools that facilitate the development of new materials and products. It also helped to elucidate the process mechanics, materials characterization, and key process parameter optimization in order to achieve the desired product performance. Finally, this workshop brought together experts in the field to identify the necessary short-, intermediate-, and long-term goals for a successful future in predictive methods for AM applications. The USNC/TAM encouraged the community to continue hosting workshops and advancing the AM field.    This workshop had a domino effect and motivated others in the community, such as professional societies and national labs, to continue the conversation and advancement of AM. The following outcomes were observed:  1)  The workshop advanced the body of knowledge and practice of AM by addressing the topic using a holistic, multifaceted, and interdisciplinary approach. The diversity of fields and sectors of the speakers considered during the workshop planning was highlighted by the workshop participants.   2)  Dialogue among AM leaders and computational experts was facilitated as they addressed the fundamental questions, barriers and challenges of theoretical and computational tools for AM. Eight discussion questions, identified by the planning committee, focused the conversation and dialogue among the speakers and attendees.   3)  New connections and potential collaborations were established among workshop attendees.   4)  A report on AM that advances the frontiers in theoretical and computational tools was published.  The workshop summary report includes the key discussions and material shared at the meeting. The report can be used as a national reference to advance AM in different sectors and applications, such as government, academia, and private sector. The report has been downloaded over 2,000 times.   5)  The workshop encouraged other organizations and stakeholders to continue the conversation and exchange of ideas through further workshops. One follow up workshop was held in October 2016 in China, and another is being planned in Germany.   Broader Impact  This workshop allowed the development of AM methods, which have great societal impact on an international scale. From airlines and cars to prosthetic limbs, AM methods are changing the way that we live. In promoting the development of AM, this workshop inherently addressed sustainability through lower material consumption, rapid customized healthcare options for amputees and joint replacement patients. The workshop undoubtedly enhanced the infrastructure for research and education by sparking new technical and theoretical knowledge.
