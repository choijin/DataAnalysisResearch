<AbstractNarration>PI: Shah, Sameer &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1541908 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to develop advanced evaluation criteria for peripheral nerve electrodes, which may alter nerve structure, biomechanics and physiological function, using non-invasive imaging modalities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Micro-CT and ultra short echo time MRI (UTE) will be used to study the structure-function effects of cuff electrodes (CEs) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (USEAs) placed on the sciatic nerve between the hip and the knee (mid thigh) of rats. The training received by the graduate student and undergraduate student working on the project at the FDA will be excellent. Each research Objective describes experimental methods involved that would be appropriate for high school students as well as undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
