<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Synthesis Program of the NSF Chemistry Division supports the research of Professor Alison Frontier in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Rochester.  Professor Frontier and her students are developing highly efficient cyclization reactions which are capable of creating compact polycyclic molecules that are difficult to prepare using other synthetic strategies. These chemical methods enable rapid synthesis of complex natural and non-natural bioactive molecules, especially small molecules with properties demonstrated to be valuable in drug discovery efforts. With respect to educational activities, development continues for an educational website ("Not Voodoo"), which is designed as a resource for students beginning independent research in an organic chemistry laboratory. Professor Frontier enriches the site with new resources, and also enhance the experience of visitors by expanding functionality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program involves the study of novel cationic reactivity and the development of efficient and green synthetic methods.  The projects focus on multistep reaction cascades that merge nucleophilic reactivity with cationic electrocyclic reactions, and allow the execution of highly stereocontrolled cyclizations. This research is leading to a richer understanding of redox cyclizations which are initiated by hydride shift, cyclizations coupled to pyridine and furan dearomatization, and the execution of higher-order electrocyclizations, which are virtually unknown reactions. New strategies for achieving enantioselective electrocyclization are also being evaluated. The proposed research is directed toward both exploring new reactivity and the development of efficient, diastereo- and enantioselective methods that rapidly transform acyclic systems into bridged, fused, or spirocyclic small molecules.  The synthetic strategies are efficient and modular, typically carried out in an environmentally friendly fashion.  Small molecule targets of this research  have desirable physicochemical properties and occupy unique chemical space; these features often correlate to bioactivity and meet stated needs for improving the quality of compound collections for use in drug discovery programs. Efforts are also focused on further development of the Not Voodoo website, a resource that serves hundreds of organic experimental chemists each day.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit.  The during this project, we learned to manipulate the key intermediate leading to stereospecific electrocyclization, synthesizing especially reactive acyclic intermediates from simple precursors.  This strategy has led to the development of two different cyclization protocols, both previously either unknown or underappreciated.  Not only do these two reaction classes represent novel modes of reactivity under the umbrella of electrocyclic chemistry, but they are also synthetically valuable transformations. The study of these reaction sequences, which involve unusual reactive intermediates, has also led to the development of novel cationic cascades, including internal redox cyclizations, and new applications of alkynyl halo-Prins reactions. Each method enables the rapid assembly of a different type of 3D small molecule, starting from simple precursors.  Products with carbon-halogen binds, which confer valuable physical properties and reactivity to small molecules, are readily available using the halo-Prins/ halo-Nazarov methods.  Broader Impacts. The new methods developed during the project are expected to simplify the synthesis of targets with unusual, densely functionalized ring systems, The synthetic strategies are efficient and modular, and carried out in an environmentally friendly fashion.  All of these parameters are synonymous with stated needs for the improving the quality of compound collections for use in drug discovery programs.    The project also focused on expanding and improving the Not Voodoo website, a resource that serves hundreds of organic experimental chemists each day; for example, between September  2017 and September 2018 the site hosted ~4300 sessions/ week.  Over the course of the project, a web developer was engaged to rebuild the site to improve website performance and navigation, and function well on mobile devices.  This new build is designated Not Voodoo X.4, and necessitated a complete restructuring of the site.  This upgrade was performed to optimize the utility and performance of the site and also increase its impact, since smartphones and tablets are increasingly used for viewing this type of web content.  Also during this upgrade, I reorganized and expanded some of the most visited pages, specifically the groups of pages on Chromatography, Reagents, and Workup. I also added a new section entitled "Purification," which collects the content on chromatography, crystallization, and (new) pages on distillation techniques.  I began building new pages on reference resources, and expanding the Reagents and Solvents section.              Last Modified: 08/01/2019       Submitted by: Alison J Frontier]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
