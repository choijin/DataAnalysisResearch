<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 14-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world?s major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in this Collaborative Research Action, the partner agencies have provided support for research projects that utilize existing Arctic observing systems, datasets and models to evaluate key sustainability challenges and opportunities in the Arctic region, to innovate new sustainability science theory and approaches to these challenges and opportunities, and support decision-making towards a sustainable Arctic environment.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and end users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anthropogenic Heat Islands in the Arctic ? Windows to the Future of the Regional Climates, Ecosystems and Societies (HIARC) brings together an international team from Norway, Russia, and the United States. The team represents expertise in the climate, societal, political, biomedical, and communication sciences. This diverse group will investigate urban heat islands in the arctic, specifically evaluating how ecosystems and societies adapt to the warmer micro-climates in urban areas. HIARC will use high-resolution in-situ data, satellite imagery, climate data with biological productivity indices, and other sources in order to document and predict environmental changes due to urban heat islands. The investigators will work with and report to a select group of end-users, in addition to disseminating their results through traditional and web-based platforms.</AbstractNarration>
