<AbstractNarration>This AGS PostDoctoral Research Fellow (PRF) award aims to reconstruct the paleo-monsoon of India during the previous 10,000 in order to better understand the variability of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the monsoon-ENSO teleconnection, as well as to evaluate how these mechanisms responded during a previously warm period of Earth's history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrestrial records from the monsoonal region of India indicate that during the mid-Holocene epoch (approximately 5,000-6,000 years ago), climatic conditions were warmer and wetter.  During this time, the northern hemisphere received greater insolation during the summer due to the precessional cycle of the Sun.  However, paleoceanographic evidence of sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) reveal that the tropical Pacific was in an enhanced La Nina-like state at approximately 5,000 years,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to evaluate two competing theories of monsoon climatology.  In one theory, increased insolation strengthened the temperature gradient between the land and the ocean and, as a result, enabled an enhanced summer monsoon.  In another theory, warmer and wetter conditions were due to monsoon-ENSO teleconnections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to develop snapshots of climate fields over the past 10,000 years by combining point-proxy paleo-reconstructions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reconstruct full climate fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the physical mechanisms are different, the mid-Holocene provides a potential analog, in terms of northern hemisphere temperature, to current forecasts of climate.  As such, this project will explore the behavior of ENSO during this time period as a means to promote better understanding of monsoon variability and monsoon-ENSO teleconnections that will aid in monsoon forecasting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts involve supporting an early career scientist and helping advance the basic science of monsoonal atmospheric circulation and their environmental impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The study of paleo-climatology is rooted in the collection of climate proxy records. A single proxy record (e.g., tree ring, lake sediment core, or marine core) typically provides a time series of climate fluctuations (e.g., air temperature, sea-surface temperature (SST), or precipitation) over some past time period at the location the proxy was retrieved. Our global proxy record database is extensive and provides a wealth of information about past climate. Although this information is valuable, it is risky to associate the changes at single location to large-scale climate patterns. Thus, we typically need to combine records in order to answer large-scale climate questions. Not surprisingly however, proxies are irregularly sampled in space and time, which can make it difficult use them in combination.</p> <p>A main goal of this project was to develop robust statistical methods that reconstruct climate changes using multiple records. More specifically, our methods use major patterns of variability in the contemporary record, along with scattered marine proxy records (e.g. Mg/Ca and alkenone-based) that cover the Holocene (past 10,000 years) to reconstruct the evolution of full-field climate variables, such as SSTs, precipitation, and winds (Fig 1, bottom).</p> <p>We applied this reconstruction method to the Indo-Pacific region in order to reconstruct the Holocene Indian summer monsoon (ISM). First, we reconstructed tropical pacific SSTs and winds and found a large-scale increase in zonal winds and cooler SSTs during early Holocene as compared to late (Fig. 2), which is consistent with an enhanced &ldquo;La Ni&ntilde;a-like state&rdquo; during early Holocene that has been cited in paleo-climate literature. Next, we sought to use these reconstructions to answer questions about the ISM during the same time. Land-based proxy records over India generally agree that the ISM was much stronger during early- and mid-Holocene (10-6,000 years ago) than late Holocene and present day (Fig 1, top). The consensus view was that stronger summer insolation during that time increased the land-ocean temperature difference, and enhanced monsoon winds, and thus, precipitation, coming off of the Arabian Sea. However, we also know that, at present, the Indian summer monsoon is stronger than average when the tropical Pacific is cooler than average. We hypothesized that at least part of the enhanced wet signal could have been from a cooler tropical Pacific. To test how much, we used tropical Pacific proxies to reconstruct Indian monsoon precipitation and Arabian Sea winds and found that the cooler Pacific could have contributed about 40-60% of the precipitation cited in land-based proxy records (Fig 3). This technique was a novel way of thinking about this problem that allowed us to separate the influence of the Pacific on the Indian summer monsoon from that of insolation.</p> <p>An extensive proxy record also exists for the Atlantic domain (Fig 4), however, the insolation-driven signal during the Holocene is strong and dominates many of the Atlantic marine proxy records, manifesting as a cooling trend since 10 ka. Instead, to observe millennial-scale variability, we developed a method that removes the insolation trend from each proxy record, thus reconstructing only the variability from the proxy records outside of that from precession. Figure 5 shows maps for every 1000 years from 8 to 2 ka BP that reconstruct millennial scale variability (Fig 5).</p> <p>In a third version of our reconstruction method, we incorporated a Bayesian estimation component, which allowed us to reconstruct ensembles of likely SST fields. These ensembles, which vary slightly from one another, provide a more robust estimate of uncertainty. Reconstructions of tropical Pacific SSTs using the Bayesian methodology show a similar magnitude of cooling the eastern Pacific with errors of about 0.3-0.5&deg;C, which are nearly twice as much as those produced by our original reconstruction model (Fig. 6). We used these spatial reconstructions to estimate each of the four main NINO indices (NINO1+2, NINO3, NINO3.4, and NINO4) with error estimation on each.</p> <p>This research project developed novel methods to reconstruct larger-scale trends and variability using proxy data non-uniformly distributed in space and time, while also investigating climate evolution of the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic domains. The development of the reconstruction models and their applications blended the fields of contemporary climate science, geology, paleoclimatology, statistical data analysis, and archaeology. Part of this research discovered a connection between proxy climate data trends in the northern Arabian sea and archaeological evidence of changes in wind patterns. Unfortunately, our understanding of contemporary climate and long-term trends and variability is constrained by our relatively small observational period (~ 100 yrs of data). Thus, studies that improve upon our ability to utilize proxy records are worthwhile, providing better context of where Earth&rsquo;s climate has gone in the past and informing where it might go in the future.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/14/2018<br>      Modified by: Emily&nbsp;Gill</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1525465/1525465_10403618_1515953681999_1_IndoPac_proxy_map--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1525465/1525465_10403618_1515953681999_1_IndoPac_proxy_map--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Holocene Proxy Records from the Indo-Pacific Region"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1525465/1525465_10403618_1515953681999_1_IndoPac_proxy_map--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Holocene Proxy Records from the Indo-Pacific Region"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(top) Compilation of proxy records in various forms (e.g. caves, lakes, discharge records) that suggest the Indian summer monsoon was stronger during the early- to mid-Holocene.
