<AbstractNarration>The growing hardware security community is faced with an immediate need to develop effective tools and benchmarks. The purpose of this project is to lead a community-wide movement toward stronger assurances in our integrated circuits, computational platforms, and electronics supply chain. Based on the proven effectiveness of information sharing in many communities including crypto and computer-aided design, the PIs plan a significant enhancement and increase in scope of Trust-Hub, a central web-based repository for benchmarks, hardware authentication platforms, evaluation software, source codes, tools, and much more in the area of hardware security and trust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of this project include development of (i) procedures to dynamically generate trust benchmarks with hard-to-detect Trojan instances, (ii) hardware platforms for security validation, (iii) a suite of security metrics, (iv) a suite of ready to apply attacks, and (viii) comprehensive hardware/software validation test suites and data. The results of this project would be of interest to semiconductor companies, US government agencies and university researchers worldwide. Benefits to the society include secure and trustworthy electronics for healthcare, defense, finance, transportation, automotive and other applications. This research will impact the education of students, industry professionals, and government agencies' engineers through courses, online materials, and on- and off-campus seminars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent years, the area of hardware security and trust has seen increasing research activity. A large population of academic and industry researchers have been working on various aspects of hardware security problems. Most research in this area is still carried out in an uncoordinated basis in labs around the world using an assortment of home-grown reference designs, simulation environments, hardware implementations, and results are reported in terms of ad-hoc figures of merit. Thus the effectiveness of these methods is not universally accepted, as they are mostly applicable to some designs, some platforms, or some technologies but not to others.  Based on the proven effectiveness of information sharing in the crypto research and development community, the PIs had previously developed an information hub called Trust-Hub (www.trust-hub.org), a central web-based repository for technical papers in the area of Trojan detection and prevention, tutorials, Trojan benchmarks, source codes, tools, Trojan detection platforms, and any other information that accelerates Trojan detection research. In response to the rapid growth of the hardware security and trust community and the emergence of new security primitives, attacks, and countermeasures, the Trust-Hub team proposes to substantially expand the scope of Trust-Hub to reach out to the much larger hardware security community (Trojans, benchmarks, counterfeit electronics, security primitives, etc.).   The majot tools and benchmarks developed through the course of this project are:   Hardware Trojans and Trust Benchmarks: Although significant progress has been made over the past several years on developing more effective detection techniques, hardware Trojans remain a major research challenge to the hardware security and trust community. Existing efforts show that designs are still vulnerable to many types of Trojans with many researchers continuously developing new detection techniques and new Trojans that are harder to detect.  Physical Unclonable Functions: New PUF designs and protocols have been extensively researched. In addition, the resiliency of PUFs has been tested through the development of new machine learning (ML), side channel (SC), and hybrid (ML+SC) attacks. The community desperately needs publically available tools and metrics to evaluate PUF randomness, reliability in presence of environmental changes (temperature, aging, etc.), and resiliency to such attacks.  Counterfeit IC Detection and Prevention: Counterfeit electronics are a longstanding problem that has recently grown worse. In order to curb the threat of counterfeit electronics once and for all, there is a significant need for tools, taxonomies of anomalies and defects, remote access to advanced instruments, and metrics that assess the effectiveness, cost, and test time of detection/avoidance mechanisms.  Metrics: The ad-hoc approaches for evaluation of hardware security and trust are inhibiting true progress. Metrics for evaluating the security primitives, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures are vital.  Project Assessment and Evaluation: the project assessment and evaluation activities will focus on three areas of project activities: 1) the extent to which external communities are reached; 2) the extent to which we provide high quality services to them and; 3) our impact on their practices and activities.   Publications: The PIs have published a number of impactful publications in the field with very high citation in addition to three books of which one is textbook.
