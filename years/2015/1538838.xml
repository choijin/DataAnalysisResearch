<AbstractNarration>This award provides student travel support for the 36th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2015) that will held from June 13-17, 2015 in Portland, Oregon. PLDI is the top technical forum for the presentation of new and exciting advances in programming languages and compiler research. The symposium covers a wide range of topics in the field, including: Language designs and extensions; Static and dynamic analysis of programs, Domain-specific languages and tools; Type systems and program logics; Program transformation and optimization; Checking or improving the security or correctness of programs; Memory management; Parallelism, both implicit and explicit; Performance analysis, evaluation, and tools; Novel programming models; Debugging techniques and tools; Program understanding; Interaction of compilers/runtimes with underlying systems; Program synthesis. Students will be able to attend all events associated with the conference, and a rich set of workshops and tutorials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF support ensures participation of US students while paying attention to underrepresented groups. To broaden participation, the grant is intended specifically to increase the number of students who cannot otherwise attend, that is, students who do not have any financial support whatsoever, e.g., from their advisors, departments, universities. The broader impacts include building international community and cooperation in the research areas of the conference, and enhancing education of students with exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. This award will therefore help train the next generation of language designers, compiler implementers and systems researchers.</AbstractNarration>

Prioritiy was given to students who had no support (from their university, department, and/or their advisor), women, and under-represented groups.  The following students were supported through this PLDI 2015 travel support:       Barowy,   Daniel   Curtsinger, Charles   Ding, Yufei   Kaki, Gowtham   Luo, Hao   McClurg, Jedidiah   Moore, Scott   Nkounkou, Brittany   Peng, Yuanfeng   Shah, Michael   Shidal, Jonathan   Sterling, Shad   Sullivan, Michael   Tassarotti, Joseph   Zhao, Zhijia        The selection of the students was through the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (http://www.sigplan.org/PAC/).
