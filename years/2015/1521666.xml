<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding to conduct a workshop series on innovation, entrepreneurship, and translational research.  Two workshops are supported by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and focus on facilitating EPSCoR jurisdictions, assessment of current processes and resources that support innovation and translation, increase their capacity in these areas, and develop circumstance-specific action plans that will improve innovation-related outcomes in their respective jurisdictions.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institutions in general grapple with the intrinsic challenges of technology transfer for university-based inventions.  Many EPSCoR jurisdictions, however, face the additional hurdles of limited availability of entrepreneurs, lack of a connected business development eco-system, and difficulty in finding capital to support technology maturation and start-up growth.  The workshops address these issues, increase the tangible discoveries emerging from funded research programs, and improve the processes for translating discoveries into commercially viable applications.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop series, comprised of two workshops, seek to improve, both individually and collectively, the capacity of EPSCoR jurisdictions to develop and implement processes for accelerating research-based innovation and the translation of innovation into products and services that benefit society.  The immediate goals include evaluating the environment within the community and jurisdictions (first workshop) and then tailoring individual jurisdiction-specific action plans based on a menu of experiential best practices (second workshop).  Jurisdictions will work on implementing their action plans after the second workshop.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action plans will have impact by improving processes for encouraging disclosure of inventions, establishing and strengthening partnerships with industry, engaging students in entrepreneurial programs, supporting technology licensing and business development, and collaborating with regional business development support resources.  In addition, a shared clearing-house (called an Innovation Hub) will be developed for communicating innovation-based partnering opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Longer term outcomes include improvements to the processes for translating fundamental research results into applications.   Improvements in quality of life, economic development, and job creation are some of the resulting significant derived benefits.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Greater emphasis on research outcomes emerging from basic and applied science and engineering programs has given rise to the creation of new programs to better leverage research infrastructure for innovation and connect research and training programs to industry problems and economic development.   NSF EPSCoR supported a community-led workshop series in which participating jurisdictions assessed their innovation assets and developed an action plan to improve their effectiveness in promoting industry collaboration, research-based innovation, technology commercialization, entrepreneurship, and business development.    A two-part series of workshops on Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Translational Research was conducted from October 2015 through February 2016.  65 people (including speakers and staff) from 14 EPSCoR states attended the first workshop, and 72 people (including staff) from 15 EPSCoR states attended the second. The workshops guided participant teams from each attending jurisdiction through self-assessment, SWOT construction, and action plan development to identify and address needs and opportunities related to research outcomes.           Prior to the first workshop, teams conducted a detailed survey instrument to describe assets and programs directed at innovation and industry collaboration, technology transfer and commercialization, entrepreneurship training and practice, start-ups, and business development, and technology-based economic development.  In Workshop 1, best practices were presented in each of the topical areas with facilitated Q&amp;A among the jurisdiction teams.  Teams engaged in facilitated exercises to create SWOT analyses for each of the topical areas, as well as a cumulative analysis.  Reviews of the SWOT analyses were used to provide guidance and feedback for refinement and preparation of a draft Action Plan for Workshop 2.  Participating teams in Workshop 2 presented their refined cumulative SWOTs and draft action plans and discussed background, status, and plans for execution with the group.  In each workshop, an open forum discussion was conducted to relate the topical discussions to programs within NSF and the EPSCoR office.  These discussions and the information gathered through the facilitated workshop activities and pre- and post- workshop surveys identified key needs in networking and collaboration and industry relations that were positively impacted by the workshops and can be further addressed by NSF programs.  NSF EPSCoR programs have demonstrated flexibility in supporting impactful outcomes in the workshop thematic areas (industry relations, patents, start-up companies) and should continue to provide communication and collaboration support to help jurisdictions understand and address their needs in this area.          A website (http://sdepscor.org/resources/nsf-innovation-workshop/) was developed to archive outcomes and provide a guide and process tools for other organizations to work through the assessment, analysis, and action plan steps of the workshop.
