<AbstractNarration>When children learn a new word, such as the name for an object, they must then figure out what other objects should receive this same label.  This can be an especially challenging problem for color words because different examples of the same color category can vary widely and the exact boundaries of individual color labels are not obvious. For example, once a child learns that blue can refer to the color of the sky, she must also determine whether blueberries, grapes or grass receive the same label. Although the boundaries for what differentiates blue from purple or green seem straightforward to adults, children experience some ambiguity, and different cultures actually employ different color categories with different boundaries.  For example, some cultures refer to blue and green things with the same color label. Thus, to learn color terms, children must figure out where blue begins and ends. The current research investigates how children solve this complex problem by examining color word learning in speakers of English and Otji-Herero.  Otji-Herero is spoken by the Himba, an ethnic group in rural Namibia, and contains only 5 color terms to cover the same range of colors that English speakers typically label using 11 terms (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, brown, gray, black and white). The research investigates how differences in exposure to visual colors, combined with differently sized and structured color vocabularies, affect how individuals establish color word categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate how learners encode color with language in three parts. First, it will test children's early comprehension using infant-friendly eye-tracking methods to determine the initial assumptions that guide first color word meanings in English-learning children (18-30 months). Second, the project will test longitudinal category change. To do so, the researchers will follow children from the time they produce their first color words until they acquire adult-like meanings for all 11 English basic color terms. Finally, these naturalistic studies of category change will be complemented by studies of experimental categorical change in which researchers introduce new color words to individuals who have divided their color space into 5 (Otji-Herero) or 11 (as in English) words while manipulating the type of visual evidence they receive during training. The researchers will also photograph the learning environments of participants to test how visual experience impacts changes in color word meanings. These photographs will be used to create a valuable online database as a resource for other researchers. Using these visual images as well as existing databases on children's linguistic input, the researchers will construct a computational model of how learners use visual and linguistic information to construct color word meanings.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Color is everywhere in the world, and is so ubiquitous that young children may not even notice it when first learning about objects and events in their environment. Many previous researchers have argued that color is not salient or important to young learners, and that because of this they learn color words late in development, around the age of 3, whereas many words are learned beginning at 12 months. Our research, however, shows that this long-held consensus underestimates children's awareness of color, and that in fact they begin learning color words many months earlier than previously thought. Whereas previous studies asked whether children use color words exactly like adults, we employed an alternative strategy of looking at children individually, and asking whether they show evidence of any kind of systematic knowledge, even if it differs from that of adults. Using this approach, we discovered that although children use color words very differently from adults, they use them systematically from the age of 18 months, and "overextend" them, resulting in larger color categories. For example, using a combination of labeling, categorization, and eye-tracking tasks, we found that many children's first meaning of "red" includes colors like red, pink, and purple, while many children interpret the word "white" to include white, black, gray, and brown. We also found, using a combination of methods, that these large, overextended, categories become smaller in size as children begin to produce more color words. Competition among their color words results in each word labeling a smaller range of colors. These studies together indicate that color word learning begins early in language acquisition, and is a gradual process of discovery, aided by early experiences hearing color words used to label things in the world.&nbsp;Children begin language learning interested in color, and learn color words by forming large categories that shrink as they learn new words.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/27/2019<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;A&nbsp;Barner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
