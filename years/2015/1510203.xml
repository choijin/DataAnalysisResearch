<AbstractNarration>1510203&lt;br/&gt;Reinhold&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1510714&lt;br/&gt;Bornhorst&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently the growing threat of antibiotic compounds in natural waters and the antibiotic resistance in microorganism in those waters has been recognized and is an emerging field of intense research. The uptake and accumulation of antibiotics by food crops has prompted concerns about unintentional human exposure. In addition to accumulation, plants metabolize organic chemicals, including antibiotics, through conjugation reactions, resulting in phyto-metabolites that are sequestered into cell walls and vacuoles. The overall aim of the proposed project is to elucidate the production of phyto-metabolites of antibiotics and their subsequent release in human systems when plants are eaten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will evaluate the central hypothesis that plants predominantly metabolize antibiotics through conjugation with glycosides and glutathione, forming phyto-conjugates that are reverted to the parent antibiotic by human digestion. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, the research will: 1. Identify the metabolites of antibiotics in Arabidopsis thaliana in sterilized, controlled systems. 2. Quantify the production of phyto-metabolites of antibiotics in soil systems planted with A. thaliana and three vegetables, as relevant to the environmental fate of antibiotics in crop systems. 3. Elucidate pathways of degradation of phyto-metabolites of antibiotics during human digestion. The proposed research addresses the limitations of existing research on the fate of antibiotics through coupled use of radiolabeled chemicals and mass spectrometry, which will facilitate quantification of phyto-metabolism and degradation of phyto-metabolites in controlled mesocosms and column studies. Consequently, the proposed research is expected to advance understanding of phyto-metabolism of emerging pollutants through the following outcomes: (1) development of a generalized, transferable model of phyto-metabolism, (2) realistic estimates of the mass of phyto-metabolites of antibiotics in vegetated systems, including quantification of individual phyto-metabolites sequestered in vacuoles and cell walls with time, and, (3) determination of the bioavailability of sequestered phyto-metabolites during consumption of vegetables. This study will broadly impact society and science through integrating discovery and teaching, engaging underrepresented groups, broadly disseminating results, and addressing environmental and human health challenges. Research will engage and train a graduate student, at least two undergraduate students, and least four high school students in active research that transcends engineering and biology. This project will involve minority high-school students in research to encourage interest in engineering careers. Research outcomes will be broadly disseminated through academic avenues, including journal publications and conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research indicates that plants can uptake and metabolize antibiotics, incorporating them into plant tissues.  Based on laboratory experiments, these antibiotics are then released upon digestion or decomposition of plant tissues, exposing microbial communities in the gut and soils to sugar-conjugated antibiotics.  Most current risk assessments of antibiotics in plant systems rely on measurements of the parent antibiotic in plant tissues and do not consider metabolites; as our research indicates that &gt;90% of antibiotics are metabolized, and that those metabolites are released upon digestion or decomposition of plant tissues, it is likely that current risk assessments of antibiotics dramatically underestimate the contributions of plants to antimicrobial resistance.   We demonstrated that plants metabolized the recalcitrant triclocarban (TCC) upon long-term exposure. More importantly, a substantial portion of TCC taken up by plants was metabolized, especially in the stems, leaves and fruits. Hydroxylated TCC (e.g. 2?-OH TCC and 6-OH TCC) and glycosylated OH-TCC were found to be the main phase I and phase II metabolites in plant tissues, respectively. We also observed that the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana extensively metabolized two commonly used classes of antimicrobials, including sulfonamides (SMT and SMX) and tetracyclines (CTC and OTC), shortly upon exposure.
