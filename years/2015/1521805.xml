<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number:  1521805&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Colorado School of Mines&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  P. Craig Taylor&lt;br/&gt;Title:  International Conference on Exotic Forms of Silicon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Conference on Exotic Forms of Silicon will be held during July 13-17, 2015 at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado.  This conference will discuss new ways to create and produce unique forms of silicon, an element abundant in the earth?s crust, to enable future breakthroughs in the areas of microelectronics and renewable energy production.  Fifteen world leaders in silicon research have agreed to participate in this conference. The conference will also support the participation of 20 graduate students and postdoctoral research associates who are positioned to be future leaders of this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silicon is an earth-abundant, non-toxic element that the base material for semiconducting devices.  If alternative molecular forms of silicon (Si) can be made with high purity in thin film form, then these new silicon materials may have significant potential to drive the next 50 years of microelectronic, optoelectronic, and energy harvesting device development.  This conference will bring together 15 internationally prominent researchers in silicon materials research, mostly based in the United States, to discuss common problems and potential transformative breakthroughs to enable the next generation of microelectronic, optoelectronic, and energy harvesting materials and devices, and to drive US-led innovation in this area.  Structures to be discussed include: 1) forms of silicon created under high pressure that are metastable at ambient pressure;  2) single layers of Si (silicene);  3) clathrate Si, which has been studied for superconducting and thermoelectric properties but not for semiconductor applications; 4) nanostructured forms of Si (nanodots and nanowires), including those composed of diamond Si; and 5) porous Si.  The conference will also provide support for the participation of 20 graduate students and postdoctoral research associates, including student from under-represented groups at Fisk University, as part of a collaborative relationship with the Renewable Energy Materials Research Science and Engineering Center at the Colorado School of Mines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The International Conference on Exotic forms of Silicon was held at the Colorado School of Mines, Golden Colorado, in July of 2015.  The objective of the conference was to bring together researchers working on the many forms of silicon, other than bulk diamond Si or amorphous Si, to discuss common problems and potential transformative breakthroughs, such as enabling the next generation of microelectronic or opto-electronic materials and devices.  Structures discussed included, (1) those formed under high pressure that are metastable at ambient pressure, (2) single layers of Si (silicene), (2) clathrate Si, which has been studied for superconducting and thermoelectric properties but not in any detail for semiconductor applications, and other open-cage Si structures, (3) nanostructured forms of Si (nanodots and nanowires), including those  composed of diamond Si, (4) porous Si, and (5) other structures that differ in their structural, optical or electronic properties from bulk diamond Si, such as siloxenes and clathrasils.   Silicon is an abundant, non-toxic element around which an advanced technology exists for semiconducting devices based on diamond Si.   One of these exotic forms of Si, such as those pictured in the image, could form the basis for the next revolution in electronics or even opto-electronics, since some forms exhibit direct, or nearly direct, band gaps.   Broader Impacts  Review articles will be published in a special issue of Applied Physics Reviews are based on original presentations at the International Conference on Exotic forms of Silicon held at the Colorado School of Mines, Golden Colorado, in July of 2015This special issue brings together review articles from several diverse constituencies to discuss some common problems and potential solutions.   It is the hope that this issue may help to establish a new community of scientists and engineers working toward some common goals.   Seven graduate students and five postdoctoral research associates from several different organizations attended this conference and participated in the lively discussions that followed each talk.
