<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Ali Chamseddine at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quest for unification of fundamental physical interactions has been the subject of intensive research for nearly forty years. The stumbling block in this program is the inclusion of the gravitational force among the other three forces mediating the strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions. These latter forces are very well understood in the framework of quantum field theory. In contrast, the gravitational force, because of its extreme weakness, is sizable only for macroscopic objects and is therefore mainly understood only at the classical level. Professor Chamseddine's research focuses on the development of a quantum theory of gravity. As such, research in this area promotes the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.    Due to its interdisciplinary nature, this work will also contribute to the advancement of knowledge in high-energy physics, gravitational physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.   Moreover, this project is envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  The American University of Beirut (AUB) plays a very important role in promoting the American educational system in the Middle East.  The recent launching of the Ph.D. program in theoretical physics is a step towards the promotion of high-level research in the Middle East, and is attracting students of high caliber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, Professor Chamseddine will conduct research investigations in supergravity, grand unified models, quantum gravity, string theory and noncommutative geometry.  He will pursue the construction of spectral manifolds in noncommutative geometry which reproduce the Standard Model Lagrangian coupled to gravity. In addition, he will study physical applications and dynamical realizations of this quantization scheme.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At extremely high energies which existed at the birth of the universe we expect  space-time to be formed out of quanta of geometry. To achieve this we proposed a higher form of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. This enabled us to establish the existence of two kinds of quanta of geometry in the form of four spheres. The algebraic structures on the spheres together with the initial four dimensional manifold form a noncommutative space describing the full geometric structure of space-time. The algebraic structure on the two spheres corresponding to the quanta of geometry determines uniquely the three fundamental forces observed in nature: the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions, as well as the fundamental fermions consisting of quarks and leptons. A remarkable outcome of this project is that we now have a geometric explanation for the celebrated standard model of particle interactions and provided an elegant answer to the question: Why the Standard Model? We gave an explanation why there are only 16 fermions per family, and the reason for the existence of the Higgs fields and the generation of fermionic masses through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We predict the existence of a new scalar particle at energies of order 1011 Gev providing mass to the right-handed neutrinos, thus explaining through the see-saw mechanism the extremely small masses for the left-handed neutrinos. We have also determined uniquely that there exists a unification scale at which the three fundamental forces are unified in a left-right symmetric Pati-Salam model.   The requirement that the three dimensional volume is quantized leads to the existence of a constrained scalar field, resulting in a modified model of General relativity keeping the same degrees of freedom for the graviton in addition to half a mode corresponding to the presence of dust. We have the surprising result that our minimally modified theory of gravity gives a simple explanation of dark matter in the form of dust, or as extrinsic curvature of the three dimensional hypersurfaces. Unlike general relativity, we are able to include expressions in the action which are higher order in space derivatives but not time derivatives, avoiding the presence of ghosts. We constructed non-singular cosmological solutions where at time zero, the curvature is not infinite. In addition we constructed non-singular black hole solutions thus avoiding the no-go theorems of Hawking and Penrose.   In summary, armed with new mathematics of noncommutative geometry as formulated by Alain Connes, we are able to provide a framework for the unification of all particle interactions, built from quanta of geometry which determines uniquely the geometric structure of space-time. In addition we provide an explanation of dark matter in terms of dust and extrinsic curvature of the three space, without the need to assume the existence of new particles or forces.
