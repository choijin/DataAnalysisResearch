<AbstractNarration>An Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) implementation and research project will be conducted at Morehouse College with the goal of utilizing a highly innovative utilitarian scientific literacy curriculum to increase retention of freshman STEM majors.  Special emphasis will be placed on second semester freshman STEM majors who are at-risk of changing to a non-STEM major. This will be accomplished by: 1) presenting scientific literacy workshop/seminars to all freshman STEM majors at Morehouse College in their Living Learning Center - Orientation and Training program; 2) identifying second semester freshman STEM majors who may be considering changing to a non-STEM major using written assessments and focus groups; 3) enrolling these at-risk second semester freshmen in a cohort and exposing them to advanced scientific literacy best practices that are designed to retain them in the STEM major.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational research agenda of this project is to determine the efficacy of the programmatic activities in retention of STEM majors as a means of contributing to the knowledge base concerning best practices for freshman intervention and retention in STEM.  Increasing student retention in STEM ultimately increases America's scientific workforce and global economic competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The term ?scientific literacy? is malleable, with different definitions for different populations. In this project scientific literacy aligns with the concept of ?utilitarian scientific literacy? which is a student?s understanding of the skills, behaviors and attitudes necessary to become a successful science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) major, as well as possessing the growth mindset identity of a successful STEM major. Best practices in several different scientific literacy programs have been developed at Morehouse College that successfully increased retention of STEM majors.  The goal of this implementation project was to implement, evaluate and study a hybrid scientific literacy program to increase retention of all freshman STEM majors at Morehouse College. This was accomplished in two phases, first by implementing in New Student Orientation (NSO), and second implementing to second-semester freshmen STEM majors who were identified as being at-risk of changing to a non-STEM major.  For two consecutive years a modified scientific literacy curriculum was presented in NSO to all incoming freshmen STEM majors at Morehouse College, in three separate workshops, that lasted a total of seven hours.  Sub-components of the scientific literacy curriculum that was presented included Scientific Literacy and College Retention, Success in STEM, Growth Mindset and panel discussions with upper class STEM majors. Assessment results measured students? perception of course content, difficulty, presentation style, learning strategies, application in everyday life and overall experience.  In each of these categories on a scale from 1 to 5 (1-low, to 5-high) results consistently averaged a high score above 4.  Similar Likert scale assessments relative to the students? overall experience also scored high. For example, in 2017: students indicated they would recommend this program to other students (4.65 average score out of 5); students were interested in attending other scientific literacy activities (4.29 average); and students believed this program will help them be successful STEM majors (4.65 average).  The second goal of this project was to identify second semester freshman STEM majors who may have a high probability of changing to a non-STEM major and enrolling these at-risk students in a scientific literacy program designed to retain them in the STEM major. The first stage of this activity consisted of developing the ?Likely STEM Changer? (L-STEM-C) assessment instrument to identify second-semester freshmen STEM majors who are at-risk of leaving their STEM major.  This instrument was developed in part from the literature and used a five-point Likert scale which included questions in three sub-scales: 1) Relationship to Major, i.e. why the student majored in STEM; 2) Continual Changers, i.e. relative stability and self-efficacy; and 3) Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors that affect major changing.  A total of 491 Morehouse College students took the L-STEM-C in 2016 and 2017.  Of this number approximately 75 students each year were identified by the L-STEM-C instrument as having a high probability of changing their major to a non-STEM major.  Of these 75 students, 40 each year were recruited to participate in a scientific literacy program designed to reinvigorate their interest in STEM.  Students learned how to create and maintain highly empowered study groups and were charged with forming study groups in STEM courses.  Research seminars and round table panel mentoring discussions by upper level undergraduate students and Morehouse faculty were conducted including a presentation on the history of African and African American scientists and a panel discussion by STEM professionals.  Overall, students rated these sessions high giving an average of 4.16 (out of 5) for program relevance, an average of 4.13 for program valuable, and instructors level of preparedness, consistency, motivation, and effectiveness all independently scored an average Likert scale over 4.2.  Currently a longitudinal study is be conducted to determine if students who participated in this intervention persist in the STEM major at a greater rate than students who were at-risk and did not participate.  In addition, an ongoing longitudinal study is being conducted to elucidate the validity of the L-STEM-C instrument in predicting which second-semester freshmen STEM majors have a high probability of changing their major.  Upon completion of these studies data will be published.   This project was conducted at an all-male, Historically Black College and University (HBCU). Nationally, African American male STEM majors represent one of highest groups for low retention in STEM majors. The development of an effective assessment instrument that can be used at minority and majority institutions, coupled with the use of early intervention strategies to increase student retention by increasing the level of scientific literacy, will improve the graduation rates of STEM majors.  This will ultimately have a broad impact on America?s scientific workforce and global economic competitiveness.
