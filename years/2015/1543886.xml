<AbstractNarration>NON TECHNICAL AND TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $8,000 are recommended in partial support of the travel expenses and registration of ten underrepresented group scientists and junior faculty to attend the Pacific Polymer Conference (PPC)14, sponsored by the American Chemical Society?s  Polymer Chemistry Division, to be held on 9-13 December 2015 in Kauai,  Hawaii. The conference is the product of the Pacific Polymer Federation (PPF) which is a regional organization of individual polymer societies from around the Pacific Rim and Pacific islands currently numbering seventeen member societies from fourteen countries. The objective of the PPCs, which are held every two years and rotate among member societies, is to bring together polymer scientists from the Pacific region to discuss and exchange recent advances in polymer science, polymer technology, and the application of polymers. The last  conference in the series organized by a US society was held in 2005. The planned conference  which is scientifically and technologically comprehensive, is organized into six main sessions, each encompassing two or more subsessions. The main sessions are: (1) POLYMER SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY. (2) BIO-RELATED POLYMERS. (3) POLYMER PHYSICS and PROCESSING. (4) ENERGY. (5) ENVIRONMENT. (6) SPECIAL TOPICS. The proposal includes a running list of expert invited speakers for each session. The conference offers the opportunity for the development of closer ties among Pacific Rim polymer groups and individual scientists, to mutual benefit.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report:  DMR- 1543886  Kenneth J. Wynne on behalf of the American Chemical Society, Polymer Chemistry Division  Request for partial support: Pacific Polymer Conference 14 (PPC14)  07/01/2015 - 06/30/2016  Award: $8,000  Introduction. The ACS Polymer Chemistry Division has always had a strong international involvement.  The POLY an International Committee actively involves our international colleagues in the Division, as symposium and workshop organizers, speakers, and colleagues.  More specifically, POLY was the host of the 14th Pacific Polymer Conference (PPC-14) at the Grand Hyatt Resort on the island of Kauai, HI, December 9-13, 2015. The meeting was a success as evidenced by: 235 lectures, 181 poster presentations and two plenary sessions. The largest constituencies outside the US were from Japan (85), China (44), Korea (40), and Taiwan (15).  Other participation was from Asia, Europe, Africa and North America.    Objectives and scientific merit. The goal of this project was to provide partial support for travel expenses and registration for underrepresented polymer scientists and young faculty for their participation in PPC14. To achieve this goal, symposia organizers were informed by e-mail of the importance of recruiting younger faculty, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities. From these communications and responses, a plan was developed for recruiting highly meritorious underrepresented faculty. The specific objectives included developing a list of qualified candidates, selecting those who would benefit most from help, informing the candidates of the opportunity, and assuring and facilitating their award at the meeting site. Ten $800 awards were made. The awards were used by awardees toward travel expenses and registration.    Outcomes and broader impacts. From e-mails and personal conversations it was clear that NSF help for each of these young scientists was key to attendance.  Importantly, a broader impact of participation was giving these young polymer scientists a "boost" by providing a forum to present their work among internationally well-known speakers from the Pacific Basin. In keeping with the goals of NSF support, access for persons with disabilities and daycare opportunities information on daycare and for persons with physical impairments was prominently featured as a tab on the website home page:  http://www.ppc14.org/specialneeds.html  A program of symposia, speakers for each symposium, abstracts for each presentation and information about the poster session presentations was made available to all participants at the meeting website: http://www.polyacs.net/Workshops/PPC14/program.html   NSF support for the Pacific Polymer Conference was gratefully acknowledged on the meeting website, http://www.polyacs.net/Workshops/PPC14/home.html and in a poster prominently displayed on the podium at which presentations were given.
