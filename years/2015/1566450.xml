<AbstractNarration>This collaborative proposal aims to combine advances in ice core sampling technology, knowledge of Andean storm event meteorology, cyberinfrastructure, and climate modeling and analysis to fresh snow, snowpits and ice core data to be recovered from ice caps in Peru and Bolivia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of the project are to investigate South American atmospheric circulation features (e.g. El Niño/La Niña (ENSO), South American Low-level Jet, Southern Hemisphere trades and westerlies), tropical-mid-latitude-polar teleconnections, and the significance of key global-scale forcing functions that control atmospheric circulation (e.g. solar variability, volcanic activity, dusts, and greenhouse gases) and have significant relevance to moisture and heat transport over South America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The regional retreat of alpine glaciers coupled with increased population, industry, and agriculture activities are generating future demands on water resources. Declines in water resources may magnify the regional impacts of ENSO.  Instrumental records of climate and environmental variability over the region are sparse yet ice cores from Central Andean glaciers provide a source of high resolution records of past climate dynamics and chemistry of the atmosphere extending back centuries to millennia.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climate reconstructions from ice cores could provide added temporal and spatial context to existing multi-proxy reconstructions in order to assess the impact of natural and human-induced physical and chemical climate change at the storm-scales that impact day to day and season to season events, and in the process, develop analogs for predicting future change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on the researchers' recent W.M. Keck Foundation and NSF-supported transformative laser sampling of ice cores and the newly released, NSF-supported cyberinfrastructure and climate analysis tools.  It also involves supporting an early career post-doctoral scholar, development and testing of new analytical tools, and strong collaboration with South American scientists.</AbstractNarration>

Working with our U. Maine and South American university partners from 2016-19, we set up citizen scientist observational networks and conducted seven field expeditions to obtain a diverse suite of high elevation atmospheric and snow surface data collections designed to discriminate individual storm events over time.  From these rich data resources, we have been able to chronicle the seasonal evolution of atmospheric conditions and surface snowpacks, and then analyze them in contexts of atmospheric circulations and associated climatic forcings.  The first target, focused on spatiotemporal signals in the isotopic (&delta;D, &delta;18O) composition of precipitation, examined four years of daily precipitation observations from citizen scientist networks in our two field regions to identify wet season controls on subseasonal variability in &delta;18O. This analysis revealed a regionally coherent subseasonal signal in precipitation &delta;18O, consisting of alternating 9-27-day periods of anomalously enriched and anomalously depleted &delta;18O. This signal reflects variability in precipitation delivery driven by synoptic conditions and relates to variations in the South American low-level jetstream over Amazonian lowlands east of the Andes, and tropospheric moisture availability over the study area. Annual layers observed in the subsequent dry season retain this subseasonal signal, providing a pathway for the development of snowpit age models, and demonstrating how synoptic variability is transmitted from the atmosphere to mountaintop snowpacks along the Altiplano's eastern margin. These results furthermore introduce the tantalizing possibility that annual layering identifiable in Andean ice cores may contain as-yet unutilized information about subseasonal variability and associated circulation anomalies from past climate epochs of the late Holocene.  This work is presented in a 2019 publication in Journal of Hydrometeorology (Guy et al., 2019).  For the second target, our objective was to reveal the specific meteorological processes underlying the imprinting of &delta;18O in individual precipitation events that collectively produce subseasonal variability signals. Central to this analysis is QUIPU, a tool we developed to provide a computational framework for cross-comparing and analyzing our diverse data resources.  We used QUIPU to develop precise age models for snow strata within annual layers, enabling time-tagging of individual snowpit samples to specific storm events recorded in meteorological observations.
