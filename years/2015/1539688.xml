<AbstractNarration>On-line Process Analytical Technology (PAT) is needed in enabling biopharmaceutical companies to significantly improve drug quality and productivity. Current in-situ monitoring in production plants and laboratories is still mainly based on measuring temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, pressure, airflow, and liquid flow. These parameters do not give information on cell viability, cycle, size, autophagy and apoptosis that are metrics to indicate reproducibility of the bioprocess. FDA suggested key PAT technologies such as near-infrared, mid-infrared, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence and imaging, and mass spectroscopy, are all under active development, but with limitations of one kind or another, such as limited sensitivity, difficult to use, and high cost. Dielectric spectroscopy is also studied as a promising approach, but not yet appropriate for PAT due to limited sensitivity and information contents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves a novel radio frequency (RF) interferometer technique for On-line Process Analytical Technology (PAT) instrument development. The obtained radio frequency (RF) probes exploit novel interference processes to enhance sensitivity while applying novel tuning mechanisms to cover broad frequency ranges and tune sensitivity for robust system operations. The RF probes are expected to have unprecedented sensitivity and robustness to analyze cell viability, autophagy, apoptosis, and size in a label-free and non-invasive manner. Many of these cell properties are not available in other PAT methods. The electronic approach is expected to enable mass produced low-cost and easy-to-use PAT instruments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The I-Corps team on Ultra Dielectric Probes successfully completed the training courses, seminars and workshops at Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA.  Guided by the teaching team instructors, the I-Corps team successfully conducted more than 100 interviews of potential customers in analytical labs, clinical diagnostic labs, biopharmaceutical companies, chemical pharmaceutical companies, brewers, distillers and ethanol fuel producers.  Through this process, the I-Corps team gained deep insights about the process of technology commercialization, obtained practical knowledge and significant experience in conducting customer interviews, generated and refined our business model.  We identified brewers, distillers and ethanol fuel producers as our targeted market space, which can be extended to pharmaceutical companies and analytical labs in the future.  The targeted market space involves ~ $400 billion economy output.  The extended market space involves another ~ $800 billion or more economy.  These potential customers need our technologies for real-time online monitoring of biomass, cell viability and contaminations.  So they can have better yield and higher productivity, for which a 1% improvement is significant.  There are currently no effective techniques for customers in these industries to use.   We also identified the functions of a minimum viable product (MVP), identified the gap between our current technology maturity level and the requirement of an MVP, and developed a plan to build a technology demonstration prototype and a plan to commercialize the technology.  An NSF accelerating Innovation Research- Technology Transfer (PFI: AIR-TT) proposal has been submitted for the development of the targeted prototype.  The original I-Corps team is fully involved in the new PRF: AIR-TT project with strong supporting letters from a few potential customers interviewed during the I-Corps process.
