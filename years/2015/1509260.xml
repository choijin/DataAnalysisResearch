<AbstractNarration>For cancer and many chronic conditions, detecting early stage disease is the most critical factor in successfully curing patients and improving long-term survival rates. Current clinical practice involves taking biopsy samples from suspicious sites, followed by tissue processing and microscopic examination for abnormalities. This is a low yield, expensive, painful, and slow process. This project develops a new approach for microscopic imaging of living cells and tissues within the body in real time, which will improve the ability of physicians to detect early stage disease. The developed approach will also greatly increase the number of diagnostically useful biopsies being collected, improve the accuracy of margin identification during surgical resection, and permit non-invasive monitoring of post-surgical sites for recurrence. Lowering costs associated with unnecessary biopsies, multiple clinic visits, and repeat surgeries due to undetected residual disease will also positively impact the economics of healthcare delivery in the US.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical focus of this project is on the design of a fiber-optic probe that will enable examination of tissue for signs of disease in real-time, non-invasively, at the level of traditional pathology. This involves breaking conventional resolution limitations in fiber-optic imaging to deliver a real-time "optical biopsy".  This is accomplished through integration of mathematical concepts from the compressed sensing field with hardware design and engineering for the clinical setting. The main goals of this project in this regard are (1) to design and engineer two candidate hardware architectures for optical biopsy, (2) to design, analyze and optimize the computational algorithms required to generate high-resolution images from these specific architectures, (3) to design and train automated feature recognition algorithms to assist the physician in interpreting optical biopsy images in real-time, and (4) to complete benchmark validation of the system using calibrated test targets and biological phantoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project stems from the tight integration between fiber-optic-based endomicroscopy and signal processing theory and algorithms. This project does not simply apply image analysis algorithms to previously-acquired data in post-processing. Instead, the optical hardware components and signal processing elements are co-designed to enable imaging at 2-4 times higher spatial resolution than possible from developing the hardware or software alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will thus advance the medical imaging field by developing new signal processing techniques to increase resolution and field-of-view that do not require additional breakthroughs in microfabrication methods. This project will also advance the signal processing field by introducing new algorithms to solve missing data problems, address ill-posed inverse problems, and implement compressive sensing theory, all at previously unexplored length scale.  However, the most transformative aspect of this work is that it has the potential to change clinical practices from reliance on 100 year old pathology practices to real-time information on tissue status at the patient?s bedside.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Endoscopic imaging provides clinicians with the ability to evaluate tissues and organs inside the body.  Some instruments provide images with limited detail due to the way that images are delivered from the tip of the endoscope to a camera located outside the body.  Fiber-optic bundles are flexible cables containing thousands of optical fibers packed together that can transmit images from one end to the other.  However, each fiber contributes only a single pixel of information to the image, and regions in between fibers capture no information at all. This project aimed to develop new techniques to address these limitations of fiber bundle-based imaging and improve the resolution of endoscopy.  The broader impacts of this project will result from enabling clinicians to examine tissue at greater detail, which may lead to earlier diagnosis of disease, improved determination of tumor boundaries during surgery, and reduced need for tissue biopsies.  The first outcome of this project was based on the observation that the individual fibers within a bundle can be thought of as individual pixels in a digital camera.  Each fiber captures light from the object, which is subsequently displayed as a color or gray level on a monitor.  Prior work in the field of compressive imaging demonstrated that images containing many pixels can be captured using a camera with only a single pixel.  We hypothesized that this approach could be translated to fiber bundle imaging, enabling each fiber to contribute more than one pixel of information to the image.  To be effective, however, this concept would need to be applied in parallel to each fiber in the bundle.  Our work in this project demonstrated that this principle can indeed be implemented in a highly parallel form, where a low resolution camera (with a small number of pixels) can be used to generate high resolution images (with a large number of pixels) [Dumas et al., Opt. Exp., 2016].    The specific method we used to demonstrate that the single pixel camera could be highly parallelized involved placing coded masks between the object and a camera.  There are several possible options for positioning these masks and our second outcome involved experimentally testing two different approaches.  We showed that placing the masks at an ?image plane? worked better than their placement at a ?Fourier plane?, and that the former approach could be simpler to implement in an endoscopic instrument [Dumas et al., Opt. Exp., 2017].  Using this knowledge, we assembled a test platform to collect images through a fiber optic bundle, with coded masks located at an image plane.  This allowed us to demonstrate our third project outcome, imaging real objects through a fiber bundle, with 17 image pixels acquired for each individual fiber in the bundle.  This approach was demonstrated with test objects at the microscopic and macroscopic levels, and importantly for future clinical translation, by imaging a human subject [Dumas et al., Opt. Lett., 2019].  Having established that multiple pixels of information can be obtained from each fiber within a bundle, we sought to solve the problem of how to acquire information from object regions located in between fibers.  We developed a spectral encoding technique using a prism to guide light of different colors from neighboring locations on an object, into each fiber of the bundle.  When this light emerged from the other end of the bundle, simple color filters were used to separate out the information originating from each location on the object.  We demonstrated that this approach to improving resolution in between fibers could be combined with the coded mask method for improving resolution within fibers, to produce a final image with significantly higher resolution than the original [Dumas et al., Proc SPIE 2019].
