<AbstractNarration>The historical arc of violence between communities and states is a concern worldwide.  Warfare deeply impacts the development of governance, economy, language, technology and more, and is a central topic of study in the social sciences.  Archaeologists are uniquely positioned to study the development and impacts of warfare over many centuries, even in those societies for which there is limited historical information. Dr. Andrew Scherer of Brown University, Dr. Charles Golden of Brandeis University, and their Guatemalan collaborators will explore the conduct and impact of warfare among Classic period (AD 250 - 900) Maya kingdoms, offering a case study in which historical records complement the material remains studied by archaeologists. This research will produce important data providing a rich comparison with other societies in the ancient and historical Americas, as well as the states and chiefdoms in Eurasia and Africa including Mesopotamia, Greece and Egypt that have long provided much of our understandings of the development of war and statecraft. This research has the practical benefit of strengthening collaborative research ties between American and Guatemalan scientists, and provides training opportunities for American and Guatemalan undergraduate and graduate students. Further, the research zone is being devastated by looting, illegal logging, slash-and-burn agriculture, forest fires, and ranching.   This work will provide government authorities, land-use managers, and local communities with data detailing the location and extent of archaeological sites and extends infrastructural support to help combat this destruction. The project will provide employment opportunities for impoverished communities in the area around the park. The project will therefore demonstrate America's commitment to the advancement of knowledge, the protection of natural and cultural resources, and the betterment of lives in neighboring countries and developing economies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maya were once thought to be one of the few ancient states without warfare, their rulers concerned with little more than religious rituals. More recent research has revealed that ancient Maya society had more in common with other ancient and modern states, and that warfare constituted a tragic but important component of statecraft.  Yet our understanding of Maya warfare has been derived largely from art and hieroglyphic inscriptions with little understanding of how it was actually conducted, supported logistically, how it may have impacted society, and its role as a cause and effect of political formation and collapse. Scherer and Golden will use as their case study the Classic period kingdoms of Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan. They have previously conducted research on fortifications at boundaries of these kingdoms, dating to the eighth century AD.  These have been interpreted as indicative of escalating violence immediately preceding the political collapse of these states. To determine whether warfare and defense were concerns from the foundation of these kingdoms, shaping in part their political and economic development, Scherer, Golden, and collaborators will study defenses associated directly with the political capitals of Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan. Preliminary observations by the co-PIs and their local collaborators suggest such defenses do exist, contrary to the assumption that most such capitals did not have fortifications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding supported archaeological investigations of Precolumbian warfare in El Pet&eacute;n, Guatemala from May 1, 2016 through August 31, 2017.   PIs Scherer and Golden serve as directors of the Proyecto Paisaje Piedras Negras-Yaxchilan (PPPNY) with Guatemalan colleagues Monica Urquiz&uacute; in 2017, and Griselda P&eacute;rez Robles in 2016.  Broadly, the aim of this binational research program was a holistic understanding of the development, expansion, and decline of Classic period (AD 250 &ndash; 900) Maya kingdoms in the Usumacinta River region, which today forms the border between Mexico and Guatemala. This work has focused on the geographic and political limits of authority of the ancient kingdoms of Piedras Negras (Guatemala) and Yaxchilan (Mexico).  Previous research in this region by the PIs - including reconnaissance, site mapping, and excavation funded by the NSF (BCS-0715463 and BCS-1115818) - revealed over 50 previously undocumented archaeological sites, further documented previously known sites, and identified a variety of anthropogenic features across the region including defensive works.  That research demonstrated distinct strategies in the Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan kingdoms, differing in the location of defensive walls and the degree to which those fortifications were (or were not) integrated into the greater defense of each respective kingdom. In the Late Classic period (AD 600 - 900) the rulers of the Yaxchilan polity oversaw the construction of an extensive landscape-oriented defensive system.  This fortified border was defined by an integrated system of masonry walls, hilltop redoubts, and noble palace complexes strategically settled to defend the greater polity against attack from neighboring kingdoms.  No similar border system has yet been identified in the Piedras Negras kingdom where sites seem to systems of fortifications seem to be focused on local defensive needs.  Team members identified walls north and south of Piedras Negras during reconnaissance in the immediate periphery of Piedras Negras, and carried out excavations on walls crossing valley floors at 3 km and at less than 1 km north Piedras Negras.  These walls appear to be associated with residential structures dating to the Late Classic period.  In the tall hills adjacent to the river defensive walls were also identified in close proximity to residential structures occupied from the Preclassic through Classic periods.  Ceramics excavated from one such wall include Preclassic materials, but these may may simply represent fill taken from earlier residential occupation.  We suspect that the walls date to the Late Classic period.  Interestingly, these upland walls restrict access through already challenging hills.  Three other walls were also identified approximately 2.5 km east of the center of Piedras Negras, in narrow valleys leading up into the Sierra del Lacandon.  These walls similarly do not impede transit along easier valley routes.   Such walls blocking movement through already difficult upland terrain may have been intended to discourage movement through non-valley routes.  Additional research carried out at the fortified hilltop site of Macabilero, located 15 km to the south of Piedras Negras has revealed a fortress, with platforms perched on a purposefully leveled hilltop crisscrossed by chasms.  Caches of sling stones were found in the bottoms of some of these chasms, and identified in excavations of the site?s structures.  Surrounding the site in the narrow defiles formed by steep mountains were numerous multi-meter masonry walls.  Excavations in the platforms of Macabilero itself have yielded almost exclusively Late and Terminal Preclassic (c. AD 350) period ceramics and the walls around Macabilero are likely associated with violence that predates the rise of the royal dynasty at Piedras Negras.   The results of the project suggest fundamentally different conceptions of Classic period Maya urban landscapes.  Previous research had suggested that defensive features in the immediate vicinity of Maya capitals represented constructions thrown up in unusually violent episodes.  The present research suggests that in some parts of the Maya area such features were a constant part of the landscape.  It is unlikely that such features represent perpetual warfare across centuries.  Rather, in times of war these walls represented symbols of security to the populace and functioned for the defense of the capital, while in peace these walls directed movement of people across the landscape in times of peace, facilitating and providing supervision of trade.   This research has provided the immediate impacts of training graduate and undergraduate students in the United States and Guatemala, and raising awareness of Piedras Negras and its environs.  Longer terms, project participants in Guatemala are already seeking continued funding for conservation efforts at the site through other institutions.  Finally, this research has had a significant impact towards sustaining research and conservation in an imperiled zone of rich natural and cultural patrimony in the Sierra del Lacand&oacute;n National Park, Guatemala. Local communities around the park have been engaged in efforts to raise awareness for sustainable development and tourism efforts.  These public outreach efforts have the potential to protect cultural and natural patrimony over the long term.          Last Modified: 09/10/2017       Submitted by: Charles Golden]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
