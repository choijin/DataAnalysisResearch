<AbstractNarration>This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that develop students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by providing engineering experiences in atmospheric and related sciences to 112 middle school students. The collaborative project is dedicated to helping low-income youth achieve a brighter future through long-term, comprehensive educational enrichment activities. It will develop and study Engineering Experiences, in an out-of-school-time (OST) setting that combines project-based learning in STEM with engineering experiences and ongoing mentoring to prepare students for success in high school STEM courses and the future STEM workforce. The project builds on previously funded projects about nanotechnology experiences for high school students and adapts cyberlearning tools for Engineering Experiences. Middle school students will use engineering design principles on activities and projects involving wind power, aircraft design, atmospheric sensors, solar energy, and testing dropsonde models in a wind tunnel as part of an afterschool program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guided by the US Department of Education's out-of-school-time framework, the project will use survey, interview, and classroom observation data to capture the degree and under what conditions the interplay of individual and social processes contributes to knowledge construction that leads to student competency, motivation, and persistence in STEM.  If data show that certain types of engineering experiences do positively influence low socioeconomic status (SES) and underserved students? competency, motivation, and persistence in STEM, then outcomes will be disseminated to other communities to help increase opportunities for more low SES students to engage in project-based engineering experiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Engineering Experiences project investigated an approach for involving low-income, diverse youth in innovative out-of-school time learning experiences that aimed to increase their interest, motivation, and persistence in STEM education and careers. This effort was a collaboration between the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, the University of Colorado Boulder, and the I Have a Dream Foundation Boulder County. Over the course of the performance period, approximately 380 low socioeconomic status and diverse youth (primarily Hispanic) participated in various program implementations.  The primary product from this effort is the Engineering Experiences Toolkit, which can be used by out-of-school time program providers targeting diverse middle school youth. This Toolkit contains:   An out-of-school time curriculum that asks youth to investigate the following driving question over a 15-week period:  How can Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) be used to determine the damage caused by a natural disaster to a town? Flight Logs supporting youth journaling and reflection that have built-in prompts for utility value interventions asking youth to reflect on the personal relevance of various aspects of the program, formative feedback on program implementation, reflections on their use of science and engineering practices, and prompts for reflecting on engineering design processes. Media materials supporting out-of-school time facilitators to learn about and implement the Engineering Experiences curriculum, including a storyline diagram depicting the overall flow of the curriculum as it is driven forward by youth questions and ideas.  Facilitator materials (i.e., guides, video clips, and training materials) for using the curriculum with out-of-school time youth. Youth materials including blogs and videos on UAVs and documenting their experiences. A questioning guide for parents and caregivers on career and workforce issues.   A conjecture map depicting the underlying logic of the Engineering Experiences program including the theoretical underpinnings of key program elements. Peer-reviewed publications describing various program implementations as well as research outcomes.     Key research findings include:   Innovative Uses of Technology:    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are a promising platform supporting the meaningful integration of a variety of technology-rich learning experiences, including sensors, programming, 3D printing, and augmented reality.    Middle school youth enroll in Engineering Experiences primarily because they are interested in the topic: using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.     Innovative Learning Experiences:   The storylining approach, predominantly used to develop curriculum for formal learning environments, can be effectively extended to develop out-of-school time learning experiences.   Youth respond positively to structured prompts embedded in journals that are tightly integrated into the curriculum, and actively use the journals for daily reflections.   Over the course of the 15-week program, youth perceptions of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles systematically shifts from perceiving them as fun ?toys? to play with to ?tools? for science and engineering investigations. Youth also demonstrated increased understanding and more systematic use of science and engineering practices.    The Engineering Experience curriculum can be readily adapted and reused across a wide variety of out-of-school time programs. This was demonstrated through observations of program implementation at multiple programs and sites in addition to the I Have a Dream Foundation partners.      Broadening Participation Strategies:   Youth persistence and motivation to participate in out-of-school STEM time programs can be enhanced through strongly coherent curriculum, where youth understand the purpose of the activities and how they help to advance their investigations or design challenges                 Last Modified: 08/10/2019       Submitted by: Tamara R Sumner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
