<AbstractNarration>Parasitic plants?plants with limited or no photosynthetic ability?are reliant on hosts for survival. Many parasitic plants have been understudied and work regarding their ecology, evolution and biogeography would be a substantial contribution to understanding symbiosis. This research supports study of the biogeography of mistletoe, a well-known parasitic plant found mainly in the Southern Hemisphere. The research aims to understand the distribution of New Zealand mistletoes by considering their dependence on other organisms (through reliance on parasitic associations with trees and on birds to disperse seeds) and by understanding how the shape of the landscape affects their dispersal. This study will use a new model developed by the PI to ascertain how ecological factors affect the distribution of organisms. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Dave Kelly, a noted expert on mistletoe ecology and evolution who has comprehensive knowledge of the location of mistletoes, and of bird-mistletoe-tree host associations in New Zealand. The work will address questions never before asked from a historical biogeography perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will use a novel likelihood modeling approach developed by the PI to assess the historical biogeography of New Zealand mistletoes. Many parasitic plants have been understudied and work regarding their ecology, evolution and biogeography would be a substantial contribution to understanding symbiosis. By focusing on a small clade of mistletoes (Loranthaceae) and using parasite, host and dispersal agent/barrier and vegetation type data, the PI will be able to ask: What biotic factors have structured the historical biogeography of mistletoes? Does host and dispersal agent biogeography correlate with parasite biogeography? How does heterogeneity in the landscape affect mistletoe distribution? Currently, no study has tried to assess the biogeographic history of parasitic plants and we lack understanding of ecological factors have influenced the biogeographic history of parasitic plants. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Royal Society of New Zealand.</AbstractNarration>
