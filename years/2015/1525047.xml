<AbstractNarration>It has been accepted that the characteristics of sperm are determined by the diploid genotype of the male producing them.  However, recent and unexpected findings indicate that the phenotype of a sperm cell may also be influenced by its own genotype. This innovative project examines the degree to which the haploid genotypes of sperm cells affect their individual characteristics and the relative importance of sperm competition versus selection post-fertilization in causing biases in transmission of alleles from one generation to the next. It will provide basic information to illuminate a previously unsuspected but potentially important avenue for natural selection in evolution. The expected results have the potential to open up an important new line of research in sperm biology. They are expected to have broad implications in developmental biology, evolutionary biology, and for improvements in reporductive technologies in humans and domestic animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates the epistatic interactions among genes observable in hybrids between two incipient species of freshwater fish (Astyanax spp.). Previous work has shown that sperm from hybrid males pass along biased subsets of alleles and allelic combinations derived from unlinked genes. This observation suggested the hypothesis that the phenotypes of individual sperm (in this case fertilization efficiency) are determined by their individual genotypes, i.e., the probability that a package gets delivered depends upon what it contains. Consistent with this hypothesis are preliminary studies that show that sperm subpopulations - defined by differences in swimming ability or by their response to a chemical challenge - differ significantly in allelic content. This research tests whether the observed transmission biases are indeed caused by sperm competition or whether there is a contribution from zygotic selection, post fertilization. Single sperm will be genotyped from embryos formed using intracytoplasmic sperm injection. This will allow different sub-populations of sperm (e.g. slow versus fast swimmers) to be compared for allelic content. Additionally, the offspring of hybrid X non-hybrid individuals will be genotyped, allowing for the detection of transmission biases. The hypothesis predicts that biases will be restricted to families derived from hybrid males but not from hybrid females.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Why does a single human ejaculate contain tens or hundreds of millions of sperm cells when typically only one is successful in fertilizing an egg?  Why not just produce a single sperm cell? These questions are at the heart of the project reported herein.  One hypothesis is that so many are needed because the rigors of navigating the female reproductive tract eliminate most of them. Another is that functional sperm cells are so difficult to manufacture that large numbers are needed to get even a few effective cells. Indeed, a typical normal ejaculate may have 50% of its sperm cells immotile and with distorted anatomy.  This project tested a different hypothesis that large numbers of competing sperm and few eventual winners serves as a screen against the transmission of bad genes. That is, sperm carrying bad genes would be less effective competitors and those sperm with good genes would have the advantage of being more likely to fertilize the egg. We used a fish model for this project because they are external fertilizers and this allowed us to manipulate sperm more easily than could be done in a mammalian model.  Each sperm cell in a human ejaculate has an absolutely unique sample of the gene alternatives (alleles) carried by the male producing the sperm.  Some carry many bad alleles or allelic combinations while others carry many good alleles or combinations.  If the bad alleles, ones that might lower the vigor or general fitness of an offspring, also affect the vigor of the sperm that carry them, competition among sperm for the prize of fertilizing the egg would act as a screen against their transmission.  This, however, is only possible if the characteristics and behaviors (phenotypes) of sperm cells were, at least in part, affected by their allelic contents. This was the prediction of the hypothesis we tested during the project. During our research we subjected sperm cells to a chemical challenge (Hoechst 33342 dye) at concentrations that were high enough to cause some of the cells to break up.  Other sperm cells were more robust and did not break up.
