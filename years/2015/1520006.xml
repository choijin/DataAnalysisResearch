<AbstractNarration>In this project, the PI team will study the plastic flow behavior of materials in the lower mantle of the Earth that occupies a large fraction of Earth between the upper mantle and the core. Plastic deformation in this region is an important mechanism of cooling of Earth and it also controls the way in which materials are stirred or mixed. The experimental studies on plastic deformation under the conditions of the lower mantle have been difficult due to the difficulties in generating and measuring stress and strain under these conditions. The team has made various modifications to the deformation apparatus that was developed in their lab to conduct these deformation experiments. The results will provide the first data set to understand the whole Earth thermal and chemical history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rheological properties of the lower mantle will be investigated using a rotational Drickamer apparatus developed in in the PI's  laboratory. This apparatus, after numerous modifications, now allows his team to conduct large strain quantitative deformation experiments (to strain ~100-300%) under shallow lower mantle conditions (P to 28 GPa, T to 2200 K) providing the quantitative results on rheological behavior under these conditions. Not only the flow laws of each mineral, but also the microstructural evolution will be studied to provide the mechanisms of deformation and the nature of lattice-preferred orientation that can be used to interpret seismic anisotropy.</AbstractNarration>

We also developed a theory to estimate stress from the diffracted x-ray.  Two important results have been obtained.  (1) Deformation experiments of lower mantle minerals (P~27 GPa, T~2200 K) showed that among two minerals in the lower mantle, bridgmanite is substantially stronger than ferropericlase. This suggests strain weakening that would result in shear localization.  (2) Deformation experiments of olivine during its transformation to ringwoodite (P~17 GPa, T~1100 K) showed that newly formed fine-grained ringwoodite is substnatially weaker than olivine. This results implies that when small grained ringwoodite is forned in a cold subducted slabs, the slab will be come weak and this would allow cold slab to deform.
