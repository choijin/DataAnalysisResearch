<AbstractNarration>1509493&lt;br/&gt;Marr&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water treatment and wastewater treatment are the greatest engineering achievements of the 20th century in terms of public health. Wastewater systems have helped drastically reduce the incidence of enteric (gastrointestinal) disease, which remains a leading cause of childhood mortality in developing nations. The recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease has raised new concerns about the potential for exposure to the virus in wastewater, not only through direct contact but also through inhalation of aerosolized droplets. Prior work has shown that toilets, sewer systems, and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can generate bioaerosols. It is often assumed that medical care in the developed world is superior to that in less developed areas, but there are certain technological aspects that may in fact lead to less desirable consequences. Research is needed in order to determine the extent to which Ebola virus could in fact be aerosolized by wastewater systems, from the point of use at a toilet to the sewer environment and ultimately in WWTPs. There are several critical knowledge gaps regarding the potential for aerosolization of Ebola virus from wastewater systems. Prior studies have not examined the aerosolization of filamentous viruses from wastewater systems, and even fundamental information, such as the size distribution and total number of aerosols generated from wastewater systems, is not available. Partitioning of microorganisms from human waste to liquid, aerosols, and surfaces in wastewater systems has not been considered. Additionally, it is not known whether Ebola virus is able to survive after being aerosolized from wastewater. Given the high mortality rate of Ebola virus disease and the many unanswered questions surrounding aerosolization from wastewater, this research is critical for ensuring the safety of workers who may come into contact with wastewater. Results from this project will support practical solutions, such as installing toilet lids or informing recommendations for safe work practices and use of personal protective equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this research is to assess the potential for inhalation exposure to Ebola virus that is aerosolized during the regular operation and maintenance of wastewater systems. We will seed Ebola virus surrogates into three wastewater systems (flush toilets, a laboratory-scale sewer model, and a laboratory-scale aeration basin), quantify the amount aerosolized, and measure the size distribution of the carrier aerosols. Using this information, the PIs will predict the fate of the virus and the dose inhaled by nearby workers. The specific objectives are to (1) quantify the emission rate and size distribution of Ebola virus surrogates and total aerosols produced by wastewater systems; (2) determine the partitioning of Ebola virus surrogates between water, stool, and surfaces; (3) predict the fate of the aerosolized viruses and potential inhaled dose. This project will produce novel data about the number of aerosolized viruses and the size of the carrier aerosols produced by wastewater systems, including toilets, sewers, and aeration basins. Because aerosol size largely dictates fate in the atmosphere, this knowledge is critical for predicting the risk posed by aerosolization of Ebola virus from wastewater systems. While bioaerosol formation in sewers and WWTPs has been surveyed in the field, we will examine generation of bioaerosols for the first time under controlled laboratory conditions. This project will also produce novel information about the partitioning of an enveloped virus between water, solids, and surfaces in wastewater systems. Finally, this project will provide the first quantitative estimate of the potential for inhalation exposure to Ebola virus that is aerosolized during the regular operation and maintenance of wastewater systems.</AbstractNarration>

This result does not negate the possibility of infection by contact with large droplets that splash out of the toilet onto the floor, walls, toilet itself, and other nearby surfaces. Airborne concentrations of viruses in the models of a sewer and aeration basin ranged from 0.1 to 20 infectious virus particles per liter of air. Emission rates ranged from 0.3 to 550 infectious virus particles per minute from these models. Our results show that converging flows in sewer systems can aerosolize Ebola virus surrogates. The emission rate is lower than for the aeration basin, but the confined geometry of a sewer system may lead to higher concentrations and higher inhalation exposure. Under a certain set of assumptions, a sewer worker could be exposed 10 virions, the amount thought necessary to cause infection, in 12 hours. The effects of design of a sewer or wastewater treatment plant, such as flow rate, pipe size, and aeration rate, and wastewater composition on aerosol generation are not yet known. Another concern that is not addressed by this study is high-pressure cleaning, which is likely to generate aerosols, although such activity can be postponed until after an Ebola threat has passed.</p> <p>These results suggest that sewers and wastewater treatment plants can aerosolize Ebola virus and others of concern in wastewater. The results of this study add to the database of bacteria and virus concentrations in air around wastewater systems, and the emission factors can be used to predict virus concentrations in a variety of scenarios, such as outdoors using an atmospheric dispersion model or in an enclosed system whose air is assumed to be well mixed; both models would require an emission rate. Although the reported concentrations of Ebola virus surrogates in ambient air are low, they are sufficient to lead to inhalation exposure that would be of concern for Ebola virus. Aerosolization from toilets appears to present the lowest risk, while aerosolization in sewer systems and at wastewater treatment plants may be a concern if infectious virus is present.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/27/2017<br>      Modified by: Linsey&nbsp;C&nbsp;Marr</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1509493/1509493_10346759_1485534829659_LinTOC--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1509493/1509493_10346759_1485534829659_LinTOC--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Aerosolization of viruses"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1509493/1509493_10346759_1485534829659_LinTOC--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Aerosolization of viruses"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Viruses may be aerosolized from different types of wastewater systems: toilets, aeration basins at wastewater treatment plants, and sewers</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kaisen Lin and Linsey Marr</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Linsey&nbsp;C&nbsp;Marr</div> <div class="imageTitle">Aerosolization of viruses</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1509493/1509493_10346759_1485534758696_TOCart--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1509493/1509493_10346759_1485534758696_TOCart--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Virus in wastewater"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1509493/1509493_10346759_1485534758696_TOCart--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Virus in wastewater"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Whether Ebola virus surrogates can be aerosolized from wastewater depends on whether they stay in the water or stick to solids</div> <div class="imageCredit">Linsey Marr and Mari Lee</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Linsey&nbsp;C&nbsp;Marr</div> <div class="imageTitle">Virus in wastewater</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1509493/1509493_10346759_1485534649486_FAQfigure--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1509493/1509493_10346759_1485534649486_FAQfigure--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Aerosol size"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1509493/1509493_10346759_1485534649486_FAQfigure--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Aerosol size"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Range of sizes of aerosols and droplets compared to a human hair</div> <div class="imageCredit">Linsey Marr</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Linsey&nbsp;C&nbsp;Marr</div> <div class="imageTitle">Aerosol size</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
