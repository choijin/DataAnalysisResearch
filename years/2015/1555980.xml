<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project will study the "smart grid" - with advanced- or "smart" metering technologies at its core and its adoption by communities seeking a more efficient, responsive, and sustainable energy system. Smart meter implementation across the U.S. has been intermittent and uneven and the reasons for this are poorly understood. This study will explore the impacts of the new technology, and the social and institutional dynamics that facilitate and impede its implementation at different levels of social organization. The project will synthesis field theory and transition theory to understand smart meter implementation, and more broadly, the transformation of the American electricity system. It is significant because it will contribute to our understanding of the rapidly evolving smart meter field and of energy transitions more generally. The proposed research will benefit society because it will provide practitioners, policymakers, and researchers with insight into the field-level factors and processes that facilitate and impede the implementation of smart meters - widely seen as key to an efficient, secure, and sustainable energy system in the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study examines relational dynamics in an emerging sociotechnical field, focusing on the case of smart meters. The objective of the proposed research is to investigate inter-organizational conflict and cooperation that have led to the uneven development of smart metering systems. The study proposes a nested research design and triangulated multi-method approach aiming to 1) investigate inter-organizational relations that structure and produce a state?s contemporary smart meter field; 2) conduct in-depth studies of four smart meter projects that illustrate different successes and failures; and 3) build and analyze a quantitative dataset containing national- and state-level information on smart meter implementation and its relationship to public and private funding, knowledge production, technological innovation, and governance. Results will be disseminated to practitioners, including interview partners in government, private businesses, and utility companies. When complete, the quantitative dataset and related metadata will be also made available to interested individuals through the project website.</AbstractNarration>

In this context, many see the "smart grid" &ndash; with advanced- or "smart" metering technologies at its core &ndash; as the key to a more efficient, responsive, and sustainable energy system.

To date, this study has generated transcripts of 52 in-depth interviews with Washington-based advocacy groups, public and private electrical utilities, technology firms, university and national laboratories, and consumer advocacy groups; complementing the interviews are secondary-source data consisting of organizational websites and annual reports, publications and whitepapers, datasets published by federal entities such as the Department of Energy, and industry trends data.

These studies assess consumer motivation for engaging in utility programs, consumer trust in utilities and strategies for increasing trust, and privacy concerns in the context of household energy management.     Key findings that emerged from this study include the following:     Opposition to smart meters is fueled by a discourse of "energy populism" that calls rhetorical attention to anti-elitism and inequality, victimization of "regular people", ownership of electricity use data, and centralization as unintended consequences of the energy transition. Within the smart meter field, innovation is occurring through multi-level institutional processes and interactions, with public, rather than privately-owned utilities, heavily shaping innovation outcomes. Our research also confirms that American trust in utilities is generally low &ndash; significantly lower than in other institutional actors &ndash; and that trust is associated with willingness to participate in utility programs.       Our experimental research also finds, more specifically, that:     motivations for participating in utility programs varies with political ideology &ndash; with conservatives generally more driven by financial motivations and liberals by both financial and environmental concern. utility investments in renewable energy had the strongest, most consistent effect on consumer trust. But that for Americans in general, utility prosocial behavior and improvements in communications/customer service had no effect on consumer trust in utilities.       Broader Impacts   This study shines new light on a poorly understood set of social phenomenon: how consumers, organizations, social movements, and governments are responding to and shaping an emerging technology &ndash; smart meters &ndash; that is a key component of the contemporary energy transition. The study offers the potential to bridge seldom-connected methodologies and theoretical approaches, train graduate and undergraduate students in diverse research experiences, contribute to the ongoing public conversation about energy distribution and use, and guide policy decisions in ways that increase organizational efficiency and technological diffusion.
