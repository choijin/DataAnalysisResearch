<AbstractNarration>1509432 (Mason)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is an emerging gaseous fuel combustion method in which carbon dioxide (CO2) can be separated from other components in the flue gas, enabling a low-cost and efficient separation and capture of CO2.  The potential success of this project will help avoid negative impact on the earth's atmosphere and climate.  The proposed activities will also promote training and learning activities by involving undergraduate and graduate students in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge gap is known to exist among molecular-level details about the surface science of oxygen carriers of CLC. While candidate batch studies have helped identify carriers, details of structure-reactivity relationships and the intermediate heterogeneous steps involved in the fuel oxidation are yet unknown.  The proposed study aims to enhance the understanding of the fundamental reaction mechanisms involved in important heterogeneous processes of CLC and related catalytic applications.  The thermodynamic stability of oxygen carriers will be assessed through experimental and theoretical methods and trends between carrier structure, composition, durability, and reactivity will be identified.  The knowledge thus gained may drive the future rational design of materials for CLC and related applications.  The methane fuel and its C-H bond activation related to many other reaction activities will be studied.  Chemical synthesis and the replacement of petrochemical feed stocks by alkanes will also be investigated, expanding the potential impact of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is an emerging combustion technology to generate energy from burning fossil fuels such that the produced CO2 is inherently separated. This is achieved by using solid oxygen carriers based on transition metal oxides, as opposed to burning in air. An obstacle to scaling up CLC is optimization of the oxygen carriers.  Over the course of this project, we used a combined experimental and theoretical approach to compare the performance of different transition metal oxides, namely iron, copper, cobalt, manganese, and nickel oxides, as oxygen carriers in CLC using methane (CH4) as the reducing agent. Experiments used a continuous flow reactor at variable temperatures from 500 to 800 oC and feed flow rates ranging from 12.5 to 250 h-1 . The experiments were carried out systematically to isolate and probe the effects of particle size, operation temperature, and flow rate on the performance trends for CH4 conversion to CO2. Microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, along with complementary quantum chemical modeling at the density functional theory (DFT) level, were used to investigate the solid-state mechanism of oxygen carrier reduction and the coupled surface chemical and bulk material processes influencing performance.  The research conducted through this project revealed that different reduction mechanisms occur, and this can be related to the size-dependent behavior of the oxygen carrier. Furthermore, the modeling work demonstrates how to relate the inherent geometry and electronic structure of the transition metal oxide to the experimentally observed reduction mechanism, and this accomplishment enables a means for predicting oxygen carrier performance trends computationally.  Transition metal oxides are a ubiquitous class of materials in nature and technology, and therefore the scientific outcomes relate to fields such as mineralogy and heterogeneous catalysis.  Several graduate students were supported by this project, and were trained to work on a collaborative, multi-disciplinary project related to cleaner energy technology development and fundamental science. Results were disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences. The venues of the publications and presentations reflect the collaborative nature of the project, and spanned chemical and chemical engineering audiences.  The project also supported the development and offering of a freshmen seminar course on the topic of "Energy and the Environment," in which students engaged in readings and discussions of topics such as energy basics, energy and climate, energy storage/distribution, and energy efficient buildings. Students received training in critical problem solving skills and systems-level thinking. The class culminated in a presentation project, in which students presented a chosen research topic using a poster and oral remarks. Faculty and graduate students attended the poster session, and interacted with the students through discussions and feedback.
