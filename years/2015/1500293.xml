<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a novel bridge column system to fill the need for cost-effective and sustainable bridges that are resilient to natural and man-made hazards such as earthquakes, terrorist attacks, vessel collisions/fires, and corrosive environments.  The hybrid metal-glass composite column system is important because our nation is in critical need for durable and safe transportation infrastructure.  Conventional structural materials, such as reinforced concrete and steel, are vulnerable to various hazards and environmental conditions.  Traditional bridge construction methods are expensive, time consuming, and cause major traffic interruptions.  This product enables accelerated construction of new bridges, increased work zone safety, and reduction of travel delays, which optimizes the stewardship of public funds to grow the nation?s infrastructure.  The project will result in the proof-of-concept of a novel hybrid composite column system.  This hybrid composite system integrates the unique energy dissipation of steel material, the excellent strength-to-weight ratio of glass fibers, and the exceptional durability of polymeric resins.  These features provide the following advantages:  superior structural performance, durability, cost-efficiency, and ease of construction when compared to the leading competing systems like conventional concrete-filled FRP tube (CFFT) systems in this market space.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) understanding morphology of hybrid steel-glass composites, 2) validating superior structural performance of the column system, 3) developing reliable structural design methodology, and 4) identifying and addressing potential scalability and manufacturing difficulties.  A series of structural experiments will be performed on tubes with diverse composite architecture under various loading conditions.  This will be complemented by high fidelity finite element simulations to optimize the design of the prototype.  After finalizing the design, structural testing of a large-scale bridge column will be performed.  In addition, personnel involved in this project including multiple graduate and undergraduate students, some from underrepresented groups, will receive entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through collaboration with industry partners and communication with Departments of Transportation and bridge construction companies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages NOV Fiber Glass Systems to provide expertise in manufacturing of filament wound composite tubes and access to their testing facility in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>
