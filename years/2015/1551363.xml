<AbstractNarration>A grant is awarded to Iowa State University for research into the evolution of bacterial operons. Many bacterial proteins work together in the same metabolic pathway, and/or as a complex. In many cases, the genes coding for these proteins are clustered together on the chromosome are under a common controlling mechanism, and are transcribed into a single RNA molecule from which the proteins are translated. It is estimated that, depending on the individual genome, between 5 and 25% of bacterial genes reside in operons. Work will explore whether the construction and/or destruction of clusters of co-transcribed genes takes place as a sequential series of events that can be identified. This research will identify the events that happen in operon evolution through comparative genome analyses of a large number of bacterial genomes. These events include gene gain, gene loss, lateral gene transfer, and different types of changes in the genomic structure. The questions which will be answered are: which are the determining events of operon evolution? Are there events that are more and less dominant in defining a change over time in operons? Are these events universal, or vary between operons and different bacterial genera? If the latter, which are the varying dominant events and what can we learn about operon evolution from studying them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to simultaneously control the transcription of related genes is a strong genetic mechanism that influences bacterial life and functionality on many levels. Understanding how operons evolve will provide insight into one of the most basic and prevalent bacterial genetic structures. This, in turn, will help us better understand the evolution bacteria, which constitute the most diverse and influential of life's domains. This study enables the introduction of new hypotheses to understanding how operons evolve, and proposes that different operons may have evolved using different mechanisms that can be identified. This project, at the interface of computational science and biology, will train undergraduate and graduate students, including programs that support minority education and research. The result of this project will be disseminated through a freely-accessible database describing operons and their evolutionary trajectories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELLECTUAL MERIT: How do complex organs and other living entities evolve? Darwin has addressed this point in Origin of Species (1863): "To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems... absurd in the highest degree."  Reducing the complexity of a problem without eliminating its essence is how scientists approach such involved problems.  We have decided to look at the evolution of complex entities in the bacterial genomes: genes that work together to form complex structures or protein machineries that a single gene cannot. Often in bacteria, these genes are coded on the same stretch of chromosome consecutively, like words in a sentence.   We investigated the evolution of operons under the assumption that the genes composing an operon were initially functioning and coding separately, but that gradually coming together over many generations provided a measure of synergy and increased fitness that separate genes cannot. We identified three types of events that can take place in the evolution of an operon: (1)  genes join each other on the operon (joins) (2) genes get removed from the operon (deletions)  (3) Genes get duplicated in the operon (duplications).   We then examined  related bacterial species for groups of genes that have partial operons: blocks of genes that have more than one "word" of the "sentence', but not the entire "sentence". These partial gene blocks may have some functional utility, even if they do not fulfill the entire function of the operon.

We called these partial gene blocks "orthologous gene blocks" or "orthoblocks".  Once we established groups of orthblocks, we examined how conserved they were between bacterial species in a large group of proteobacteria, and whether that conservation was related to their functionality. We discovered that orthoblocks related to vital cellular function: such as DNA transcription to RNA, or H+-ATPases (vital energy machinery) are highly consrved between species. In fact, there were no partial orthoblocks of H+ ATPases or transcriptional machinery. This tells us that the evoltuion of these operons predates the common ancestor of the proteobacteria we examined. At the same time, orthoblocks for genes having to do with adaptation to the environment, and especially to extreme environments, are not well conserved.
