<AbstractNarration>One of the great engineering challenges of the modern era is to create nanometer-scale structures and devices with high throughput and reproducibility.  In nanoelectronics, the speed and density of devices have been the driving forces behind the increased resolution and capabilities of traditional top-down methods.  The ability to maintain this trajectory is predicated upon the development of novel fabrication methods.  This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award supports the development of a hybrid approach that couples a key aspect of conventional lithography, the ability to create complex architectures over large areas, to the resolution afforded by molecular self-assembly.  The goal of this work is to create new economical nanomanufacturing techniques for the electronics and communications industries.  Given the interdisciplinary nature of this project, undergraduate students will learn to communicate across disciplines and will receive broad scientific and technical training in preparation for their careers beyond the University of North Florida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the molecular-ruler process, conventional lithography is combined with the selective deposition of multilayers that are comprised of bifunctional thiol molecules and metal ions.  The chemical multilayer defines the nanometer-scale spacings of the lithographically patterned surface structures.  This hybrid approach is inherently parallel and, hence, scalable and can be integrated into existing lithographic methods.  The molecular-ruler process has great potential as a fabrication technique, however its general effectiveness and reproducibility is limited by the quality of the multilayer.  This award will support an investigation of extending the capabilities of the molecular-ruler process by utilizing self- and directed-assembly strategies.  Bifunctional thiol molecules will be designed and synthesized for use in metal-ligated multilayers.  Monolayers and metal-ligated multilayers will be assembled, and their structure and quality will be characterized using a range of surface analytical techniques.  Combining the molecular-ruler process with atomic force lithography, devices with single-nanometer interconnects within tailored nanogaps will be fabricated and their electronic behavior will be characterized.  This hybrid strategy for the fabrication of nanogaps should provide a general and widely applicable methodology to produce well defined, registered nanometer scale features. Additionally, this award will support the interdisciplinary training of undergraduate students in the areas of organic synthesis, analytical surface science, and electronic device fabrication and characterization.</AbstractNarration>

The chemical multilayer defines the nanometer-scale spacings of the lithographically patterned surface structures. This hybrid approach is inherently parallel and scalable and can be integrated into existing lithographic processes. This project explored extending the capabilities of the molecular-ruler process by utilizing self- and directed-assembly strategies.  The intellectual merit of this project was in advancing the understanding of nanostructure creation by combining top-down and bottom-up strategies, which is important for connecting, operating, designing, and optimizing nanoscale-scale devices and architectures.  We explored the use of methyl-terminated alkanethiol molecules as the terminating layers of metal-ligated multilayers used in the molecular-ruler process.  Molecules with other chemical functionalities could greatly expand the overall versatility, and thus the utility, of this process. We discovered that the solution deposition of alkanethiol molecules resulted in low surface coverages (~40%) with features that varied drastically in height. Because such structures are not conducive to the production of uniform nanogaps, the vapor-phase deposition of alkanethiol molecules was explored. Unlike the solution-phase deposition, alkanethiol islands produced by vapor-phase deposition exhibited markedly higher surface coverages (&gt;80%) of uniform heights. To illustrate the applicability of this method, metal-ligated multilayers, both with and without an alkanethiol capping layer, were utilized to create nanogaps between Au features using the molecular ruler process.   We explored the assembly of metal-ligated multilayers used in the molecular-ruler process on Si substrates.  Patterning on Si substrates is of interest as Si substrates are more compatible with traditional semiconductor manufacturing.  Our key insight was to oxidize the terminal functional groups of a preexisting organosilane self-assembled monolayer (SAM) to enable the growth of the metal-ligated multilayers.  We demonstrated, via spectroscopic ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM), that the growth of the metal-ligated multilayers only occurred when the preexisting SAM was oxidized.  We utilized these metal-ligated multilayers on Si substrates to enhance the chemical patterning technique known as nanoshaving.  Nanoshaving is a scanning probe lithographic technique that generates patterns by moving an AFM tip in a predetermined track at a relatively high force setpoint to induce desorption within a chemical film.  Although nanoshaving has been previously employed to generate organosilane chemical nanopatterns on Si substrates, extremely high force setpoints (~&mu;N) are required to break the Si-O bonds of the organosilane-oxide interface.  These extreme force setpoints rapidly dull atomic force microscopy tips and degrade the resolution of the resulting nanopatterns.  We circumvented this limitation by nanoshaving on metal-ligated multilayers, which required relatively low force setpoints (~nN). The interface between the preexisting oxidized organosilane SAM and the Cu-ligated MHDA multilayer provides a natural low-force breakpoint for nanoshaving.  The resulting patterns functioned as chemical resists for defining metal nanostructures.   The broader impacts of this work relate to enabling and facilitating economical nanoscale pattering in the electronics and communications industries.  In this context, nine undergraduate research students at University of North Florida received a broad, diverse, and unique research and learning experience by participating in this project.  Five of these students were co-authors on published papers and six of students presented their research at conferences with the support of the grant.  At the completion of the grant, six students have graduated from UNF and four of these students have gone on to pursue graduate degrees in chemistry, pharmacy, and physics.
