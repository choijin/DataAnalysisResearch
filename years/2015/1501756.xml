<AbstractNarration>2015 marks the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the landmark civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination and ensures equal opportunity and access for persons with disabilities. Although progress has been made during the last two and a half decades, people with disabilities continue to be employed at rates much lower than the rest of the population. This is especially true of Americans who are deaf or hard-of-hearing (d/hh). Being employed in STEM provides a great benefit for d/hh people, since overall d/hh people in STEM occupations earn 31% more than d/hh people in non-STEM fields, and being employed in STEM reduces the earning gap between deaf and hearing employees. This center, DeafTEC, aims to increase the access for d/hh individuals to career information, to a technical education, and to unrestricted employment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DeafTEC will impact the knowledge and attitudes of d/hh students, as well as high school teachers, community college faculty, parents, counselors and employers, in terms of the educational and employment opportunities and options available. The Center's professional development experiences will improve the instructional expertise of high school and community college teachers in STEM subjects to provide greater access to learning for these students, as well as help employers develop the sensitivity and skills to successfully integrate d/hh technicians into the workplace. DeafTEC will also expand its reach to veterans with hearing loss by developing, with their local community colleges and veterans programs, resources on best practices for teaching this underserved audience. The Center will:&lt;br/&gt;(1) develop expanded partnerships in targeted regions of the country among high schools, community colleges, and industry to improve access to technological education and employment for d/hh students;&lt;br/&gt;(2) develop new curricula for national dissemination related to STEM careers for middle and high school students, job readiness for community college students, and best practices for teaching d/hh students in STEM subjects for general teacher preparation programs;&lt;br/&gt;(3) provide professional development resources for community college faculty on best practices for teaching military veterans with hearing loss;&lt;br/&gt;(4) develop an expanded website to serve as a clearinghouse for information related to technical education and technician careers for d/hh students; and&lt;br/&gt;(5) continue to expand a national STEM dual credit program to improve pathways for d/hh students to transition from high school to college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DeafTEC's  emphasis on universal design, developmental math and writing across the STEM curriculum can benefit all students in need of additional resources and support. The partnerships established among high schools, community colleges, and employers can also serve as a model that can be replicated in other regions as well as with other groups of underserved students.</AbstractNarration>

DeafTEC aims to broaden the participation in technician careers among deaf/hh individuals by providing them, as well as their teachers, counselors, employers, and co-workers, with the resources that will help them succeed both in the classroom and on the job.  During this renewal grant, DeafTEC has focused on capacity building and the creation of an infrastructure through:    Regional partnerships to cooperatively promote best practices in educating and employing deaf/hh individuals. A comprehensive website that will ultimately serve as a clearinghouse for information related to technical education and technician careers for deaf/hh students, their parents, teachers and employers. An expansion of its national dual credit program, Project Fast Forward. The development of new curricula for national dissemination. The creation of resources for community college faculty on best practices for teaching military veterans with hearing loss.

In February 2020, Project Fast Forward transitioned to a fully institutionalized pre-college program in NTID’s Division of Academic Affairs.  Under this DeafTEC renewal period, Project Fast Forward has:  Increased the number partner schools from 28 to 41 high schools in 25 States Offered professional development to 22 high school counselors Offered professional development to 85 teachers Increased STEM dual credit course offerings from 10 to 13 Offered 179 STEM dual credit course sections in high schools Registered 1,089 students in STEM dual credit courses Awarded 2,037 college credits to 679 students who passed STEM dual credit courses    DeafTEC Website (www.deaftec.org)   This comprehensive website serves as a national resource on technical education and technician careers for deaf/hh students, their parents, teachers and future employers. Materials on the website include:     STEM awareness and employment materials featuring videos of deaf STEM professionals and information on technician careers. Employer resources to help employers hire, onboard and create inclusive environments for deaf/hh employees including an online course for employers, coworkers, HR business leaders, and other inclusion/diversity professionals on these topics. Best practices for instruction that provides extensive resources on effective strategies for teaching deaf/hh students, strategies for writing in the STEM discipline, and strategies for teaching math which includes over 60 accessible math tutorial videos STEM sign video dictionary includes signs for information technology, lab sciences and math    Online Curriculum   STEM Career Awareness curriculum. This four-unit, 30-lesson curriculum aims to increase the educators’ abilities to teach introductory STEM concepts specifically to deaf/hh middle and high school students.
