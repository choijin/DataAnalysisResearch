<AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to understand expert secondary mathematics teachers' knowledge for teaching exponential functions. In particular, the study examines how mathematics knowledge for teaching is used by teachers as they are teaching students' and the factors that influence their interactions with students. The project is recruiting teachers in order to observe their teaching of exponential functions units in Algebra II, Pre-Calculus, and College Algebra courses in high schools. They will conduct classroom observations throughout the teaching of the unit and conduct interviews with the teachers before and after each unit. The project builds on other frameworks for understanding mathematics knowledge for teaching. Other studies have focused more frequently on elementary or middle school teachers. The contribution of this work is to understand the mathematics content teachers are using in high school in their work with students. Exponential functions are a common topic in the three high school courses and a foundational topic for students' learning of algebra and calculus. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research questions for the study focus on the decisions expert teachers draw on while making decisions related to teaching exponential functions, the mathematics knowledge for teaching they use to make decision, and the factors that influence the quality of those decisions and students' opportunity to reason mathematically. They are recruiting expert teachers who have taught the courses for at least two years and are recognized as high quality teachers. The data collected include video data from classroom observations and pre-observation and post-observation interviews. The questions to be asked in interviews focus on teachers' decision-making and will probe for their mathematics knowledge for teaching. Mathematics knowledge for teaching includes how teachers' knowledge that supports their planning, instruction, and assessment of students' mathematical reasoning. The study also provides a research methodology that could be used to study mathematics knowledge for teaching in other secondary mathematics topics.</AbstractNarration>

Describing teacher knowing is describing their decisions which involves answering: 1. What mathematical world emerges from the teachers? doing? 2. What is the teacher activity that brings forth this world in planning and in-the-moment decisions? 3. What is the underlying cognition that tells the teacher that what they are doing is fitting?  We developed protocols to describe the mathematical world and ideas that emerge from the mathematical discourse and activity of the classroom. Classroom observation analysis methods focus on the mathematical ideas that emerge in the classroom discourse and the teacher decisions which influence their emergence.  After identifying decisions, we can ask a variety of analysis questions such as: to what extent did the decisions 1) lead to coherence among the mathematical ideas? 2) support access to the mathematical ideas?  We focused on the mathematical ideas related to writing an equation to represent an exponential function and the corresponding decisions connected to these ideas using the following questions.   1. With respect to the equation of an exponential function, what is the nature of the mathematical ideas promoted in the whole class discussion (WCD)? What core mathematical ideas are developed? What connections are made among ideas, concepts, and skills to form and justify the ideas? 2. What instructional actions from the teacher support the mathematics to emerge and to be coherent, connected, and comprehensible? 3. What rationale motivate the actions?  The answers to these questions provide a comprehensive description of the knowing of high school mathematics teachers for teaching this topic of exponential functions.  For our in-depth analysis of three teachers? decisions related to teaching students about the equation of an exponential function, we found the teachers promoted three themes of ideas.   1. The situations discussed in class are growing exponentially. The relationship between the variables is an exponential function. 2. There are options in how to define the independent variable. The choice of how to define the independent variable will affect the equation of the function. 3. Because the situations involve repeated multiplication, the equations will take an exponential form of y=a*(b)x where a is the starting value and b is the constant multiplier. The definitions of y and x varied among the classes.  We found the role of the exponent in a*(b)x had the potential to unite these three themes. Teachers discussed the exponent in two ways: (1) the exponent counts the number of multiplications of a by b and (2) the exponent is a transformation of the independent variable. Both ideas could contribute to a definition of exponential functions. While the connections between these ideas were not made visible in two classrooms, one teacher included an explicit discussion of the relationship between these ideas.  Our work resulted in a description for how mathematical ideas that emerge in a classroom and the decisions the teacher made to support that emergence describe a teacher?s MKT, a collection of research questions to examine the impacts of the decisions on various aspects of a mathematics classroom, and explicit descriptions of teachers? MKT for teaching students about the equation of an exponential function. We noticed three things for the field to consider with respect to MKT.
