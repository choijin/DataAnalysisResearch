<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS) 2016" that will be held from May 23-27, 2016, on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the thirty-sixth installment of the Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group of over one-hundred mathematicians whose primary research interests are in operator theory or the theory of operator algebras. Some of the main foci of the 2016 event are the following: deformation/rigidity theory; free probability; recent advances in operator theory; classification of C*-algebras; noncommutative geometry; noncommutative probability; C*-algebras and dynamical systems; operator spaces and their applications. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This conference grant has brought together researchers from the theory of operator algebras and quantum information theory. Traditionally GPOTS, the great plain operator theory symposium, serves the operator algebra and operator theory community  for updates on recent research. The conference is repeated on a yearly basis. The conference also provides an important forum to promote young researchers and students. This particular  conference had a number of guest speakers from the Quantum Information Theory community. Quantum information theory and operator algebras share certain fundamental concepts which are used very differently in both fields. More recent connection have been found in recent years, and these new connections played an important role is some of the key note lectures. Beyond the connection to quantum information theory, the talks tried cover the different research directions within operator algebras including noncommutative geometry, free probability, deformation-rigidity theory, classification theory and combinatorial aspects of operator algebra theory.   The grant supporting the GPOTS conference series is an important infrastructure contribution from the funding agency, and helps to maintain and grow a striving research community with an outward look to applications.     In the last year funding was used for visitors which provide an update on research presented during the GPOTS conference.
