<AbstractNarration>The construction industry has been suffering from the lack of real-time performance monitoring, holistic project management, labor efficiency, and waste-preventive tools. This has led to cost overruns in almost 90 percent of construction projects with an average of 28 percent higher than forecast costs. This research project is expected to facilitate a transformative change in the ways that construction activities and operations are tracked and monitored. It will play a significant role in future rapid, nonintrusive and cost effective data acquisition capacity due to the use of audio signals instead of active sensors or digital cameras. Eventually the incurred efficiencies, sustainability benefits, and reduced costs of an automated project monitoring system will significantly benefit the U.S. Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Facilities Management industry. Success in this project also promises significant impacts to engineering education. The project's educational activities are highly integrated and inter-related with the research activities. The research results will be used to create educational material and will be made publicly available to educators at other institutions. The research results will also be integrated into the outreach and engagement activities and will result in engaging minorities and underrepresented groups through various programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite recent advances in developing and implementing audio signal processing techniques for analyzing and modeling complex systems and processes, the real added value and potential applications of audio signals are still unknown to the civil engineering research community. This project is the first attempt to introduce audio signals as an alternative source of information for recognizing, tracking and monitoring construction operations at jobsites. Current approaches for recognizing and monitoring construction operations are either location-based or machine-vision-based, and implying audio signals is a significant leap to overcome their limitations. The framework provides the missing link between generic signal processing and construction performance monitoring. This project will expand the research horizons for academics in civil infrastructure systems as well as in digital signal processing domains. Particularly, this scientific breakthrough will set the stage for future research in automatically identifying and life-logging construction operations and equipment actions, estimating project performance indices, and creating corrective measures to keep the project performance as planned. This, in turn, will enable the future development of novel, automated applications for construction sequence analysis, productivity measuring, project monitoring and control systems, and maintenance decision making.</AbstractNarration>

In this framework, an audio recording system is placed at a jobsite, and once in place, used to track the locations and usage level of various pieces of equipment in real-time. This can provide a beneficial tool by enabling automatic measurements of the amount of accomplished work, downtime, and other factors.

The use of audio as the primary source of input data has crucial advantages including a manageable data stream size, minimal cost and intrusiveness, and operability in both day and night and under harsh conditions (e.g., compared to video-based monitoring).   The first key step involved in this project was to develop a framework for processing, denoising, and isolating the audio components corresponding to individual machines (from recordings which may contain a mixture of various pieces of equipment operating simultaneously). The next key step involved developing classification methods for recognizing various forms of construction activity for each machine from the isolated/processed recordings using machine learning algorithms that learn the classifier from training data. The final key step involved developing higher-level tools for analyzing and visualizing equipment utilization.  We have made significant contributions related to each of the major goals of the project as listed above, including the development of new signal processing techniques for detection and classification of various machinery using audio and that can be utilized in new environments without the need for extensive training data or labels.  Specific activities included: -Demonstrating, as a proof of concept, that a proposed method for classifying construction equipment activity using a denoised short-time frequency representation and support vector machines can be highly effective. -Exploring methods of processing to isolate different pieces of equipment when multiple pieces of equipment are simultaneously active. This included exploring a mixture of signal processing tools and hardware modifications to see what is possible, including various forms of blind-source separation combined with microphone array processing and possible the use of equipment-mounted contact microphones. Using multiple microphones, we developed a system that detected the angle and approximate range of a each piece of equipment using data captured at a real-world construction site. -A weakness of previous approaches to training classifiers arose due to the fact that we must assign an activity label at a very fine level of granularity in time.  This presents difficulty, since in many time periods during different activities, the acoustic signal is virtually indistinguishable (e.g., when a machine is idling).  To address this we have developed more sophisticated techniques which are based on classifying an entire block/window of time, which necessitated the development of new algorithmic approaches.   The novel approaches to training the classifier are of particular benefit and are a significant technical contribution.  In order to make an audio-based construction monitoring system useful, it must require little to no training in the field.  Any required labeling or other preparation should be robust and simple.  The techniques for training classifiers that were developed as part of this project have the several advantages: -Only weak labels are required--this means that rather than labeling specific sounds, the system can work with labels that apply to an entire time period, whether or not the machine was active during that entire time period. An example of a weak label is labeling a 30-second sound clip as "machine digging" even if the digging was only intermittent and for a fraction of the entire clip. -The training data can have background noise and multiple target sounds and it automatically sorts the various sources and noises into "different bins" so that it can learn specific sounds even in the presence of interference. -The classifier is efficient and quick to train, making it possible to transition the training and operation to an embedded system.   This project provided a proof-of-concept that an audio-based construction site monitoring system is indeed feasible. While there still remains additional development work to turn this into a commercially viable system, we believe that this project provided a foundation for such future work.
