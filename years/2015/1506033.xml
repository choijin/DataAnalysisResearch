<AbstractNarration>Observations indicate that 80% of the matter in the Universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary "dark matter" particles that do not emit or absorb light. Remarkably, particle physics theories proposed for other reasons predict the existence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) with just the right properties to be this dark matter. If WIMPs are the dark matter, they may be detectable when they scatter in Earth-based detectors. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will help train undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs in a multidisciplinary field using techniques at the leading edge of measurement technologies with applications in areas of great societal interest. Furthermore, the project will support the preparation of Native American students for post-secondary education in science and engineering, with the goal of improving the diversity of the nation's scientific workforce through the group's participation in the GEAR-UP program at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and to distinguish them from backgrounds. The high background rejection that the SuperCDMS technology offers provides significant advantages compared to other technologies, yielding world-leading sensitivity to low-mass dark matter and multiple-target complementarity in a single experiment. To achieve the full sensitivity, it will be critical to reduce the radon-induced backgrounds of the experiment. This award will enable the PI to develop and implement cost-effective means to mitigate the concentration of radon in air, in particular for the underground cleanroom to be used for installation of the SuperCDMS SNOLAB detectors. The group will continue its leadership of SuperCDMS Soudan data analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided support for one graduate student at 75% time (Mr. Joseph Street for most of the time, and Mr. Michael Bowles in Year 4), ten undergraduates over the length of the grant, and 50% of the salary of a post-doctoral research associate (at first Dr. Ray Bunker, mostly Dr. Eric Miller), for work on the multi-institution SuperCDMS experiment, which is attempting to detect the dark matter that is believed to make up 85% of Universe?s mass.  The group led or contributed to many key results, with Dr. Bunker coordinating analysis of the experiment data for the entire collaboration over the first months of this grant.  The group contributed to analyses of experiment data that set new limits on low-mass dark matter interactions, and new limits on dark matter interactions with Ge.  They also contributed to analyses increasing understanding of the detectors, including leading the completion of analysis to calibrate the energy scales for nuclear recoils interacting in SuperCDMS Si detectors.     Operation of SuperCDMS detectors demonstrated the detectors' ability to achieve sensitivity to extremely low energy deposits through lowering the detectors? transition temperature and/or operating the detectors at high voltage bias.  These two demonstrations indicate the power of this detector technology for future searches for dark matter.  The group made strong contributions to a paper demonstrating the expected sensitivity of the upcoming SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment.     The group performed research and development of a system to remove radon from breathable air and demonstrated a method to add low-radon humidification.  Radon in the air is expected to cause events that may mimic dark matter interactions, so the ability to create low-radon spaces for detector assembly is critical to future experiments.  The group developed several improvements to the radon-reduction system, which achieved the milestone of producing the lowest radon concentration reported (since eclipsed by another group).  Since radon in air has significant impact on health, this system may also provide a spin-off technology.  The group built (and prepared for the shipping of) a radon-reduction system for the SuperCDMS SNOLAB project and demonstrated that the system exceeds project goals while operating at SDSMT.     The group also performed measurements to test the SuperCDMS SNOLAB system for removing radon from inside the detector?s shielding.  They designed, assembled and used a system to measure radon diffusion through gasket materials, and used equipment they had assembled under another grant to measure radon emanation from gaskets, allowing choice of the material for the experiment?s anti-radon shield.     The group performed several measurements to help ensure that present or future manufacturing of detectors achieves required low levels of radioactivity.  They measured the radioactivity levels of parts for SuperCDMS SNOLAB. They demonstrated that radon-daughter plateout onto detectors while in their polishing slurry would be negligible.  They determined that a new method of etching contamination from detector sidewalls, which otherwise is expected to dominate backgrounds for SuperCDMS SNOLAB at low energies, is highly effective.  They determined that plateout onto Teflon is 10?100x worse than onto most other materials, and they determined methods to mitigate the problem.     Broader impacts of this project include development of a laboratory exercise on radioactivity in air for high school students, with outreach to high school students including a group of Native American high school students, as well as public talks on dark matter and radioactivity in air.     Ten undergraduates, four post-baccalaureate students, and two high school students gained useful research experience and training while contributing to the research supported by the grant.
