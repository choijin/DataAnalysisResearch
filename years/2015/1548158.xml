<AbstractNarration>Georgia's largest export in 2013, at $6.75 Billion, was aerospace products and parts. Exports from this sector grew by 19.8% in that year alone. Historically, machine tool technology has always been a foundational underpinning of manufacturing and this is especially true in the aerospace industry. While there is a national shortage of workers available with multi-axis CNC skills, and industry's demand for them is continuing to increase, the advanced training required to produce them remains unavailable. Professional development for machine tool instructors will directly address this problem by building the capacity for industry-recognized training at technical colleges and 4-year institutions involved in the Coalition of Machine Tool Technology Programs of Georgia (COMP-GA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Athens Technical College (ATC) in conjunction with COMP-GA and Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU) are creating a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Advanced Multi-axis Programming (CAMP) certificate program, to enhance the quality of Georgia's machine tool technology programs. Machine tool instructors from majorly rural areas in Georgia are receiving formal training from the renowned Vincennes University (VU) in Indiana to help sharpen their expertise in the field. Instructors are learning how to set-up, program, and use advanced multi-axis CNC machines, to incorporate the industry-recognized certification in to their classroom curriculums. COMP-GA and SPSU are partnering with the Regional Advanced Machining Partnership (RAMP) and Central Maine Community College (CMCC) who are also NSF/ATE recipients currently developing an advanced machining certificate. The CAMP project is responding to industry needs for trained workers, and meeting the specific demands of the aerospace industry in Georgia. The CAMP project is disseminating knowledge among Georgia machine tool programs while providing a model for working with four-year institutions to determine best practices for technical education. Machine Tool educators are learning to sustain technical instruction and maintain relevancy in the field. The professional development activities are influencing curriculums designs, and participants are creating strong foundations and practices that are benefiting the workforce in Georgia. The partnership between COMP-GA and SPSU is increasing the participation of underrepresented groups, including women and minorities, as all students matriculating are accessing greater job opportunities with higher rates of pay.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Due to the statewide and national demand for highly-skilled multi-axis technicians/workers in Georgia, Athens Technical College (ATC) a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) In conjunction with Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU), a four-year public institution, now part of Kennesaw State University (KSU) in the University System of Georgia, applied to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and received a small grant for Advanced Technical Education (ATE). This grant funded the collaborative grant "CNC Advanced Multi-Axis Programming" (CAMP) project (DUE # 1501872, DUE # 1548158).  The CAMP project outcome increased availability of CAMP training opportunities in Georgia by "making it possible for Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) instructors to develop and implement a 21st century CNC multi-axis machining and programming (CAMP) certificate." This was achieved predominantly by creating and providing a program of professional development opportunities for the two-year college machine tool and technology faculty throughout the state. As a result of the CAMP project, positive and significant impacts on TCSG?s CAMP training capacity have been achieved and the project model should be transferable to other programs needing to develop their CAMP training capacities.   The CAMP project successfully:  1.)    Formed the coalition of machine tool programs in Georgia (COMP-GA) to identify programs in Georgia who wanted to participate in advancing their training to the CAMP level and to coordinate the efforts and activities required to do so.  2.)    Provided training to COMP-GA faculty members around the state of Georgia, according to industry standards on programming and machining, using multi-axis CNC machining centers at various locals including Learning Labs, Inc., a Mastercam training provider in Georgia and the HAAS Technical Education Centers located at Vincennes University in Indiana (VU), Central Maine Community College in Maine (CMCC) and Danville Community College in Virginia (DCC).  3.)    Proposed a CAMP certificate to TCSG, which has been accepted and approved for development.  4.)    Evaluated 10 multi-axis machining and programming projects for their suitability as potential projects in the proposed CAMP curriculum for TCSG institutions.  5.)    Began networking with, and gaining guidance and expertise from, the Regional Advanced Machining Partnership (RAMP), which is an existing NSF ATE project that has developed a CAMP certificate training curriculum at CMCC, which they have shared with the CAMP leadership.  6.)    Promoted student articulation into a BAS of Manufacturing Operations, through an Articulation Agreement with Kennesaw State University.  Due to these accomplishments, TCSG now has a cadre of machine tool technology educators who possess the foundational skills required to implement a CAMP Certificate in Georgia. This trained group of COMP-GA technical instructors, certified at various levels, is now academically prepared and ready to implement and begin teaching a CAMP certificate.  As a result, Kennesaw State University implemented the multi-axis training in a course, which included 4th axis machining to forty students.  This course will then be evaluated as a direct transfer from the future implemented CAMP certificate.  An additional impact of this grant includes raising the awareness of the Haas Foundation grant across the state of Georgia.  As a result, four technical colleges and two universities have received over eighty thousand dollars in funding for scholarships to students in machining and manufacturing curriculums.  Further, this project grant has made it possible to implement other activities as part of the project.  Dual-enrollment of high school students has increased due to the promotion of the student articulation into CAMP training and the Bachelors of Applied Science in Manufacturing Operations.  This has provided a clear career path for technical graduates with an Associate of Science degree and will continue to stimulate recruitment.
