<AbstractNarration>The rules governing the public funding of science tend to downplay an extensive literature in economics and finance regarding the balance of risk and return in designing portfolios. This project develops measures that quantify the importance of project riskiness in selecting research portfolios that appropriately balance incremental and breakthrough scientific innovation in order to improve social welfare.  Findings speak directly to ongoing debates about the innovativeness of the current funding system of public science funding institutions and provide valuable insights for private research-intensive firms in a wide range of sectors within the U.S., many of whom are currently worried about how to maintain their scientific edge in the face of enormous investments elsewhere in the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To estimate research portfolio choices and the implicit weights that respondents place on various features of those portfolios this project uses stated preference surveys and econometric techniques designed for use with discrete choice experiments.  A diverse respondent pool - elite life scientists, mid-career life scientists, life science postdocs, and MBA students - elucidates the role of incentives and experience in shaping preferred allocation rules.  Experimental variation in the scarcity of research funds also provides valuable information about how tradeoffs between risk and return are impacted by the potential scale and scope of research projects under evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF-SCISIP Stated Preference Outcome Report  July 30, 2020     The rules governing the public funding of science tend to downplay an extensive literature in economics and finance regarding the balance of risk and return in designing portfolios. In this project we implement stated preference surveys to a population of business/economics students and active researchers in the life sciences in order to assess these risk-reward tradeoffs.  The primary goal of this project is to develop measures that quantify the importance of project riskiness in selecting research portfolios that appropriately balance incremental and breakthrough scientific innovation in order to improve social welfare.   Our work has revealed an important finding regarding risk taking in R&amp;D investments.  Despite incentives for risk taking in our experiment, the majority of subjects in our study were risk averse when choosing their projects. They preferred projects with less disagreement between reviewers, even though choosing those projects was financially penalized in our experimental design. Using background data gathered during the experiment, we were able to rule out that subjects simply did not understand the experiment or the research process. Instead, subjects' distaste for risk best explained their behavior. Overall, these results point to the difficulty in getting subjects to make risky choices, even though those choices have a higher average payoff. In the context of research and development funding where payoffs are potentially nonlinear in the novelty?and therefore riskiness?of a project, risk averse behavior of the form we measure could substantially reduce innovation.  Ongoing work is extending this analysis to assess how choices vary when investment resources are more or less scarce.     Our findings have important implications for the design of public and private research funding allocation rules.  They also shed light on institutional details that shape investment decisions and the radicality of the insights and innovations that follow.  Those include, but are not limited to, the aggregate amount of funding available, reviewer expertise, and the diversity of projects that are evaluated within a given review cycle.  Together they point toward a variety of approaches that could be used to improve public and private research investments to deliver cutting edge discoveries that improve health and well-being for future generations.
