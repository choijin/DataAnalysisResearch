<AbstractNarration>Magmatic-hydrothermal fluids in the crust transport and deposit ore metals in some settings, and in other settings, they feed hot water into high-temperature geothermal systems used to produce electricity.  Exactly how minerals precipitate in these environments is not well understood because the processes operate at depths and on timescales that are not accessible to direct observation. To understand how, when, and where rock fractures form and then fill with minerals, especially quartz, the investigators in this study are examining veins in a large ore deposit exposed on Earth's surface.  Studies supported by this award consist of mapping the vein pattern, and determining the mineral assemblages, then imaging the textures of crystals, measuring the properties of fluids trapped in the crystals, and determining the abundances of trace elements within those crystals.  These measurements reveal the temperature, depth and growth histories of the crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, the large and well characterized hydrothermal system in Butte, Montana serves as a natural laboratory for investigating how magmatic-hydrothermal veins fill with quartz, sulfides and magnetite. The mechanisms and timescales of vein formation are addressed by (1) mapping the distribution of quartz-dominated veins and variations in alteration of the host rock adjacent to these veins, (2) analyzing quartz vein textures and compositions using a suite of analytical tools (SEM, SEM-CL, SEM-EBSD, and EPMA), (3) estimating temperature and pressure of mineral formation using trace element and fluid inclusion thermometry, and (4) conducting hydrothermal quartz growth experiments in the laboratory to assess the influence of crystal growth rate on the Ti-in-quartz thermometer. The combined data set addressing SEM-CL textures (mottled vs. banded euhedral), EBSD (addressing crystal orientations), fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures, and the P-T interpretations of Ti-in-quartz, Zr-in-rutile and Ti-in-biotite from EPMA will constrain the interplay of fluid flow, heat transfer, and quartz precipitation in ways that provide new insights into how magmatic hydrothermal systems work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Some magmas intrude the upper crust, cool, and emit hydrothermal fluids through small fractures?fluids that carry copper, molybdenum, lead, zinc, gold and silver.

By studying the composition and texture of that quartz, we can determine the conditions of vein formation, like pressure, temperature and possible deformation.

The amount of Ti that dissolves in quartz is a function of the pressure (P) and temperature (T) of the quartz crystallization, thus a measurement of Ti in natural quartz can tell us the P and T of its formation.  However, two different calibrations of the thermobarometer by other experimenters disagree with each other, so we sought to resolve the discrepancy.

This finding resembles how low-T geochemists think about trace elements dissolving in minerals, but has yet to be adopted by petrologists.  Our new numerical model of Ti uptake by quartz explains many features of our experiments and those from previous studies. A key conclusion is that quartz-rutile equilibrium may not have been established in anyone?s experiments, but our experiments and kinetic model show that one calibration is sound, and further provide valuable guidance to researchers who use Ti in quartz to estimate temperatures and pressures of mineral formation.      In studies of Butte quartz veins, our earlier investigation revealed two SEM- cathodoluminescence (CL) textures referred to as CL-euhedral and CL-mottled. CL-euhedral quartz has alternating dark and light growth zones of crystal faces reflecting crystal growth from a hydrothermal fluid. CL-mottled grains have a CL-gray background that is dappled with darker regions.  Interestingly, some quartz veins contain both textures side-by-side.  Our finding is that the mottled texture forms where randomly oriented quartz crystals recrystallize but adjacent parallel euhedral crystals are spared from recrystallization because the shear stress on the elongated crystals is less than the critical shear stress needed to activate internal slip.  One related finding is that Ti concentration in CL-dark bands in euhedral quartz records the temperature of quartz formation whereas the CL-bright bands record non-equilibrium temperatures.       In summary, Butte quartz veins formed by the following series of events:         Rock hydrofractures above the magma chamber.         Euhedral comb quartz crystals grow on the fracture surfaces.         Additional crystals nucleate in the rising fluid and jam or settle with random orientations in the centers of veins.         After the vein has mostly solidified, vein centers accommodate stress by deforming plastically, thereby converting CL-euhedral textures to CL-mottled textures, especially in vein centers.      In this research, we combined experimental studies of quartz crystallization with focused studies of naturally formed quartz veins from the Butte porphyry copper deposit, a typical example of a magmatic hydrothermal system.  In porphyry copper deposits, criss-crossing veins form by repeated injections of magmatic fluids that react with the fractured wall rock, making such a complex hydrothermal tangle that deposit origins are hard to pick apart scientifically.  This research on quartz vein textures and the meaning of the Ti concentration in the quartz enable us and other researchers to untangle the this complex history.
