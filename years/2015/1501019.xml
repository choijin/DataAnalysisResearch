<AbstractNarration>Turbulence is the phenomenon by which a fluid flow, initially very smooth, can develop smaller and smaller eddies, structures at smaller and smaller scales, until it looks completely chaotic. Though anybody can observe this phenomenon, and though it is of paramount importance in physics, aerospace engineering, etc.,  it is very poorly understood at a conceptual level. Weak turbulence is a related phenomenon, which is also poorly understood, but which might be theoretically more approachable. Rather than fluid flows, it describes situations where waves interact. The aim of this proposal is to develop theoretical tools, and apply them to concrete physical examples, leading to a deeper understanding of weak turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be more specific, the main object of focus will be the nonlinear Schroedinger equation set on a compact domain, which is one of the simplest and most used models to describe nonlinear wave, or dispersive phenomena. It is believed by physicists that the right regime to observe weak turbulence involves three limits: weakly nonlinear (small data), big box (large domain), random phases (decorrelation of the Fourier modes in a statistical sense). The aim of this project is to investigate how these three limiting procedures can be made rigorous. It involves spectral questions (understanding the eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the Laplacian on domains), nonlinear aspects (how these eigenmodes interact) and statistical questions (finding the right probabilistic description of the stationary state).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of this project was to further our understanding of weak turbulence, a chaotic behavior observed in many physical systems: from Plasma Physics to Atmosphere and Ocean science and Quantum Mechanics or Nonlinear Optics. In all these fields, weakly turbulent behavior is observed, and it has been a great challenge to understand its mechanism.   Physicists believe that weak turbulence can be described by the so-called kinetic wave equation (KW) ; however, there are instances where this equation does not give results which are consistent with experiments.  Hence the need to establish rigorously the regime in which the kinetic wave equation (KW) is valid!  This question was investigated for one of the simplest models which is expected to exhibit weak turbulence: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, set on the torus.  In a work in collaboration with T. Buckmaster, Z. Hani, and J. Shatah, which is being finalized, the PI was validate the equation (KW) in an appropriate regime. This is not the full answer to the question of the validity of (KW), but this is the first step towards its resolution; and the first rigorous result to address this question.  The proof of this result relies on a number of mathematical tools: theory of nonlinear dispersive equations (of which the nonlinear Schrodinger equation is an instance), but also probability theory, harmonic analysis, and analytic number theory (arising from harmonic analysis on the torus, where the eigenvalues of the Laplacian are given by quadratic forms on the integers).
