<AbstractNarration>Invasions of non-native species are one of the greatest environmental challenges of the 21st century, threatening not only native flora, fauna, and the ecosystem services that they provide, but also agriculture, human health, and the economy. Invasion and establishment of non-native species is driven by both physical (abiotic) factors, such as temperature, and by interactions with native species (biotic factors), such as predation and competition. Understanding how these biotic and abiotic factors magnify or cancel one another is necessary for forecasting the conditions under which invasive species establish in new localities, and for developing methods to control the spread of such species. Yet, most studies overlook the joint effects of abiotic and biotic factors on invasion success because they examine on only one type of factor. This project addresses this problem by examining the joint effect of environmental temperature and competition for resources on invasion by an insect in California. The research combines laboratory experiments, field observations, and mathematical models to forecast the conditions that allow the invasive species to spread. Currently, the U.S. spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually on invasive species control. This project aims to reduce this cost by providing the scientific knowledge needed to develop more cost-effective control measures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project integrates manipulative experiments, field observations and mathematical models to examine how temperature and competition impact population dynamics and species interactions of an ecologically related pair of insects, one native and one invasive. The impetus for this work comes from a native-invasive interaction occurring in the California coastal sage scrub community in which two Hemipterans (Family: Pentatomidae), native Murgantia histrionica and recent North American invasive Bagrada hilaris, compete for their primary host, the perennial shrub Cleome isomeris. This study aims to (i) quantify the joint effect of temperature and density on life history traits (fecundity, development, mortality) of the two species, and (ii) parameterize a mathematical model of stage-structured population dynamics that incorporates mechanistic descriptions of vital rate temperature responses, and time-dependent developmental delays that arise due to temperature variation. These goals are achieved through (i) a fully factorial lab experiment with density and temperature treatments, (ii) estimation of model parameters using maximum likelihood methods applied to experimental data, which are used to analyze a delay differential equation model of population dynamics, and (iii) field collection of insect abundances to test the model's predictions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Modern species invasions represent a major environmental challenge due to negative impacts on natural systems, agricultural resources (crops, livestock), and human health.  Further, they are increasing in prevalence as the globe becomes increasingly more connected.  The majority of damage is done by ectothermic pests and pathogens- organisms such as insects, reptiles, fish, and microorganisms that cannot regulate their body temperature and hence are highly sensitive to the temperature of their surrounding environment.        Understanding the ingredients that promote invasion success of such ectotherms is the focus of Margaret Simon's dissertation, funded by the NSF doctoral dissertation improvement grant.  For the dissertation, she developed, parameterized, and tested a mathematical model for predicting the joint effects of physical (environmental temperature) and biological (competition with native species for resources) factors on the invasion success of introduced species.  Simon's research found that the systematic way in which ectotherms respond physiologically to temperature generates predictable population-level patterns that have important implications for invasion success.  In particular, she found that within the range of temperatures over which a given introduced species can survive, higher temperatures maximize the species' probability of successfully invading a region, but lower temperatures maximize the species' population size, potentially translating into more negative impacts on the native community.  Using Lotka-Volterra models with and without developmental delays, Simon's dissertation investigated the mechanistic underpinnings of why ectotherm invasives of tropical origin are more successful at establishing in temperate habitats than temperate invasives introduced into the tropics, and the effect of climate warming on competition between native and invasive species.        Taken together, Simon's dissertation makes an important contribution in developing theory for predicting which regions around the globe are most vulnerable to invasion by ectothermic pests and pathogens, and why. Increased predictive power will allow for more effective management and control policies to be put into practice.  In turn, these changes will prepare society to more readily protect natural systems, food and economic security, and human health in the face of ongoing climate change and globalization, both of which augment the risk of species introductions and invasions.      Simon has presented her work at a major conference (e.g., ESA) in her field approximately every year of the grant period, has engaged in outreach activities geared toward generating excitement for science in young children, middle school girls, and undergraduates from groups underrepresented in STEM fields, and has incorporated aspects of her work into courses she has taught as a doctoral student at UCLA.  She has provided undergraduate students the opportunity to deeply engage in research by working closely with a few of them to develop and implement their own research projects.  She helped these students to communicate their findings to the scientific community by presenting posters at science events hosted within, and outside of, UCLA (e.g., one student was invited to Washington DC to present his work at a meeting of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM).      Simon completed the dissertation at the end of 2017 and is now a postdoctoral associate at Yale University conducting basic science research aimed at understanding the role of spatial processes in maintaining terrestrial biomes in the tropics, a highly productive region of the globe that has been, and continues to be, heavily impacted by changing climate and other global change drivers.
