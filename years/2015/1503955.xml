<AbstractNarration>The conference "Groups, Geometry, and Three-manifolds" will be held May 21-22 at the University of California in Berkeley, California. This conference will bring together a number of experts in "Thurstonian" three-manifold topology and related areas to discuss their latest research, as well as to talk about where the subject may be headed. In addition to the speakers, the grant will fund the participation of a number of faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions, as well as early career researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proofs of the virtual Haken conjecture and the virtual fibering conjecture by Agol have moved the study of three-manifolds into an exciting new stage.  Although these central problems have been resolved, there remain many exciting directions to pursue.  At this conference experts in the field will give talks on topics such as: random methods in three-manifolds, deformations of geometric structures, algorithmic methods in three-manifolds, Dehn surgery and the space of all three-manifolds, and hyperbolic geometry.  Participants will also be asked to contribute to a new problem list in Thurstonian geometry and topology, and this problem list will be published on the conference website: https://sites.google.com/site/groupsgeometry3manifolds/</AbstractNarration>

The motivation for the conference was three-fold:  to take stock of the field of "Thurstonian" geometry and topology after the resolution of many of the important conjectures in the field;  to create a list of open problems in the field;  and to celebrate the career of Daryl Cooper, who has been a major contributor to this field, and a mentor and source of inspiration to many young mathematicians.  Ten experts in three-manifold topology and related areas gave lectures on the latest advances, and there was much discussion about open problems and the future of the field.  Included amoung the speakers was recent Breakthrough Prize winner Ian Agol.  Open problems were solicited from both participants and speakers, revealing that Thurstonian geometry remains an incredibly active and vibrant branch of mathematics. The resulting problem list, which contains 63 questions submitted from over 20 mathematicians, was published on the conference website https://sites.google.com/site/groupsgeometry3manifolds/ and on the mathematics preprint archive.   The conference was well attended, with over 85 registered participants and speakers.  In addition to some of the speakers, this grant helped fund sixteen participants in the conference, nearly all of whom were either graduate students, post-docs, or faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions.
