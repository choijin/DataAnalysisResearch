<AbstractNarration>This project advances the current state of knowledge regarding the governance of scholarly digital infrastructures, comparing interoperability, interconnection, capacity management, and systems management.  Digital infrastructures are large-scale sociotechnical systems that rely on the Internet technologies, digital data, and social practices that work together to create functionality across time and space. This research is motivated by the growth of large-scale digital projects designed to support the digitization, preservation, access, and reuse of information artifacts. The need for long-term sustainable computational resources for information is ubiquitous across all aspects of society including government, education, healthcare, and scientific research.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project is developed as a comparative case study in order to contrast and compare the institutional practices of digital infrastructures, and it pursues two research questions: What are the common and unique aspects of digital infrastructure governance? How do digital infrastructures coordinate the interoperability, interconnection, capacity management and systems management of these digital technologies and practices?  The first research question focuses attention on detailing the ways in which digital infrastructures operate, make choices, distribute resources, negotiate issues, and offer services.  These decisions both frame and are shaped by the combination of scientific practices, the participant's interests, current technologies and their development trajectories, and the structure and form of data. The second research question focuses specifically on the relationships among the pertinent digital infrastructure characteristics, digital technologies, and governance. Identifying and articulating these patterns and structures is at the heart of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research focused attention to governance of scientific digital infrastructures (SDI). An SDI is a particular form of large-scale sociotechnical system that relies on Internet connectivity and further involves an array of information and communication technologies (ICTs), and data and social practices that work together to create functionality across time and space. Most SDI are built around data repositories of specific interest to specific communities of scholars and scientists. An example of an SDI are the Long-Term Ecological Research Centers (LTERs) that the NSF has been funding.   The scholarly attention to building DI (and SDI) and the substantial funds being committed to developing SDI, is advancing research and scholarship by providing greater access to information to students and researchers. In scientific research, the thinking is that the accumulation and access of data and information over a long period of time increases the chances of novel  discover. Even with this increased activity, however, less consideration has been given to the institutional practices of SDIs, and how these forces shape and are shaped by technological elements, even though we have clear evidence that these forces will be most influential in shaping digitally-enabled scientific work.  For this reason, our project is focused on the governance of the technical and institutional practices through which SDI operate.    Two research questions framed the project: RQ1: What are the common and unique aspects of SDI governance? RQ2: What can we learn about SDI governance by studying their operations?  The first research question focuses attention to detailing the ways in which SDIs operate, make choices, distribute resources, negotiate issues, and offer services.  The second research question focuses specifically on the relationships among the pertinent SDI characteristics, digital technologies, and governance.  To answer these RQ, we pursued a comparative case study. Doing allowed us to look across cases to develop insight, and to look at each case over time to examine trajectories. To do this, we drew on a framework used in economics to compare infrastructures. This framework is comprised of six elements: interoperability, interconnection, systems, capacity, management of resources, and scale.  Four findings come clear from the sustained investigation we have now completed:  Finding one:  Most SDI are not yet operating at a scale that allows for comparison across all elements of the framework.  That is, most SDI are emergent or ?ground-up? efforts that are localized to sub-communities of a larger intellectual space.  Their funding streams and organizational maturity are such that they are often not able to achieve steady-state operations.  This insight drove us to focus more attention on the small number of SDI that had achieved some level of institutional stability.  Finding two: All SDI are able to address the technical issues of gathering and storing data sets for future use. However, very few were able to convince scientists the SDI was sustainable, leading to lower levels of use (and diminished funding) along with issues with strategic and operational governance.  Finding three: Some SDI can achieve ?institutionalization? to the extent that their digital infrastructure, funding, governance, usage by the community, and value from use, led to a level of success in which the repository became an acknowledge or expected part of the larger scientific infrastructure.  Finding four: Institutionalization is fragile: funding, leadership and use are all dynamic, and the logic holding all of these together has to adapt over time. This requires adroit leadership that encompasses all the elements of the comparative framework.  The intellectual merits of this project include:   (1) Focusing on governance foregrounds the SDI?s sociotechnical basis as science infrastructure. (2) The empirical results of this work advancing current understanding of SDI governance and coordination.  The broader impacts of this project: (1)  Advance our understanding of how digital resources are governed for common good. (2)  Provide actionable guidance for organizations that build or lead DIs/ SDIs.       Last Modified: 06/28/2021       Submitted by: Steven B Sawyer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
