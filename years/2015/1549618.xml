<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase-I project is to improve the detection of cessation of respiration with regard to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. It will result in a portable device for long-term monitoring of baby?s vital signs without requiring any sensor to be placed in touch with a baby. The proposed project promises to result in improved wellbeing of infants and young children in the context of a public/private partnership between a newly formed small business, a College of Engineering and a major Health Sciences Center. By making vital sign monitoring available to every family with a low-cost semiconductor system-on-chip, it can be a game-changing product for the baby monitor market. The proposed technology points to other novel uses such as a detection of epileptic seizures and subsequent research in predicting sleep apnea, Parkinson?s disease, as well as non-medical applications such as remote monitoring of search-and-rescue for earthquake, fire victims; border patrol; entrance security; and see-through-wall radar. A successful result will contribute to the growth of the company, U.S. and global sales, and the economic competitiveness of the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop and demonstrate an alternative to current monitors which require contact with the baby. It will integrate a novel on-chip solution into a low-cost portable device for long-term monitoring of vital signs without baby contact. The objective is to design a chip in a commercial complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process to ensure low cost and low-power. The research will focus on radar non-contact measurement of physiological movements caused by breathing and heartbeat. Research will also be conducted on designing an antenna array to send a radio frequency signal, which will be reflected back from the human body and phase-modulated by physiological movements due to heartbeat and respiration. The result will be beam steering radar with a compact size and will eliminate the null detection point, so that detection of the vital sign activity will not be affected by either the position of the infant or the radar residue phase. The mass production cost of such a device will be significantly lower than currently employed systems.</AbstractNarration>

The main object of this project is to design a non-contact baby monitor based on a radar sensor technology that can sense the vital signs (i.e., respiration and heartbeat) of a baby. Such monitor could be used to warn parents of potential SIDS conditions on a newborn baby, and notify the parents if their baby experiences any abnormal breathing or heartbeat.</p> <p>During Phase I, three main research tasks were carried out. The first one is the design of a 24-GHz complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transceiver chip. The purpose of designing all the monitoring function into a single chip is to make the baby monitor easy to integrate into portable devices. Furthermore, the chip solution reduces the cost of the baby monitor product.&nbsp; This design work was carried out by PI Yiran Li and a graduate student from Co-PI Dr. Changzhi Li&rsquo;s lab. The layout for this transceiver chip design is shown in Fig. 1 (see supporting image Fig.1).</p> <p>The second research task is to complete a beamforming array and integrate it into a radar system. The beamforming array could be adopted by the baby monitor to accurately point its signal at a baby&rsquo;s chest and minimize interference from parents and pets moving around the crib. This research was conducted by Dr. Changzhi Li&rsquo;s research group. A K-band frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar sensor with beamforming array was fabricated on a printable circuit board (PCB). The measurement results of the beamforming array show that such beamforming technique benefits the baby monitor application.</p> <p>The third research task is lab test and data validation. Several rounds of tests were taken at Texas Tech University Health Science Center (TTUHSC) SimLife Center. The radar sensor prototype used in this work was designed by Dr. Changzhi Li&rsquo;s group and yearONE is holding an exclusive license agreement on it. These research experiments were conducted by PI Yiran Li. The results of these tests showed that the proposed radar based sensor technology could provide accurate vital sign information. (Please see Fig.2 in the supporting image for the experiment setup).</p> <p>Besides completing the research tasks as mentioned above, yearONE also worked on the business development side during Phase I. During the duration of Phase I, all business development and patent efforts that were conducted by yearONE were at no cost to the grant. yearONE has successfully converted its options agreement from TTU and has executed a fully exclusive licensing agreement for the proposed technology. In total, yearONE has signed 3 fully exclusive licensing agreements from TTU. With the executed licensing agreement, it has allowed yearONE to make initial revenue by fabricating and selling a biomedical radar prototype &ndash; <strong><em>iMotion</em></strong>. Currently, yearONE has customers from four different countries and regions including: USA, Australia, China and Taiwan. yearONE established a good relationship with the customers and received excellent product feedback.</p> <p>With the underlying technology being developed from this project, yearONE has successfully applied and received two rounds of funding by the Global Laboratory for Energy Asset Management and Manufacturing (GLEAMM) project, which was established with a $13 million energy investment by the State of Texas.
