<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of graduate students in the Summer Research Conference in Statistics and Biostatistics, held in Carolina Beach, North Carolina on June 7-10, 2015.  The meeting is the 51st in a series of annual conferences sponsored by the Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS). Its purpose is to encourage the exchange of current research ideas in statistics and biostatistics and to give motivation and direction to further research progress. The conference series focuses on young researchers, providing excellent opportunities for interaction among junior researchers and leaders in the field.  The meeting features talks on current research topics together with dedicated time for clarification, amplification, and further informal discussions in small groups. Under the travel support provided by this award, students will attend and present their research in posters to be reviewed by more experienced researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Southern Regional Council on Statistics is a consortium of statistics and biostatistics programs in the South, stretching as far west as Texas and as far north as Maryland. It currently has member programs at 45 universities in 15 states in the region. The 2015 Summer Research Conference in Statistics and Biostatistics sponsored by SRCOS is particularly valuable for students and faculty from smaller regional schools within driving distance, affording them the opportunity to participate and interact closely with internationally-known leaders in the field without the cost of travel to distant national or international venues. It will strengthen the research of the statistics and biostatistics community as a whole, and particularly in the relatively underdeveloped southern region. More details are available at the conference web site http://www.uncw.edu/src2015/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Summer Research Conference (SRC) is an annual research conference sponsored by the Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS).  Since the inception of the SRC, the purposes of the conference are to encourage the interchange and mutual understanding of research ideas in statistics and biostatistics, and to give motivation and direction to further research progress, particularly for young researchers, in a manner not ordinarily possible at other meetings.  The meeting is particularly valuable for graduate students, isolated statisticians, and faculty from smaller regional schools in the Southern Region.  Each year, the location of the conference is chosen to be at a drivable distance for researchers in the Southern Region, thus affording them the opportunity to participate and interact closely with internationally-known leaders in the field without the cost of travel to distant venues.  Speakers present formal research talks with adequate time allowed for clarification, amplification, and further informal discussions in small groups.  As such, speakers, session chairs, and discussants make themselves accessible for informal discussions of their research as well as formal presentations.   On the second day of the conference, the NSF/R.L. Anderson Student Poster Session for graduate students is featured.  An overwhelming majority of faculty and senior researchers stay and view the student posters.  The Student Poster Session includes a competition, with student posters judged by leaders in the field.  The Student Poster Session provides an excellent opportunity for the young scholars to gain experience and obtain feedback.  Awards in honor of SRCOS founders are presented that evening at the conference banquet.  A separate poster session for young faculty and isolated statisticians allows them a means of participation.   The 51st Annual Summer Research Conference (SRC) was held June 7-10, 2015 at the Carolina Beach, North Carolina at the Courtyard Carolina Beach Oceanfront Marriott hotel.  It was organized by the Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS) and hosted by the University of North Carolina at WilmingtonÆs Department of Mathematics and Statistics.  A record-setting 126 scholars participated.  The website for the meeting is http://www.uncw.edu/src2015/index.html, and it contains program details, abstracts, and photos of conference activities.  The research program was anchored by two internationally-renowned plenary speakers: Dennis Cook of the University of Minnesota and Noel Cressie from the National Institute for Applied Statistics Research at the University of Wollongong, in Australia.  Discussants for the plenary speakers were Lexin Li of North Carolina State University and Chris Wikle of the University of Missouri, respectively.  Five other invited oral presentation sessions featured senior faculty speakers and outstanding junior faculty invited speakers.  Don Edwards (University of South Carolina) gave a thought-provoking banquet speech on the ethical use of statistics in medical law suits involving Medicare and Medicaid.  At the banquet, in addition to student poster awards, a Paul Minton Award for outstanding career service to the profession was awarded to the same Don Edwards.  The NSF/R.L. Anderson Student Poster Session featured poster presentations from 53 graduate students, representing 21 graduate programs across the Southern Region.  The ASA also supplied additional funds to help support the studentsÆ travel.   These awards enabled students, in many cases representing programs with limited travel budgets, to experience a significant scientific conference firsthand.  They interacted closely with leading researchers in the field in a manner which would not be possible at larger national or international meetings (which would also be prohibitively expensive for many of these students to attend).   Their posters were judged by a panel selected by DÆArcy Mayes of Virginia Commonwealth.  The panel...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
