<AbstractNarration>A large number of planets around other stars ("exoplanets") are being discovered or will be discovered by space missions like Kepler and TESS. There is a shortage of ground-based instruments that can follow up on these discoveries and measure the properties of the exoplanets themselves.  This significant bottleneck is being addressed by the construction of the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT), a worldwide network of primarily 1-meter telescopes. The LCOGT project is active in education, operating an extensive program of student observing on their telescopes. Numerous students from high-school to university seniors are employed as interns. Designs developed for LCOGT are open-source, and science data are made available to the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund the construction of 6 identical environment-controlled enclosures for the LCOGT Network of Robotic Echelle Spectrographs (NRES), which is currently under construction with NSF funding.  These thermal enclosures will ensure that the NRES reaches its original design requirement for radial velocity stability. Timely completion of NRES will enable follow-up observations of planetary system candidates as well as a wide range of science requiring high-resolution spectroscopy of relatively bright targets.  Each spectrograph is coupled to two independently-targetable 1-meter robotic telescopes that function as a single, global instrument with flexible scheduling capabilities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) operates a worldwide network of professional, robotic, computer-controlled 1-meter telescopes. The individual sites, located in Hawaii, Texas, the Canary Islands, Tibet, Chile, South Africa, and Australia, are spread out in latitude and longitude in order to provide uninterrupted access to the night-time sky for cutting-edge science. Each of the existing telescopes is equipped with multiple cameras and numerous filters to measure and study visible light. With funding from the NSF, LCO is building and deploying a Network of Robotic Echelle Spectrographs (NRES) to 1-meter telescopes at up to six different sites. These high-resolution spectrographs are purpose-built to characterize stars (i.e., their temperature and composition) and discover new planets in orbit around them. Once available, NRES will be an invaluable resource to the astronomical community.</p> <p>Each spectrograph requires a very stable operating environment in order to achieve its precision goals. The NRES Igloo (initially designed with support of NSF award 1407666) is a cost-effective enclosure that successfully&nbsp;meets our stringent pressure and temperature stability requirements (+/- 0.01 C temperature and +/- 0.02 mbar pressure)&nbsp;even under harsh external conditions. Providing this stability at low cost makes it a critical component in the delivery&nbsp;of cost-effective, high-precision spectra. Following on our success with the first unit, three additional enclosures have been produced and deployed for subsequent NRES spectrographs (this grant). Each Igloo enclosure is built from a&nbsp;refrigerated 20-foot shipping container. These containers are sturdy, inexpensive, and very well insulated, making them ideally suited to our application. We wall-mount a standard HVAC unit which is able tomaintain temperature steady to about +/- 1 degree C. To further improve our temperature control, we erect a plastic &ldquo;tent&rdquo; structure in the middle of the igloo, effectively creating a separate room within the igloo. Airflow into and out of the tent is managed by a set of four computer-controlled, variable-speed fans affixed to the outside of the tent. The combined effect of the plastic barrier and active fan control is an air temperature steady to +/- 0.1 degree C inside the tent, a 10-fold improvement over what HVAC alone could do (and significantly better than expected).</p> <p>At the core of our system, each NRES spectrograph is housed in a thick, multi-layer chamber that provides a high degree of&nbsp;insulation. This insulated chamber (includig most of the supporting electronics and devices) resides within the&nbsp;temperature-stabilized tent structure described above. This multi-stage approach to temperature regulation produces excellent results at a significantly lower cost than any other available option. Three such enclosures were successfully built and deployed in 2017. A fourth unit was assembled, tested, and shipped in late 2017. It arrived on-site in early 2018 but has not yet been commissioned as of this writing. For all three installed units, igloo performance in the field meets or exceeds our science requirements, demonstrating the soundness of the design. Salient aspects of the design are available in the Astronomy instrumentation literature for the benefit of other projects.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/09/2018<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;Siverd</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1508464/1508464_10379994_1523276865877_20161124_215943--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1508464/1508464_10379994_1523276865877_20161124_215943--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Igloo Interior"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1508464/1508464_10379994_1523276865877_20161124_215943--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Igloo Interior"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This photo, taken from the open doorway of the first completed NRES Igloo, shows the interior layout.
