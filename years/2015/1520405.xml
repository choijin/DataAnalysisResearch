<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small-Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to lead the develop of next generation wireless communication technology and provide ultra-high-speed, broadband connectivity to consumers. The enormous consumer demand for mobile multimedia content on smart phones and tablets is accelerating growth of data traffic on wireless networks.  This trend will continue in the next decade as billions more devices will be connected to the Internet-Of-Things including automobiles and home appliances.  To support such growth, wireless smart phones and tablets need to have faster connectivity speeds to the network.  The networks must also adapt to handle the exponential growth in data traffic with smaller cells and higher backhaul capacity. With the congestion of existing commercial spectrum, new innovations in wireless technology are required to meet this challenge.  This project offers a new technology and solution to multiply the bandwidth of of wireless devices and networks and help expand ultra-fast broadband access to consumers.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the proof-of-concept demonstration of a wireless optical transceiver module that can increase the connectivity speeds of next generation wireless devices by several folds.  Novel device and material designs will be investigated to achieve the target performance of this project.  Today, the fastest WiFi technology is capable of nearly one Gigabit per second (Gbps) speed while the next-generation WiFi solution can deliver 5Gbps. The speed limitation of wireless modems are due to limited availability of commercial spectrum. The speed required to transfer ultra-definition video content without compression is 20Gbps. As 4G-LTE wireless technology is rapidly gaining adoption, wireless operators are wrestling with data capacity bottlenecks in their networks.  Concurrently, wireless industry is beginning to debate requirements for fifth-generation (5G) wireless devices and networks and increased connectivity speed is high on their agenda.  The technology pursued under this project can offer a viable solution for the 5G generation of mobile devices.   In addition to smart phones and tablets, the proposed technology can expand wireless backhaul capacity and provide novel communication solution for connected cars, unmanned aerial vehicles and other devices connected to the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under the NSF SBIR Phase-I &amp; IB programs, LUMEOVA, LLC has successfully demonstrated proof-of-concept, ultra-wideband wireless optical technology that can potentially increase wireless data communication speeds by tenfold.  The company designed and tested the key optical components for the ultra-wideband module and fabricated the devices in collaboration with North Carolina State University Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.    Intellectual Merit:  Wireless data traffic is exploding driven by insatiable consumers? demand for video content on mobile device. Emerging applications such as Virtual Reality and 360&deg; video will accelerate this trend.  Today?s smart phones and tablets are capable of capturing and displaying ultra-high-definition (4K) video but their ability to share such content is limited by the connectivity speed of WiFi and cellular networks. The wireless industry is struggling to cope with the ever-increasing data demand from consumers due to lack of "good" radio spectrum.  Nearly all wireless communication today from AM/FM radio to broadcast TV, GPS, satellite radio/TV, 4G LTE cell phones, Bluetooth and WiFi take place in the "good" radio spectra below 6GHz where signals travel freely in the air without resistance.  Above 6GHz, radio signals increasingly encounter friction and loss in the air due to absorption by moisture, oxygen and other compounds in the air.   FCC is allocating more radio spectra in the microwave and millimeter wave bands above 6GHz for 5G cellular market. However, the new spectra are more suitable for fixed 5G wireless backhaul than for mobile devices due to excessive signal losses and line-of-sight requirements.   As a result, the industry is planning to deploy 5G mobile services in the existing sub-6GHz bands through re-use of unlicensed spectrum, carrier-aggregation and advanced antennas for increased spectrum efficiency.  To visualize this, our radio wireless information high-ways are congested multi-lane roads that cannot be widened and increased traffic can only be supported through packing more passengers per car and running double-decker buses!    Optical, wireless represents the best opportunity for multiplying connectivity speeds of mobile devices since there is over 300,000 times more bandwidth available in the optical bands compared to the allocated sub-6GHz radio bands used by devices today!  Optical signals also travel much better in the air than microwave and higher frequency radio signals making optical communication a better alternative for mobile devices.  Today, ultra-fast optical communication delivers most of our internet, voice and video communication over fiber cables across global networks.   However, the full potential of optical technology for wireless, mobile communication is yet to be unleashed.  LUMEOVA is developing innovative, ultra-fast, wireless optical communication modules to boost connectivity speed of smart phones, tablets and other mobile devices by over ten-fold!  Optical, wireless modules are not envisioned to replace radio-frequency (RF) WiFi and 5G technologies.  Instead, they are designed to complement and coexist with RF solutions in mobile devices to provide them with super-fast connectivity links when available.      Broader Impacts:  The development of ultra-wideband optical wireless modules by LUMEOVA under the NSF SBIR Phase-I program has broader benefits for the global society and economy.  Broadband access to internet has clearly been demonstrated to correlate with better educational and economic development.  Ultra-wideband, connectivity for smart phones combined with virtual reality enables low-income families to provide better education and healthcare for their children and give them social upward mobility potential. While online education using 2-D internet access has been extremely successful in expanding global knowledge economy, 3-D interactive communication enabled by ultra-wideband wireless optical can expand the horizons of possibilities.   Imagine in-home, portable sonograms connected to mobile phones that enable doctors remotely and interactively perform preventative diagnosis of patients in rural and underserved areas.   Imagine students in remote locations learning how to collaborate with each other and on a project and solve problems via virtual-reality simulators.  We only have to look back on how increasingly high-speed internet access has changed our lives to appreciate the full potential of 10X ultra-fast connectivity of the future.
