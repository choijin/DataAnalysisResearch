<AbstractNarration>Performance bugs cause unintended performance degradation and energy waste in mainstream software. These bugs can easily slow down production software for several times and are posing increasing threat to software quality with the meager increases in single threaded performance in multi-core era and an increasing emphasis on energy efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous works for performance bugs, including testing and profiling, mostly treat software as a black-box, and are usually too late or ineffective in preventing the damage of performance bugs. This NSF CAREER research project seeks to develop systems and tools that take a white-box approach to addressing the open problem of performance bugs. First, it conducts an empirical study to enrich the understanding of performance bugs in real-world. Second, it develops tools that can automatically detect performance bugs before, during, and after bug manifestation. Third, it designs a testing framework to expose performance bugs before software release. Finally, it also looks at the performance bug issue in multi-threaded programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education focus of this project is to broaden the software curriculum to bring students more awareness and exercise of performance and correctness issues in software, especially multi-threaded software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will improve the understanding of performance waste problem in software, provide substantial tool support to help lower software development and performance testing costs, and improve software users' everyday experience through faster software. It will also help improve the energy efficiency of production-run software and protect environment in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Improving the performance and efficiency of software systems is crucial to enhancing user experience and saving energy. Unfortunately, develping efficient software is increasingingly challenging for programmers due to the increasingly complicated, dynamic, and hyterogeneousworkloads and software/hardware infrastructures. In reality, performance problems caused by software defects, referred to as performance bugs, have caused many high-profile software failures.   This project tackles the performance bug problem and makes significant  contributions to the state of the art in understanding, detecting, diagnosing, and fixing performance bugs.  - It conducts one of the first comprehensive empirical studies about real-world performance bugs in widely used open-source software, and finds common patterns about the root causes, triggering conditions, fix strategies and other aspects of real-world performance bugs. - It provides a variety of program analysis tools that can automatically detect various types of performance inefficiency bugs in software. These tools have discovered hundreds of previously unknown performance bugs in widely used open-source software. - It provides diagnosis tools that can efficiently diagnose performance problems perceived by users leveraging unique sampling and program analysis techniques customized for performance diagnosis. - It provides automated fixing and patch validation tools to help developers generate and validate performance patches.   The above techniques can help software developers to improve the efficiency and performance of deployed software, greatly improving the user experience and energy saving of production-run software.   The research results of this project have been disseminated through conference proceedings (10 research papers on top-tier computer science conferences), research talks, benchmark dissemination, and others. Furthermore, work from this project won an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at the flag-ship software engineering conference in 2015.   Multiple students have gone through research training in this project. Among them, two have finished their Ph.D. thesis about tackling performance bugs and have become faculty members in academia. Out-reach activities and teaching development based on this project have also been conducted.       Last Modified: 06/26/2017       Submitted by: Shan Lu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
