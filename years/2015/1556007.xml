<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the democratization of manufacturing through democratization of design and simulation technologies.  Geometric design systems and CAD tools are now widely available as standalone systems or cloud-based services, but simulation technologies remain inaccessible due to high cost, tedious data preparation, and demand of expertise in structural simulation. This project aims to make structural simulation widely available to both novice and expert users as a low cost fully automated service that requires no preprocessing or data conversion. The cloud-based simulation service is a disruptive technology that will make structural simulation widely available to communities of makers, as well as manufacturing enterprises, leading to dramatic improvements in performance, manufacturability, sustainability and cost savings. Wide adaption of simulation tools is also an important ingredient of STEM education and workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address the technical challenges identified in Phase I of the project, focusing on the goal of making cloud-based structural simulation service easily accessible and widely used. The key ingredients of the proposed approach are: (1) Development of novel user interaction modes and scenarios that enable rapid creation, composition, and editing of structural simulations by novice and expert users; (2) Guided interactive interpretation and exploration of simulation results aimed to not only to convey and explain simulation results, but also to engage the users into improving their designs by creating improved simulation scenarios. (3) Context-integrated simulations, where automated simulations are fully integrated with other services and delivered seamlessly within the context of common design or manufacturing applications, such as shape design, 3D printing, or manufacturability analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In Phase I of the project we demonstrated feasibility of creating an easy-to-use, low-cost, and fully automated cloud-based structural simulation service.  But to achieve significant societal impact and commercial success, the service had to become more accessible, more usable, and more relevant to users and their applications.  This is the overarching technical objective of the Phase II effort.    For this SBIR Phase II project, Intact Solutions deployed a free structural simulation service online for low cost, wide accessibility, and zero installation.  Users interact with the service by way of modern web browsers capable of displaying 3d geometric content.  The ultimate goal of the project was to democratize simulation technology by making it widely accessible and practiced by a broad spectrum of novice and experienced users with needs ranging from traditional and additive manufacturing to architecture, mechanical design, education, and many others.  As part of the Phase II development effort, complex simulation setups were abstracted to a library of simplified simulation scenarios that can be applied with very little input by (typically) inexperienced users.  Methods were also developed to aid in the interpretation of simulation results and performance of shapes under load.  Throughout the project, the backend implementation was continuously refined to improve performance and capabilities.  The backend implementation also leveraged developments made in other research programs.  Most notably, geometric interoperability using geometric moments developed under DARPA?s TRADES ([1]) program was incorporated into the solution pipeline.  At the project mid-point, users were surveyed to identify additional functionality they wanted to see.  Nearly universally, additional physics were requested. To that end we added simulation of natural vibration modes (developed under DARPA?s TRADES project), and the tools to assist in visualization of these simulation results, including the display and animation of the first 5 natural vibration modes. The fully-functional service is deployed on the web at intact.design and allows users to upload their geometry in a variety of model formats, run simulations, and view results.  We also developed and published a web-accessible API to the backend to allow advanced and enterprise users to access the simulation service from within their own workflows.
