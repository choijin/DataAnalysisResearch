<AbstractNarration>Many of the best studied planetary systems orbit nearby A-Type stars, which are stars that are slightly more massive than the Sun.  This project will use Georgia State University's Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy interferometer array (CHARA) to determine the fundamental properties of these stars (for example, sizes and surface temperatures) that, among other things, will enable much more accurate estimates of their age.  Accurate ages are critical for determining how planetary systems change with time.  This program will train a junior astronomer (a postdoctoral researcher) and two undergraduate students in a high profile area of scientific research.  Project participants will also participate in public outreach activities at Georgia State University's Hard Labor Creek Observatory.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use the CHARA interferometer array to survey 60 nearby A-Type stars.  They will precisely measure the oblate shapes of rapidly rotating stars and model the effect of gravity darkening.  These measurements will provide more accurate comparisons with evolutionary models, from which masses and ages can be inferred. The results could enable new scientific advances, including tests of evolutionary models that account for rapid stellar rotation, constraints on theories for how and why some A-Type stars are chemically peculiar, a temporal stamp for the evolutionary stage of the debris disks and/or planetary systems that some of these stars harbor, and empirical relations for correcting the biases in mass and age estimates of more distant, and thus spatially unresolved, rapidly rotating A-Type Stars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[A primary goal of this project was to conduct a CHARA Array interferometric survey of nearby spectral type A stars.  These observations allowed us to measure the sizes and oblate shapes of these stars (e.g. Figure 1), and enabled more accurate comparisons with evolutionary models to determine masses and ages.  The stellar modeling technique we developed accounts for the observed properties of these stars (oblateness, rotation, broad-band photometry, visibilities) and the predictions of evolutionary models that incorporate rotation, self-consistently.  The results have been used to improve the ages of planet host stars (e.g. the B9 star Kappa Andromedae), the ages of nearby Moving Groups (e.g. AB Doradus), as well as the ages of chemically peculiar stars.  Example results are illustrated in Figure 2 for a sample of nearby lambda Bootis stars (all within 50 pc). Despite having a range of rotation rates, our results show that most lambda Boo stars are young (&lt; 300 Myr), favoring circumstellar contamination (perhaps from a disk) as the likely explanation for their peculiar surface abundances (as opposed to chemical differentiation or dredge-up).  This grant partially supported the Ph.D. research of 3 graduate students, two of which have already successfully defended their Ph.Ds.  It funded the research of 2 undergraduate students, one of which is an under-represented minority in the sciences.  This granted funded the research of a postdoc.  Overall, the grant was effective in helping to train the next generation of astronomers. The PI, the postdoc, and the 3 graduate students supported by this grant have all been active in sharing the discoveries of this work through public talks at Georgia State and at Astronomy Clubs throughout Georgia.  And for the past 5 years (with the exception of 2020 because of the pandemic), the PI has hosted an annual event at Georgia State's Hard Labor Creek Observatory (in Rutledge, GA), called Starry Night.  These events were part of the annual Atlanta Science Festival and provided the public with telescopic tours of the evening sky and opportunities to learn about the exciting astronomy research done at Georgia State.  In addition to these, the PI visited 3-4 elementary schools per year to talk about science and to engage young kids in science experiments.  A majority of these visits were to Title I schools in metropolitan Atlanta, GA.  The effort has helped convey at a young age that science is for everyone.
