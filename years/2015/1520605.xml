<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to transform the analog design landscape, eliminating the analog design bottleneck by creating a new way to do analog layout using digital place and route technology. The potential impact is broad and encompasses most, if not all, semiconductor companies and design houses, who will be able to gain reductions in cost and design schedule by utilizing the technology that will begin to be developed in this proposal. The clear analogy is with digital Place and Route (P and R) technology which has now almost completely replaced custom digital design and layout. Except for few very specialized niches, digital P and R is the standard tool used by everyone on nearly every chip. The company's stem cells and flow can become the equivalent of this technology for analog and mixed signal designs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project targets several facets of the flow to prove that analog layout productivity can be increased by orders of magnitude. A continuous time linear equalizer circuit layout will be created using our stem-cell Place and Route flow, and compared to a hand-crafted layout. By increasing the stem-cell layout active density, expanding the stem-cell library to minimize mapping errors, and creating macros hierarchically, the company will reduce layout-induced parasitics such that area, power and performance will match or exceed the handcrafted version. A layout will be generated with the company's flow to prove compatibility with analog circuits other than amplifiers or linear equalizers.  Also, the project will prove portability from one foundry process to another to show that post-extraction simulated performance is maintained in the new process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need for automation in the physical design phase of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuit design.  Analog circuits are always involved when electronics interact with the physical environment, and with increased presence of electronic systems in everyday life whether in the form of smartphones or the Internet of Things (IoT), analog circuits will continue to provide the interface between the physical and electronic worlds. By allowing better analog circuits to be designed much faster and cheaper, this project can accelerate the deployment of such systems that provide added comfort, convenience, and security.  At the commercial level, the efficiency gains from the layout automation flow developed in this project can reduce the time-to-market for any mixed-signal or analog design, giving a competitive advantage to users of this technology. This advantage becomes more dramatic in the most recent, FinFET processes. As such, the new, automated flow can be used to provide design services to IC design companies that need layout help. Also, the design resources that get freed up from the increased efficiency can be used to explore architectural improvements in the circuit design, which may provide greater performance improvements than incremental improvements of existing designs. As a result, users of this improved flow can gain some advantage over its competitors in some metric, be it area, power, performance, or cost.  In mixed-signal or analog integrated circuit design, much of the effort is spent in the physical design or layout phase.  This is due to the need to control layout parasitics, as uncontrolled parasitics can degrade performance to the point where the circuit performs nothing like what was intended in the schematic design.  In order to minimize parasitics, layout is usually done by hand, which is a time-consuming process that can take months for a complex system.  This project intends to develop an improved physical design flow that significantly reduces the required time and effort.  Past efforts in this area have not seen much success in adoption due to the need for custom tools or the limited capability for reuse, which in the end, did not significantly reduce design effort.  The approach taken in this project has considered these past shortcomings, and is centered on developing common, highly reusable library elements that can be used in currently commercially available digital place and route tools to deliver good analog layout.   In Phase I of the project, the automated design flow has been improved to the point where the automatically generated layout performs comparably well against hand layouts and/or schematic designs of target analog circuits.  The library elements have also been ported to a different technology node to verify foundry technology independence of the flow.      The following were the three objectives specified in the Phase I Proposal:     Demonstrate comparable performance of automatically generated analog layout against hand layout.   Demonstrate fast generation of final analog layout from schematic.   Demonstrate technology node independence of design flow.       In order to meet Objective 1, a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) was designed in a 28nm process using Totic stem cell technology.  The automatic flow had to be refined significantly to achieve circuit performance that is comparable to a hand layout circuit.  After 4 iterations, the layout generated using the Totic flow (Figure 1) resulted in a circuit that performs to within approximately 20% of the hand layout, satisfying the initial objective.  Objective 2 was addressed via a phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit in the same 28nm technology as the CTLE.  While the place and route process was relatively fast, many issues arose during the design process, primarily caused by the lack of robustness in the stem cells.  Due to the stem cell issues, the total effort took approximately 400 hours, which was much longer than the initial target of 72 hours, but we believe that that time could be reduced significantly if no time is spent on fixing stem cells. The estimated time with issue-free stem cells is around 150 hours.  The final layout is shown in Figure 2.  Objective 3 was addressed by porting the 28nm PLL to a 14nm FinFET technology.  This involved development of a new set of stem cells for the new process, migrating the schematic from the old technology to the new technology, and running the Totic place and route flow with the new stem cells and schematic.  Because much of the knowledge that was gained through design iterations in the 28nm PLL development could be used directly in the 14nm technology, a single iteration was sufficient in generating a working design (Figure 3).  The porting effort took approximately 134 man hours, and it seems feasible that by applying more resources in parallel, the design could have been completed well within the 72 hours target of wall clock time.
