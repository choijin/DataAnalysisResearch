<AbstractNarration>Current research indicates that 46% of the world's 7,000 languages are in danger of losing their last speakers by the end of this century. Communities are responding to this situation by accelerating their efforts to learn their languages.  In situations of severe language endangerment, communities and educators are turning to archived language documentation to promote language learning.  This workshop project will investigate the process of language acquisition in these unique learning situations, looking specifically at the role of documentary materials -- grammars, dictionary, and linguistically analyzed natural discourse -- in learning.  A special focus will be on the long-term academic success and other benefits to learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Fall 2015, Ruth Rouvier of the Education Development Center will facilitate this workshop in Washington D.C.  Rouvier will bring together a 10-member interdisciplinary team of specialists in language acquisition, early childhood development, educational linguistics, documentary linguistics, statistics, and public health.  Participants will address topics relating to the role of language documentation in formal language-based activities and the impact of these activities on learners ages 0-5. The impacts to be addressed include linguistic benefits (language competence and use) and extra-linguistic benefits relating to academic success and social well-being. Workshop participants will examine both the resources and practices known or hypothesized to result in these positive outcomes, and the methods for evaluating these benefits. They will assess the state of collective (i.e., academic, professional and community) knowledge regarding these issues and make recommendations for addressing shortfalls, in order to encourage research on how language documentation research affects society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of the workshop will be broadly disseminated for discussion and comment through listservs such as the Resource Network for Linguistic Diversity, the Foundation for Endangered Languages), and the Linguistlist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The workshop "Documentation and Child Learners" was held at the offices of the Education Development Center in Washington, DC, from October 13-14, 2016. The workshop was attended by nineteen researchers and practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines and professions, with research projects or institutional or community affiliations in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. The workshop discussions centered around existing research and practice, and recommended next steps, to support Indigenous communities? actions to maintain, restore, and reclaim their languages, with a focus on the youngest children. Although language documentation and revitalization were a starting point for these discussions, they also encompassed contributions from psychology, education, child development, early childhood education, public health, and Indigenous studies, among other fields. Immediately after the workshop, on October 14, the workshop participants met with representatives of federal agencies, private funders, and interested researchers to share preliminary findings and recommendations. In May 2017 the Child Language Research and Revitalization Working Group, comprised of all nineteen of the workshop participants, released a white paper entitled "Language Documentation, Revitalization and Reclamation: Supporting Young Learners and Their Communities," which synthesized the group's findings and recommendations regarding research, practice, and policy on this topic. This white paper has been disseminated through the working group members' professional and personal networks, and results continue to be shared through presentations at professional and academic conferences and meetings. The Child Language Research and Revitalization Working Group is continuing and expanding on the work begun through this workshop in a number of ways. These include incorporating recommendations into members' own research priorities and practices; transforming the group into a permanent body of experts who are committed to fostering and promoting further work and advocacy on these topics; and developing an institutional home within the Myaamia Center at Miami University.
