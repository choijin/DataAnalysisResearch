<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Project &lt;br/&gt;1512659 Gomes, Carmen &lt;br/&gt;1511953  McLamore, Eric S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a novel sensor device designed to detect foodborne pathogens.  The researchers will stimuli-response material in combination with a specially developed biomolecule for detecting Listeria monocytogenes (pathogen present in foods).  The proposed work is particularly important because we do not have antibodies (a molecule that recognizes the pathogen) that have high affinity for this particular pathogen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop biosensors which combine stimuli-responsive polymer nanobrushes and aptamers. Such an approach is expected to significantly improve the field of pathogen detection. The biosensor device will be evaluated on a broad range of criteria such as sensitivity, selectivity, and response time with appropriate controls.  The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in combining the actuation of stimuli-responsive polymers with selective capture of bacteria by aptamers immobilized on the polymer surface for increasing selective capture and retention of target pathogens. The biomimetic approach proposed in this work is inspired by selective recruitment of symbiotic bacteria by ciliate actuation in the bobtail squid light organ, which is capable of capturing a specific target species from a solution with a complex microbial background and a wide range of particle sizes. When combined with nanomaterial-modified electrodes, it is anticipated to provide two distinct advantages; namely, enhanced capture of target bacteria due to lower non-specific binding, and enhanced limit of detection.  Broader Impacts : A convenient, rapid, and sensitive biosensor for foodborne pathogens can have significant impact in food safety and medical diagnostics.  This proposed research also serves as a unique opportunity for dissemination of engineering research to underrepresented population at the two collaborating institutions and will focus on food safety  and nano-biosensing technologies. These activities will include at Texas A&amp;M University:  (i) demonstrating practical applications on detecting foodborne pathogens in the Expanding Your Horizon one-day camp ( reaches 70 sixth-grade girls per year), (ii) mentoring  and hosting young women through the Women Explore Engineering summer camp; and (iii) hosting a high school teacher through Enrichment Experiences in Engineering program. At University of Florida activities will include (i) recruiting secondary science educator to participate in the research project through the Center for Precollegiate Education and Training (ii) developing online learning modules using animation software to teach biosensor concepts; and (iii) coordinating  and hosting  K-12 students through 4H Bioengineering summer camp &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Unsafe food and food poisoning due to insufficient protection from pathogenic bacteria result in human suffering from illness and tremendous financial repercussions. Despite strict regulations to control the presence of human pathogens in our food supply, there is an increasing incidence of disease resulting from contaminated foods. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop rapid and accurate techniques for pathogen<em> </em>detection in order to mitigate this problem. The objective of this research project was to develop biosensors based on composites of stimuli-responsive polymer nanobrushes and aptamers. The combinatorial effect of stimulus-response polymer nanobrushes functionalized with DNA aptamers for selective pathogen targeting demonstrated to significantly improve the field of pathogen detection. The research plan was to accomplish the following objectives: (1) engineer stimuli-responsive polymer nanobrush composites functionalized with DNA aptamers for targeting pathogens; (2) characterize actuation of nanobrush-aptamer composites for capturing and detecting pathogens; and (3) determine efficiency of nanobrush aptasensors for measuring pathogens in stagnant and flowing media.</p> <p>During the duration of this project, we worked with two stimuli-responsive polymer nanobrush types, pH-responsive and temperature-responsive functionalized with capture probes, including aptamers, enzymes, and/or antibodies for the detection of foodborne pathogen bacteria. We have tested these capture probes used for selectivity under the presence of interferents and complex food scenarios. We have also tested planar interdigitated aptasensor for flow-through detection of <em>Listeria </em>spp. in hydroponic lettuce growth media. This project produced an optimized method for capture and detection of bacteria based on aptamer and antibody functionalized stimulus responsive polymer nanobrushes, i.e., biomimetic nanobrushes. A new understanding of the effect of switchable gating properties was generated. This project produced a new understanding of the bio-nano interface in biosensors. Knowledge of the fundamental electron transport phenomena at this interface is critical for biosensor development. This project produced an optimized method for immobilizing biorecognition agents, i.e., aptamers, lectins, and antibodies. Immobilization of biomolecules while preserving the tertiary structure is often the most critical step in fabricating these devices. It assisted with understanding the fundamental interactions among biorecognition agent, microorganism, biopolymer, and bio-nano interface in biosensors. Moreover, it produced a new understanding on engineering biopolymer and hybrid metallic structures to improve biosensor performance. This project also assisted with the understanding of sensor efficacy in the presence and absence of flow and dielectrophoretic cell concentration. These fundamental studies can aid in the future development of microfluidic biochips incorporating the biomimetic nanobrush concept and dielectrophoresis for bacteria sensing. This study resulted in a rapid, sensitive tool, which has the potential to be integrated into food processing monitoring.</p> <p>Biosensors for foodborne pathogens have impact in other areas such as hospital infection, theranostics, battlefield trauma, and disease tracking in ecosystems. Furthermore, these biosensors can be used for early detection of diseases and in mitigating biothreats. The research also has unforeseen broad applications in areas other than biosensors, including development of other biotechnologies utilizing immobilization of biomolecules such as bioreactors, cell therapy, and cell scaffolds. Application of these biosensors have been demonstrated in rural areas in Colombia and other low-resource locations. The technology is being used to measure pathogens in hydroponic systems for food production.</p> <p>Additionally, this project trained five graduate students (one female Hispanic and four female students, one PhD and four MS), four undergraduate students (one female, two Hispanic students) and one research experience for undergraduate (REU) student, all in engineering disciplines. Students had the opportunity to present their research achievement at professional and scientific conferences. Students were involved in all activities of this project, and in most cases were the leaders of the activities.</p> <p>This project is likely to impact on the commercialization of a rapid, sensitive and portable foodborne pathogen detection tool, which can be integrated into food safety monitoring by food processing companies. This study resulted in rapid, portable, sensitive tools, which can easily be integrated into food safety monitoring. The developed sensing tools were able to sense bacteria pathogens in lab conditions at the level of currently used total viable count methods or better (approximately 2 cell per milliliter). Consequently, the tools developed in this project have the potential to assist in reducing the burden of foodborne diseases and ensuring a safe food supply and assisting with reduction of food waste. Furthermore, the advantage of the devices developed is that it will be able to yield results with a short time frame of minutes (approximately 20 min), compared to current evaluation time of 8-10 hours to days. This rapid analysis is expected to provide a significant economic advantage over current standard techniques by reducing holding times for laboratory testing and allowing processing plants to optimize intervention strategies. The results have been broadly propagated to the community by conference talks, papers, and seminars. Sixteen papers and two book chapter have been generated from the results of this project.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/08/2020<br>      Modified by: Zivko&nbsp;L&nbsp;Nikolov</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1512659/1512659_10365956_1594242119377_Figure1outcome--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1512659/1512659_10365956_1594242119377_Figure1outcome--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1 - nanobrush border sensing strategy."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1512659/1512659_10365956_1594242119377_Figure1outcome--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1 - nanobrush border sensing strategy."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Nanobrush sensing strategy for selective bacteria capture.
