<AbstractNarration>The 19th International Congress on Nitrogen Fixation (ICNF-19) that will be held at the Asilomar Conference in Pacific Grove, California from October 4-9, 2015  is a scientific meeting that provides outstanding opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scientists to interact with scientists from academia and industry on a global scale.  The meeting actively emphasizes and supports the training of students and postdocs in developing their communication and interpersonal skills.  Detailed efforts are planned to broaden the participation of women and members of groups under-represented in the sciences. The funding provided by NSF will broaden participation and help defray the costs of participation of students, postdoctoral associates and early-career investigators from the U.S. scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 1974, the ICNF has brought together previously insular research communities to stimulate international dialogue on the critical issues relating to biological nitrogen fixation.  The conference presents perspectives on the state of knowledge and covers diverse topics on nitrogen fixation.  The 2015 conference will have an outstanding program consisting of five plenary speakers: Peter Vitousek (Stanford University), Dennis Dean (Virginia Tech), Claire Gough (INRA, France), Jens Stougaard (Aarhus University, Denmark) and Mariangela Hungria (EMBRAPA, Brazil) along with closing remarks by Hauke Hennecke (ETH, Zurich).  The core program includes poster sessions as well as 12 sessions consisting of oral talks on the Biochemistry of Nitrogen Fixation, the Chemistry &amp; Theory of Nitrogen, Technology &amp; Business Aspects, Regulation &amp; Physiology, Molecular Genetics &amp; Genomics of Legume Symbioses, Nodule Development &amp; Physiology, Global Aspects, the Evolution, &amp; Ecology, Genetics &amp; Genomics of Legume Symbiosis, Real World &amp; Food Security Issues, Microbiology &amp; Synthetic Biology, and Non-Legume Systems. The content of the meeting will be disseminated by providing access to abstracts through the conference web site. In addition, like many previous ICNF meetings, the plan is to publish a book volume summarizing the presentations for ICNF-19.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 19th International Congress on Nitrogen Fixation (ICNF-19) was held at the Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove, California from October 4-9, 2015.  This was a forum for over 230 scientists from more than 30 countries to present results related to nitrogen fixation.  The subject matter ranged from atomic scale descriptions of catalytic mechanisms to global surveys of environmental impacts.  The meeting began on Sunday evening with a keynote talk by Peter Vitousek of Stanford University on "Ecological regulation of biological N fixation".  The next four days generally consisted of a morning plenary session followed by twin parallel afternoon sessions.  There was ample time for discussion over meals, at breaks, and at evening poster sessions.  Overall, the program format allowed members of the nitrogen fixation community to learn about each others research, to network and form collaborations, and discuss the future of nitrogen fixation research.   There were significant opportunities for students to participate in the program.  In fact, the Wednesday afternoon sessions were chaired by students, and several students gave talks throughout the program.  Students from around the world also presented posters at the meeting, and 3 students received awards at the meeting banquet for best posters in chemical, biological, and general aspects of nitrogen fixation.  Apart from the scientific sessions, the program also allowed for a meeting of the International Steering Committee.  Two new women members were added to the committee, and it was agreed to hold the next Congress (ICNF-20) in Spain in 2017, chaired by Prof. Maria Delgado.  At the final session of the meeting she gave a beautiful presentation inviting scientists to the meeting in Granada.
