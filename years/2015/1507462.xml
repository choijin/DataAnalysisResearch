<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Marie-Christine Daniel of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County is developing and studying highly multifunctional systems, where specific molecular species are attached to gold nanoparticles. This work is unique in that up to five different types of molecular species, each with its own function, can be attached with controllable composition. These functions include the ability to be imaged, bind to a particular biomolecular species (like a specific cell type), and release a chemical. A system that simultaneously displays complementary and cooperative properties can be much more effective than a mixture of single functional species. The study aims to understand whether the property of a particular function is affected by the proportion of that function in the nanosystem and/or by the other function(s) present in the nanosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to study how the coexistence of diverse functionalities onto a single nanocarrier can impact their individual properties on the entire nanocarrier. The novelty of the proposed multifunctional nanoplatform resides in the use of a set of specifically functionalized poly(propyleneimine) dendrons to decorate a gold nanoparticle core in a convergent construction approach. The dendritic structure affords a common interface between the core and the diverse functionalities, and a higher payload. The convergent assembly facilitates a better control over the composition of the resulting multifunctional nanocarriers: this is used to systematically vary the composition/proportion of five functionalities (NIR tag, MRI tag, protein, and two different cleavable small molecule payloads) onto the nanocarrier and thus obtain information about possible interactions between functions and their impact on the nanocarrier properties. The broader impacts of this work include the development of versatile nanoplatforms possibly leading to advances in a variety of fields, in particular in cancer combination therapy. Also, in Prof. Daniel's laboratory, high school students and undergraduates from under-represented  groups have the opportunity to participate to this interdisciplinary research and learn about chemical synthesis, material science, nanotechnology and biochemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the promising avenues for delivery of chemotherapeutics specifically to tumors and in increased effective concentration is through the use of nanoparticles. Presently various novel nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (liposomes, dendrimers, gold nanoparticles) are being investigated. The use of nanocarriers offer several compelling advantages such as their inherent versatility, increased multivalency and ability to passively target tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Within the diverse field of nanocarriers, dendrons and dendrimers (synthetic macromolecular polymers with tightly controlled geometry and structure) have shown impressive potential for targeted delivery of therapeutics.             This project led to the large scale preparation (up to 1 liter) of dendron-capped gold nanoparticles (hydrodynamic radius 30 nm) with various terminal functional groups (amine, carboxylate) and their derivatization for use in drug delivery and in vivo imaging.  A set of two dendrons of opposite charges (amine, carboxylate) was synthesized in gram scale and was used for the formation of highly stable, dendronized gold nanoparticle. These nanoparticles are able to withstand several rounds of lyophilization cycles with no sign of aggregation, and are stable in biological buffers as well as in serum. This nanocarrier platform displays a dense coating, with &gt;1400 dendrons/nanocarrier, which will enable very high payload. Furthermore, while positively-charged AuNPs expectedly showed cell cytotoxicity from a nanoparticle concentration of 1 nM, the mixed monolayer AuNPs (coated with 40/60 positive/negative dendrons) interestingly did not exhibit any sign of toxicity at concentrations as high as 15 nM, similarly to the negatively-charged AuNPs.   Three categories of dendrons have been prepared: (1) dendrons with imaging properties, (2) dendron with tumor-targeting abilities, and (3) dendrons carrying chemotherapeutic drugs. The dendrons with imaging properties consist in one dendron for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and two dendrons for near-infrared optical imaging. The dendron with tumor-targeting abilities was modified with an antibody fragment (Fab) specific to prostate tumors. And the dendrons carrying chemotherapeutic drugs consist in a dendron bearing cisplatin and one bearing doxorubicin.  All these functional dendrons were added onto gold nanoparticles, either on their own, or mixed:   Gold nanoparticles coated with one of the optical imaging dendron (containing a chlorin) led to improved fluorescene property. We have also found that gadolinium-based MRI dendron can be combined with chlorin dyes onto the surface of gold nanoparticles without affecting the fluorescence properties of the chlorin.  Since the process of functionalization of the gold nanoparticles allows for control of the ratio of MRI dendron and optical dendron, this will render possible the optimization of these bimodal nanocarriers so that they display both optimal MRI and fluorescent properties. Also, since gold is a heavy metal, the gold nanoparticles bearing MRI tags and optical dyes can also be used for X-ray CT imaging, becoming trimodal imaging agents.  The targeting gold nanoparticles, containing Fab fragments, do induce some immune reactions, but with a time- and concentration dependence, This implies that these gold nanoparticles should be able to be tuned in order to control their effect on the immune system.  Regarding the drugs loading, this project led to the development of a new approach that allows complete functionalization of the dendrons with precursors of acid-labile bonds: this opens the door to the preparation of a single molecule (e.g. dendrons) bearing 8 chemotherapeutic drugs.  This, added to the fact that we found a capacity of over 1,000 dendrons per gold nanoparticles, has the potential to lead to nanocarriers loaded with thousands of chemotherapeutic drugs.   The long term research goal of the current project is the generation of a diverse library of multifunctional theranostic agents against various forms of cancer (breast/prostate cancer) by effective utilization of the dendronized gold nanoparticle platform.  This project provided opportunities for research, and mentoring in chemistry/biochemistry, and have supported 2 graduate students who have been able to do full-time research and mentor several undergraduate students, during academic year as well as during the summers.  Also, it gave the opportunity to 8 undergraduate students (including a majority of underrepresented students) to get trained and involved in our research lab and thus improve their research skills.  Finally, it provided exposure to science and technology for high-school students that visited the lab during summers, as well as high-school students of schools where the PI presented a seminar on this project.
