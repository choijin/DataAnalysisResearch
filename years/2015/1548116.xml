<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for a 2-day workshop to be held at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography in the Fall/Winter 2015-2016. This workshop will bring together science community stakeholders, video recording experts, and data managers and metadata specialists to develop consensus and best practices for video and complementary metadata to help move the community toward the common goal of broad public access to distributed video content for scientific research and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Video imagery is an integral part of underwater operations conducted with ROVs, HOVs, and AUVs. These data are critical for sampling, exploration, and observation activities during seafloor operations and are key records for immediate post-dive and post-cruise research by the shipboard participants. Video archives have the potential to provide broad significant scientific benefits long after data acquisition and have tremendous potential for engaging the public in exciting ocean science research. To achieve this potential, significant challenges must be addressed that will allow video archives to become accessible and include sufficient metadata to allow users to access the content relevant to their needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the planning and execution of a workshop entitled Establishing Community Standards for Underwater Video Acquisition, Tagging, Archiving, and Access. The workshop was held in June of 2016 with approximately 75 participants present and participating remotely. Participation in the workshop from the commercial video industry provided important insight into the challenges we addressed.  Additional insight was gained from a web-based survey that was taken by 133 members of the community including operators, data managers, and scientists.  The objective of the workshop was to develop community consensus on standards for underwater video encompassing the entire workflow from acquisition through archiving in order to address the challenge of managing an ever-growing catalog of scientifically valuable video data. The workshop successfully addressed a number of issues and provided suggested actions that have been or are being adopted by operators. In addition, the workshop participants provided recommendations for the establishment of a working group that can shepherd the process of codifying best practices going forward. This is especially important given the pace at which the technology underpinning video data acquisition, storage, and delivery advances.  The workshop materials including presentations, reccomendations, workshop reports are publicly available at:  UnderwaterVideoWorkingGroup.  In addition, this site will serve as a repository for software that aids video acquisition, metadata generation, data management, and data storage.  Key recommendations of the workshop participants included best practices for the following topics:  ?       Recording  ?       File Naming Conventions  ?        Video Formats  ?       Compression  ?       Recording Media  ?       Telepresence and Video Recording  ?       Other Camera Sources  ?       Syncing time-codes and metadata  ?       Metadata Priorities  ?       Time-code embedding  ?       Subtitles/Watermarks/Video Overlay  ?       Embedded Geolocation Data     The best practice recommendations and suggestions are not intended to be an unfunded mandate, but are meant to help organize the community toward achieving common goals. We suggest that each operator should develop their own implementation strategy based on resources available and competing priorities, but following as many of the guidelines presented as possible.  With a concerted community effort, we hope to lay a foundation for providing the greatest accessibility and usability of underwater video data.
