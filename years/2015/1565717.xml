<AbstractNarration>Skilled worker shortages and lack of gender diversity in technician level science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields are state, national, and international problems. Having more women in the STEM workforce will help narrow the male-female wage gap and help reduce workforce shortages. This project at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology entitled Skilled Women Get STEM Jobs is designed to enable female students to prepare for careers in high demand, typically male-dominated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This project will contribute to the body of evidence about effective ways for high schools, community colleges, and industries to develop STEM pipelines that encourage young women to enter typically male-dominated technical careers. The project will have an impact not only on the large area served by the college, but also nationally, by disseminating information about successful recruiting and retention activities to encourage similar initiatives at other colleges and in industry groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on three college technician programs that are vital to the region and the nation: (a)  Machine Tool &amp; Computer Aided Manufacturing that educates technicians for jobs as machinists, tool and die makers, and computer numerically controlled operators and programmers; (b) Electrical Technology that educates technicians for the construction industry as electricians, the manufacturing industry as industrial electricians, and the utility industry as power generation and distribution technicians; and (c) Water &amp; Environmental Technology Program that educates technicians for water and wastewater treatment at municipal and private facilities, and for food processing, paper production, waste-to-energy, and environmental companies. The project will have an especially strong impact on water technology outreach initiatives as the college offers the only Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) approved associate degree program. The program will communicate directly and regularly with the PA DEP training section and the Pennsylvania Water Environment Association. National dissemination will be through the Water Environment Federation. To strengthen the three aforementioned technician programs, the project will build a high school to college pipeline to (a) encourage female high school students to enroll in college programs that offer solid job prospects, (b) engage the enrolled students through an informal group mentoring program and internship opportunities, and (c) facilitate their entry into the workforce by ensuring their familiarity with industries and job opportunities. Recruitment activities target females at 11 high schools through industry tours, college tours, and hands on cross disciplinary immersion workshops that develop a product designed by the participants to solve a local environmental problem. While research indicates that one-on-one mentoring using female role models works, this strategy will not bring results in industries or college programs that are virtually devoid of women. The project will test a novel approach to see if contact with female technicians, industry tours, and hands-on cross-disciplinary workshops are promising practices for attracting female high school students into three targeted STEM fields. It will also develop and test a replicable model for such workshops and a comprehensive evaluation will help determine the most effective strategies. Within three years, female enrollment will increase from 6% college-wide to 20% in the three targeted programs, and female students in those programs will be retained at the same high rate as males.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Skilled Women Get STEM Jobs project focused on increasing female student enrollment and retention in three programs at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology in Lancaster, Pennsylvania: Water &amp; Environmental Technology (WET), Computer Integrated Machining (CIM) [formerly known as Machine Tool &amp; Computer-Aided Manufacturing], and Electrical Technology (ELEC).       Project faculty developed close relationships with local high school teachers, guidance counselors, and administrators.  These partners worked in collaboration to select and invite female high school students to participate in a day-long field trip experience.  Each field trip began with a tour of local industry (e.g., a manufacturing facility, or a wastewater or drinking water treatment plant), and was followed by lunch with female role models working in the targeted industry.  Female participants then toured the College campus and met with instructors in the targeted programs.     As a final culminating activity, participants were invited back to Campus to participate in a hands-on, multi-disciplinary workshop.  Students machined components for a desktop fountain and worked to wire a simple circuit.       The project also focused on improving the retention of female students enrolled in the targeted programs.  Faculty in WET and CIM collaborated to develop a team building initiative on Campus, and offered multiple group mentoring activities during each term.     Intellectual Merit: The findings of this project contribute to the body of evidence about effective ways for high schools, community colleges, and industries to develop STEM pipelines that encourage young women to enter typically male-dominated technical careers.      Creating strong partnerships between high schools and local industry was found to be a valuable recruiting tool.  A key takeaway was the importance of selecting industry sites carefully to ensure they met one or more key criteria, including:  Employ females who could serve as role models within the targeted career paths. Show a clear link between the career path and required technical skills and soft skills. Demonstrate connections between the industry and the community and/or local environment.   In some cases, project faculty provided informal training with suggested talking points to industry partners before the female students were brought onsite for plant tours.       Many participants in the tours, and female students who subsequently enrolled in one of the targeted programs, reported that their perception of the industry was changed by seeing young women (role models) they knew or were introduced to who worked in that industry.      Finally, recognizing the importance of micro-messaging, project faculty advocated for changes in marketing materials and strategies.  New publications featured photos of female students engaged in learning or at work. Each technical program produced a banner featuring female students.  In addition, technical programs were encouraged to have female students and/or industry representatives onsite for Open Houses held for prospective students.       The implementation of these best practices led to a sustained increase in the number of female students enrolled in the targeted programs, with the largest number of female students enrolled in the WET program.  Female student enrollment across all programs at Thaddeus Stevens College also increased.     Broader Impacts: The results of this project have had a broad impact. The project team shared their findings locally, statewide, and nationally with other colleges, high schools, and industry partners.    The most notable broader impact included industry partners who adopted some of the successful strategies. At the local level, several industry partners began adopting the practice of offering industry tours beyond the scope of this grant.  At the national level, HAAS Automation Inc. (a CNC equipment manufacturer) revised their promotional materials to ensure that young women (specifically including a Thaddeus Stevens College student) were featured.
