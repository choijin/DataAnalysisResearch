<AbstractNarration>This is funding to cover airfare, ground travel and certain other expenses for approximately 40 attendees (30 promising junior investigators plus 10 accomplished senior scholars as mentors, eight from academic and two from industry) at the 8th Summer Research Institute (workshop) being organized by the PI under the auspices of the Consortium for the Science of Socio-Technical Systems (CSST), which will be held July 20-24, 2015, at The Nature Place, a National Environmental Study Center of the National Park Service located outside of Colorado Springs, CO.  The CSST resulted from recognition of the growing importance of research on the interplay of humans and technology.  The science of socio-technical systems (SST) is fundamental to the rapidly growing "virtual organizations" thematic area, among others; thus, the urgent national need for research that is firmly grounded in the SST tradition.  Yet this community of scholars, which includes faculty in diverse fields such as social informatics, social computing, CSCW, computational social science, HCI, and information science, remains fractured and largely invisible. The CSST series of Summer Research Institutes is a critical step toward unifying this diverse community and enhancing its visibility, by providing an immersive experience for the next generation of SST leaders (both advanced doctoral students and pre-tenure faculty) so that they will be well prepared to engage in distributed scientific inquiry.  The Summer Research Institutes build critical intellectual and social capital by fostering creation of a cohort group of new researchers whose work is shaped by hearing experts in socio-technical systems research provide encouragement and give advice on how to advance the field's intellectual basis, methodological approaches, and potential for sustained, meaningful and even transformative impact.  Increasingly, the iConference has become a showcase for Summer Research Institute alumni; for example, in 2011 more than one third of all events involved a sociotechnical scholar and Summer Research Institute alumni.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2015 workshop will adhere to the successful format that has evolved and been refined over the course of the prior Summer Research Institutes.  The workshop will bring together early career researchers selected through a competitive review process with a set of more senior researchers for an intensive five-day research exchange.  The event will be residential and located in a semi-isolated locale to encourage the maximum amount of social interaction among participants.  Senior faculty, junior faculty, and advanced doctoral students will collectively strive to articulate in more coherent and contemporary forms the basic principles, goals and approaches to doing socio-technical science across a range of relevant intellectual communities.  They will explore topics and methods for advancing the science of socio-technical systems, while focusing on intellectual development of individual research that is aligned with core aspects of the socio-technical perspective. More than 55 accomplished senior scholars and 210 promising junior investigators have participated in the previous seven CSST Summer Research Institutes  The diversity of participants across a number of dimensions (e.g., institutional, disciplinary, geographic, gender, minority group status), serves to broaden participants' perspectives at a critical stage in their careers.  The immersive intellectual experience during the workshop will facilitate creation of a social network among the participants and the senior researchers who serve as Institute instructors.  This network will play a major role both in the professional development of the participants and in the evolution of the field of socio-technical systems research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the 2015 CSST Summer Research Institute was to foster the continued support and development of a community of talented researchers across a diverse array of disciplines who study and evaluate the design, implementation, performance, and outcomes of sociotechnical systems. This fostering took multiple forms.     First and foremost, this fostering featured the mentorship of junior researchers by leading scholars not only for how to improve their scholarship, but for how to best employ alternative methods and approaches, how to think more broadly about the problems they tackle, how to form working partnerships with colleagues in related fields, how to navigate research careers and institutions, and how to explain and disseminate their work to broader audiences.  Beyond this mentorship, the Institute also fostered community building among the mentors themselves, who were drawn from diverse disciplines and who may not have known of each otherÆs work prior to the Institute. Such community building allows opportunity for senior scholars to contemplate new partnerships, consider another fieldÆs candidates when hiring, and otherwise broaden and deepen the community.  A third way in which the Institute fostered community development was through the bringing together of a set of volunteers, primarily junior scholars, who worked as a group to build cyberinfrastructure for the community in the form of website features and other applications that promote connectivity among scholars.  Finally, the InstituteÆs fostering took the form of mentoring teams of scholars who came to design sociotechnical research projects, and potentially begin writing funding proposals for the projects, with the guidance of experienced senior scholars.       In sum, although support for the Summer Research Institute did not directly lead to scientific findings, it directly supported improved science (and indirectly aided future scientific findings) by helping us build the social and cyberinfrastructure that leading science demands.
