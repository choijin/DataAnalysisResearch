<AbstractNarration>Youth long distance runners and their injuries have been understudied, particularly when compared to the amount of existing and ongoing research regarding adult runners. Physical burnout and overuse injuries can have a lasting effect, contributing to medical costs and preventing young athletes from remaining physically active. The findings of this investigation will have applications across youth development and activity, and will lead to a richer understanding of the biomechanics of long distance runners between genders and across maturational levels.  The proposed research will capitalize on Drs. John Cronin and Jon Oliver?s study of youth and adolescent athletes at the Sports Performance Research Institute of the Auckland University of Technology, and will generate a more holistic picture of the interaction between biomechanics, neuromechanics, and fatigue in growing athletes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study aims to analyze changes due to fatigue in the biomechanics and neuromuscular control of male and female long distance runners of varying maturational status.  This research will result in a profile of how muscle activity, leg stiffness, and stride length change with fatigue, as these can all be predictors of injury.  To achieve this goal, kinetic and kinematic data will be collected during a training run on a treadmill.  Leg stiffness and muscle activity will be compared before and after runs using EMG and force measurements.  Potential uses of this research include a biomechanical risk prediction model to provide guidelines for safe volume and frequency of running by pubertal stage.  The methods employed can also be extended to protect young athletes in other sports where overuse injuries are common, such as baseball.  This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Royal Society of New Zealand.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Running is an increasingly popular sport and recreational activity, with more young athletes training for and competing in distance events worldwide.  However, despite the growing participation in running there is little consensus regarding safe levels of running volume and frequency with regards to age, especially when it comes to middle to long distances.  Studies of adult runners and what predisposes them to injury are plentiful and diverse, but comparable research incorporating pre and early adolescents are lacking.  Such studies are vital in order to determine the interaction of growth and maturation with both fatigue and markers of injury risk.  The purpose of this study was to examine the mechanics of young runners and how they change with fatigue, with longer term goals of 1) comparison to mature runners and 2) identification of potential overuse markers and injury predictors.  It was posited that both limb acceleration and impact forces would increase with fatigue.  The hypothesis was tested by using three dimensional camera analysis to capture and analyze a group of youth distance runners over the course of a forty minute run to fatigue.  We found that similarly to adults, foot strike patterns in young runners can change with fatigue - for example from forefoot to rearfoot. Heel acceleration and ground reaction forces demonstrated a tendency to increase with fatigue as well.  Stride length and cadence remained relatively constant.    A deeper understanding of the mechanics and physiology of young athletes and how they are differ from that of adults is important from both a development and injury prevention perspective.  This work fills a void in the existing literature by beginning to describe the mechanics of young distance runners, providing preliminary data and guiding the direction of future research in this area.
