<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt; A magnetic skyrmion is an interesting structure of the spin texture in which its topology is unchanged against any smooth deformation of the spins.  Because of this stable topological structure, skyrmions exhibit many exotic and unique properties that could be used in future spintronic technology.  However, skyrmions exist only in special types of materials and usually at low temperature and high magnetic field so that it is difficult to explore their physical properties.  In this proposal, the PI proposes a new method to synthesize and study artificial magnetic skyrmions so that skyrmion research can be performed at room temperature and in a much wider range of materials.  This method also permits the search of other topological subjects such as the so-called merons.  Results of this research are expected to not only advance our knowledge on topological properties of magnetic systems but also to create application potentials in spintronics technology.  In addition, this research activity integrates research with basic education at both graduate and undergraduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt; Artificial magnetic skyrmions will be synthesized by Molecular Beam Epitaxy and investigated using Photoemission Electron Microscopy.  Single crystalline magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetization will be grown epitxially on top of which magnetic disks will be grown using a contact shadow mask.  Magnetic vortices will then be formed inside the disks by choosing appropriate disk radius and thickness.  The interfacial magnetic coupling imprints the vortex state from the disk into the underlayer.  Therefore an artificial skyrmion will be formed with the vortex surrounded by perpendicular magnetization.  The skyrmion topological magnetic number will be controlled and switched by switching the surrounding magnetization up and down.  Topological properties of the skyrmions will then be explored by imaging the skyrmion vortex as a function of magnetic field.  Other topological objects such as merons will also be searched and investigated in coupled disks in which the interlayer coupling and disk thickness ratio will be systematic varied using double wedge growth.  In particular, correlation between polarity and divergence of the meron will be explored.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             We accomplished several projects during this period.  In particular, we successfully created artificial magnetic skyrmions at room temperature.  Skyrmion is a topological spin texture of two-dimensional system, and exhibits many fascinating topological properties.  The formation of skyrmions in experimental systems, however, usually requires the inversion symmetry breaking of the materials.  This requirement excludes many magnetic materials from skyrmion research.  We developed an innovative method to realize for the first time the artificial magnetic skyrmions.  Recognizing that a skyrmion is nothing but a magnetic vortex surrounded by an out-of-plane magnetic background, we imprinted a magnetic vortex state from a Co disk into a continuous Ni film.  In this way, the Ni film contains a vortex state below the Co disk but an out-of-plane magnetization surrounding the disk area.  Then we realized artificial skyrmion in the Ni film at room temperature without the constrain of inversion symmetry breaking.  In addition, different topological state of the skyrmion can be prepared by simply flipping the out-of-plane Ni magnetization direction. Using magnetic imaging technique, we revealed the topological structures of the created artificial skyrmions and demonstrated unambiguously the topological effect in the annihilation process of these skyrmions.  Our result broadens the skyrmion research by extending skyrmion materials to epitaxial thin films without the need of inversion symmetry breaking as well as by realizing skyrmions at room temperature, therefore will impact significantly the future skyrmion-based spintronics technology.  In addition, graduate students and postdocs received solid scientific training during the research process.  They not only learnt the state-of-art experimental techniques, but also moved to the cutting-edge frontier of spintronics research.
