<AbstractNarration>The massive integration of wind resources into the generation mix of the electric power infrastructure poses new challenges to system operators due to the uncertainty and variability of these resources. The intermittent nature of wind and other renewable energy resources, together with limitations of storage in current power systems, poses serious challenges for integrating renewable resources into the power grid, while maintaining acceptable service reliability. Efficient deployment of conventional and flexible resources requires new methods that explicitly account for uncertainty in day-ahead unit commitment. This project proposes to use topology control as a recourse mechanism which mobilizes flexibility of the grid through transmission line switching to redirect power flow in response to prevailing renewable generation conditions, thus overcoming loss of reliability due to intermittency. However, such topology control will require new algorithmic innovations which will allow system operators to plan their day-ahead unit-commitment by incorporating topology control as a recourse action. The project pursues a novel problem formulation for transmission line switching in response to variable generation that holds promise for being computationally feasible. It is hoped that the outcomes of the project will help to facilitate growth of renewable generation while maintaining grid efficiency and reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the topology of the grid consists of a discrete set of transmission links, the choice of which links to use becomes a combinatorial optimization problem. Moreover, the presence of intermittency in renewable generation requires the transmission network to adapt to the specific generation scenario being observed. This leads to a two-stage stochastic optimization model in which the first stage choices are associated with slow-ramping generators, while the second stage model includes the fast-ramping as well as intermittent generators. The recourse action in this setup leads to a mixed-integer program (MIP) in the second stage, which violates the convexity requirements of common decomposition algorithms which have been highly successful in power system operations. This proposal shows that a new model, which is a two stage stochastic MIP (SMIP), possesses a very special structure which can be exploited so that realistic stochastic unit commitment problems can be solved, even though the general class of two-stage SMIP models are known to be extremely difficult. The proposal outlines a combined parallel-serial approximation strategy which appears promising, and could transform the commonly-held notion that high penetration of renewable energy will have an adverse effect on reliability. The project is a high-risk, high return undertaking on two levels: a) it could lead to a truly sustainable approach to reliable renewable integration, and b) the algorithmic advance of solving very large scale SMIP by decomposing into smaller pieces, without sacrificing optimality would provide a major step in the solution of these very challenging optimization problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Focus: Renewable Energy Integration.  Lawmakers throughout the U.S. have mandated that electricity supply should include a significant percentage of energy from renewable resources - each state has set its own goal, with California being the most aggressive Each state has set its own goal, with California being the most aggressive, requiring 50% renewables by 2026, 60% by 2030, and 100% by 2045. Local/State authorities (e.g., Independent System Operators (ISO)) which are in-charge of wholesale electricity supply have commissioned focused studies to assess operational considerations such as system reliability, market design, storage technologies and other devices.  However, a recent study commissioned by CAISO suggests that for penetration levels beyond 33%, one can expect a great deal of over-generation while also facing the possibility of curtailment of renewable energy, or load-shedding in the evening.  One basic questions facing ISO?s is: "how much renewable penetration can be managed in large electricity grids, without the negative impacts mentioned above?"  To answer this question, we study whether there may be any advantages to adopting modern stochastic algorithms for electricity grid operations.   Workflow of Power System Operations:  Modern ISOs manage their power-systems in two-phases. The first phase involves day-ahead planning, where the demand and renewable-supplies are estimated, generation-bids are collected, and a day-ahead unit commitment (DA-UC) problem is solved to clear the market. The DA-UC problem produces a low-cost commitment schedule for all generating units, typically, over a day-long planning-horizon with hourly resolution. The second-phase of operations addresses the real-time requirements of the grid. Throughout the day, short-term unit commitment (ST-UC) and economic dispatch (ED) problems are solved to produce cost-effective generation profiles and to address contingencies, using the most up-to-date data on the system. These problems are solved for much shorter time-horizons, but with finer resolution. Our experimental framework is designed to imitate the decision-making process of modern ISOs. We consider a three-layered framework. At first, a DA-UC problem determines hourly commitment-schedules for a majority of generators, using day-ahead forecasts on load and renewable resources. We simulate the planning of intraday operations, dynamically, and at a more granular level. The ST-UC problems, solved every hour, commits additional resources based on need. Finally, ED problems, solved every 15 minutes, determines cost-efficient generation decisions. As the simulation-clock is moved, the renewable-supply information provided to ST-UC and ED problems is also improved.  Such repeated solutions are the key to setting up these experiments, and a system such as CORE allows us to carry out such experiments with relative ease.  Specific Purpose of the Experiment:  Because Solar and Wind are considered to be highly Variable Energy Resources (VER), our experiment sought to answer the following question:   When we introduce such VER into the grid, do deterministic planning models provide the most appropriate tool for electricity grid operations? Do stochastic planning models help?     We studied these questions for a network known as NREL 118, which has been created for experimental purposes by researchers at the (National Renewable Energy Lab).  Our study involves we used two types of models:  Deterministic or Stochastic Optimization models for each type of planning problems (DA-UC, ST-UC, and ED).  These three classes are listed in that order for the experiments reported in Table 1.  Thus, the designation (DDS) stands for the models DA-UC, ST-UC, and ED being solved using Deterministic optimization algorithm for the first model, another Deterministic optimization algorithm for the second model, and finally a stochastic optimization algorithm for the third model.  The columns in Table 1 are grouped into three categories:  The first three columns correspond to solar (S) and wind (W) penetration for the NREL dataset, the second set of columns are for medium renewable penetration, and finally, high renewable penetration.  It is clear from the first row (N/A) that using no reserves is unacceptable because the average unmet demand due to VER would be unacceptably high.  Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the SDS entries (for unmet demands) the smallest in each set of three runs.   While the experiment was performed for the NREL dataset, it points to a direction that using stochastic optimization for planning operations of the electricity grid has the potential to provide much superior resilience of the electricity grid, and should be considered for high renewable penetration.
