<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project results from the potential for the technologies being developed to incorporate the spatial dimension into video-based communication tools, allowing people to share their physical spaces with remote participants, who can then independently explore and annotate these spaces, providing new opportunities for remote collaboration. The commercial impact of this innovation is potentially substantial. Such spatial telecollaboration technologies could find practical use in a wide range of applications, such as remote repair, training and instruction, disaster/emergency situations, real estate, and many others. More compelling remote collaboration tools can open up new opportunities for people to richly experience remote events and to share personal experiences in a way that audio- and video-based communications cannot achieve. These telecollaboration capabilities can significantly improve opportunities for underdeveloped and underserved communities to participate in location-specific events and activities, including remote medical assessment, remote learning, and participation in situations where travel is prohibitively expensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project endeavors to build on prior NSF-funded research to develop compelling, user-centered technologies that support remote collaboration in contexts where the physical space around the user is important to the interaction. The research plan focuses on two specific aspects that have not been addressed in prior work but are important to commercialization of the technology: initialization of the spatial modeling and handling of dynamic scenes. The proposal suggests plausible solutions and details plans to explore individual solutions and combinations for both problems, in order to provide users with a system that requires minimal additional effort or focus to employ. The results of the proposed research include a solution path for both of these key issues and a prototype system that implements remote spatial-based collaboration without encumbering the users with system-level details, while allowing them to focus on the tasks at hand.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ While videoconferencing products and virtual world environments are now widely used in a broad range of contexts from social to enterprise, they lack support for spatial interaction with the physical environment, as needed for example in remote assistance for repair, training, medical assistance or assessment, or spatial exploration. While at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the PI introduced a new concept for remote collaboration based on Augmented Reality (AR). By integrating advanced computer vision and AR, it allows remote collaborators a far greater level of spatial interaction and a more intuitive way to communicate spatial information than traditional tools, using off-the-shelf smartphones or similar devices. The objective of the project funded by this NSF SBIR award was to address a particular set of challenges identified as critical to move from research prototype toward commercial viability, and in particular to identify ways to improve the robustness and usability of the prototype such that it could be employed by non-technical experts.  During the award period, we were able to design and implement solutions for the identified challenges and thus moved from a research prototype significantly towards a product prototype, with a much more flexible and scalable system architecture and a better user experience. Importantly, we were able to devise solutions for newly arisen technical challenges without impact on the original vision of the product.  The intellectual merit of the project includes novel designs and algorithms in the realm of computer vision and human-computer interaction. The broader impact of the project is the potential for the technologies being developed to significantly broaden the applicability of remote collaboration to new fields. Better remote collaboration tools can open up new opportunities for utilizing sparsely available expertise more efficiently, enabling faster responses or better oversight in critical situations, and other remote interaction scenarios.
