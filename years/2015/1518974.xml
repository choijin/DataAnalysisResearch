<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for junior speakers to attend the second "Future of Astronomy" conference in Evanston, IL. The conference follows on from a highly successful meeting held in 2011, and is designed to bring together a significant fraction of the top postdoctoral researchers in astronomy in North America. A key goal of the workshop is to create a venue where leading postdoctoral researchers from across the country, working in much different programs and in different areas, can come together to share their excitement and ideas on future key research areas. This is a significant opportunity for the attendees to speak about, and survey, the frontier of astrophysics, and the workshop will undoubtedly lead to numerous new collaborations being formed. Funding will additionally be targeted toward, although not limited to, women and under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Thanks to NSF support, we were successful in convening a three-day meeting of the top young astrophysics researchers in North America, ensuring that fully half of the speakers at the conference were female astronomers or astronomy researchers from underrepresented minorities in the field.  NSF funding allowed us to invite and fully fund the travel of 20 female and under-represented-minority prize postdoctoral fellows (out of a total of 40) to Evanston, IL for "Fellows on the Frontiers 2016" meeting from August 31st to September 2nd, 2016 at Northwestern University.  The speakers summarized their research in 20-minute talks, covering diverse areas of astronomy research such as the growth and evolution of galaxies, the formation of planets and stars, the growth of supermassive black holes, chemistry in the Universe, the explosions of massive stars, turbulence in the gas between stars, planets that feely move between stars, simulations of the evolution of the Universe, how stars can be destroyed by moving close to black holes, detecting planets around other stars, and how gravity works in extreme conditions.  The attendees not only interacted with other researchers during the talks, but enjoyed catered breaks and receptions to meet and network, to help them discover new research questions and topics.  The organizers also invited American Astronomical Society (AAS) President Christine Jones Forman to attend, who talked with all of the attendees during a catered lunch, answering questions about the state of the astronomy research community, the importance of the AAS, and how to communicate (and how important it is to communicate) with congressional representatives and thank them for their support.   During the meeting, organizers recieved a number of compliments both on the organization of the meeting, and on the 50/50 gender balance at the meeting.  Researchers also enjoyed the wide variety of topics that were discussed (where a different subject area was discussed in each successive talk).  This format, where expert researchers are invited from different subfields, is almost unique; besides the "Bash Symposium", we know of no other venue where such a diversity of astronomy postdoctoral fellows can meet to discuss the scientific state of the field, and their wishes for the community in general.  The organizers and attendees were very happy with this meeting; we hope to hold another version of this meeting in four to five years.
