<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Davis at Azusa Pacific University  APU) and Professor Clowers at Washington State University (WSU) are pursuing a new approach for detecting and characterizing chemicals at trace levels using a technique termed Radiative Ion-Ion Neutralization (RIIN). Under the guidance of Drs. Davis and Clowers, a combined team of undergraduate and graduate researchers advance an innovative approach to chemical detection that has the potential to directly benefit a number of existing technologies routinely used for environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and threat detection in both the civilian and military domains. Current methods for detecting trace chemicals in the field often rely upon technology that not only ignores diagnostically-useful information, but restricts the chemical detection limits that may be reached. Successful characterization of the Radiative Ion-Ion Neutralization (RIIN) mechanism enhances the levels of information provided from rapid chemical measurements and impact fields from preliminary security screening to biochemistry. Through the implementation of this project, students from APU have the opportunity to travel to WSU during the summer academic months to work with Dr. Clowers and his students in a graduate-level research environment while students from WSU have the opportunity to travel to APU during the academic year to gain experience leading research and mentoring undergraduate research assistants.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing approaches for ion detection at high pressure are inherently limited by the signal-to-noise performance characteristics of analog circuitry.  At present, no compatible ion amplification technology is capable of single ion-counting under atmospheric conditions. This has constrained the growth and development of ion mobility spectrometry as a trace analytical tool.  Radiative Ion-Ion Neutralization (RIIN) provides a new means of recording gas-phase ion signals that also integrates optical spectroscopy with traditional ion mobility measurements. The development and characterization of the RIIN detection platform is pursued across three objectives: 1) Development of RIIN as a quantitative gas-phase ion-transduction mechanism; 2) Determination of the RIIN photon release mechanism; and 3) Leveraging wavelength resolved RIIN signals for chemical identification. The unique signal transduction provided by the RIIN system directly benefits platforms focused on characterizing atmospheric pressure gas-phase ions and adds a highly informative second dimension of information that can more precisely assess the chemical content of complex mixtures. An equally important goal of this work is the integration of RIIN-informed gas-phase spectroscopy into the ion mobility experiment. The resulting multidimensional platform represents both a new analytical methodology and means of directly probing the chemical functional groups for gas-phase ions.</AbstractNarration>

Many chemical instruments rely on the detection of ions at atmospheric pressure, and a successful single-ion counting mechanism would make these instruments much more sensitive and able to detect lower levels of contaminants. RIIN is the phenomenon of two ions, one positive, one negative, interacting with one another to produce light. An ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) spectrum using RIIN to detect the ions was previously shown (<strong>Picture 1</strong>), and this research aimed to prove or disprove the phenomenon and leverage it for analytical utility. Several discoveries were made through the course of this research: a new method for measuring environmental metals was developed that has the potential to allow on-site measurements of extremely low concentration contaminants (<strong>Picture 2</strong>); IMS was made significantly simpler and cheaper through the application of printed circuit boards and open-source hardware and software (<strong>Picture 3</strong>); the use of 3D printing technologies now allows researchers to produce optical mounts and similar hardware for a fraction of the cost of commercial solutions (<strong>Picture 4</strong>); and these tools as well as models of analytical instruments have been created and used to enhance the teaching of analytical chemistry to undergraduate students (<strong>Picture 5</strong>).</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>In addition, throughout the course of this research, numerous undergraduate chemistry students had the opportunity to participate in NSF-funded research, present their work to professional conferences, and publish the results; an opportunity not common for undergraduate students from a primarily undergraduate institution. Of the students involved directly in this research, 50% were female and 40% were from underrepresented populations within STEM fields. These students were able to travel with the PI to a nationally recognized research university (Washington State University) as an integral part of this collaborative research project, where they spent 2 months working full time alongside graduate students in the chemical sciences as well as being mentored by Dr. Brian Clowers; Co-PI of the grant and PI of the lab at WSU. This work also served to advance the research tools and access within Azusa Pacific University (APU). As a direct result of this work, APU now has access to 3D printing, an IMS that is currently being used in another research project as an inter-departmental collaboration, and tools to advance the education of the students through hands-on analytical projects. As a recently designated Hispanic Service Institution, these tools will advance the education of underrepresented student populations for years to come.</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The final results of the proposed project were not those anticipated in the proposal process. While the interaction of ions with a biased needle does produce light (evidenced by the spectrum shown in <strong>Picture 1</strong>), this interaction is not due to the RIIN process as originally hypothesized. The light produced is characteristic of any needle at high voltage (a corona discharge); composed solely of light emitted from nitrogen in the air (<strong>Picture 6</strong>). This, among other evidences, led the researchers to conclude that RIIN is not the phenomenon behind the observed spectrum and precludes the ability to use this as a method for single-ion counting. The value of this research in the end came through the discoveries made through reaching these conclusions, and the resources provided to the students and faculty of APU. This project has served to significantly advance research endeavors and therefore the educational experience of the next generation of science students in Southern California.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/27/2019<br>      Modified by: Eric&nbsp;J&nbsp;Davis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1507155/1507155_10401326_1566945961642_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1507155/1507155_10401326_1566945961642_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Prior Work"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1507155/1507155_10401326_1566945961642_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Prior Work"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">IMS-RIIN spectrum of nitroglycerin.
