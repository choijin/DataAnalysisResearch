<AbstractNarration>A non-technical description of the project, which explains the project's significance and importance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pantanal region of Brazil is a vast domain of headwater wetlands that represents a little-documented aspect in the evolution of river systems. These environments are extremely important for the ecological health of tropical rivers. The environment is sensitive to both climatic and environmental changes, but the degree to which these will affect the region is unknown. This project will examine lake cores collected from the region to establish a chronology of environmental change in the region that documents the response of the system to climate and can help evaluate the possible effects of human intervention. This is a collaborative project that is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A technical description of the project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID project will examine how changing environmental conditions can (1) impact surface processes (e.g., erosion and weathering); and (2) influence landscape evolution in lowland tropical wetlands. The field site is the little- studied Pantanal of central South America. The Brazilian Pantanal offers an excellent example of extensive savanna-floodplain wetland development along several coalescing megafans (large distributive fluvial systems).  The main objective of this research is to collect new lake sediment cores from a large floodplain lake in the northern Pantanal. Lake deposits are a potential archive of Quaternary landscape evolution, as the dynamics of sediment composition and accumulation are sensitive to environmental transitions. The project will use standard techniques to assess how the lake accumulates sediment today, and use these data as a framework for interpreting older material recovered from the lake cores.</AbstractNarration>

This RAPID project took advantage of a convergence in unusual access to sampling permits, a timely weather window, and personnel in Brazil to sample the largest lake in the Pantanal wetlands, Lake Uberaba. The Pantanal is one of the world?s premier sites to study the Quaternary evolution of large distributive fluvial systems (DFSs) and lowland wetlands in a tropical setting.

The reliance on remote sensing stems largely from practical concerns &ndash; the Pantanal is formidable wilderness &ndash; and access to permits from the Brazilian government are very difficult for foreigners to obtain.    The project team, comprised of scientists and students from the USA and Brazil (Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul), completed the first successful sampling expeditions to the Lake Uberaba region of northwestern Pantanal, which is situated along the toe of the Paraguay DFS.  The project PIs built collaborations with the Brazilian Army and the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, who provided logistical support that helped to make the sampling expeditions possible, as well as access to new remote sensing and environmental time series datasets. As the lake was previously unexplored, the approach initially focused on sampling to understand the limnogeology of the modern system, in order to constrain the hydroclimate filter imposed by the lake on any environmental reconstructions made using sediment cores.

These insights were confirmed by a shallow seismic profile, which imaged a low-relief floodplain with incised channels underlying the lake system. In situ physical/chemical properties (dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, salinity) were measured at the air-water and water-mud boundaries, which revealed a well-mixed, oxygenated, freshwater lake basin.
