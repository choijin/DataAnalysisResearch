<AbstractNarration>Often, the main factor limiting the performance of vehicles, power generators, civil engineering structures, and many other products is the durability of the metals they are made of. Better metals are therefore key to advancing technologies at the core of US competitiveness and security: transportation, energy, and infrastructure. Nano-metallic materials comprise a class of metals that promise to fill this need: they possess extreme strength, resistance to damage from repeated loading, and numerous unique properties such as resistance to radiation damage. This research project addresses a drawback of nano-metallic materials that has so far limited their practical use. Namely: when they stretch, they do not elongate uniformly throughout, but rather pinch off in isolated locations. This project will create nano-metallic materials that stretch uniformly and are therefore not prone to sudden failures. It will thereby remove a major impediment to the widespread technical use of nano-metallic materials and accelerate their deployment to the marketplace. This project will also undertake outreach activities to high school teachers and students, women, individuals from underrepresented minorities, and the broader scientific community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though many nano-metallic materials are intrinsically ductile, they appear to fail in a brittle-like manner because plastic deformation in them localizes into narrow zones that subsequently fracture. The goal of this project is to create nano-metallic materials that resist flow localization by engineering their architectures, interfaces/surfaces, and compositions via an iterative design process that integrates theory, modeling, and experiments. The project will follow an iterative design-synthesize-test cycle that scans the design space rapidly and integrates insights gained in each iteration by updating theoretical models connecting design parameters to performance metrics. Due to the nanometer-scale microstructure dimensions in nano-metallic materials, conventional dislocation-based mechanisms for averting flow localization are not applicable. Therefore, this project will explore and implement non-dislocation mechanisms that rely on twinning, surface and interface stresses, coherency stresses, interface barriers to slip, confined layer slip, and composites of flow-localizing and uniformly deforming constituents.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Advanced structural metallic alloys are vital to the next generation technologies at the core of US competitiveness and economic and national security, transportation, energy, and infrastructure.  While metallic materials and coatings are widely used in engineering applications, the conventional metals tend to be weak and prone to failure resulting in over-designed structures that limit the mechanical performance and reduce the overall efficiency. Nanocomposite metallic materials comprise a class of metals that exhibit high mechanical strengths but suffer from sudden failure upon yielding due to their inability to elongate uniformly throughout. The goal of this project was to design nanocomposite structures that are super-strong but resist localization of plastic flow.  The intellectual merit of this project was the demonstration of an iterative "design-synthesize-test" cycle approach that integrates computational simulations with experimental synthesis and characterization to develop nano-metallic materials with superior mechanical properties. Cu-Mo thin films synthesized via magnetron co-sputtering were used as model systems.  The project explored, iteratively, a variety of compositionally modulated designs that form due to self-organization during film growth where the mechanical response of each design was used to change the synthesis parameters to alter the composite design. It was concluded that the bicontinuous, intertwined random concentration modulation design enables suppression of flow localization even in super-strong metals with yield strengths exceeding 2000 MPa.

This hierarchical architecture may lead to unprecedented combination of strength and deformability.  The broader impacts from this project were outreach activities to high school teachers and elementary and middle school students, including individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM, and the broader scientific community.
