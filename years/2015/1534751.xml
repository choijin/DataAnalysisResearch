<AbstractNarration>Competition in plant communities is a fundamental ecological process that has been studied through experimentation and by modeling. Given the long time periods over which tree populations interact and the increasing availability of extensive data bases with long-term measurements of tree growth and mortality, this project aims to use advanced modeling methodology to develop enhanced quantitative expressions of competition.  Improved models of competition in forest populations are required to further advance our predictive ability for management options in a range of forest types. Understanding competition dynamics is paramount for evaluating management activities such as deploying genetic material, prescribing site preparation treatments and planting density, predicting response to varying levels of inter-and intra-specific competition resulting from vegetation control and thinning, and ameliorating nutrient deficiencies through fertilizer applications. Increased understanding of competition processes and formulation of improved models for quantifying competition effects will enhance evaluation of a wide array of forest management options. These results will have far-reaching implications, not only for forest management decision-making but also for forest conservation and restoration, and for understanding and modeling environmental influences, including climate change, on forests. Additional broader impacts include an enriched educational experience for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows due to the involvement of industry scientists as well as university faculty in the conduct of this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this research project is to use contemporary modeling and statistical techniques and computing technology to exploit information in forestry field studies in an effort to develop improved quantitative measures of tree- and stand-level competition.  Modeling is a powerful tool for integrating and synthesizing existing theory and empirical evidence, identifying knowledge gaps, and suggesting relevant hypotheses regarding underlying plant competition that might be tested through experimentation. Relating resource availability and competition intensity to growth and survival is central to understanding and projecting forest stand dynamics. A key challenge is determining effects of species, genetic variation, microsite heterogeneity, and local neighborhood effects on tree-size variation through time. These effects are confounded, highly interactive, and especially difficult to separate for stands of trees, which interact over long time periods. Furthermore, tree-to-tree competition cannot be measured directly, but rather is inferred based on measurements of overall stand density, relative tree size, and/or point density measures that include sizes of and distances to neighbors. Advanced statistical analyses and modeling techniques will be applied to data bases to deal with the complexity of forest ecosystem dynamics over extended time periods. Gaps in knowledge will be identified and experimental approaches for testing relevant hypotheses regarding competition process will be advanced.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Forests are globally important to human health and well-being through the oxygen they create, their moderation of temperature at a local scale, their sequestration of carbon, and their ability to provide ideal environments for many people to rest, relax, and recreate.  Forests are important for providing clean water and wildlife habitat, as well.  Forests face a number of threats including land use changes (for example conversion to other uses as human populations grow and demand more developed areas), modifications in land owner structures, and climate uncertainty- either regionally increasing or decreasing variation in weather patterns, or general warming, or even cooling in certain areas.  To this end, though not the primary focus of this research, a 'water deficit' and 'aridity index' database for Douglas-fir has been compiled for further testing of weather and climate effects on individual tree diameter growth and mortality.   Competition between trees is a crucial interaction process influencing important components of forest development and change, such as new tree (seedling / sapling) recruitment, growth and mortality, which in turn determine forest stand dynamics. Improving the quantification of competition effects in forest models thus will also result in greater ability to evaluate the under-researched and often unknown mechanisms that drive competition (and other tree interactions, e.g. facilitation) as studied in fields such as forest and plant ecology. It is extremely important to understand these tree interaction phenomena in order to better predict the impacts that external forces may have on forest stand dynamics.  Having this information is key to assessing how forests would adapt to changing long-term forces of humans and nature.  The research conducted with this project provides information that will help forecast long-term changes in forest structure and composition, which will foster better management practices - tenets that are critical to sustaining forest ecosystems - as well as for efficient and sustainable forest operations.  Finally, this research helped illustrate the core issues facing forests and demonstrated the true value of long-term research into forested systems, achieved through a more complete understanding of and better quantitative expressions for competition effects on tree and stand growth and survival.
