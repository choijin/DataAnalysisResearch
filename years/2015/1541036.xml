<AbstractNarration>A fundamental requirement for EarthCube is access to a comprehensive spectrum of well-curated, reliably re-usable, and seamlessly interoperable scientific data, but this does not exist today with many Geoscience domains still lacking sustainable data services. This project is a collaboration between an established data facility in the solid Earth sciences, IEDA (Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance), three scientifically related data communities in the solid Earth sciences that lack data facilities (deep seafloor processes, mineral physics, polar cryosphere), a research data collection (MetPetDB), a group of computer scientists that specialize in distributed information systems and interoperability, and a social scientist to re-structure the IEDA data facility, both organizationally and architecturally, to create the pilot of a multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary alliance of data providers. The goal is to create a model for other data facilities to partner with so far ?underserved? data communities to broaden integration of Geoscience domains into EarthCube, and advance both interdisciplinary and discipline-specific data science, while realizing economies of scale by sharing common data services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using IEDA as a testbed, the project will adopt elements of three EarthCube technologies that have been or are being developed by EarthCube Building Block projects: CINERGI (Community INventory of EarthCube Resources for Geoscience Interoperability), GeoWS (Geoscience Web Services), and GeoLink (Semantic Web technology), to build the architecture of the alliance, thereby testing, validating, and potentially improving these technologies. The technical work will focus on creating a flexible and scalable framework that will allow a growing number of partner systems to plug into shared capabilities such as applications for integrated data discovery and data submission and contribute their resources. Architectural changes at IEDA will go hand-in-hand with the transition of IEDA?s organizational structure toward the envisioned multi-institutional alliance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During this project we explored possibilities of utilizing resources and services available within the IEDA project for the benefits of the Mineral Physics community, through the new Data Alliance concept.   One of the aims of the UH group was to establish a Mineral Physics focus group that would define specific Data Products and potential mechanism through which these Products could be established that are of highest importance to the community and could be delivered by the IEDA Data Alliance. We also aimed to stimulate a community discussion to define data deposition standard (both in terms of metadata content as well as quality control factors) specific to mineral physics that would be implemented in the key Data Products.  To achieve these goals we organized a breakout session, which took place at the 2015 COMPRES Annual meeting. The session focused on cyberinfrastructure needs of mineral physics community, and included discussion of the on-going efforts and major needs in databases for mineral physics, as well as software development efforts for experimental data analysis.  We assembled an informal mineral physics CI special interest group which includes representatives of major synchrotron facilities serving mineral physics community as well as academic researchers who specifically care about comparability, accuracy and uncertainty analysis. Members of the group have co-organized a software workshop at the 2017 COMPRES Annual Meeting. The group maintains a website.  In August 2016, we co-organized and hosted in Honolulu a CIDER workshop entitled "Towards building consensus on interoperability of modeling tools for computational thermodynamics and fluid dynamics." The workshop aimed at stimulating discussion about coupling fluid dynamical models with constitutive relations derived from realistic and accurate thermodynamic and materials properties simulations, which aligns closely along the lines of the IEDA Data Alliance. The workshop brought together representatives of both communities and allowed to define understanding regarding the status of codes and computational resources in each field, and define deliverables and requirements of both kinds of models in order to better understand how to design an interface between the two.  This project helped to focus attention of the Mineral Physics community at large on the issues of cyberinfrastructure solutions and data standards that are necessary to effectively communicate the products of Mineral Physics research to other fields of Earth science.
