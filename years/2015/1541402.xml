<AbstractNarration>Cyberinfrastructure is increasing diversity and adding new types of complexity and challenges on campus for researchers and information technology staff at Florida International University (FIU). Together they are encountering barriers in interoperability and usability when attempting to integrate resources at the campus level with sites connected across other campuses, regional, national and international organizations.  Researcher demand is growing dramatically for network services and expertise to access cyberinfrastructure resources including climate data, Large Hadron Collider data, remote observing on optical telescopes, and computing and data resources for example. Simultaneously, the campus network infrastructure must be operated with security and best practices that protect day-to-day operations, financial and personnel data of the university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Campus Cyber-Infrastructure Engineer Lead or C-CIEL (i.e. Campus Seal) assists in the planning, designing and implementation of a seamless integrated cyberinfrastructure.  FIU is connecting researchers' laboratories to facilities and cyberinfrastructure resources at destination end points providing friction-free multi-institutional research collaborations through the campus science network and Science DMZ, and Identify and Access Management infrastructure. The C-CIEL guides the effort to coordinate and collaborate with the Information Technology departments, academic units and research groups, to design and engineer solutions that address their application requirements, from an end-to-end perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project are increasing multi-institutional collaborative research, increasing uptake and use of campus science network, Science DMZ and cyber security infrastructure; and, contributing towards a community of campus cyberinfrastructure engineers by fostering engagement and coordination on campus, regional, national and international levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Project Outcomes Report: Campus Cyberinfrastructure ? Data, Networking, and Innovation (CC*DNI): A CI Engineer Lead for a Hybrid Campus Network   Cyberinfrastructure on the Florida International University (FIU) campus network is highly varied, with many end user devices, instruments, servers, network appliances, HPC cluster, data management systems, etc., creating a complex environment to be managed.  To better support science flows across FIU?s Enterprise network, the FlowSurge project (NSF award# OAC-1246185) created a Science DMZ and a Science network to partition the campus network using OpenFlow technology.  To enhance research collaborations, FIU built a federated Identity and Access Management (IAM) system, leveraging the SDN resources on and off campus, to integrate advanced SDN technologies with campus CI.  Secure Access For Everyone (SAFE) (NSF award# OAC-1440728) is a standards-based integrated IAM system that supports trusted collaboration and sharing of CI resources across multiple institutions. To provide leadership in the planning, design and implementation of an integrated use cyberinfrastructure on the FIU network, as well as with cyberinfrastructure at the regional, national and global levels, FIU received support (NSF Award# OAC-1541402) to create a Campus Cyber-Infrastructure Engineer Lead (C-CIEL, pronounced C-SEAL) position. The C-CIEL was established in the Division of Information Technology at FIU, and will continue to be funded at the conclusion of the award.   The C-CIEL successfully lead the effort to coordinate and collaborate with diverse groups on campus, ranging from the IT and administrative departments to the academic units and research groups. The major goals for the C-CIEL were the following:  Support science and engineering research projects at FIU Maintain the Campus CI Plan Support science application drivers connected to the Science DMZ Support researcher publications and proposals   Coincident with the establishment of C-CIEL, FIU funded the project ?Accelerating FIU?s science research and education towards discovery and innovation by leveraging FIU?s Science DMZ?, which supported upgrading the network capabilities of the Science DMZ and Science network to 100G, and upgrading data center resources for science applications. The C-CIEL engaged researchers and relevant teams in the Division of IT in order to achieve the following desired outcomes of the project:  Connect researchers and their laboratories to the new 100G Science DMZ; Implement the Research Core, Edge SDN networks and the Science DMZ  Migrate Data Center CI to the new Science DMZ Migrate the Identity and Access Management Services to the Science DMZ   The C-CIEL documented use cases for each of the science drivers that was connected to the new Science DMZ.  An objective of the use cases was to map the CI in the science workflow and to document the before and after results of moving the science driver to the new Science DMZ.    A project summative evaluation was conducted to evaluate the project against four key metrics of success.  The C-CIEL was instrumental in providing quantitative information to the project evaluator.  The C-CIEL participated in meetings with the researchers, assisted in the development of the survey instrument, and in the interpretation of the data.    At the conclusion of the project, recommendations and future work were documented in the project final report.  The target audience for the recommendations and future work are the VP of Information Technology (CIO), the VP of Research, and one or more representatives of the research community.   NSF?s investment in the C-CIEL position, combined with FIU?s investment in network and cyberinfrastructure upgraded FIU?s Science DMZ and Science network to 100G.  Computation and storage resources for research activities, such as the HPC cluster, were upgraded to support 100G connections to the Science DMZ.  Researchers working in FIU?s neuro-imaging center, the Wall of Wind, the Geographic Information System (GIS) center, and in other research facilities connected to the new Science DMZ are performing their work with less friction from the campus network.
