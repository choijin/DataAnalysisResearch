<AbstractNarration>According to Moore's Law, miniaturization of electronic components is nearing its end. Different approaches are being explored to continued improvement of computing performance.  Technology is currently at the beginning of a paradigm shift from charge-based devices to spintronics where the electron spin is used to transport and store information. Eventually, all major elements of a computer chip (logic, memory, data storage) may be based on magnetism, addressing some of the most pressing current challenges such as power consumption and interconnect delays.  Specifically, spin transfer torque random access memory is being vigorously pursued to replace conventional semiconductor technology in the near future. However, a reduction of the current required to switch the state of a memory element is urgently needed in order to realize the full commercial potential. The proposed research will address these challenges by studying and optimizing the material properties of these nanopatterned elements that are critical for operation as a memory element.  The close collaboration between Samsung and UC-Santa Cruz provides an excellent opportunity for students at all levels to be trained in an industrial environment. The project also ensures rapid translation of the research results into prototypes and, ultimately, commercialization of memory products using nanomagnetic arrays. Other outreach activities include internships for undergraduates, and guest lectures from Samsung researchers at UC Santa Cruz. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project between UC Santa Cruz and Samsung Semiconductor aims at studying and optimizing the critical material parameters that determine the performance of next-generation magnetic memory devices. The expertise in device design and fabrication at Samsung and ultrafast magneto-optical characterization at UC Santa Cruz will be combined in order to understand, control, and minimize damping in nanomagnetic elements that will make up high-density commercial products. By the end of the project, a complete understanding of how material choice, process conditions, and sample geometry affect damping will have been gained. Both single nanomagnets and nanomagnet arrays will be studied with the goal of being able to control Gilbert damping in a single nanomagnet under applied bias and to understand the influence of various mechanical and magnetic inter-element interactions in an array on the behavior of a single element.</AbstractNarration>
