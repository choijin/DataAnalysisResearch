<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to understand whether and how protecting health as a right in a nation's constitution improves the health of its citizens. Currently, just over half of written constitutions in the world include a "right to health" in seemingly enforceable language. Whether this is beneficial to health outcomes and health policy, however, is not clear. Prominent ethicists suggest it should benefit public health policy while many legal experts have voiced skepticism -- yet little empirical evidence is currently available. This project uses a mix of quantitative analysis and qualitative field research to examine the effects of institutionalizing health as a constitutional right. If a right to health does operate to improve health -- expanding the power of civil society, the legal system, and health-related officials to improve health policy and health outcomes -- then it could be a powerful tool to improve the wellbeing of individuals in society. If not, it may problematically distort health policy. This project seeks to build scientific knowledge through interdisciplinary research, addressing these unanswered questions for the fields of law, public health, and political science. While the United States lacks an explicit constitutional right, health policy is increasingly legalized and, with the Affordable Care Act, the role of the state in health and of courts as arbiters is expanding. As such, lessons from this study may provide insights applicable to a U.S. context. In addition, this research may help national security and aid agencies implement more effective global health programs by identifying when, if, and how legal institutions can improve health policymaking. Globally, the average national constitution is significantly rewritten every 20 years, so whether a right to health is meaningful, and what factors make it so, are important pieces of information for constitution drafters and the health policymakers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study sets out to assess, in comparative perspective, the operation and effect of a constitutional right to health as an institution within the political economy health. Bringing insights and tools from political economy to the study of public law can help expand the emerging field of comparative constitutionalism -- in this case bridging the gap between existing normative and doctrinal studies of socioeconomic rights and the large field of empirical research on health and social policy. Adding to scientific knowledge on the production function of population health is also a goal.  This project does so through mixed-methods "nested analysis" in South Africa, India, and Thailand that combines a large-N statistical regression with small-N fieldwork-based case studies. First, the study will construct a global panel dataset with national health, demographic, economic, and constitutional characteristics spanning 40 years and use multilevel regression analysis to examine the empirical relationship globally between a right to health and health outcomes. If the study's hypotheses are correct, there should be observably better health outcomes in countries with a right to health, controlling for the dominant economic, demographic, and political explanations for national wellbeing.  Second, the study will gain causal leverage by seeking evidence directly linking the right to health with pro-health policymaking through field work in South Africa, India, and Thailand. Within-case analysis of interview and archival data will allow "process tracing" of recent health and health-related policymaking to help determine whether the statistical relationship observed in the large-N analysis is causal. Ultimately, data from this project should provide strong evidence about whether and how a constitutional right to health affects public health outcomes -- with implications for health policy, constitution-writing, and legal reform.</AbstractNarration>
