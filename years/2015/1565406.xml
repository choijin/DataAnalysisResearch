<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests partial support for an international symposium on Insect Effects on Ecosystem Services, to be held in conjunction with the International Congress of Entomology in Orlando, FL, September 25-30, 2016. Most (82%) of the support requested here would be used to recruit and support the participation of graduate students and early career scientists from under-represented groups at U.S. institutions, with a small amount of funds also requested for immediate follow-up activities. All of the participants in this symposium would also be able to attend the larger Congress. The balance of anticipated support for the symposium is being sought from other sources. The topic of the symposium is of major societal interest and has broad potential for impacting land management decisions. This award will ensure that graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and/or other early career scientists can attend and/or give talks or present posters at the meeting. Specific attention will be placed on the recruitment of individuals from underrepresented groups in science in the U.S. Funds may also be used to support travel for a speaker from an underdeveloped country that would also enhance diversity. The co-organizer is from Germany, although no support is sought here for his participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium is designed to allow for intensive interaction among participants and to facilitate new interdisciplinary interactions and collaborations. The topics chosen are especially ripe for such collaborations and also represent topics of much current interest. The organizing committee and selected speakers include an early career female from the U.S. and other U.S. participants some supported on other related projects by NSF, along with a suitably wide range of international scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Natural ecosystems provide a variety of services on which humans, and other organisms, depend for survival and well-being.  For example, all food and fresh water, as well as many medical and industrial products, are products of ecosystems. Ecosystem services have been categorized as provisioning (production of food, fiber, water and other resources), cultural (non-material benefits, such as recreation and other aesthetic values), supporting (primary production, pollination, decomposition and soil formation necessary for resource production) and regulating (biological control and other feedback mechanisms that maintain relatively consistent delivery of services).  Sustainable delivery of these services is not optional, but critical to human survival.  Conversely, ecosystems also have been viewed as producing "disservices", such as pests, litter, biological hazards such as diseases, animal attacks, allergenic and poisonous organisms, and geophysical hazards such as floods and storms. Ironically, many of these disservices are induced by management practices, such as deforestation and concentration of agricultural crops, that favor insect species adapted to these environmental changes.  Insects affect the delivery of ecosystem services in both positive and negative ways. Pollination and decomposition services are increasingly recognized as critical to human food production and livestock waste management. Although insect outbreaks may appear to threaten some ecosystem services, outbreaks tend to maximize vegetation diversity and maintain primary production near carrying capacity as environmental conditions change, thereby ensuring sustainable (but not maximum) delivery of ecosystem services. Attempts to maximize harvest of ecosystem resources typically trigger these negative feedback processes and threaten continued delivery of ecosystem services.  Accordingly, management decisions should protect species and processes that contribute to sustainable delivery of ecosystem services while minimizing induction of disservices.  This symposium was structured to outline various effects of insects on ecosystem services and disservices, in order to provide a framework for deciding when and how insects should be managed in order to ensure sustainable delivery of ecosystem services.
