<AbstractNarration>The Evryscope is a new type of telescope that records the entire sky visible from Chile in each exposure, and it obtains a new exposure every two minutes, night after night. Its 691 megapixel camera and the continuous operation will enable the discovery of short-timescale events, such as the decrease in apparent brightness when a planet passes in front of its host star. Professor Law, along with students at the University of North Carolina, developed the Evryscope and will use it as the centerpiece of his 5-year integrated education and research plan in this Faculty Early Career Development Program award. In addition to providing opportunities for student research training, the PI will develop Evryscope-based modules into large introductory classes and into the upper-level observational astronomy curriculum. The team will create a zoomable, real-time view of the dynamic sky seen by Evryscope into a giant interactive planetarium display at UNC's Moorhead planetarium. This public exhibit will be used by hundreds of thousands of school-age children and planetarium visitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has deployed the 8000 square-degree Evryscope at Cerro Tololo, where it is recording the entire southern sky down to 16th magnitude with 2-minute cadence. The PI and his students will conduct the Evryscope survey of a range of variable and transient targets, and they will develop the data processing/analysis and database tools to maximize the scientific output of this survey. Their principal focus will be a large survey for habitable rocky planets around the nearest white dwarfs.</AbstractNarration>

Every two minutes they take a 1.2 gigapixel image of the sky, looking for new high-speed astrophysical phenomena. This grant supported the Southern Evryscope?s operations and data analysis over a five-year period. During the project we collected half a petabyte of imaging data, built software systems to analyze the data in realtime, and measured the ongoing brightness changes of millions of stars with trillions of data points. The dataset has resulted in 20 publications in refereed journals so far, with many more to come. The scientific highlights from the project include the discovery of the first optical superflare from Proxima Centauri, searches for stellar and planetary companions to exotic compact stars, a comprehensive analysis of flares from nearby cool dwarfs that could affect planetary habitability, the first detailed characterization of a population of ultra-short transient flashes produced by debris in Earth's orbit, and the largest survey of the temperatures of the brightest and most-important exoplanet-habitability-affecting superflares from nearby stars.
