<AbstractNarration>This grant to Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) will provide travel funds for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in computer science to attend the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) in 2015. The HFL brings together Laureates of the most prestigious awards in computer science and mathematics to spend a week interacting with 200 early career researchers. In addition to the scientific exchanges with the Laureates and each other, participants at the Forum gain a valuable global perspective on computer and mathematical sciences?early career researchers represented 47 countries at the 2014 Forum. Modeled on the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, the HLF provides graduate students and postdoctoral researchers with extraordinary access to a group of scientific role models through lectures, small group discussions, and casual conversations. Such experiences can have a profound impact on the development of an early career researcher. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) will recruit a highly qualified and diverse applicant pool for the Forum. There are many exceptionally promising early career researchers who have little or no opportunity to interact with the Laureates of the major prizes in the computer and mathematical sciences. The HLF is a unique opportunity for these individuals, one that can energize and steer future research. The recruitment and selection of participants will emphasize the potential benefits of the opportunity for the researchers, as well as the overall goal of ensuring a broadly inclusive group of participants. ORAU will provide logistical support both prior to and during the forum and also continue to perform an assessment of participant experiences to document the impact of the Forum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With funding from this NSF award, eight PhD students were supported to attend the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) held in Heidelberg, Germany from August 23-August 28, 2015.  This delegation of the future of American computer science was enabled to interact with Laureates of prestigious computer science and mathematics awards &ndash; namely the A.M. Turing Award, Abel Prize, Fields Medal, and Nevanlinna Prize, along with other high caliber graduate students from around the world.  The experience at the HLF provided opportunities to form new research collaborations with high-achieving graduate student counterparts from around the world.  Participants in the Forum gained a valuable global perspective on their discipline that prepares them for leadership in that global community, and they were given the opportunity to forge relationships with their colleagues who are also at the beginning of their careers.  As one supported student noted, "The network you create is amazing. To see many mathematicians/computer scientists so excited about their area is great."   The intention of the HLF and supporting an American delegation was twofold:  to connect these young researchers so that they will collaborate and further the discipline as they mature professionally and to bridge the gap between the generations of computer science research.  At least one student conveyed success, reporting that they "found other young researchers with more applied problems that I may be able to contribute to from a more theoretical perspective."  Another student gave a glimpse of their experience bridging the gap:  "I spent an entire evening talking to Fred Brooks (Turing Award, 2000) about his career as a professor. The stories of his experiments and students and travels were amazing. It was like talking to history.  His experiences will inspire me for the rest of my career."   The HLF gave these early career researchers an opportunity for interaction that is typically not available within the normal university environment or in their home university department, whereby the Laureates provided formal plenary lectures and led small group discussions with topics driven by a combination of prepared presentations by the Laureates as well as student questions. Many fellow ACM Turing Award recipients were key contributors to the event. Leslie Lamport (Turing Award, 2014) gave a compelling lecture advocating the use of mathematics in the description of computer systems to aid in their construction and analysis. Manuel Blum (Turing Award, 1995) brought drama to the stage by demonstrating how he could brief four volunteers on ways to "compute" passwords at need without memorizing them. Sir Tony Hoare (Turing Award, 1980) reminded the researchers that the roots of computation and science go back to Aristotle, Euclid and other philosophers who have advanced the state of the art over millennia. Edmund Clarke (Turing Award, 2007) drew the young researchersÆ attention to the importance of being able to say something about the correctness of computations dealing with real, continuous quantities ("hybrid systems").   Based on feedback collected upon their return, the supported students overwhelmingly reported that this was an invaluable experience.  The most common themes included having the opportunity to talk to various Laureates about their research, receiving insights and resources, and being afforded the perfect environment to be able to easily interact with Laureates and graduate students from around the world.  Students noted receiving the lessons in how radical scientific ideas can often be inspired by transferring ideas from other fields and how important it is to be as excited about the day-to-day research as it is the potential of reaching end results.  The applications for the forum were solicited strategically to encourage graduate students from institutions that provide little or no opportunity to interact with the Laureates in computer science, as well as a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
