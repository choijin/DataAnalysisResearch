<AbstractNarration>PI:  Benjamin J. Schwartz &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1510353&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sun represents the most abundant potential source of sustainable energy on earth.  Solar cells that use light-absorbing organic polymers to convert light to electricity - organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices - offer a potentially low-cost route for renewable electricity production.  However, in order to achieve parity with other solar photovoltaic technologies, organic solar cells must increase their power conversion efficiency past the current 10.5% world record.  The goal of this project is to add metal nanoparticles into the active layer of the organic solar cell to possibly enhance solar energy conversion efficiency.  The active layer of the OPV device consists of the conducting polymer and nanostructured carbon. If the metal nanoparticles are in the right place, they will enhance light absorption, and ultimately solar energy conversion efficiency, through a complex process called plasmonic resonance.  A key innovation of this project is that that metal nanoparticles will be formed at precise locations within the active layer to enable this process.  As part of the educational activities associated with this project, the principal investigator participates in a program where nanotechnology topics are brought to high school classrooms throughout the greater Los Angeles area in a series of graduate student-run workshops for high school teachers.  The graduate student supported by this grant will develop and conduct workshops on solar energy featuring organic solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major technical challenge with the fabrication of organic photovoltaic devices is to precisely control the nanoscale spatial distribution of the light-absorbing polymer (electron donor) and fullerene (electron acceptor) to optimize charge separation and photocurrent collection.  Furthermore, other complicating factors may occur during device fabrication.  For example, conductive metals are deposited on the top of the organic polymer layer by thermal evaporation to serve as an electrical contact. It is hypothesized that these evaporated metals easily move through the fullerenes and leave a layer of metal nanopartÂ¬icles underneath any fullerenes that reside at the top of the polymer layer, creating unintended consequences to device performance that have been overlooked to date.  Preliminary data supports this hypothesis, and the overall goals of this proposed research are to determine the effects of metal interpenetration on the performance of polymer-based PV devices, and then develop strategies to purposely manipulate metal nanoparticle interpenetration to improve device performance through plasmonic optical absorption enhancement.  In the proposed research, experimental and computational approaches will be used to understand these processes. Sequential processing, where the donor (conducting polymer) and acceptor (fullerene) layers are deposited in separate steps, will be used to control the vertical fullerene distribution within the OPV active layer.  Transmission electron microscopy, in combination with ellipsometry and neutron reflectometry, will be used to study the conditions by which metals penetrate through fullerenes.  This information will be used to develop synthesis strategies to control the distribution of interpenetrated metal, and ultimately the size and position of the metal nanoparticles that are formed. The dielectric constant, plasmonic absorption enhancement, and exciton quenching measurements will performed on the metal nanoparticle impregnated active layer, and these fundamental optoelectronic property measurements will be correlated to overall measurements of device performance, including solar energy conversion efficiency, external quantum efficiency, and photocurrent/photovoltage transients.  Complementary simulations that couple full solutions of Maxwell?s equations with standard drift-diffusion solvers will be performed with metal nanoparticles in the active layer to help to understand and interpret these experimental results.  The research outcomes will suggest purposeful ways to simultaneously enhance OPV device fabrication and performance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Conjugated polymers are materials that combine the mechanical properties of plastics (lightweight, flexible, easily processed) with the electrical properties of semiconductors.  This makes them amenable for applications in a variety of novel optoelectronic devices, including organic LEDs, transistors, photovoltaics and thermoelectrics.       To take the best advantage of conjugated polymers in such devices, it is important to place metal contacts to the material and also to control the electrical conductivity of the material by changing the number of electrons available.  In the work funded by this grant, we investigated two aspects of using conjugated polymers in practical devices, finding that:  1) the way in which the metal electrodes are deposited onto the conjugated polymer can alter the number of electrons in the material in an uncontrolled way, and 2) that if one wants to intentionally alter the number of electrons in the material, one can design a molecule to do this in the most optimal way for particular device applications.     In the first part of the project, we showed that when evaporating metal contacts onto films of organic semiconductors, in some cases the metal atoms could penetrate deep into the film. Moreover, when this penetration did occur, the intercalated metal would alter the number electrons in the film in an uncontrolled way, potentially explaining a lot of seemingly contradictory results in the literature.  We were able to show that by placing a small, electrically conductive blocking layer between the organic semiconductor and the metal that the metal penetration could be prevented, leading to much more reproducible results.     In the second part of the project, we examined how the addition of different small-molecule oxidizing agents removed electrons from conjugated polymers to change their electrical conductivity.  What we found was that it for the best conductivity, it is important that the molecule that takes the electron from the polymer must sit as far from the polymer as possible, to minimize the interaction between the electron and the hole left behind on the polymer.  Using this knowledge, we then designed a new oxidizing agent based on small clusters of boron with organic substituents in which the electron sits on the boron inside the large cage of substituents and is thus isolated from the hole left behind on the polymer.  With these new oxidizing agents, we were able to achieve record electrical conductivities for these materials as well as tease apart some of the mechanisms by which conjugated polymers can be used in thermoelectric devices.
