<AbstractNarration>Warm core rings acting between western boundary currents and the continental shelf exert significant impact on the physical and biological environments of the slope seas and coastal oceans, which are major contributors to the global primary production. However, compared to that of eddies in the open ocean, the role of Gulf Stream warm core rings in the biophysical processes of the shelf-slope system has received less attention, and contrasting results exist. This study will elucidate the key biophysical mechanisms by investigating the biomass characteristics and the dominant physical mechanisms controlling the vertical nutrient delivery associated with Gulf Stream warm core rings.  The improved understanding on nutrient dynamics from this research will contribute to the stewardship of living marine resources, and better ecosystem management. Research findings will be presented to the general public through public lectures. This project will also support the training of undergraduate students outside of oceanography through the Summer Undergraduate Research Program at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the physical-biological processes associated with the evolution of Gulf Stream warm core rings in the shelf-slope system of the Northwest Atlantic, with a focus on the dominant physical processes controlling vertical nutrient delivery. The research will include analyses of satellite data, historical in situ data, and numerical simulations. For better understanding of the relative importance of several mesoscale biophysical processes, the photoautotrophic biomass within the warm core rings will be characterized first using satellite observed sea surface height and chlorophyll concentration. The investigators will then conduct idealized numerical modeling experiments to identify the dominant physical processes responsible for vertical nutrient delivery including vertical mixing and vertical advection induced by frictional decay, eddy-induced Ekman pumping, and wind-sea surface temperature interaction.  The findings from the idealized modeling will be further synthesized in a realistic coupled biophysical model for the Northwest Atlantic region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the mechanisms that drive the vertical transport of water, containing nutrients, inside mesoscale ocean eddies, spinning bodies of water that have diameter from 100-200 km.  The focus of this study was on warm-core Gulf Stream rings.  These are large anticyclonic mesoscale eddies that form from meanders of the Gulf Stream.  These warm-core rings are characterized by the accumulation of ware water in their cores.  Traditionally, these types of eddies, anticyclones which are defined by their rotation being opposite that of Earth's rotation, have been characterized as areas of low primary production.  The advent of satellite observations of the color of the ocean from which we can infer the amount of phytoplankton in the surface waters allowed oceanographers to start to question the previously accepted lack of primary production in these rings.  Building on this new information, we developed a numerical simulation of these ring to diagnose which parts of the equations that describe the movement of water in eddies are dominant in the modulation of upwelling and downwelling in eddies.  The results indicate the the prevalence of one term over another is very dependent on the scales at which one looks.  For example, when looking at these warm-core rings for weeks to months, the upward movement of water resulting from the interaction of the surface currents of the eddy with the wind provides the largest contribution to upwelling.  On the other hand, at small time and space scales, as would be observed by a ship occupying a ring for a number of days, the contribution of changes in the shape of the eddy are primarily driving the movement of water up and down.  The results of this numerical simulation were presented in the Journal of Physical Oceanography.       Last Modified: 09/28/2020       Submitted by: Peter Gaube]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
