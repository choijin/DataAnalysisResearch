<AbstractNarration>Objective: Epilepsy affects 60 million people worldwide who suffer from recurrent seizures, and 40% of patients do not respond to any drug therapy. These patients would greatly benefit from closed-loop neuro-stimulation therapy to suppress seizures, but the efficacy of such therapy critically depends on whether the stimulus is administered close to the seizure origin (epileptogenic zone, EZ) and immediately prior to or at seizure onset. This program develops novel computational tools for effective EZ localization and seizure onset detection from multi-channel intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The tools are derived by (i) analyzing the dynamics of the brain network as a seizure approaches and (ii) developing a model-based framework that combines multivariate statistics, Bayesian estimation, and optimal control. The tools use iEEG recordings to (1) reconstruct and track the topology of the brain network over time, and (2) identify topological signatures that are specific of the seizure state and uniquely localize the EZ. The rule that detects these signatures from sequential iEEG measurements is adaptive and optimizes the trade-off between specificity and sensitivity by minimizing a cost function of both the detection delay and the probability of false positives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Multiple translational impacts will occur at the interface between engineering and neuroscience. First, the proposed tools will allow more accurate EZ localization and resection, more efficient review of iEEG signals, and more effective treatments for seizure suppression (more effective placement of the stimulation electrodes and more efficient neuro-stimulation devices). Overall, these outcomes will reduce the hospitalization time and potentially avoid fatal accidents to epilepsy patients, save lives, extend life-expectancy, and improve the administration of drugs. Also, this program will introduce a transformative detection paradigm that generalizes to any application involving hidden state transition detection relevant to a wide array of disciplines (e.g., early earthquake detection or threats detection). Finally, this program will support the development of courses in multivariate signal processing and statistical modeling at Johns Hopkins University and of outreach activities that will inspire high school students (especially from minorities) from the Baltimore metropolitan area to pursue a career in engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background and Major Goals  The project aims to develop optimal, unsupervised computational tools to automatically detect incoming seizures and to assist with the localization of the seizure onset zone in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. These tools combine multichannel intracranial EEG recordings, multivariate statistics, Bayesian estimation, and optimal control to reconstruct the evolution of the brain network in time and to identify signatures that are specific of the seizure state. These tools implement optimal detection policies, i.e., the decisions minimize a specific cost function that account for various objectives, e.g., minimization of detection delays or minimization of false positives.     Accomplishments  The project was conducted on multichannel intracranial EEG recordings collected in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who were monitored with subdural grid and depth electrodes over several days before receiving resective surgery of the seizure onset zone. Recordings were processed offline to determine the temporal evolution of the brain network as seizures approach, to identify signature features, patterns, or events that may be highly predictive of the incoming seizures, and to define criteria for the unsupervised localization of the seizure onset zone in the brain. The central hypotheses are: (1) the brain can be treated as a functional network whose nodes are the subdural and depth electrodes; (2) the topology of such network changes in a reproducible way as a seizure approaches, i.e., it shows early changes that are characteristic of the seizure and may help to detect when the seizure is about to start and to localize where the seizure likely originates from.  Specific Objectives:  A) To develop multivariate network-based features that closely track the temporal evolution of the brain network and identify the seizure onset zone. These features map all the network nodes simultaneously and the feature components covering the onset zone show a distinctive, reproducible temporal pattern during seizures;  B) To develop a multivariate-based optimal detection tool for automatic seizure detection. The tool tracks the evolution of the multivariate features and recursively decides whether a seizure is likely to occur.  Significant Results:  We found that, in patients with complex partial seizures, the connectivity of the brain network defines a finite set of brain states and the seizures are characterized by a consistent progression of states.  We found that the seizure onset zone is initially isolated from other brain regions at early stages of seizure events and then becomes more connected in the network towards the end of seizure.  We developed an algebraic procedure to measure the similarity between the activity of distinct nodes in the brain network. This procedure revealed that nodes covering the seizure onset zone have a signature pattern that isolate them from the rest of the brain network.  We developed a seizure onset detector that processes intracranial EEG signals online to reconstruct the brain network, tracks changes in this network over time, and automatically detects a seizure when these changes cross a time-varying, adaptive, optimal threshold.  Key Outcomes:  We found that the brain enters a finite set of "states" at all times, where these states can be defined by the topology of the brain network.  We found that the brain transitions through a finite number of states in a consistent manner during seizure events, i.e., the pattern is the same across different seizures in the same patient, while it may change from patient to patient.  We showed that, for each patient, there is a signature state that the brain recurrently transitions to at the beginning of each seizure and this state is associated with a particular network topology in which the seizure onset zone may be highlighted.  These outcomes contribute to the general investigation of how the brain functional network evolves during unconstrained spontaneous activity and provide a better understanding of the spatiotemporal mechanisms of the cerebral function in the epileptic brain at the transition into seizure events.
