<AbstractNarration>PI:  Neubert, Josh  &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1521828&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last decade, research groups have made great advances in stem cell science, tissue and biomedical engineering, cryopreservation, and other areas of regenerative medicine that have begun to show promising results. However, the ability to produce clinically applicable solutions to organ disease and impairment, especially in complex organs such as the heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys, has for the most-part eluded researchers. The need for solutions to organ impairment has never been greater. The organ waitlist has grown rapidly over the last two decades while the number of donors has stagnated. It is estimated that 35% of all U.S. deaths could be prevented or significantly delayed by organ repair or transplantation. New solutions are required to meet this demand. The investigators propose a landscape analysis study and workshop to identify key milestones toward creating these solutions. The work will create a critical-path roadmap toward solutions to organ impairment. Included in this roadmap will be specific opportunities to incorporate innovative methods for technology advancement such as prizes and awards that can be used to supplement, enhance, and leverage traditional research grants. The workshop will be hosted in Washington DC on March 16-17, 2015, convening key stakeholders from academia, industry, and government agencies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The investigators have defined three primary outcomes for this workshop: (1) Identify key quantitative milestones that will open critical opportunities on the road to solving organ disease; (2) Determine how to best identify when a proposed research avenue or milestone will not be achieved to help focus future research initiatives on potentially successful outcomes; and (3) Identify opportunities to advance quantitative milestones and supplement or better target existing research grant programs using incentivized innovation models (prizes, challenges, awards, etc.). Four topic areas of potential milestones have been identified for discussion during the workshop: Regulation, Tissue &amp; Biomedical Engineering, Cryopreservation, and Manufacturing/Clinical support. Prior to the workshop, key stakeholder interviews will be conducted to gather preliminary information defining the content of the scientific discussions for each of these four sessions. Upon conclusion of the workshop, specific guidelines, milestones, and criteria will be presented and disseminated to the public concerning the roadmap, milestones, and new methodologies for advancing solutions to organ disease.</AbstractNarration>
