<AbstractNarration>Changes in the atmospheric circulation in response to anthropogenic forcing are expected to affect stratospheric water vapor and ozone recovery, with direct effects on surface temperatures, precipitation, and winds. Policy makers and the public rely on model projections of these changes. This research will develop strategies to validate model simulations with analytic theory, to identify and correct model biases, and to establish rigorous test to assess their fitness for climate projection. This project will also support the education and training of two graduate students. providing them the opportunity to develop a physical understanding of the atmospheric circulation and practical experience with high performance scientific computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will connect theory, modeling, and observations of stratospheric transport. The Brewer-Dobson Circulation describes the transport of mass and trace gases through the stratosphere. In concert with chemical processes, it sets the distribution of water vapor and ozone through the middle atmosphere. Models nearly unanimously predict the Brewer-Dobson Circulation to increase in response to anthropogenic forcing, but the circulation cannot be observed directly, due to the slow time scale of overturning (on the order of years). In situ and satellite-based estimates of the "age of air," a measure of the transport time from the surface to stratosphere which can be estimated from observations of trace gases, however, do not robustly detect a change in transport. Some even suggest a weakening of the circulation, although large uncertainties imply that model trends are not inconsistent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first goal of this project is to establish a connection between the stratospheric circulation and age distributions with three-dimensional atmospheric models. In particular, the latitudinal structure of age, which can be calculated directly from measurements of trace gases such as CO2 or SF6,  will be related to the mean circulation of mass, which is diagnosed in climate model integrations. The second goal is to use these insights to evaluate stratospheric transport in numerical models, connecting standard tests of dynamical cores to the climatological properties of the circulation. Theoretical constraints on age transport will be used to detect biases in climate models arising from deficiencies in their representation of the circulation and/or tracer transport. The third and final goal is to evaluate the new tracer-transport diagnostics in the context of climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative effort between New York University and the Massachusetts Institute of technology has developed theoretical tools to evaluate and interpret the movement, or transport, of trace gases by the stratospheric circulation.  Gases such as such carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and ozone make up only a very small fraction of the atmosphere but play an important role in climate by affecting the radiative budget of our planet.  These, and other gases present in only trace amounts such as the industrial chemical sulfur hexafluoride, also provide us a unique view into the working of the atmosphere, as they can be readily observed by satellites and from samples of air collected from various points in the atmosphere.   These new tools have led to a better data-based estimate of the stratospheric meridional overturning circulation.  This circulation transports trace gases upward into the stratosphere in the tropics, and then poleward and downward into middle and high latitudes of both hemispheres, with significant implications for stratospheric climate and chemistry.  For example, it concentrates ozone in the higher latitudes, even though ozone is primarily produced in the tropics.  Changes in stratospheric overturning induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions could change the future distribution of stratospheric ozone, which protects the surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation. To assess these changes, we must be able to quantify the circulation.  Our work suggests that there are biases in the circulation indicated by several atmospheric reanalysis products, model-based estimates of the atmospheric circulation that are constrained by available meteorological observations.  Observations of trace gases provide an additional source of data to better constrain these products, which are used widely to understand the model and improve climate models.  This grant has also allowed us to establish a benchmark test for the simulation of trace gas transport in atmospheric models, which can be used to assess the fitness of these complex numerical, computer-based codes for climate prediction.  We have shown that the underlying numerical formulation of an atmospheric model impacts its ability to simulate the behavior of trace gases. State-of-the-art models based on very different computer codes, however, do provide a consistent simulation of stratospheric transport provided they are run with sufficiently fine resolution, particularly in the vertical.  This gives us greater confidence in climate simulations by these models.  In addition, our work on the coupling between the stratosphere with the troposphere has improved our understanding of and ability to model processes in the stratosphere that can extend tropospheric weather forecasts on sub-seasonal to seasonal time scales.  This includes both the response to external forcing (such as large volcanic eruptions) and to internal, natural variability (extreme events known as Sudden Stratospheric Warmings).  In particular, change in the strength of the stratospheric winter circulation, induced either by volcanic aerosols or an extreme weather event, impacts the tropospheric jet streams.  Finally, this project has supported the education of three PhD students, one now an assistant professor at a major US research university and the two others active in STEM research as postdoctoral research scientists.  It has also supported the development of a publicly available atmospheric model code, the Model of an idealized Moist Atmosphere (MiMA), which is being used worldwide to further weather and climate research.
