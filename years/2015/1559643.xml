<AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conventional wisdom suggests that charismatic leaders' allure fades quickly after their deaths. Why, then, do many individuals become and remain attached to the legacies of some charismatic leaders? The PI conducts a survey experiment that directly tests the strategies and conditions under which new leaders can reactivate citizens' attachment to political parties that were established as vehicles for charismatic leaders in order to garner political support. The results of this study will inform debates about the nature and consequences of charismatic leadership across disciplines including political science, sociology, psychology, and business management. Furthermore, the project will clarify how different types of attachment to charismatic legacies might strengthen or undermine democratic representation and electoral competition. Finally, the results can serve to inform political communication and campaign strategy in countries with strong charismatic legacies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the nature and evolution of citizens' attachments to weakly institutionalized political movements founded by charismatic leaders. The PI argues that new leaders can tap into the charismatic founders' legacies to sustain or reactivate support through one of three mechanisms: 1) a programmatic mechanism that link citizens' ties to the movement through programs and policies; 2)a grassroots mechanism that posits that citizens' attachments are preserved through participation in the movement' organizations; 3) a personalistic mechanism that indicates that citizens' attachments remain anchored in the founder's charisma.  The PI test these three mechanisms through a survey experiment that examines the relative influence of each mechanism on citizens' attachment to the legacy parties. Individuals are randomly assigned to read a short news piece containing one of four experimental conditions, three of which will prime either the programmatic, grassroots, or personalistic aspects of the movement, and the fourth of which will contain no prime. Subsequently, participants will answer questions about their identification with the movement, support for its leaders, emotional attachment, and political attitudes and behaviors. The PI uses difference-of-means and difference-of-proportions tests to examine which mechanism provides the basis for followers' attachments to the movement. The Pi uses Argentina and Venezuela as the cases of interest.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Conventional wisdom suggests that charisma is ephemeral. Yet in several countries including Argentina, Venezuela, South Africa and Turkey, politicians have tied themselves to deceased charismatic leaders and their movements to garner political support. Under what conditions can new leaders revive their charismatic predecessors&rsquo; legacies to rise to power? My dissertation research suggests that new leaders attempt to achieve this by implementing two strategies to reactivate citizens&rsquo; deep, unmediated, and emotional bonds to the movement: 1) bold, tangible, and <em>initially </em>successful performance and 2) symbolic ties to the charismatic founder.</p> <p>With the support of an NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant, I tested the effectiveness these two strategies in the context of two charismatic political movements&mdash;Argentine Peronism and Venezuelan Chavismo. Specifically, I partnered with a local public opinion firm in each country to conduct survey experiments that investigate the extent to which cues representing bold performance and symbolic ties to the founder cause loyal citizens to express deeper attachments to the movement and greater support for its new leaders. Based on other components of my research, I hypothesized that followers exposed to <em>both</em> cues&mdash;bold performance and symbolic ties&mdash;would express deeper attachment to the movement and greater support for its new leader.&nbsp;</p> <p>Five hundred self-identified followers of Peronism and Chavismo were recruited from three diverse regions of each country to participate in the study. Each participant was randomly assigned to receive cues representing both, one, or none of the two above-mentioned leader strategies, creating a total of four experimental conditions (see Table 1). Each cue was presented to participants in the context of a campaign in which a hypothetical governor was running for president. After receiving information about the candidate&rsquo;s performance as governor, participants listened to an excerpt of the candidate&rsquo;s speech and viewed a campaign poster. Participants in the first condition were exposed to a <em>high</em>-performing candidate whose speech and poster referenced the charismatic founder and other movement symbols; participants in the second condition were exposed to a <em>high</em>-performing candidate whose speech and poster did <em>not</em> reference the founder or movement; participants in the third condition were exposed to a <em>low</em>-performing candidate who referenced the founder and movement symbols; and participants in the fourth condition were exposed to a &shy;<em>low</em>-performing candidate who did <em>not</em> reference the founder or movement.</p> <p>The results in both countries (summarized in Figure 1) supported the main hypothesis. On average, Argentine participants exposed to a new leader who achieved bold performance <em>and</em> referenced his symbolic ties to the charismatic founder (Condition 1) expressed significantly stronger identification with the movement, more intense positive feelings, and weaker negative feelings toward the movement than participants in all remaining conditions. Venezuelan participants in Condition 1 also expressed less intense negative feelings toward the movement, although there was no significant difference in expression of identification with and positive feelings toward the movement across the four treatment groups. Additionally, in both countries, participants exposed to cues of bold performance and symbolic ties expressed stronger support for the candidate than participants in all other conditions. Indeed, participants in Condition 1 perceived the candidate as significantly more charismatic, trustworthy, and likeable; they also expressed greater willingness to vote for the candidate in future elections.</p> <p>The results hold important implications for studies of charisma and electoral politics. First, the results of my study uncover the precise, psychological mechanisms through which new leaders can tap into voter attachments to revive the founder&rsquo;s movement and consolidate political support. These findings provide a compelling explanation for a phenomenon that has long puzzled social scientists: the impressive ability of some charismatic movements such as Peronism and Chavismo to survive and influence politics over the long term without developing a firm organizational party structure.</p> <p>Second, the results suggest that the revival of charismatic attachments may undermine the quality of voters&rsquo; democratic representation. Specifically, political candidates who effectively cue bold, drastic performance and symbolic movement ties may depict themselves as convincing disciples of the charismatic founder. Consequently, such candidates may experience greater electoral success than politicians who campaign on <em>steady</em> performance and <em>clear</em> policy platforms. In contrast to well-institutionalized party systems, leaders in this setting may take voters&rsquo; substantive ideological preferences for granted and undermine the long-term sustainability of policies and programs.</p> <p>Finally, evidence of charismatic revival in the politically, geographically, and temporally diverse cases of Argentina and Venezuela suggest that candidates who draw on bold performance and symbolic movement ties may effectively garner political support and perpetuate charismatic movements in other contexts such as Peru, Turkey, France, and South Africa. Future research should investigate the reactivation of charismatic attachments in these and other cases to further generalize the theory and better understand the resilient and potentially diverse trajectories of charismatic movements.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Caitlin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Andrews</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559643/1559643_10423263_1493653876850_NSFProjectOutcomesReport-Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559643/1559643_10423263_1493653876850_NSFProjectOutcomesReport-Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559643/1559643_10423263_1493653876850_NSFProjectOutcomesReport-Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Experimental Results: Mean Scores for Attachment and Support by Country.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Created by Caitlin Andrews (author)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Caitlin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Andrews</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559643/1559643_10423263_1493653804067_NSFProjectOutcomesReport-Table1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559643/1559643_10423263_1493653804067_NSFProjectOutcomesReport-Table1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Table 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559643/1559643_10423263_1493653804067_NSFProjectOutcomesReport-Table1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Table 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Experimental Conditions and Main Hypothesis.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Created by Caitlin Andrews (author)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Caitlin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Andrews</div> <div class="imageTitle">Table 1</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
