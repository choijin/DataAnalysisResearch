<AbstractNarration>The challenges of the college years are often reflected in student health, including poor health habits, which offer an opportunity for preventive intervention.  There are daunting technical, privacy, and practical challenges associated with sensing, integrating, analyzing, and conveying data on physical and mental health. Also, at an institutional level, universities that hope to use technologies to improve student health will need to surmount the obstacle that a lot of institutions have no integration that connects data or services on students' physical health with that on their mental health. This workshop could be the starting point of a coordinated effort to overcome such difficulties.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very timely workshop on engaging the university student health community with computational sciences to provide for new approaches to deal with the physical and behavioral aspects of university student life.  The PI and co-PI represent expertise in computing and preventative medicine.  The plan for the workshop is thoughtful and generally provides enough time for discussion as well as presentation.  The prospective invitee list is comprehensive, and should result is a lively discussion. The conference web site will provide access to the white papers and any additional materials, such as presentation materials or reports from breakout groups.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overall goal of this project was to support and accelerate the scientific progress in improving the health of college students. To achieve this goal, the award supported multiple meetings and events where leading experts came together to discuss recent advances, common challenges, and paths forward. Ultimately, new collaborations were formed in multiple areas across multiple universities. Specifically, the following areas of expertise were brought together: health psychology, mental health, physical health, human sensing, ubiquitous computing (e.g., smartphones and wearables), social networking, machine learning, privacy and security, and smart environments. In the area of college student health, the following major challenges were identified: infrastructure to support data collection and health intervention, privacy and security concerns, engaging students and campus stakeholders, and specific methods and analytics used to develop real time and adaptive interventions. At the close of this project, there have been multiple scientific conference presentations and manuscripts that discuss ways forward to support college student mental and physical health, a time where many are at risk for beginning to develop long lasting health and wellbeing problems. Furthermore, new collaborations have formed that will catalyze sensing technology development, specifically with the goal to monitor health and wellbeing in real time such that adequate and appropriate outreach and treatments can be offered just at the time the student needs it. In sum, this award has created a solid foundation from which significant advances can be made for this often overlooked population.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/20/2017<br>      Modified by: Bonnie&nbsp;J&nbsp;Spring</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
