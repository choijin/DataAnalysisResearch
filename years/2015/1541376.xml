<AbstractNarration>As HACC, Central Pennsylvania's Community College, and its computing and network infrastructure continue to mature, the College needs to expand available bandwidth for its science and technology programs. The infrastructure connecting HACCÃ­s science and technology programs at two physical locations and to the Internet is limited to 100Mbps. At each of these connection points, HACC is replacing switch equipment, core routing equipment and the wide area network (WAN) connection. To support large science datasets and their flow across the network, HACC must re-architect the network infrastructure and redesign the virtual local area network (VLAN) architecture. This redesign of the VLAN architecture supports segmentation of the science and learning programs, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Computer Information Systems (CIS), and allows these programs to be situated on their own 1Gbps VLAN connections with expanded science and technology classroom connectivity from 100 Mbps to 1Gbps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of this project, HACC students and faculty will have access to online educational materials in one place, accessible from anywhere, and the ability to learn remotely and use time on campus efficiently. This project supports the implementation of HACC's science and technology symposia, current and potential grant-funded projects, service and research projects and mobile learning course-content production. HACC will be better able to prepare an educated workforce for Pennsylvania's key industries, including energy, technology, manufacturing and agribusiness. This model can be a foundation for HACC's other campuses and other regional institutions to implement similar projects and programs to support STEM education.</AbstractNarration>

For example, HACC&rsquo;s GIS faculty and staff hosted a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Day at HACC&rsquo;s Midtown site on Nov. 16, 2016. GIS Day is an annual event that promotes interest in learning GIS technology and careers in the field.

This advancement has allowed them to change their instructional methods and approaches within STEM courses. For example, Douglas Brown M.Ed., associate professor of computer networking technology, engineering and technology, now allows his students to download large Linux ISO images as part of the learning experience. In the past, students could not perform that task, thus negatively impacting the learning experience. Professor Brown also began to use YouTube video podcasts to provide additional on-demand instruction to his STEM students to help them complete their assigned coursework.</p> <p>This project took just under two years to complete, which was longer than expected, due to delays encountered with the fiber cable installation and external influences, such as a vendor strike. However, the results of the project were evident as early as November 2016 and continued to evolve in 2017. All STEM courses taught in the Midtown location now benefit from the expanded connectivity, and HACC faculty have commented on the improved performance and network reliability. External partner, KINBER, and a contracted network engineer from Morefield Communication assisted our internal HACC network engineer to design and implement a network architecture that expanded connectivity and provided increased reliability and performance for our STEM programs located at HACC&rsquo;s Midtown location.</p> <p>The grant project goals and objectives were completed with less funding than expected. As a result, there is a budget surplus of $45,089.49 (21.58 percent of the total grant amount). The consultant fees, materials and supplies and travel cost less than expected, and the College did not need to provide release time for faculty participation. &nbsp;</p> <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="6" width="623" valign="top"> <p><strong>NSF Cyberinfrastructure Grant</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="94" valign="top"> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="106" valign="top"> <p>Budget</p> </td> <td width="109" valign="top"> <p>Expenses</p> </td> <td width="108" valign="top"> <p>Unspent</p> </td> <td width="114" valign="top"> <p>% Over/Under</p> </td> <td width="94" valign="top"> <p>Comments</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="94" valign="top"> <p>Salaries</p> </td> <td width="106" valign="top"> <p>$1,402.00</p> </td> <td width="109" valign="top"> <p>$0</p> </td> <td width="108" valign="top"> <p>$1,402.00</p> </td> <td width="114" valign="top"> <p>-100%</p> </td> <td width="94" valign="top"> <p>A faculty member was not assigned   to the project as originally planned.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="94" valign="top"> <p>Benefits</p> </td> <td width="106" valign="top"> <p>$365.00</p> </td> <td width="109" valign="top"> <p>$0</p> </td> <td width="108" valign="top"> <p>$365.00</p> </td> <td width="114" valign="top"> <p>-100%</p> </td> <td width="94" valign="top"> <p>A faculty member was not assigned   to the project as originally planned.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="94" valign="top"> <p>Equipment</p> </td> <td width="106" valign="top"> <p>$111,836.00</p> </td> <td width="109" valign="top"> <p>$121,156.00</p> </td> <td width="108" valign="top"> <p>$(9,320.50)</p> </td> <td width="114" valign="top"> <p>8.33%</p> </td> <td width="94" valign="top"> <p>The cost of the necessary   equipment increased between the time of our initial application and project   implementation.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="94" valign="top"> <p>Travel</p> </td> <td width="106" valign="top"> <p>$3,843</p> </td> <td width="109" valign="top"> <p>$654.26</p> </td> <td width="108" valign="top"> <p>$3,188.74</p> </td> <td width="114" valign="top"> <p>-82.98%</p> </td> <td width="94" valign="top"> <p>A key position was vacant for six   months of the grant period.
