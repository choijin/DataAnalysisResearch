<AbstractNarration>This award assists with funding the 3-day conference, Biology and Medicine through Mathematics, to be held in Spring 2016 at the Virginia Commonwealth University.  The main topics of the conference are Ecology, Evolution, Epidemiology, Medicine, Neuroscience and Fluid Dynamics. Plenary lectures will be given by internationally renowned speakers, Jim Cushing of the University of Arizona, Leah Edelstein-Keshet of the University of British Columbia, Bard Ermentrout of the University of Pittsburgh, and James Keener of the University of Utah. Their expertise covers a broad representation of the application of mathematical theory to the solution and modeling of problems originating in life science and medical applications. At the meeting their talks  will provide highlights of research encompassing topics in population dynamics, cell biology, neuroscience, wound healing and the chemical and physical behavior of the heart. This meeting will provide an intimate conference environment with opportunities for  participants at all levels to present a poster or give a talk. There will be scheduled events during the conference to provide networking opportunities between junior and senior researchers. Travel awards will be given to promote the the attendance of junior participants with particular attention to providing opportunities for attendance by  women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics and science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will be hosted by Virginia Commonwealth University.  The goals of this conference are to: i) provide a venue for the exchange of biomathematics research that highlights research in areas of federal strategic interest (health, medicine, and global and environmental changes), as well as, methods in mathematical biology; ii) promote the research of junior investigators (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty); and iii) help train the next generation of researchers in mathematical biology by providing a good environment for networking between junior and senior researchers. New developments in the broad field of mathematical biology will be introduced to a diverse group of students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty. This meeting is supported by the Mathematical Biology program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences. Details for this conference can be found at the conference website go.vcu.edu/bamm.</AbstractNarration>
