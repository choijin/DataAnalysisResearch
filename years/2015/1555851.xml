<AbstractNarration>This project will contribute toward increased understanding of surface weather, accuracy of forecasts and reduction of risk to life and property. In particular, it will lead to improved forecasting of jet strength, precipitation bands, and cyclone intensity. The research will enhance understanding of the dynamics responsible for stratosphere / troposphere exchange, hence the distribution of climatologically important trace constituents. The website focusing on inertial instability in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) will enhance public knowledge of weather systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inertial instability can play a significant role in facilitating stratosphere troposphere exchange (STE) in midlatitude cyclone. A stratospheric intrusion can occur by poleward motion in the uppermost troposphere (accelerated by inertial instability), overriding a thin layer of stratospheric air. Inertial instability also plays a key role in poleward momentum surges and jet flare-ups. It has also been found that inertial instability plays a key role in STE associated with tropical cyclones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further modeling and observational studies of the role of inertial instability in UTLS near both midlatitude and tropical cyclones will be undertaken in this study. The role of inertial instability in STE, both around the periphery and near convective maxima, with a focus on the relationship between convective potential vorticity dipoles and inertial instability in the UTLS, will be examined. The climatological occurrence and distribution of inertial instability in the UTLS and its relation to other features of midlatitude cyclones will be calculated using 37 years (1979-2015) of Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) data. Composite analysis will be used to relate the locations of inertial instability to other aspects of cyclones, including jet locations and air mass pathways. Products will include charts and sections depicting the location and occurrence of inertial instability in the context of transport pathways.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant contributed fundamental new knowledge regarding the structure and dynamics of potential vorticity (PV) dipole/jetlets in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). These are pairs of counter-rotating horizontal vortices, with a jet between each one, that appear on top of deep convection near the tropopause.   We investigated their role in mesoscale and synoptic scale systems, including midlatitude cyclones (MCs) and tropical cyclones (TCs).  It led to development of the convective momentum transport hypothesis for explaining their existence and orientation.   Using START-08 aircraft constituent data and the University of Wisconsin Nonhydrostatic Modeling System (UWNMS), this work contributed new insight into how tropopause folds are created, how jet superposition typically occurs, and the cause of low ozone values commonly observed in the jet core.   These results improve our understanding of the dynamics of major storms and associated flooding events.  Rowe and Hitchman (2015) analyzed UWNMS simulations of the Super Tuesday storm of February 6-8 2008, where deep convection developed in the warm-upglide sector to the east of a trough, with regions of inertial instability appearing in the UTLS.  Figure 1 shows how convection can cause a tropopause fold by injecting inertially-unstable air into the upper troposphere, which rides poleward over stratospheric air.  Hitchman and Rowe (2017) examined the relationship between deep convection and PV structures in the UTLS in TC Talas and in MC Super Tuesday.  PV dipoles were identified, with typical vertical and horizontal extents of ~3 km and ~200 km.  An example of a UTLS PV dipole/jetlet is shown in Fig. 2, which was located to the east of the surface low in TC Talas.  The negative, inertially-unstable member, lies radially outward (to the east), while the outflow jetlet between them is northward, opposing the ambient anticyclonic flow. The inertially-unstable region provides a favorable environment for outflow, with correspondingly higher wind speeds in the anticyclonic outflow.          Hitchman and Rowe (2019) investigated the formation of mesoscale jets associated with UTLS PV dipoles in three different TCs.  They formed ~100-250 km away from the eye in a partial secondary eye-wall and are characterized by surges of air which accelerate in the updraft, overshoot, and extend radially outward.  In each case, a vertically-continuous horizontal wind speed maximum was evident in the updraft, extending from the boundary layer into the UTLS, merging with the subtropical westerly jet.    They proposed a convective momentum transport hypothesis for the origin of a UTLS jetlet /PV dipole, with schematic diagrams shown in Fig. 3. Case 1) (Fig. 3a) is relevant for convection occurring in the poleward flow to the east of a trough in a MC, where upward transport of slower-moving air will cause a jetlet directed opposite to the flow. Case 2) (Fig. 3b) is relevant for TCs, where cyclonic flow in the mid-troposphere is transported into the anticyclonic ambient flow of the UTLS, yielding a striking difference in speed (dashed profile).  The predicted orientation of UTLS PV dipole/jetlets in TCs is shown in Fig. 4 for the NH and SH.  Cyclonic mid-tropospheric flow (green arrows) injected into the UTLS causes cyclonically-oriented jetlets, with negative PV to the right of mid-tropospheric flow, and anomalous PV lying radially outward, in agreement with Fig. 2.  A jetlet/PV dipole is expected to form whenever an updraft carries horizontal momentum from the troposphere into the base of the stratosphere, where ambient winds are significantly different.       Hitchman and Rowe (2019) investigated the nature of tropopause folds with START-08 aircraft constituent observations during April 2008 and numerical simulations with the UWNMS. The predominance of low ozone and low water vapor near the jet core can be explained by the ingestion of low-ozone air from the boundary layer into an updraft, dehydrated in the UTLS, and then detrained into the equatorward side of the westerly jet.   It is shown that the basic structure of a tropopause fold, and the cause of jet superposition, is quasi-isentropic differential advection in the vertical (Fig. 5).  Rowe and Hitchman (2020) studied the rapid destruction of a lower stratospheric PV anomaly by convectively-induced inertial instability.  On 20 August 2018, 10-15 inches of rain fell on western Dane County, WI, mostly during 7-9 pm CDT, leading to extreme flooding.  In the warm sector to the east of the low, a broad northeastward surge was penetrated by a strong convective updraft over central Illinois, which caused the nearly-complete destruction of the PV maximum in less than 2 hr, by detraining inertially-unstable air into the UTLS.  The resulting poleward diversion of the high PV lens into Wisconsin coincided in time with the rainfall maximum.   This kind of dynamical insight may be useful in predicting summertime extreme rainfall events.       Last Modified: 08/09/2020       Submitted by: Matthew H Hitchman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
