<AbstractNarration>This project addresses electrodynamic processes in the Earth's ionosphere at low and mid-latitudes. These processes will be studied simultaneously in both hemispheres in the American sector from locations along the same geomagnetic field lines. Data from  ground-based all-sky imagers and in-situ satellite measurements will be analyzed.  The results of this study will be made broadly available, will help to understand how inter-hemispheric coupling occurs,   and can be incorporated in global scale models of ionospheric electrodynamics, which are relevant to understanding Space Weather. This research will involve graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt; Specifically, this project will investigate the behavior of ionospheric perturbations related to equatorial Spread-F (ESF) and medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs). Observations include all-sky imagers and Fabry-Perot interferometers at magnetically conjugate locations in the American Sector. The generation mechanism of MSTIDs will be investigated using the conjugate measurements as well as data from the C/NOFS satellite.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project involved the use of ground-based all-sky imagers to measure airglow brightness associated with ionospheric irregularities, like equatorial spread F (ESF) and medium scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs), in the upper atmosphere at ~300 km. These imagers were located in both hemispheres in the American sector and in Europe/Africa sector, with the particular characteristic that they were magnetically conjugate, i.e., sites were ?connected? through Earth?s magnetic field lines. In the American sector the imager data showed that the zonal plasma motion is faster in the southern hemisphere, effect attributed to the presence of a magnetic anomaly in the southern hemisphere. The height of the emission layer that can be related to the height of the peak electron density was determined by mapping airglow depletions from one hemisphere to the other, and seeing how well they matched. The study of conjugate MSTIDs in the Europe/Africa sector showed that in the southern hemisphere the banded structures do not move north-westward, as usually reported, but westward. This is caused by the particular configuration of the Earth?s magnetic field, that has a large magnetic declination in the southern hemisphere in this longitude sector, when compared to the field line in the northern hemisphere (24 W vs 2 E). In addition, the optical data were compared with C/NOFS satellite data when the trajectory near the geographic equator was crossing a magnetic field line that connected to the imagers. In situ plasma data consisting of electric field, magnetic field, and ion density were compared with airglow variations measured by the imagers. A consistent correlation between perturbations in electric field and perturbations in airglow brightness was observed. Ion density perturbations were not always present, when airglow and electric field perturbations were measured. This has implications when trying to understand the electrodynamic of MSTID along magnetic field lines. Poynting flux measurements provided information on the source region of MSTIDs, confirming that they are generated in the local summer hemisphere.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/12/2020<br>      Modified by: Carlos&nbsp;Martinis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
