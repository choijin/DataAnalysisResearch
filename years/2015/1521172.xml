<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project is the development of polymer applications for glucaric acid such as polyesters and polyamides.  For example, the polyester segment has a potential for 9 billion pounds with a market value of $5 - $13 billion. Success on this project will catalyze the use of bioprocess-derived glucaric acid for this and other applications for which this versatile six carbon di-acid has utility.  While some smaller shorter carbon chain length molecules (three to five carbons, C3-C5)  based renewable materials are available, bioprocess-derived glucaric acid could represent the first major, biologically-produced C6 used for polymer synthesis if it can be successfully brought to market.  Based on precedents for large-scale fermentation processes, successful translation of the glucaric acid bioprocess and polymer synthesis technology into the commercial space would also result in job creation, as bio-based plants have typically been initiated in the US.  Critically this work will also further validate the commercial viability of producing commodity-scale, high value-added chemicals produced by microbes developed with synthetic biology techniques.    With the United States at the forefront of synthetic biology, proven commercially successful products will lead to greater private investment in this growth sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this Phase I research project are: 1) demonstrate the synthesis of novel, high molecular weight polymers (&gt;10 kDa) from glucaric acid and suitable co-monomers with useful thermal and mechanical properties, and 2) develop and evaluate genetically altered E. coli strains for improved glucaric acid production.  As a novel di-acid monomer, glucaric acid provides the opportunity to explore uncharted territory in the polymer space.  These new materials can serve as functional replacements allowing suppliers to leverage an alternative to petroleum feedstock-based polymers.  Reaction schemes that carefully control monomer stoichiometry and drive high conversion will be employed to achieve polyesters and polyamides with molecular weights greater than 10 kDa.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plastics have become ubiquitous in modern life, being used for a range of applications from low cost structural components to coatings that protect objects from their environment.  However, most plastics use unsustainable and non-renewable petrochemicals as the monomer feedstock (chemical building blocks).  The outcome of this STTR Phase I work seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of replacing at least some of these petrochemical monomers with glucaric acid; a six carbon di-acid chemical building block that can be produced from renewably-sourced glucose (sugar) or myo-inositol (plant material) by fermentation of metabolically engineered bacteria.  The step-wise, biological conversion of glucose or myo-inositol to glucaric acid carried out by the bacteria is more selective and "greener" than chemical methods resulting in glucaric acid that can be produced more easily and at higher purity; an important factor for its use in polymerization or pharmaceutical applications.  In this work, a simple formulation approach has been developed to use glucaric acid for a coating that provides protection against corrosion.  A pre-polymer is generated from a salt of glucaric acid and a multifunctional amine that can be completely dissolved in water (water-borne coating).  This formulation allows for an environmentally-friendly coating process with renewable materials and requires no organic solvents.  It can generate a smooth coating on a metal surface (e.g. aluminum) and after heating, results in a plastic that is insoluble in water or other common solvents typically encountered.  Furthermore, once applied and heated, the coating adheres tightly to the metal surface and inhibits corrosion.  The use of renewable monomers in a water-borne coating formulation makes this material potentially interesting as a replacement for BPA-containing coatings.
