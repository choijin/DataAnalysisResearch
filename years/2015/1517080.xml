<AbstractNarration>Polynomials and rational functions of a single variable provide basic examples of non-invertible dynamical systems.  Even the simplest families of examples exhibit complicated dynamical behavior;  the most famous is the family of complex quadratic polynomials, where the Mandelbrot set continues to baffle researchers.  The primary goal of this project is to explore the dynamical moduli spaces of polynomials and rational functions.  The projects proposed (both the questions and the proposed solution strategies) combine ingredients from complex analysis and arithmetic or algebraic geometry.  In one direction, the PI aims to study the distribution of postcritically-finite rational maps within the moduli space.  In joint work with Matthew Baker, the PI has formulated a dynamical analogue to the Andre-Oort conjecture in arithmetic geometry. Questions of this type are not only analogies:  for example, the PI  aims to use dynamical techniques to recover a result by Masser and Zannier about torsion points in families of elliptic curves.  The main tools are recent developments in analysis and dynamics on a Berkovich analyticspace.  In a slightly different direction, the PI is studying bifurcation sets and bifurcation measures in distinguished subvarieties within the moduli space.  Here the techniques are predominantly analytic.  New questions have stemmed from experimental work, using the new computer program Dynamics Explorer developed by Boyd &amp; Boyd.  The PI is also interested in classical problems about the existence and classification of symmetries of rational functions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last five or ten years, "algebraic dynamics" has become an extremely active area of research; the questions have become more refined as senior researchers enter the subject with very different backgrounds and we uncover connections to many areas of mathematics.  Roughly speaking, algebraic dynamics is the study of dynamical systems that preserve an underlying algebraicstructure.  Such systems arise naturally in applications (for example, the one-dimensional logistic family is algebraic), and they play a role in the analysis of arithmetic objects studied by number theorists (for example, in defining height functions associated to arithmetic varieties).  The PI is actively involved in the exchange of mathematical ideas between number theorists and dynamicists.   On one hand, her questions are about the fundamental stability of dynamical systems:  under what conditions is a system insensitive to small perturbations?  On the other hand, the special class of dynamical systems she studies exhibits a rich algebraic structure, bringing dynamical features into a long history of arithmetic geometry.  Finally, the project has an experimental component that works very well with students and junior researchers; the PI is actively involved in research projects and training programs for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A dynamical system is, by definition, an evolving process, and the complex dynamical systems studied here are processes described by algebraic formulas with complex coefficients.  The moduli spaces consist of all possible systems, subject to some geometric or topological constraints, making them tractable finite-dimensional spaces that we can explore and analyze.  Fundamentally, we are interested in the notion of stability, where the long-term behavior of the dynamical system is unaffected by a small perturbation of the initial conditions.     In the research supported by this grant, I examined polynomial and rational functions as self-maps of the Riemann sphere.  Repeated iteration corresponds to the passing of time.  When the degree of the map is fixed to be d&gt;1, the moduli space has complex dimension 2d-2.  These systems are the most basic, being models for more complicated dynamical systems, with features that arise universally.  Yet, even in this simplest of settings, there is much we have not yet understood, and the structure of the moduli spaces &mdash; and the regions of stability within them &mdash; remains an open question.   As the systems are algebraic, we can study connections between the analytic or transcendental features of the chaotic dynamical system and its algebraic structure.  I am particularly interested in parallels between algebraic dynamical systems, arithmetic geometry, and complex potential theory.  Ideas in my work come also from complex analysis, Teichmuller theory, number theory, and computer experimentation.     Supported by this grant, I published 7 articles on the moduli spaces of complex dynamical systems, with an emphasis on connections to arithmetic geometry, especially the number-theoretic properties of elliptic curves.  For example, I studied the connection between dynamical bifurcations and the canonical, arithmetically-defined height functions, and I proved one part of the Critical Orbit Conjecture, posed in my earlier work with Matthew Baker.  In a joint article with Xiaoguang Wang and Hexi Ye, we gave a new dynamical proof and a strengthening of a theorem of Masser and Zannier in Diophantine geometry, about elliptic curves and torsion points.  In a series of two articles with Xander Faber, we solved the problem of computing the limiting measure of maximal entropy in degenerating 1-parameter families of rational maps by relating the dynamics to the action of a map on a non-archimedean analytic Berkovich space.

The articles are also available on my webpage.  To share these results, I gave regular lectures in seminars, departmental colloquia, and conferences around the United States and the world.   Broader Impact.  The research involved is fundamental to our understanding of complex dynamical systems and related questions in arithmetic geometry.  It is connected to many areas of pure mathematics, including complex analysis, dynamical systems and ergodic theory, geometric topology, and number theory.  Outside of pure mathematics, there are also interesting computational and algorithmic questions that arose and were addressed in certain components of the project.  One of my graduate students completed her PhD degree during this 3-year period, working on arithmetic properties of orbits for polynomials defined over the p-adic numbers.  I currently have 4 additional PhD students working under my supervision.  Two graduate students completed a Masters Degree under my supervision during this period.  I supervised 3 postdoctoral researchers while supported by this grant, and I am currently supervising one additional postdoc.  Outside of my home institution, Northwestern University, I am lecturing all over the world, and I have repeatedly given lecture series at special week-long schools.  I have also given a number of public lectures on this work and how it fits into a broader, historical mathematical context.
