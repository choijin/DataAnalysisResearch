<AbstractNarration>Growing economic inequality in the U.S. has captured the attention of many Americans. Across political ideologies and income ranges, most Americans are critical of the inequality in income and wealth they see in the U.S., and most Americans want a more equal distribution. However, contrary to long-standing theoretical expectations that would predict a rise in the demand for redistribution in response to increasing wealth and income concentration, recent evidence suggests that support for redistributive policy appears to decrease in response to increasing inequality. This research will make sense of Americans' confusing sentiments about redistributive policy through an in-depth examination of Americans' thinking about the phenomenon of economic inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The muddled and dissonant nature of public opinion toward redistributive policies suggests the need for a study using qualitative methods that are uniquely suited to capture and make sense of these kinds of messy but influential sentiments. This research does just that, using in-depth interviews (divided among rich and poor neighborhoods) to probe the complexity of Americans' thinking about economic inequality while providing a powerful cross-time perspective through the creative re-engagement of an influential qualitative study on the topic from the early 1980s (Jennifer Hochschild's What's Fair?). Using a revisit to Hochschild?s site and methods to capitalize on the dramatic economic changes over the past several decades, this project extends her findings in new empirical directions. If, as the evidence suggests, a majority of Americans are dissatisfied with current income distributions, then understanding their desire for change and how it is connected or disconnected from their opinions about solutions is of importance to a broad range of stakeholders, including all of those scholars, policy makers, and citizens who seek to understand inequality and disparity.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>I used this award to conduct and analyze in-depth interviews with 42 Americans about U.S. economic inequality in a racially- and income-diverse city in the Northeast. The interviews lasted between one and four hours, often over two sessions (124 hours of interviews). I asked about the fairness of U.S. economic systems, perceptions of the rich and the poor, attitudes toward government (including taxation and assistance programs), feelings about redistributive policies, and respondents? ideas for change. I primarily selected for people whose annual household incomes were either 1) at or above $100,000 or 2) below $50,000.

Both sets of respondents expressed a sense that Americans do not have equal economic opportunities. Most respondents voiced concerns that economic rewards are not the result primarily of a person?s merit or hard work, but instead depend heavily on the circumstances into which one is born. Furthermore, they saw current economic and social systems in the U.S. as magnifying rather than reducing the inequality of people?s starting circumstances, compounding existing advantages and disadvantages. Based on this understanding of economic inequality, most respondents expressed sympathy for the poor and frustration or anger with the rich.

Low-income Americans are often blamed by political and social elites for maintaining inequality by acting against their own self-interest in their resistance to government redistribution. I argue, instead, that what low-income respondents resist is not redistribution itself, but the government control and intervention in their lives that is currently their dominant experience of redistributive policy. These respondents related experiences and exposure to government?through assistance programs, media, and taxation?that led them to feel that existing government mechanisms of redistribution were deeply flawed. They described these government assistance programs as corrupt, controlling, demeaning, and ineffective. They suspected politicians of colluding with the rich to hoard resources while keeping the poor from improving their own lives.
