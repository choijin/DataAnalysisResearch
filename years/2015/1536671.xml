<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to enhance student participation in the 2015 Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium by providing student support for the meeting.  The conference theme is research in additive manufacturing.  Additive manufacturing, known colloquially as "3D Printing", has in the last few years become a topic of interest nationally and internationally.  It has become recognized as a significant advanced manufacturing technology that will create new industries and concomitant domestic jobs for an educated workforce. The 2015 Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium will be held at the AT&amp;T Executive Education and Conference Center on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin from August 10 to12, 2015.  It is anticipated that 220 presentations will be made, 192 oral presentations and 28 poster presentations. Students will have full access to participation in the general organized oral presentations as well as the poster event.  The strong international participation will provide domestic participants an excellent opportunity to gain valuable information on research in the field. There is ample time allotted for informal interactions of world-class researchers and students in formal meeting settings and also in informal social events during the meeting. Information on the Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium, as well as the full conference proceedings, will be made available through the worldwide web at http://sffsymposium.engr.utexas.edu/.  Students will have the opportunity to present their work in a world-class setting and will network with international leading senior researchers and other students in their field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award is to provide partial participant support for up to 80 domestic students to attend the meeting.  Selection of students will be made by the chair of the conference organizing committee based on the following criteria: domestic student status, underrepresented groups, engagement in additive manufacturing, co-author or presenter on an oral presentation or poster.  Each student awardee will pay a reduced registration fee, approximately $300 less than the cost of participation. If fewer than 80 domestic students attend the meeting in 2015, a one-year, no-cost extension will be requested with the intent to use the residual funds for identical student support for the 2016 Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported student participation in the Twenty-Sixth International Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) Symposium.  The symposium took place on August 10-12, 2015 in Austin, Texas at The University of Texas at Austin.  Funds offset student registrations which enabled students to come and participate.  There were 121 students at the meeting which represented approximately 30% of the entire meeting participation.  The meeting had 227 oral presentations and 34 poster presentations.  Of these, 144 papers were included in the 1841-page proceedings.  Authors had an option to have their papers peer reviewed prior to publication.   Intellectual Merit  The Twenty-Fifth International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium, held at The University of Texas at Austin on August 10-12, 2015, was attended by 388 national and international researchers. The Symposium was organized in a manner to allow the multidisciplinary nature of the SFF research to be presented coherently, with various sessions emphasizing computer interfacing and modeling, machine and process development and materials and materials processing for SFF.  The three-day event was completely composed of individual oral presentations to accommodate the demand for this dissemination format.  The parallel sessions were split into five sessions to meet demand, and a poster session allowed researchers to present in this format.  We believe that documenting the changing state of SFF art as represented by the meeting proceedings serves both the people presently involved in this fruitful technical area as well as the flux of new researchers and users entering the field.   Information on the SFF Symposium was made available through the worldwide web at http://sffsymposium.engr.utexas.edu/archive.  On-line registration forms, hotel information, general information brochure, proceedings order form, maps and the previous yearÆs talk titles were all available.   Broader Impacts  In addition to the benefits of direct meeting participation, students were able to network with the international additive manufacturing research community.  Wider dissemination was accomplished through the proceedings.  A total of 144 papers were included in the proceedings volume.  Authors contributed manuscripts both unreviewed and reviewed to allow authors the option of presenting their work in a refereed format.   The SFF Symposium serves as a primary forum for networking and dissemination of information dealing with research issues in freeform fabrication.  According to Ian Campbell, senior editor of the Rapid Prototyping Journal, "The SFF Symposium is to be regarded as the foremost international conference for rapid prototyping research."  RPJ, 9#1, 2003. In a recent tally by AM experts on the most significant milestones in the history of AM, excepting the invention of specific AM processes, the inauguration of the SFF Symposium ranks highest [1].  When asked which publications had greatest influence on the AM field, the Proceedings of the SFF Symposium tied with the only refereed archival journal dedicated solely to the AM field, the British-based Rapid Prototyping Journal [1].  This same group ranked the SFF Symposium highest by over 50% to the next conference when asked what meeting contributed most to the development of the AM field [1]. The SFF Symposium Conference Proceedings are heavily cited in the archival literature, and it is anticipated that the 2015 Proceedings will be as well.   [1] Christopher L.
