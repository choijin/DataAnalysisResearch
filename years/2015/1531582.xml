<AbstractNarration>Earthquakes pose a major danger to society worldwide due to the potential casualties, damage, and social and economic disruption. Shake tables allow researchers to test physical models of civil, mechanical, and electrical structures under simulated earthquakes and other types of vibration. These tests are used to observe, measure, and understand the underlying physical phenomena, and subsequently develop improved design approaches and computer models for improved earthquake-resistant engineering. This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a bidirectional shake table capable of testing specimens weighing up to 1 ton at accelerations in excess of twice the acceleration of gravity. Acquisition of this instrument will significantly enhance the capabilities of engineering faculty at California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), allowing them to bridge the gap between analytical results and experimental verification. The instrument will be used for research on the seismic performance of civil structures and infrastructure. The instrument will also allow faculty to improve training programs for students at one of the nation's most ethnically and culturally diverse universities. The shake table will be integrated into three classes and independent study projects and  will be used for summer outreach programs for secondary students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shake table will enable researchers at CSULA to test a wide variety of engineered structures under simulated earthquakes. Researchers in structural engineering will use the instrument to investigate the seismic performance of energy efficient wood-framed shear walls. There is a need to reduce the energy use in the building sector. If these walls, which insulate better than traditional walls, have adequate seismic resistance, they have the potential for significant improvement in energy. Researchers in structural engineering will also investigate the behavior of unattached photovoltaic panels. Attached photovoltaic panels present architectural difficulties in their implementation; understanding the seismic behavior of unattached panels will facilitate their use in seismic regions. Researchers in geotechnical engineering will develop a database of test results for various arrangements of soil-pile and soil-pipeline systems. They will use this database to assess the adequacy of numerical modeling techniques. This understanding will help improve the earthquake safety of our critical infrastructure. Researchers in material science and structural engineering will investigate civil applications of bio- and carbon-nanotube-based fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) for potential use for civil structures. Beyond this, the instrument will facilitate scientific collaborations between faculty at CSULA and their partners in academia and industry. The instrument will become a key piece of research infrastructure for the College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology at CSULA.</AbstractNarration>
