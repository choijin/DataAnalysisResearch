<AbstractNarration>Because faults can be barriers to underground fluid flow, they influence groundwater supply, contaminant transport, petroleum production, and underground waste storage. Natural cements commonly precipitate along fault zones; these cements can dramatically inhibit fluid flow across a fault. However, determining the distribution of fault zone cements is difficult. As a result, fault-zone cementation is typically not accounted for in estimates of the impact of faults on fluid flow. This study aims to take advantage of unique electrical properties of natural cements to characterize the three-dimensional spatial distribution of cement for an exceptionally well-exposed fault zone. Then, the hypothesis that the degree and continuity of fault-zone cementation is a key control on fluid flow will be tested by drawing water from wells adjacent to the fault. The results of this project can be applied to better understand contaminant transport in faulted aquifers, the characterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs, and induced seismicity associated with wastewater injection. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved with all stages of the project, which will enhance education for underrepresented minorities at New Mexico Tech (NMT), a Hispanic-serving institution with a focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. In addition, the geophysical equipment and groundwater wells used in this project will be long-lasting teaching resources both for NMT and for summer field courses sponsored by other universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to characterize field-scale permeability across a fault and link the hydrogeologic behavior of the fault to spatial variations in the degree of fault-zone cementation. The central hypotheses are: 1) there are more pronounced variations in the degree of cementation down-dip than along the strike of the fault because the up/down-section variations in grain size are larger than those along strike, and 2) extensive cementation does not reduce cross-fault permeability at the field-scale (i.e. the de facto hypothesis for hydrogeologic models that neglect the potential effects of fault-zone cementation). The proposed project comprises: 1) characterizing the degree and extent of cementation along the surface exposure of the fault; 2) collecting resistivity and chargeability data in transects across the fault, deriving empirical relationships between the degree of fault-zone cementation and normalized chargeability for shallow portions of the fault, and using those relationships to map the estimated degree of cementation for deeper portions of the fault; 3) coring the fault at depth to confirm the degree of cementation; and 4) conducting well tests to determine permeability across the fault in both strongly- and weakly-cemented sections. The study will generate geologically based geophysical observations, providing a unique 3D map of cementation patterns from the land surface to ~30 m depth, in transects covering &gt;700 m along the strike of the Loma Blanca fault. Interpreting well tests across the fault in the context provided by the geologic and geophysical observations will allow for the development of a holistic view of fault-zone permeability, improving predictive models of the hydrogeologic impacts of faults.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Fault-zones are important controls on fluid flow, affecting groundwater supply, contaminant migration, and waste storage. Most models of fault seal do not consider fault zone cementation, despite the recognition that it is common and can dramatically reduce permeability. Through this study, we examined the field-scale hydrogeologic effects of fault zone cementation. First, we collected geological and geophysical data to develop an understanding of the hydrostratigraphy surrounding a variably cemented normal fault in the Rio Grande Rift. Then, we conducted a series of aquifer pumping tests in wells installed within tens of meters of the cemented fault zone. We demonstrated, for the first time, that electrical resistivity tomography profiles can be used to detect subsurface fault-zone cementation. We also discovered the side of a paleo-valley in the subsurface; it is an important control on the distribution of cementation. Finally, we showed that where the fault is cemented, it is a barrier to groundwater flow.&nbsp;</p> <p>We collected electrical resistivity data from 16 transects and geological samples from 29 boreholes across and around a cemented portion of the Loma Blanca Fault. We found resistivity anomalies in cemented portions of the fault. The resistivity anomaly associated with the cemented fault is most prominent in the unsaturated zone, where a reduction in porosity and pore diameter due to cementation can enhance capillarity which results in a higher water content in the cemented fault zone than in the unlithified host sediments. Thus, in the unsaturated zone, the cemented fault has lower resistivity than the uncemented host sediment. In the saturated zone, the fault zone commonly corresponds with higher resistivities that we interpret is due to lower effective porosity. The ability to use electrical resistivity to delineate cemented fault zones in the subsurface is of practical interest, particularly given their ability to affect subsurface fluid flow.</p> <p>We discovered a paleo-valley incision surface that is an important control on the distribution of subsurface cementation. A substantial portion of the cemented fault zone in the study area has been removed by erosion and covered by alluvial sediment. Geological data identify compositional differences between ancestral Rio Grande sediment below and south of the incision surface versus coarser-grained Rio Salado derived sediment above and north of the incision surface. The coarser-grained Rio Salado derived sediment appears as a higher resistivity portion of the unsaturated zone, providing a means to delineate the paleo-valley incision surface throughout the study area.</p> <p>Finally, we conducted a series of aquifer pumping tests within tens of meters of the cemented fault zone. We show, unequivocally, that fault zone cementation can be a barrier to groundwater flow at the field scale. This is an important demonstration that a fault with no clay in its core and similar sediment on both sides can be a barrier to groundwater flow by virtue of its cementation. Most conceptual models for the hydrogeology of faults would predict that it would not be a barrier to groundwater flow. For the Loma Blanca Fault, cementation reduces the fault zone hydraulic conductivity by at least 6-22 times relative to the host sediment. The integration of geological, geophysical, and hydrogeological observations was key to developing our understanding of this complex system.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/21/2020<br>      Modified by: Glenn&nbsp;A&nbsp;Spinelli</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1557232/1557232_10420256_1598045661982_04_WaterTableContour--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1557232/1557232_10420256_1598045661982_04_WaterTableContour--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1557232/1557232_10420256_1598045661982_04_WaterTableContour--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Map of contoured water table elevations in the study area.
