<AbstractNarration>It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this grant is to measure how quarks are distributed in nucleons and in particular how the magnetic moments of quarks are aligned compared with the nucleon?s overall magnetic moment.  Measurements over the past decade have shown that the quarks contribute only about 1/3 of the total spin of the nucleon, which gives rise to prediction that a significant fraction comes from the orbital motion of the quarks and other sources. The goal of these experiments is to compare results on the quark distributions (and their orbital motion) with theoretical predictions from the so-called Standard Model of Particle Physics. Additional measurements to search for an electric dipole moment of the neutron, which would be a signal of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the properties of the elementary particles making up most of the visible matter in the universe, are also part of this project.  These research efforts will contribute to the education of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates in a broad array of skills needed in the advanced high tech workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prevailing theory of the strong force, Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD, is a generalization of the highly successful QED, yet QCD is hard pressed to provide either quantitative or intuitive descriptions of nucleon structure. This project will focus on investigating key properties of the proton, targeting the poorly measured sea quarks and the unknown orbital motion of the quarks. The research will be performed at four experiments: SeaQuest at Fermilab, PHENIX at Brookhaven, and COMPASS-II and ATLAS at CERN. The strong force also played a role at the beginning of time. In the early stages of the big bang, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) existed for an instant, before the strong force confined the quarks into bound states. This fleeting state of matter has been recreated in the laboratory and found to possess extraordinary properties, such as a viscosity so low that it may be at its theoretical minimum. This grant enables continued study of the QGP?s properties using fully reconstructed jets at ATLAS and correlations in small collision systems at PHENIX.  This award also supports a search for a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron, a CP-violating quantity. The nEDM experiment aims at a 100-fold improvement over the present upper limit of the EDM set by previous experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the work of about 40 faculty, post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate researchers and technical support personnel in the field of particle physics.  There are two parts of our program.  In the first, we investigate the structure of the building blocks of atomic nuclei, protons and neutrons.  Just as the earth spins on its axis, protons and neutrons also have spin&mdash;but spin within the rules of the very small, the rules of quantum mechanics.  At this stage, we don?t really know what its origin is and, not surprisingly, we don?t really know how it behaves--this is one of our areas of investigation.  The second part of our program goes deeper into the world of the very small, back to the dawn of the universe, to look for indications of what the rules of physics might be at the edge of our understanding.  Our current picture of this world has some remarkable, perhaps incredible, coincidences.  For example, we know that our universe has much more of what we call matter, as compared to anti-matter.  In the very early universe, we have strong reason to believe there should have been equal amounts of each, which begs the question of what happened in-between.  As a part of our work, we build apparatus for use in experiments that make measurements to help answer these questions.  Some of the development for these instruments has led to advances that are, or might in the future be, used in other applications.  For example, one such detector technology is now being used at a commercial nuclear power plant as part of a test for general nuclear safeguard and surveillance use.  Another pushes the world record for speed in particle detection.  We have also developed tools and techniques useful for, for example, satellite instrumentation that is cooled with liquid helium.  In collaboration with industry, we have developed devices that are sensitive sensors of both magnetic and electric fields, as well as potentially useful for a new generation of "quantum sensors" and "quantum computers".
