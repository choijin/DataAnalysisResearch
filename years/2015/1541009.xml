<AbstractNarration>The scientific work proposed here will carry out the research and development necessary to create a new, unique set of high-latitude electro-dynamic, ionospheric-thermospheric-­&amp;#8208;magnetospheric cyberbased tools and products that will be available to the entire geosciences community. In combination, the data products from this project will allow the derivation of a first principle electromagnetic solution for the auroral ionosphere. Project will develop a new set of data resources for the geoscience community in the form of a complete electromagnetic solution of the auroral ionosphere and will focus on developing the ?Data Infrastructure for Communities? component of the EarthCube Integrative Activities. The project will thus allow access to not only the desired derived products, but also provide support for other modeling efforts by allowing access to the database of input data and intermediary products. The system will also be designed to be extensible, allowing additional data products and models to be integrated into the system. The system will fully support existing standards that are used in the broader geosciences community such as the Data Access Protocol (DAP).The research undertaken in this proposal will enable transformative research in two otherwise separated fields: magnetosphere-­&amp;#8208;ionosphere and neutral atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MIAC project addresses the complete electromagnetic solution of the auroral ionosphere, through an implementation that matches the goals of the EarthCube program. The intent is to develop a series of interlocking web services that provide access to the underlying MIAC datasets (AMPERE, SuperDARN and SuperMAG), that apply the science algorithms to derive the desired electro-­ dynamic products, and provide data translation and visualization services. This mesh of services will be open to the community and will allow users to access any individual service. The research undertaken in this project will enable transformative research in two otherwise separated fields: magnetosphere-­&amp;#8208;ionosphere and neutral atmosphere through a) the high-­&amp;#8208;latitude electro-­&amp;#8208;dynamics couple to the incoming solar wind and magnetosphere along magnetic field lines; b) the changes in the ionosphere and thermosphere at high latitudes provide changes to the conductivities throughout the polar region, which then effect the dynamics in the magnetosphere; c) the electrodynamic energy and momentum inputs get deposited in the upper atmosphere and launch neutral winds that then couple to ion velocities and transport compositional changes to the mid and low latitudes; d) the winds and composition couple to waves impinging from the lower atmosphere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The MIAC project addresses a science need of the ITM community, the complete electromagnetic of auroral ionosphere, through an implementation that demonstrates the goals of the EarthCube program.  The project developed a series of interlocking web services that provide access to the underlying MIAC datasets (AMPERE, SuperDARN and SuperMAG), apply the science algorithms to derive the desired electrodynamic products, and provide data translation and visualization services.  The project provide continuous and complete electromagnetic solutions for the auroral ionosphere.  Global solutions with a 2-min resolution of all the basic electromagnetic parameters are the holy grail of the Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (M-I) community.  These electromagnetic solutions consist of self-consistent estimates of field aligned currents (FAC), electric potential, Pedersen and Hall conductances as well as Joule heating, Poynting flux, and horizontal ionospheric currents.    The MIAC product uses a new visualization engine called rPlot. This engine uses a combination of HTML5 and a rich set of JavaScript libraries to perform the plotting on the client side within the users browsers. The visualization service extracts the necessary subset of data for plotting and output them in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). A combination of the HTML5 canvas element, webGL and the Cesium framework are then used to render the plots. Each MIAC data product is treated as a different data layer in the plot, much like a Geographical Information System (GIS). Layers can be fully customized with different plotting parameters and can be arranged in any order with varying levels of transparency. This allows the user to actually use the browser as a way to explore the data sets and discover features that may not be readily apparent.   The project was succesful and provided closure to all objectives as stated in the proposal.  This include a fully developed website which was based on the lessons leaned from the succesfull SuperMAG and AMPERE sites.
