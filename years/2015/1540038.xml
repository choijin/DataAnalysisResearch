<AbstractNarration>This project will help plan for a potential NSF I/UCRC for Microbial Forensics, in order to address the gaps necessary for the further development of the field, including the exploitation of new technological developments, the rigorous testing and validation of techniques, and the standardization of processes. It will do this under a unified banner, with input from academia, industry, and government stakeholders. As a result it will serve as a national platform for interdisciplinary research and communication, charged with investigating natural microbial phenomena relevant to law enforcement and national security, with an eye towards commercialization and economic development for the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the field of microbial forensics is young, the potential is exciting: ten times the number of bacteria as human cells in the body provides dramatically increased opportunities for detection and attribution of crimes, the tracking of individuals and materials, and even the utilization of microbes as sentinels or recordings of past events. Fundamental questions in microbiology remain and are of broad significance to human health, agriculture, national security, industry, and the environment. Application of these technologies to the field of forensics, with its unique applications and requirements, will support and advance all of these endeavors. This proposed Center's research goals are well aligned with these needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center will leverage existing efforts currently underway at awardee institution for the recruitment and training of underrepresented minorities and women in the forensic sciences. Specifically, the PI will recruit underrepresented minorities and women to the Center by targeting and leveraging existing Bachelors-to-Masters 3+2 agreements between the Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics and historically black and minority serving undergraduate institutions. The Center will be able to provide research opportunities to these students and others in a Professional Master's Degree Program, the population of which is heavily minority and overwhelmingly female. Outreach and research opportunities to participants of the awardee institution's Summer Multicultural Advancement Research Training (SMART) Program will be provided with a goal to bring undergraduate students to the campus for 10-week research opportunities during the summer. In addition to the research opportunities, students will also receive invaluable experience in industry relevant applied research and network opportunities with industry representative in order to capitalize on these experiences for their eventual employment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Award Title: Planning Grant: I/UCRC for Microbial Forensics      Federal Award ID: 1540038      Report Submission Period: 09/15/2016 to 02/28/2017     The purpose of grant award 1540038 was to conduct a proposal planning meeting towards the establishment of an Industry/University Collaborative Research Center in the area of Microbial Forensics.  In an effort to increase diversity of ideas and collaboration, the meeting was hosted in conjunction with colleagues from Texas A&amp;M University. The meeting itself was held at UNTHSC in July, 2016 with participation of researchers, administrators, and potential corporate partners whose expertise and product portfolios span many aspects of microbiology and forensic science.  Also in attendance were program officers and representatives from the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Justice.   Outcomes:  The I/UCRC planning meeting was held at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth, Texas on July 6-8, 2016.  In attendance were industry representatives from a variety of companies including: Luminex Corporation, Bioo Scientific, Thermo Fisher, Omega Bio-Tek, Qiagen Inc., Fluidigm Corporation, Illumina Inc., and MP Biomedicals.  Originally planned but not in attendance were representatives of Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences.  The meeting itself covered many aspects of the NSF?s Industry/University Collaborative Research Center program and addressed specific concerns of the corporate sponsors regarding goals, intellectual property rights, and investment requirements.  Individual researchers from both UNTHSC and Texas A&amp;M University gave seminars on their current research and discussed its forensic applications and potential for commercial development.  Education and training components were also discussed.  As a result of this meeting, sufficient corporate sponsorship was secured to facilitate submission of a full proposal for a single academic institution in 2017, but not enough to allow for two separate I/UCRCs at two institutions.  Following discussions among the main academic collaborators from both institutions, it was decided that Texas A&amp;M would serve as the lead institution for the full proposal, and UNTHSC would serve a supporting role in this effort.
