<AbstractNarration>Abstract (Christianson, 1501020): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for a sequence of mini-schools during 2015-2017,  to be held at   the University of North Carolina.  The  three mini-schools in 2015 will be held held during March 4-6, 2015 (tentative),  April 8-10, 2015 and summer of 2015 respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the mini-schools,  intimate  interaction and collaboration will be established between members at all levels of the University of North Carolina Partial Differential Equations group with members at all levels of other elite research groups with allied interests. The tentative principal speakers for 2015 are: Gunther Uhlmann, Alexandru Ionescu, and Steve Zelditch. During each mini-school, the principal speaker will give a series of three or more lectures over the course of 2-3 days on an important topic in the fields of geometric analysis and partial differential equations. Funded participants will be chosen by the organizing committee in collaboration with the principal speaker. Several funded participants will give satellite talks complementing the principal speaker's lectures. More information will be provided at  https://math.unc.edu/seminars-and-colloquia/seminar.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Eight mini-schools were supported by the grant.  The principal speakers were G. Uhlmann, A. Ionescu, P. G&eacute;rard, P. Hislop, T. Duyckaerts, W. Minicozzi, T. Christiansen, and J. Wunsch.  Each mini-school also included satellite talks by young researchers who work on problems related to those being discussed.  The satellite speakers were typically graduate students, postdocs, or collaborators of the principal speakers.   The structure of each mini-school was flexible and adapted to the preferences of the principal speakers.  But in addition to the series of lectures over two or three days, several of the lecturers held "office hours" and spent significant time meeting with the graduate students and postdocs.  Others wrote assignments to reinforce what they were presenting, and rooms were reserved for problem sessions.  Additionally, there was significant opportunity for informal interaction.  Outside interest in the mini-schools grew significantly over the years.  More than 20 applications for external funding were received for the last several events.  For each event, 15-20 external participants were funded, though some of these funds were from other sources and in many cases only partial support could be promised.  Once a student or postdoc attended a mini-school, it was very common to receive another application for a subsequent mini-school, which provides evidence that the participants found the events to be productive.  In fact, one satellite speaker described the event as a turning point in his graduate career.  In addition to the outside participants, some twenty local scholars attended each mini-school.  The local students also benefited greatly.  Several graduate students have remained in contact with potential collaborators or mentors that were met during the minischools.
