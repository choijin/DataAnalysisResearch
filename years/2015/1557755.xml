<AbstractNarration>Evaluating and avoiding negative outcomes is critical for optimal decision-making and, ultimately, animal survival. A chemical in the brain called dopamine is well known to promote advantageous behavior when animals are pursuing reward; however, little is known regarding the role of dopamine when animals are avoiding harm. The principal investigator's lab is able to measure real-time dopamine levels in the brain of behaving animals using a tool called voltammetry, and turn dopamine neurons on/off using a tool called optogenetics. Using these tools, the investigator's research team will perform a thorough assessment of how dopamine levels within the brains of behaving rats are involved in the avoidance of footshock. Additional experiments serve to determine whether dopamine is involved in assessing the value of avoiding different intensities of footshock. It is predicted that dopamine levels will change over the course of learning in a manner that promotes successful footshock avoidance and scale with the value of the footshock avoided. All aspects of the proposed project will involve undergraduate trainees, especially trainees from underrepresented populations. By using cutting-edge technologies to investigate the role of dopamine in the avoidance of harm, the principal investigator and his students will uncover novel information about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying behavior while simultaneously developing a future, diverse population of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator recently demonstrated that a warning signal predicting the avoidance of an aversive event evokes transient surges in dopamine concentration within the ventral striatum. This finding suggests that the transient dopamine signal represents environmental stimuli predicting the avoidance of something bad similarly to those predicting the receipt of something good. Furthermore, preliminary optogenetics data reveal that facilitating midbrain dopamine neural activity during warning signal presentation promotes avoidance outcomes in well-trained rats. Despite these important advances, the precise role(s) that transient dopamine release events play in negative reinforcement processes remains unknown. In this project, the investigator and his research team will use fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and optogenetics to assess the role of transient dopamine release events in the nucleus accumbens core, dorsomedial striatum, and dorsolateral striatum during: 1) avoidance learning, 2) maintenance and extinction of avoidance, and 3) positive vs. negative reinforcement value assessment. The collection of these data will generate presently unknown mechanistic detail regarding how the brain processes negative reinforcement-- information that may contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role of dopamine in animal behavior. To accomplish these goals, the investigator will involve undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds, in all aspects of data collection and dissemination. In addition, the investigator will develop an international neuroscience conference experience program for undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities and a neuroscience outreach program in which undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities visit Denver city museums and schools to teach the general public about the brain.</AbstractNarration>

However, our previous observations suggest that dopamine is also involved in aversively motivated behavior. In the current project we sought to determine whether dopamine is related to the cost of obtaining reward and the cost of avoiding harm. To accomplish this goal, we first designed novel behavioral economic tasks that allowed us to measure the price rats will pay to receive reward or avoid harm. We increased price by requiring rats to respond more on a lever throughout daily experimental sessions to receive a fixed outcome. After each session we would then measure how consumption of each commodity changed with increasing price. If consumption became more sensitive to price, we would conclude that the value of the outcome was diminished. By contrast, if consumption became less sensitive to price, we conclude that the value of the outcome was enhanced. We then used electrochemistry to measure real-time changes in dopamine release as rats pressed a lever to receive a reward or avoid harm in these behavioral economic tasks. Using this approach, we found that the amount of dopamine detected represented the anticipated cost to obtain either a rewarding or an avoidance outcome. Next, we applied a technique called optogenetics that allows us to turn on/off dopamine neurons like a like switch. Using the approach, we found that manipulating the amount of dopamine released by either a rewarding or avoidance outcome modified the price rats were willing to pay to receive it. From these observations, we conclude that dopamine is not simply a reward molecule. Rather, transient fluctuations in dopamine release appear to encode the value of any advantageous outcome and can causally modify the price animals pay for said outcome. These data suggest that subsecond fluctuations in dopamine release may have evolved to help animals maximize utility in their environment. There are several implications of these findings. From an ethological perspective, it appears that dopamine value signals might help animals seek reward and avoid harm. From an economic perspective, it is possible that external stimuli (e.g., advertisements) can trick us into thinking we will receive outcomes that are better than reality by amplifying anticipatory dopamine value signals. And, because the amount of dopamine detected in anticipation of an advantageous outcome always exceeded the amount detected at the receipt of the outcome, it is likely that artificially heightened dopamine value signals set us up for maximal disappointment. Our observation that amplifying dopamine anticipatory value signals decrease the price rats will pay to receive reward or avoid harm generally support this supposition.
