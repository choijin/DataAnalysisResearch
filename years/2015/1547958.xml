<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research project will be in availability of high performance, affordable structures made from manufactured concrete block.  These structures include roofs, such as domes, arches, cylinders, spheres, and more.  The high efficiency of concrete block manufacturing will be used to create an entirely new range of products from concrete block.  This novel technology will help grow the block manufacturing industry, the construction industry, and will provide the end user with a high performing, affordable, low maintenance, and attractive and efficient construction system suitable for multiple applications.  The applications for this construction method include significant public infrastructure works, such as bridges, tunnels, levees, breakwaters, and sea walls.  This technology is expected to benefit homeowners, businesses, and local, state and federal government agencies.  The innovation will enhance the use of manufactured block by optimizing the strength of articulated interlocking features created during production.  This system will optimize the high compressive strength of manufactured concrete block in robust and easy to install applications.  The introduction of vaulted arches, domes, spheres and cylinders made from concrete block will provide great economic value for society and economic growth for the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will research manufacturing of the interlocking block design on a standard block machine, using a baseline standard mix.  The mix design will be changed along 3 variables: (1) amount of cement used; (2) amount of pozzolanic material used ;(3) and size and amounts of aggregate used.  These variables will be used to provide high and low settings for a Taguchi array, for analysis of properties measured, including any combined effects. These variables will have the effects of their high and low settings on evaluation of microstructure; examination of the effects of aggregate segregation within the Concrete Manufacturing Unit (CMU) at critical locations; and evaluation of how microstructure varies with cement type and cement content. This will be achieved by taking a critical piece of the interlocking key and keyway features mechanical testing rig. The results of this testing will allow a statistical analysis of stress concentration as a function of 3 variables on mold-filling. This data will determine the properties of bend strength and crack growth at the critical location within the CMU's.  This information will allow the block-maker to implement any slight adjustment to their concrete mix design to ensure optimum block strength.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: This project achieved optimization of a concrete design mix ("recipe") used for manufacturing topological interlocking concrete block to achieve the highest compressive strength, investigating three variables. The three variables investigated were: the amount of cement used, the amount of flyash (pozzolonic) used, and the aggregate particle size distribution.  Each of these three variables were examined using values which are typical or common within the standard practice of concrete block manufacture.  Each of these three variables had both a "low" and a "high" setting, in accordance with the method of experimental design and statistical analysis as employed by the Taguchi array.   The basic composition of the design mix included 380 pounds of Portland cement, 2,800 pounds of sand (smaller aggregate), no flyash (pozzolonic material), 1,000 pounds of 1A gravel (1/4 inch, larger aggregate), and 250 pounds of water.  The "low" settings for each permutation of the Taguchi array are those settings in the base composition.  The high settings for each variable were: 425 pounds of cement, 3,000 pounds of sand (smaller aggregate), and 50 pounds of flyash (pozzolonic).  The specific objective of strength testing was to determine which settings of these variables created block with the highest compressive strength.  These three variables were arranged in a Taguchi orthogonal array as an experimental design in order to gain the most information while performing the fewest number of experimental runs, as shown in Figure 1.  Simultaneously, investigation of the effects of processing geometry on mechanical properties and the distribution of aggregates and cement in the concrete microstructure was performed. This was achieved by employing advanced microscopy techniques to lend insight into the interactions between the aggregates and the cement at the micro scale as a function of local variations in processing conditions.  The optimized design mix, as determined by experimental results, was used to produce block which were then used to build a test structure to investigate the suitability of this block design for erection of a large arch without supporting scaffolding, and also to build a series of "flying buttresses" which served to resolve the thrusting forces of the large main arch.  Results from the strength testing of each permutation of the Taguchi array experimental design (Figure 3) indicate a clear and obvious combination of variable settings which created the samples with the highest compressive strength.  Sample number 7 (run order 7) exhibited the highest compressive strength, with a measurement of 5,901 psi. By comparison, sample number 6 (run order 6) was the base composition and exhibited a strength of 3,445 psi.  The optimal design mix (number 7) exhibited an increase of strength which was 71.3% stronger than the base composition.  Samples were taken from six strategically located positions within each masonry unit (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, interlocking left and interlocking right; as shown in Figure 2) critical knowledge was gained from this selection of samples' locations and their respective strengths. It was observed that no really significant difference in strength was measured as a result of sample location within the block, as shown in Figure 4.  This observation is interpreted to mean that good flow characteristics of the concrete were present within the mold cavities.  This characteristic is important and significant: it means that high-strength, robust block were produced by this design.  Block made from the optimized design mix were successfully used to build flying buttresses and a main arch for a test building with an interior arch span of 25 feet, and a depth of 30 feet (Figures 5 &amp; 6). These same block were also used to demonstrate that "Gothic" windows of large size (6 feet on edge) could be easily assembled.  This test building demonstrated these block can be assembled without support scaffolding by using their interlocking feature in a herringbone pattern, while incorporating rebar as an integral part.  Broader Impacts: This research activity provides a path toward utilizing the high efficiency production capability of the national concrete block manufacturing industry for the development of new possibilities for resilient structures. The optimization of strength as determined by this project?s experimental results provide the concrete block industry with a great improvement to compressive strength. This activity creates entirely new markets for manufactured concrete block.
