<AbstractNarration>Steroid hormones are critical for the normal function and maintenance of physiology in vertebrates.  Specifically, estrogens play important roles in differentiation and growth of the reproductive system via the estrogen receptor (ER).  The proposed project examines estrogen-like activity of COREXIT® EC9500A, the primary dispersant authorized for use in response to the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, in diamondback terrapins and several species of crocodilians.  The results will contribute to understanding the sublethal effects of COREXIT and whether it functions as an environmental estrogen.  Moreover, the results will help in the development of less toxic, novel dispersants.  Investigating the effects of environmental contaminants, including endocrine disrupting contaminants (EDCs), using sentinel species is critical due to the potential alteration of the endocrine system by EDCs in both wildlife species and humans.  This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Taisen Iguchi, a renowned expert on endocrine disruption and developmental effects of estrogen-like chemicals, at the National Institute for Basic Biology in Okazaki, Japan.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Estrogens play an important role in temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in some turtles and all crocodilians in which incubation temperatures during a thermosensitive period (TSP) in embryonic development determine sex of the embryo.  A single exposure to exogenous estrogen during TSP overrides the effects of temperature, and leads to sex reversal or skewed sex ratios by inducing ovarian development at a male-producing temperature.  Reptile species that exhibit TSD have been used as sentinel species to investigate chronic exposure to environmental contaminants including EDCs.  Using luciferase transactivation assays with nuclear hormone receptors, COREXIT demonstrated estrogenic activity in vitro via Alligator mississippiensis estrogen receptor 1.  The proposed work aims to clone and characterize ERs from diamondback terrapins and several crocodilian species.  Transactivation assays will be performed with these cloned ERs to compare the transactivation among the different reptile species. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, millions of gallons of COREXIT&reg; EC9500A were applied to the sea surface and at the broken wellhead beneath the surface to disperse the oil.  This massive release mandates evaluating not only toxicity, but also sublethal and long-term effects of COREXIT including potential endocrine disruption.  Endocrine signaling by estrogens via the estrogen receptor is fundamental for the normal functioning of the reproductive system in all vertebrates.  Estrogens also play important roles in the process of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in some turtles and all crocodilians in which egg incubation temperatures during development determine sex of the offspring.  Exposure to exogenous estrogen during this process can override the effects of temperature and result in skewed sex ratios by inducing ovarian development at any incubation temperature.  Given this sensitivity of TSD to estrogen signaling, contaminants in the environment that can mimic natural estrogens should be of major concern.  This study focused on investigating estrogen-like activity of COREXIT in the diamondback terrapin, a turtle species that exhibits TSD and has been used as an indicator species for environmental contaminant studies due to its wide geographic distribution, long life span, predatory foraging behavior, and high site fidelity.  Both of the nuclear estrogen receptors, ESR1 and ESR2, were cloned and sequenced from terrapins and found to be highly conserved with painted turtle, alligator, and chicken estrogen receptors.  The cloned receptors were characterized using nuclear hormone receptor transactivation assays with 17&beta;-estradiol, the primary estrogen in circulation in the body, and COREXIT.  This research was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Taisen Iguchi, a renowned expert on endocrine disruption and developmental effects of estrogen-like chemicals, at the National Institute for Basic Biology in Okazaki, Japan.  Transactivation assays with the cloned terrapin estrogen receptors from the present study could provide a useful tool for evaluating potential estrogen-like activity of environmental contaminants in coastal aquatic reptile species.
