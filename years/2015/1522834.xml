<AbstractNarration>The USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST) is a leading forum for innovative research in storage systems, bringing together researchers and practitioners from both industry and academia to reveal and discuss leading topics germane to file and storage systems. This award provides funding to assist approximately 20 U.S.-based graduate students to attend the 13th USENIX FAST Conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing opportunities to interact with more senior researchers and attain exposure to leading-edge work. This award will fund participation of those students who would otherwise be unable to attend FAST, with a particular emphasis upon supporting women and other underrepresented minorities in the field.</AbstractNarration>
