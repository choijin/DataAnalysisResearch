<AbstractNarration>This three year renewal of a successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of New Mexico, entitled REU in Nanoscience and Microsystems Engineering, focuses on the application of nanomaterials to biosystems and bioimaging as well as to energy conversion and storage, representing areas of current national interest. The synthesis and processing of materials in the 21st century requires a new paradigm where the physical sciences, engineering and computational modeling come together. Solving some of the most pressing challenges in the areas of health, energy and the environment provides challenging research projects for this REU Site.  The unique aspect of this program is the interdisciplinary environment, which is an essential component of materials research.  The interdisciplinary team-based approach reflects the environment these students will encounter as they transition to their careers in industry, academe or in national labs. The Nanoscience and Microsystems interdisciplinary program is based on the premise that to benefit society the unique properties of nanoscale materials must be integrated into micro- and macro-scale devices and then further into systems. Projects include drug delivery, biocides, protein aggregation and sensing, nanoparticle dynamics, catalysts, nano fluidics and energy conversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be recruited from diverse ethnic, educational as well as cultural backgrounds.  This includes students from community colleges and primarily undergraduate institutions across the country. Students work for 10 summer weeks with a research advisor and a mentor (graduate student/post-doc). The aim is to instill a spirit of inquiry by integrating research and education, and to enhance student interest in pursuing careers in the sciences and engineering. Students are guided through all aspects of research, preparing a proposal, making a plan of research, executing this plan and analyzing and presenting the significance of their work. In this manner, students transition from a relatively dependent status to one where they start to ask questions and suggest new experiments. Students also participate in a series of seminars that will include faculty, national lab and industry speakers. Field trips to the National Laboratories and to local industries enhance their exposure to career opportunities and exciting research problems. The summer research program provides students the excitement of participating in open-ended research, at the same time connecting this research with their academic curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The REU site program in Microengineered Materials was conducted during the summers of 2016 ? 2018 and through a no-cost extension during the summer of 2019. The goal of this project was to enhance the education of undergraduate students by giving them an opportunity to do hands-on research over a 10-week period in the summer. By working closely with graduate student mentors and their faculty and post-doctoral advisors, the undergraduate students gained an appreciation of the excitement of doing research and the challenges and rewards involved.  This experience proved instrumental in guiding their future careers and enhancing their interest in science and engineering. Students went on to present their work at national conferences, winning fellowships such as the NSF GRFP, and continuing their education in graduate and professional schools, or working in industry.  The 10 week program paired each student with a mentor (graduate student or post-doc).  The mentors received training prior to the start of the program. REU program participants received training in all aspects of conducting research including developing a research proposal, doing presentations on their research, reading the literature and writing research proposals for graduate program fellowships.  Students also learned how their scientific research has broader impacts, and how to assess scientific research impacts on technology and society. They were introduced to materials characterization tools available to them, and how to use them, and students also learned how to document and store the data they collected and how it is analyzed.  The intellectual merit of this program is evident from the research conducted by the students.  The research centered on three themes:  (1) Nanoscience of Biosystems, which included engineering of immunogenic nanoparticles for cancer therapy, molecular logic embedded materials, natural plant compounds as protective agents for Alzheimer?s disease and the study of oligomeric conjugated polyelectrolytes as amyloid beta-aggregates.  (2) Nanomaterials for energy conversion, which included Pt-based electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications, single atom catalysts for exhaust emission control and catalyst for converting natural gas derived liquids to fuels and chemicals.  (3) Complex Functional Systems, which included non-polar gallium nitride-based super luminescent diodes for visible light communication, coating technology for radiative cooling, mechanics of additively manufactured composites and gravure printing of metal N-inks.  Besides the broad impact of the research conducted by the students, it also contributed to broadening participation of undergraduate students in research.  The program recruited students across the US, from departments of chemical engineering, materials science, ceramics and chemistry.   A total of 47 students participated in this 10 week site program over these years, 36 supported by this NSF grant, 4 by a previous NSF/REU grant and 7 from other grants active at UNM.  Of the total, 22 students came from primarily undergraduate institutions including community colleges.  A diverse group of students participated, with a total of 25 women and 15 students from underrepresented minority groups (11 Hispanic, 2 Native American and 2 African American).
