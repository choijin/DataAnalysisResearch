<AbstractNarration>More than 90 percent of U.S. manufactured goods contain cast metal components made with a process involving multiple steps, which include melting of the original metal, and solidification in casts. The commercial viability and energy efficiency of the entire operation require controlling and predicting product quality while maximizing the rate of casting. Unfortunately, measuring the properties of the melt during processing is difficult, and to date quality tests occur only after solidification. This award supports research aimed at providing a new tool to evaluate the melt properties using sound waves at very high frequency (ultrasound). The anticipated results are expected to enable real-time monitoring of the casting process, and lead to new processing methods that will increase the energy efficiency of casting.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In metal casting, precise control of the melt properties prior to solidification can be achieved after identifying and characterizing features like grains, inclusions, and bubbles. Ultrasound metrology could track those features, while also imaging solidification fronts and measuring melt flow. Unfortunately, prior implementations of ultrasound in liquid metal have often been unreliable and intermittent. The physical mechanisms impeding ultrasound metrology are not understood. This collaborative project will couple advanced physical and chemical science to enable real-time imaging and flow measurement via ultrasound metrology, before solidification. Combining electrochemical and ultrasound techniques for melt measurements, the project will determine the microscale mechanisms of interaction among ultrasound, metal, oxide, and dissolved gas in order to enable the further development of real-time monitoring of molten metal properties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This project investigated the mechanisms that underly ultra-sound propagation and fate in liquid metals (melts) in order to support the application of ultra-sound metrology for manufacturing with metal casting. The project PI was responsible for the experimental side of the project and the co-PI the underlying metallurgical and chemical models.  Several models were provided, from the basic thermodynamic of gas solubility, the thermodynamic of precipitates formation in melts (oxides, sulfides..), to the force-balance of cavitation that relates physical chemistry of melts to the size and properties of bubbles. It was discovered that there is a fundamental thermodynamic relation between the property of dissolved gas in solid and in liquids (partial molar entropy, see Caldwell, Acta Materialia 2019). It also supported a novel electrochemical method to identify reaction in liquid metal electrodes (Calwell, Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, 2020)  The models helped informed the experimental conditions that can emulate industrial conditions and determining the operating parameters that shall be tested in order to verify the hypothesis.  The tested hypothesis was that bubbles in the bulk of the melt make echoes that enable ultrasound metrology, but bubbles at the transducer face prevent ultrasound energy from penetrating into the melt and therefore destroy the signal.  It was found that it is experimentally very difficult to emulate the industrial metals (mostly aluminium) at low temperature where most experiments can be done, because the chemical nature of aluminium is very unique. The surrogate metal used, gallium, was found to easily get contaminated with oxides which fate at low temperature and with the existing set-up is difficult to master. New experimental conditions were devised and demonstrated to be able to control better the fate of those oxides in gallium.  Thanks to the combined use of thermodynamic models and new experimental settings, it proved possible to test a number of assumptions related to the oxide and dissolved gas influence. Fundamental mechanisms for ultra-sound have been revisited thanks to the results, providing new design rules for future equipments and signal analysis for ultrasound in gallium. Those advances are timely as new industrial trials are reported using ultrasound in aluminium, and our project provided a new methodology and view on the technique that can inform engineering decisions for such future applications.
