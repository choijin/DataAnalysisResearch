<AbstractNarration>New techniques have emerged that allow the determination of the three dimensional structures of very large macromolecular assemblies. These larger biological systems play key roles in basic molecular biology, photosynthesis, nanotechnology, and health. Rather than relying on a single technique, the three dimensional structures of these molecular machines are being determined by integrating results from many different kinds of experiments using computational methods. In order to allow these integrative, or hybrid, models to enable future research by the broad community of scientists and also provide for the development of new educational platforms, it is essential to develop a way to archive these data and make them easily accessible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several steps are necessary to achieve this goal. Current archiving of macromolecular structures depends on the fixed spatial positions of atoms; therefore the existing representation of these models must be extended to include both non-atomistic and spatio-temporal models. A new infrastructure will be developed that allows for the federation of different experimental repositories hosting data sets contributing to these integrative models. Once this infrastructure is developed, it will be necessary to prototype a system for depositing and archiving these new integrative models and supporting data.</AbstractNarration>

The major goals of this project include creation of a data representation to capture the details of integrative modeling and use this as a foundation to build a prototype system for deposition and archiving of I/H models. This project addresses a timely need in the evolving field of structural biology and advances the "FAIR" guiding principles of making the results of integrative modeling "Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable".  The significant outcomes of this research project are:  A set of data specifications that describe the results of integrative modeling. These data specifications address the important features of I/H modeling including representations of I/H models in multiple spatiotemporal scales and conformational states and definitions of spatial information derived from a variety of experimental and computational techniques. These data specifications are captured in a software-amenable "dictionary" of data terms and collectively form the set of data standards required for archiving I/H models.
