<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this one-year project is to enable the participation of eight students and early-career scientists from the US at the VIIth Coronal Loops Workshop, which will be held in Cambridge, UK, during July 21-23, 2015.  This workshop is aimed at cultivating a forum for focused discussions on coronal heating, in general, and the dynamics and heating of coronal loops, in particular.  One very important aspect of this international workshop is to ensure a significant participation by students and early-career scientists.  Therefore, this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  Coronal loops are the building blocks of the Sun's atmosphere and through understanding them we aim to unravel the mysteries that the solar atmosphere presents us with. In particular, we want to know the details of how the million degree corona is created.  The purpose of this proposal was to request funding to support the attendance of young/early career scientists (Ph.D. students and post-docs) at the seventh Solar Coronal Loops Workshop, which was held at the University of Cambridge, UK, on July 21 - 23, 2015. The Loops Workshop series began in 2002, motivated by the fact that the theory/numerical modeling of the day was not able to adequately explain state-of-the-art observational data (e.g. from SoHO and TRACE) showing the structure and evolution of coronal loops, despite the rich detail it provided. Since then, the Solar Coronal Loops Workshops have been a series of highly successful meetings focused on the physical processes that govern these enigmatic structures.  Enormous progress has been made, with new observatories, theories and models working in tandem to provide many fresh insights and ideas. Several long standing problems have been solved, thanks in large part to the Loops Workshops bringing the community together, and the field has been transformed in the fourteen years since their inception.   Intellectual Merit  The Solar Coronal Loops Workshops are truly international, with more than 60 participants from countries throughout the world. They bring together observers, theorists and modelers; scientists who are world-leading experts in their fields. The format of the meetings is designed to facilitate discussions and the exchange of ideas, rather than passively listening to talks. The Loops Workshops have become the international standard of reference for the debate about the nature and properties of solar coronal loops. They have been responsible for fostering new collaborations, allowing those who hold opposing views to openly debate their ideas, and have inspired new investigations.  Broader Impacts  The Solar Coronal Loops Workshops have been particularly supportive of young/early career scientists from the very beginning. They are often the first opportunity for many of the participating young scientists to present their work to an international audience of their scientific peers, but to do so in an environment that is supportive and encouraging. The Workshops are one of the very few forums that provide young scientists with the opportunity to not only observe senior scientists engaging in the key debates of their field, but to join in those debates themselves. The relatively small-size of the meetings and their informal nature means that young scientists can network and connect with senior scientists much more easily. This provides them with an extremely valuable resource in terms of additional mentoring, feedback, collaboration, and references for Fellowships and post-doctoral opportunities later on.  The funding provided by this proposal allowed three young/early career scientists, and a more senior scientist suffering a funding shortfall from a country experiencing severe economic difficulties, to participate in this Workshop. The opportunity to connect and engage face-to-face with their scientific peers was extremely valuable in each case.
