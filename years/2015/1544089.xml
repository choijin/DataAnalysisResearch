<AbstractNarration>The activity will support travel for up to 20 students and 20 participants to attend and present at a workshop on Radio Frequency Spectrum Management, which will take place at the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez, Puerto Rico.   The meeting will take place in August 2015. The grants will provide partial support for travel, housing, and conference attendance. The topic of this conference is of great relevance to the NSF's interests in spectrum management for research applications, particularly radio astronomy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will have duration of 5 days, including one day for a presentation on the radio interference issues at NSF's Arecibo Observatory.  The goal of the workshop is to recruit under-represented minorities in this important area, which is at the convergence of science, engineering and economic development. The workshop will have introductory and advanced topics, including Spectrum Management fundamentals, Strategic Planning, Spectrum Management for Satellite Systems, Scientific Research and Maritime Commercial Uses.</AbstractNarration>
