<AbstractNarration>This study reinterviews a nationally representative sample of Russian citizens who were first surveyed in spring 2012 about their political, economic, and social views in order to understand a very important transformation in Russian public opinion. Shortly after pro-European Union protesters ousted Russian-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014, Russia stunned the international community by annexing Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and began backing a fierce insurgency that soon gained control over significant parts of Ukraine's industrial Donbas region. The Russian public rallied to support President Vladimir Putin, whose approval ratings skyrocketed and have remained high. This study will shed new light on three major puzzles: (1) What exactly underlies the massive "rally-around-the-leader" effect that we observe in Russia? (2) Why has the economic crisis that followed Crimea's annexation not led to a significant reduction in this rallying effect? (3) Why have the battlefield costs of the ongoing Russian-backed insurgency in Ukraine not led to a decline in Putin's popular support? The results will help policymakers and a broader public better understand the international behavior of Russia, a country with which the US has had frequent misunderstandings and one of only a few countries able to project significant power worldwide. In particular, it will help us better understand the ways in which Russia's public opinion might constrain or encourage different kinds of behavior in the international arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these puzzles reflects important questions for social science that this study will address. The opportunity to reinterview the very same citizens first interviewed in 2012 will enable us to explore which categories of people are the most likely to join a rallying effect and which are not. While rallying effects have been observed in many countries that engage in international conflict, very few other studies have been able to interview the same people both before and after. This will facilitate understanding more precisely what facilitates such rallying effects. The durability of this rallying effect despite economic crisis will enable us to better understand conditions under which people are willing to sacrifice economic gain for national pride or some other value. Prominent prior studies in many countries (not just Russia) have often found that presidential popularity tracks tightly with economic performance, making it particularly interesting to investigate why this pattern has failed to hold in Russia during at least the year since the Crimea crisis began even though it had held strongly before. The fact that battlefield costs have not dented presidential popularity since the start of the crisis will facilitate a better understanding of how people understand their country's participation in conflict, including what might be important effects from mass media such as state-controlled media or the Internet.</AbstractNarration>
