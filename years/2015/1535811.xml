<AbstractNarration>The public's appetite for detailed weather information is on the rise, but current weather forecasting accuracy is not satisfactory, especially when it comes to predictions for small-scale areas (e.g., neighborhood-, or block-level). Current national radar systems provide weather information updated once every 5 minutes and the quality of the data degrades considerably with increased distance from the radar. Therefore, in case of severe weather, some events might remain unnoticed or the information about them might not be delivered on time. A next generation, short-range weather radar developed at UMass Amherst promises higher temporal and spatial resolution as well as a reliable, low-cost operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new class of compact weather radar developed by this team promises much higher data resolution and can be deployed on rooftops, communications towers, and other infrastructure elements, without expensive structure modifications. The low-weight of the system allows for a 2 person installation without the usage of a crane or helicopter further reducing the overall cost. The radar radiates a peak power on the order of 100W, rather than in the range of 250-500kW - a standard for current operational weather radars. Therefore the proposed sensing system does not pose any radiation hazard. Due to its short-range nature of operation, observation of the weather close to the ground, which directly affects local communities, is possible. With the proposed technology, up-to-the-second radar information will be transmitted to individuals and organizations that make critical decisions about the weather.</AbstractNarration>

Interviews were performed with entities from the following sectors:  -        Government institutions (National Weather Service (NWS), Department of Transportation (DOT), Emergency Management Agency)  -        Aviation sector (major airlines, major and local airports, pilots)  -        Outdoor event organizers (MLB, PGA Tour, Formula 1)  -        Data resellers (Weather Analytics, Ubimet, Verisk Climate, WSI)  -        TV stations (Weather Channel, CNN, ABC, NBC, etc)  -        Off-shore sector (Philips Conoco)  -        Environmental measurement sector (Vaisala, Schneider Electric, EWR)  We started our interview with institutions from the government sector, since the are natural adopters of our weather technology.

We experienced a similar situation in our interviews with data resellers. They expressed their interest in high-resolution, high-quality weather data. Unfortunately, they are used to the fact that currently weather data is provided for free by the NWS and are not willing to pay for more improved data.  The off-shore sector was moderately interested in low-cost weather radar technology due to the fact that a significant part of their business is taking place in an area not covered by ground based radars. However, the operation in remote areas requires a highly reliable system, which can...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
