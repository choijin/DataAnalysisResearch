<AbstractNarration>This award generally aims to integrate high-precision age-dated 5,000 year-old speleothems with isotopic and chemical data from various environmental proxies in the southwestern United States.  This study will focus on climate modulators that impact regional hydrologic cycles on differing time-scales.  These modulators include the inter-annual varying El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the decadal and multi-decadal Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO), and solar variability which may act across varied time-scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This region was chosen for the study because it has well-documented hydrologic sensitivity to climate forcing and modulation.  The western United States has a long history of climate induced social disruption, dating back to pre-history. Understanding these natural changes will help contribute to a possible predictive capability of future changes in the hydrologic cycle.  Such a predictive capability would be a societal benefit to the United States in that it could result in better resource planning and management. A further benefit of the project is the support of a graduate student at a minority serving university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speleothems from regional caves provide an opportunity to observe possible changes in the modalities of these climate modulators over the long term and have demonstrated their fidelity to isotopic, chemical and physical climate proxies that are radiometrically datable using advances in uranium-series based chronometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will specifically collect and evaluate data from two sites with different seasonal hydrologic cycles with the aim of isolating the seasonal component of observed changes and the responsible climate variables. For example, the North American Monsoon (NAM) is modulated by changes in the AMO. This seasonal delineation is important because it could help solve the puzzle of the change in coherence between the NAM and other recently documented Northern Hemisphere monsoons.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The specific objectives of the project were: 1) Obtain speleothem samples that covering the Middle to Late Holocene, 2) obtain high resolution stable isotopic data, 3) do trace element and Sr isotopic analyses on select samples, 4) compile our growth thickness data, where annual banding is resolvable.   The specific scientific objectives were:  1.What lead to the Late Holocene "greening" of the SW, although the monsoons elsewhere weakened?  2) What were the seasonal deficits that lead to the megadroughts.  Were the seasonal moisture patterns similar for all the megadroughts or were there differences among them.  If there were differences, why?     Working hypothesis: Most, if not all of the droughts, were either summer droughts like the 1930s (Dust Bawl) drought or combined summer and winter, like the 1950s drought.  3) What lead to the change in the relationship between the SW US and the Asian monsoon?  Hypothesis: the change reflects hemispherical scale changes likely related to Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.  The correlation between drought and Northern Hemisphere temperature and North Atlantic SST data (Asmerom et al., 2013) give impetus for testing this idea.  4) Was solar modulation of SW climate mostly associated with Pacific-sources climate modulators (PDO-ENSO) or was it also responsible for changes in the North American Monsoon?     We can now say we have specific answers for three of our four scientific objectives and continuing our analysis to address the fourth scientific objective.  1) On the question of "what lead to the Late Holocene "greening" of the SW" our working hypotheses were:   A) Strengthening of the El Nino phase of ENSO lead to increase in winter precipitation, B) An alternative hypothesis is that, in an evaporative setting like the SW, insolation-driven Late Holocene cooling increased the effective moisture of the region.  It turns out neither of our hypotheses held up as is.  Comparing our data from the winter-sensitive southern Great Basin and North American monsoon dominated southern SW, neither winter moisture nor cooler climate can explain the greening of the SW during the Late Holocene.  In fact, we found that the two regions have a negative correlation during this period.  The role of temperature is more nuanced: cooler overall temperature during the Late Holocene increased effective (precipitation-evaporation), but does not explain the decadal and longer time-scale pluvials and droughts.  But another aspect of temperature better explains these major features of SW climate:  changes in Northern Hemisphere temperature modulates the strength and position of the Atlantic sub-tropical high, the Bermuda High in our case (Asmerom et al. 2019).   2) With respect to the cause of megadroughts, here again, most megadroughts in the SW seem to be summer, North American monsoon driven, droughts.  Consistent with modern observation, NH warming leads to intensification and westward migration of the Bermuda High and vice-versa (Asmerom et al., 2019;). In fact, the driest interval in the SW during the Common Era is during the Little Ice Age (Asmerom et al., 2013).   In contrast, the Little Ice Age in our winter dominated study area in the southern Great Basin was unusually wet.           3) What led to the change in the relationship between the SW US and the Asian monsoon?  Our new data added to data from our study of the last glacial in the SW show that the anti-phasing of the SW apparent moisture and Asian monsoon is true at millennial time-scale.   This change is modulated by the meridional shifts in the position of the polar jet stream (Asmerom et al., 2010).  At shorter time-scales, on the other hand, the SW US precipitation and the Asian monsoon co-vary similarly, although the mechanisms may be different; changes in the strength and position of the ITCZ in the case of the Asian monsoon and the strength and position of the Sub-tropical Atlantic high for the North American monsoon.  We are preparing a manuscript to present this work.  4. We have established a relationship between solar variability and precipitation in the SW US.   We are trying to gain a mechanistic understanding.   It is not clear whether the relationship (typically at about r ~0.3) is an issue of coincidence or there is a causal connection.
