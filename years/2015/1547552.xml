<AbstractNarration>This award is to provide 20 need-based student travel grants to the International Conference on Mobile Ad hoc and Sensor Systems (IEEE MASS), in Dallas, Texas, Oct 19-22, 2015.  Travel grants for the conference and also to support pre-conference workshops will be offered to interested young researches in the field of wireless, mobile, and sensing technology and systems, who otherwise would not have the opportunity to attend.  The conference traditionally brings together researchers in the broad field of wireless, mobile and sensor systems including distributed signal processing, cyber-physical applications, networked services, architectural considerations, sensing systems, network middleware, platform design, and system resource management to facilitate intellectual exchange and expose students to first-class research in these areas.</AbstractNarration>
