<AbstractNarration>Understanding the outcomes associated with R&amp;D funding requires accurate linking of funding with the papers produced by the funded work. This proposal develops a methodology to accurately link grants with topics, an important challenge for the development of a rigorous, quantitative understanding and analysis of science policy. The research will provide methods to accurately and consistently identify coherent research areas and systematically link those topic areas to research funding and research output, such as scientific publications, using text and other features. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to accurately link grants and topics in a consistent way would be an important advance in the usefulness of STAR METRICS data. In addition to developing a methodology, this project also establishes the accuracy of existing NIH grant-to-article linkage data, and develop grant-to-article linkage data for non-NIH grants -- data which are not readily available. More accurate grant-article and grant-topic linkages will facilitate other research and be important to the STAR METRICS platform.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This EAGER proposal was aimed at taking a major step forward in evaluating the impact of federal investments. We proposed to developan accurate process for linking grants to topics using metadata available in the STAR METRICS&reg; repository. Accurate grant-to-topic assignments are necessary in order to show how science funding affects outcomes.  Our assumptions were the following: 1) Topics are best represented as clusters of papers in our model of science. 2) STAR METRICS data (and data from similar databases) are the best available sources of data that can be used to link grants to topics. 3) Text (titles and abstracts) will be the basis for accurate assignment of grants to topics. 4) Once grants are accurately assigned to topics using text, this could be used as the basis to test the accuracy of acknowledged grant-to-article linkages (from NIH RePORTER or other sources).  One significant change occurred early in the project. We were able to obtain references for ~150 R01 grant proposals for which we already had the STAR METRICS project data. This was unanticipated at the time our proposal was written, but was very beneficial to the project because it allowed us to compare grant to topic assignments using proposal references, project text from STAR METRICS data, and articles that acknowledge grants (grant-to-article linkages).   Outcomes  1. The accuracy of using text-based methods to link grants to topics has been quantified. a) Our text-based method for linking grants to topics is sufficiently accurate to conduct large scale studies (i.e. assigning funding to topics to evaluate large scale effects) based on aggregated data. b) However, our text-based method for linking grants to topics is not sufficiently accurate to use as a basis for testing the accuracy of grant-to-article linkages. c) Rather, we found that grant-to-article linkages are a more accurate way of assigning grants to topics than is our text-based method. This runs directly counter to our third assumption above.  2. Attempts to improve the accuracy of assigning projects to topics using text by excluding æbroader impactsÆ text were unsuccessful. Broader impacts text, rather than diluting the signal, actually contributes positively to the textual accuracy.  3. The unexpected availability of grant proposal reference data was a game-changer. a) We had previously found that papers can be assigned to topics more accurately using their references than using their title and abstract. In this project we showed that the distribution of proposal references to topics is nearly identical to the distribution of paper references to topics. Thus, we made the assumption that the most accurate way to link grants to topics is using the references from grant proposals. b) By comparing to proposal reference data, we showed that grant-to-article linkages are nearly as accurate as references for assigning grants to topics. c) We showed that textual data are the least accurate method (although still often good) for assigning grants to topics. d) These results are being written up for publication.e. We note that grant reference data are rarely available. In our opinion, the best path forward is to obtain grant reference data.   4. The availability of grant reference data had an important spillover effect. We learned that proposal references, in addition to being an accurate way of assigning grants to topics, provide an early indicator of the intention to do either traditional or innovative work. a) Building on a recent paper by Foster, Rzhetsky &amp; Evans (2015), we used the idea that a proposal is a statement of intentions. A proposal is (intended to be) innovative if it builds upon two topics that, at the time, are not yet linked in the literature. This is detected by assigning the proposal references to topics. Articles, however, make claims. A claimed innovation is detected in the same manner &ndash; the references in the article are assigned to topics, and the claim is innova...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
