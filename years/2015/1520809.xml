<AbstractNarration>This award will support an NSF CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop to introduce junior faculty to the NSF CAREER program, and assist in successful strategies for proposal preparation. The NSF CAREER program serves a critical role in the National Science Foundation's efforts to identify, foster and support the nation's most promising junior faculty in both research and education. Professionals just starting their careers often have limited experience with grant writing and evaluation and quite often no interaction with the program directors at NSF. This workshop brings young faculty members to Arlington, VA and provides a robust series of opportunities to improve in proposal writing, focused and strategic interactions with NSF program directors from across CISE and recent CISE CAREER awardees. The major features of the workshop include presentations on proposal writing, experience sharing, mock panels, and a proposal clinic. A limited number of participants will receive travel support to encourage participation from HBCU/MEI faculty to attend this workshop.</AbstractNarration>

The 2015 CAREER Workshop for NSF Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) was very successful.  The 1-day event was held on March 16, 2015 in Arlington, VA, at the Hilton Arlington, near the National Science Foundation. The day after the workshop, March 17, 2015, offered an opportunity for the junior faculty members to have a one-on-one conversation with NSF CISE Program Directors from their primary research programs.  More than 200 junior faculty members in CISE-related disciplines who came from 150 universities in more than 40 states across the nation attended the workshop. Travel fellowships were provided to dozens of minority and under-represented faculty, which allowed them to travel to DC and attend the workshop in person. At the workshop NSF program directors from CISE introduced the NSF CAREER program to young researchers, and helped them to prepare their CAREER proposals to the CISE programs. A YouTube channel was established to broadcast the event online for many who participated remotely. A website was also maintained for the workshop.
