<AbstractNarration>The need for a programming-savvy workforce, the challenges encountered nation-wide in teaching programming skills, and the advent of massively open online courses (MOOCs) all stress the importance of revolutionizing existing technologies meant to support learning via unsupervised practice. The reliance on hand-designed learning experiences in Intelligent Tutoring Systems has created a bottleneck in the enhancement of such technologies. The significance and importance of this project will be the creation of a system that automatically provides programming practice problems via a tutoring system.  Parsons puzzles, which are the focus of this work, have already demonstrated improvement in programming skills.  This project will continue research on the effectiveness of Parsons puzzles and determine whether an evolutionary algorithm approach to creating Parsons puzzles is effective in producing the same or better learning outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this end, this project will achieve two complementary goals. First, Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms will be used to autonomously design Parsons puzzles. These relatively new practice problems have already shown great promise in supporting the development of programming skills. By integrating Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development theory in the design of our fitness function, the pedagogical soundness of the evolved Parsons puzzles will be further enhanced. Second, recent breakthroughs in Co-evolutionary Algorithms will be leveraged to data-mine the underlying learners-problems interaction space. This will permit autonomous extraction of insights about the most informational interactions. Such information has the potential to provide new perspectives on the significance of both evolved and hand-designed Parsons puzzles, along with the order in which to guide students through these puzzles to ensure proper scaffolding. Quantitative and objective measures of differences in mean difficulty and number of attempts to solution will be used in comparing hand-designed Parsons puzzles and evolutionary algorithm created Pasons puzzles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This work established the foundations for a research agenda in Coevolutionary-Aided Teaching systems. Such systems aims at leveraging evolutionary and coevolutionary principles to enable software to automatically design practice problems for learners. In our specific case, we chose to focus on Parsons puzzles, a relatively recent and promising type of practice problem for novice programmers.  The first outcome was to implement an intelligent tutoring system allowing students to work with hand-designed Parsons puzzles; http://epplets.org/. The second outcome was to implement a software able to evolve Parsons puzzles and feed them to a front end service. Initially, epplets.org was used to that end for the Mark I release of the EvoParsons software. Mark II release provided a new and more modern user interface able to work as a web application on both desktop and mobiles.Mark III added features allowing the collected data to be completely anonymous, thus facilitating the collection and sharing of data. The third outcome was to apply coevolutionary dimension extraction techniques to the task of data mining student vs. practice problems interactions. This was successfully applied to both problets, epplets and EvoParsons interaction logs.   The research developed with respect to the 2nd outcome of this project allowed our team to establish the feasibility of actually applying evolutionary computation techniques to the task of designing pedagogically-relevant practice problems for learners. The coevolutionary dimension extraction techniques helps us provide an objective metric to measure the quality of our candidate solutions and thus enable the automation of their design.
