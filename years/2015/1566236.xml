<AbstractNarration>Multi-dimensional modeling has enabled and is enabling breakthroughs in many research fields such as science, engineering and art, and is constantly producing high dimensional data that requires analyzing, mining and visualization. The size of the data is often big as the fine resolution of the modeling warrants accuracy in the theories developed. The stress and strain tensors in fluid and solid mechanics, the diffusion tensor in medical imaging, the curvature tensor in shape modeling, and the deformation gradient tensor in earthquake engineering are just a few examples. These tensors appear in the form of data arrays, and having the capability of visualizing the topological structures and their dynamics can potentially empower domain scientists with new insights and possibly new fundamental understandings of the physical and biological phenomena. In addition to sharing the knowledge and tools created through this research among scientific communities, the investigator will incorporate the work into teaching materials for undergraduate and graduate students and into summer programs for K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the complexity and extensiveness of the data, any visualization has to be mindful of occlusion and cluttering.  In particular, this project will investigate theories and algorithms that support topology-driven, multi-scale visualization of three-dimensional, second-order tensor fields. One focus will be on the smooth transition of these tensor quantities from one scale to another to ensure consistency in the topological structures and preservation of topological features. The other focus is on defining all possible topologies and developing visualization algorithms that represent the dynamics of the field topology at one scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award aimed to build a multi-scale analysis and  visualization framework for tensor fields, a mathematical concept that  has found many applications in science and engineering.  Tensor fields  are challenging to understand.  With the visualization, mathematical  properties of these fields are shown and analyzed.  The multi-scale  approach can help the users visualize these properties at different  scales.    Through the research project, we have  advanced the state-of-the-art analysis and visualization of tensor  fields, including novel topological analysis of 3D symmetric tensor  fields often seen in solid mechanics and material science, a multi-scale  topology-driven framework for asymmetric tensor fields on surfaces with  applications in fluid dynamics, and visualization system for branched  covering spaces, an advanced mathematical concept.  The aforementioned  research projects have resulted in three publications and presentations  at the top venue of visualization research.   In  addition, we have engaged researchers with expertise in fluid dynamics  and solid mechanics.  The visualization has helped them verify some  observations obtained from their simulation and measurement data sets.   Furthermore, our visualization system for branched covering spaces is  available for the public.  The award has been used to  fund graduate and undergraduate research projects. Two Ph.D. students  have been trained to develop the visualization systems and to understand  the theoretical concepts.  Also, undergraduate students and high school  interns have been invited to participate in some components of the  research.  The research has also helped them become further interested  in data visualization.          Last Modified: 06/30/2020       Submitted by: Yue Zhang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
