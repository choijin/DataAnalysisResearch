<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to undertake data analysis for the NSF-sponsored ACTpol and AdvACTpol experiments.  These experiments are seeking to better understand the thermal radiation (known as the cosmic microwave background, or CMB) left over from the time of recombination in Big Bang cosmology. The ACT is the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, a 6m-diameter millimeter wavelength telescope located at 17,000 ft elevation in northern Chile. Broader impacts of the work include mentoring of female undergraduates, and research training of graduate students and a postdoc.  The awardee will also visit elementary schools and museums to lead astronomy education activities as part of the Project ASTRO program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will focus on CMB science including inflation and lensing B modes, and CMB weak lensing. The former informs our knowledge of cosmic inflation during the big bang, and the latter can provide information on the mass of neutrinos.  Millimeter sky simulations with polarization will also be created.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research enabled by this award pushed the boundaries of knowledge in terms of cosmological parameters obtained from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and led to novel uses of the gravitational lensing of the CMB to probe fundamental physics. In total, this award enabled the publication of over 30 papers, which were co-authored by the PI and her group.  Of these publications, 20 used data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).     Specifically, the PI's group pioneered techniques of CMB de-lensing, which is needed to measure primordial gravitational waves from inflation.  The PI's group also put constraints on the mass of the neutrinos using a measurement of the ACT CMB lensing power spectrum.  In addition, the PI's group made the first measurement of the ratio of CMB and galaxy lensing, when both CMB and galaxy sources are lensed by the same foreground objects. This enabled novel constraints on dark energy and the curvature of the Universe.     Other achievements of this award are that the PI developed a novel technique to use high-resolution CMB lensing measurements to probe the properties of dark matter.  This in turn led the PI to develop the concept of CMB-HD, a next generation CMB experiment.     The PI also engaged in outreach activities via a) teaching elementary school children about astronomy as part of the Project Astro program, b) giving many public talks about her research, and c) participating in STEM outreach events geared towards retaining women in science. For example, the PI participated in many discussion groups as part of the Stony Brook Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program, discussing careers in science and her own experiences.  The PI also led educational astronomy activities and question-and answer sessions with elementary school classes as part of the Project Astro program. These activities broadened the astronomy and science experiences of these children, and aimed to bring the wonder of science into their everyday classrooms.
