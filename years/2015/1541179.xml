<AbstractNarration>In July 2014, the National Telecommunication Information Administration (NTIA) and the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Office of Engineering and Technology (OET) issued a Joint Public Notice (PN) to seek public comment on the creation of an urban test city to support rapid experimentation and development of policies, underlying technologies, and system capabilities for advanced, dynamic spectrum sharing by wireless devices. Based on the responses received from this comments process, the FCC and NTIA are seeking inputs to support the development of a framework for the model test city. The framework for the Model City would include consideration of several aspects including, technical, collaborative, funding and governance aspects. The FCC is sponsoring a workshop on April 15-16, 2015, to facilitate this process. The workshop aims to bring together a group of 100 experts in the field from a variety of sectors and backgrounds, including from government, industry and academia, at the local, state, national and even international levels. This project will support the travel of 20 attendees from academia and 10 from the public safety sector who would otherwise be unable to attend. Travel support will be used to promote participation of attendees who can contribute to the sharing of ideas between academia and industry and federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this workshop will develop a strategic plan for new approaches that will allow commercial interests to share currently underutilized bandwidth without jeopardizing functionality and safety in emergency situations. The workshop will also contribute valuable insights to the growing acceptance that wireless spectrum is becoming an integral part of so-called "Critical Infrastructure" and therefore requiring of Critical Infrastructure Protection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In response to a 2014 Joint Public Notice issued by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the Federal Communications Commission?s (FCC) Office of Engineering and Technology (OET), a national workshop was organized for interested stakeholders from industry, government and academia to explore the practical concerns of creating public-private partnerships for urban test cities that would support investigations of the issues and needs surrounding spectrum sharing. The two-day Model City Workshop explored the development of, and alternatives for, concept, scope, governance framework and technical considerations of dynamic spectrum sharing and discussed case studies of similar efforts.  Participants at the Model City Workshop contributed valuable insights regarding wireless spectrum?s growing identification as "critical infrastructure" in a modern society and how to, therefore, provide critical infrastructure protection and regulation. Participants also worked to develop alternative approaches to enable stakeholders to share underutilized spectrum without jeopardizing functionality, security or safety. The input received during the Model City Workshop will be helpful in advancing national policy and rule making.  The workshop was held at FCC Headquarters in Washington, DC on April 15, 2015 and included discussions on the model city concept and scope, state-of-the-art technology, and case studies.  Lighting talks, Q&amp;A sessions, and breakout sessions on governance (management, process, and funding) and technology (testing, training, spectrum, and data handling) were also held. This proposal funded travel and lodging for workshop participants and others without access to sufficient funds to attend the 2015 Model City Workshop.  Funding leftover from the 2015 Model City workshop was used to support the travel of attendees at the 2016 Wireless Spectrum R&amp;D Interagency Working Group (WSRD) VIII workshop, which focused on spectrum sharing enforcement issues and provided a forum for information exchange and the identification of relevant research and development opportunities. WSRD members used information gathered from this workshop to develop recommendations for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.  The input received at the WSRD workshop from government, academic, and private sector stakeholders led to the following recommendations for research investment in four categories: 1) Information gathering, 2) Measurement and Sensing, 3) Identification, forensics, and adjudication, and 4) Policy.  Details on the agenda and discussions held at the 2015 Model City Workshop can be found at https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/events/2015/04/fcc-and-ntia-announce-workshop-on-model-city-program.
