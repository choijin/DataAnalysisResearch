<AbstractNarration>The Educating the Next Generation of Geoscientists (ENGAGE) project is providing opportunities for members of underrepresented groups, primarily Hispanic, to experience the geosciences in formal and informal settings via classroom, lecture, workshop, and field experiences.  This collaboration between San Jose State University, San Francisco State University, and the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, is developing approaches that make use of the social and cultural values ethnic groups to support motivation, learning, and student confidence in their own abilities.  Strategies to overcome academic, socio-cultural, and economic obstacles include guest lectures and workshops, family science nights, integration of laboratory and field research experiences in the undergraduate curriculum, paid summer internships and scholarships, and strengthening of pathways between lower level undergraduate programs in area community colleges and the upper level geoscience majors program at SJSU.  These combined efforts serve the important goals of increasing the diversity of students pursuing and achieving undergraduate degrees in the geosciences and increasing Earth System Science literacy among communities that are underrepresented in the STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

These experiences were designed to support the social and cultural values of diverse ethnic groups while raising student confidence in their own abilities to pursue science. After the ENGAGE project grant transferred from San Jose State University to San Francisco State University in 2015, ENGAGE goals were best achieved by expanding two existing programs at San Francisco State: (1) the METALS (Minority Education Through Traveling and Learning in the Sciences) program for urban high school students and the Climate Change Scholars program for SF State undergraduate students in the College of Science and Engineering.  Working together with METALS program partners at the University of Texas at El Paso and the University of New Orleans, fifteen high school students from the SF Bay Area, New Orleans, and El Paso were recruited to participate in a ten-day field experience in the summer of 2015 to dinosaur fossil sites in Montana. The trip was a valuable introduction to paleontology in a field context and, guided by scientists from the University of California Museum of Paleontology, the high school student participants met leading researchers from the Museum of the Rockies, the Beatrice Taylor Paleontological Field Research Station at Egg Mountain, and the Redding Field Station in Rudyard, Montana.  Geosciences faculty mentors and other STEM professionals, graduate and undergraduate students, joined the paleontological experts who, collectively, created a supportive learning environment that served to motivate students towards geoscience careers while fostering curiosity about Earth science in field settings.  The Climate Change Scholars project at San Francisco State University also benefitted from ENGAGE program support and successfully provided opportunities for College of Science and Engineering students to gain valuable research experience in labs that study climate change.  During the fall 2015 semester, scholarships were awarded to ten SF State undergraduate students from six different majors (Meteorology, Geology, Geography, Environmental Studies, Biology, and Engineering).  The Scholars met twice monthly during the semester and participated in seminars and workshops including GRE and graduate school preparation, resume building, and career training. Under the guidance and direction of supervising faculty, students presented posters at a university project showcase under the following titles, Refrigeration Systems and Climate Change; The Health of Vulnerable Communities and Climate Change; Health, Climate Change, and Environmental Injustice in West Oakland; Coastal Community Vulnerability: A Project Design on the Effects of Reciprocity on Resilience and Adaptability; Climate Change and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta; Statistical Evaluation of High-resolution Precipitation Forecasts in the Bay Area and California; Effects of Vegetation on an Urban Heat Island; and The Effect of Climate Change on the Distribution of the Lyme Disease Vector.  Activities taking place under the ENGAGE umbrella of programs incorporated best practices in geoscience education, including hands-on learning experiences, exposure to authentic geoscience data and research, engagement in actual and virtual field experiences, peer-to-peer mentoring, and career guidance from professional scientists.  In summary, outcomes of project ENGAGE resulted in the direct sharing of resources and information to underrepresented students in the geosciences and the removal of many academic and sociocultural obstacles that have traditionally hindered greater diversity in the geosciences.
