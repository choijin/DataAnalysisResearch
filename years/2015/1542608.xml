<AbstractNarration>The Siple Transmitter Experiment, operated in Antarctica from 1973 to 1988 under sponsorship from the National Science Foundation, provided scientific researchers with a heretofore unmatched opportunity to perform controlled experiments to study nonlinear wave-particle interactions. Very low frequency waves radiated by the transmitter at the Antarctic Siple Station propagated into the Earth?s magnetosphere where they interacted with the energetic electrons in the Radiation Belts. This interaction modified the waves, amplifying them and generating new rising and falling frequency components.  The modified waves were observed with radio receivers on the ground at the Northern Hemisphere conjugate points of the same geomagnetic field line.  These "triggered" waves bear similarities to naturally occurring "chorus" type waves that are a major driver of space weather processes. The data were recorded and later digitized under the Air Force Research Laboratory data-preservation award. Analyzing this legacy dataset with modern techniques and comparing observations to the latest numerical models will help resolve outstanding issues in space weather research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whistler-mode waves are the electromagnetic waves with frequency of about 100 Hz-30 kHz, observed in Earth?s magnetosphere, and they are one of the major factors significantly affecting the energetic electrons population in the Earth's Radiation Belts. Despite many decades of active research, important questions on the whistler waves interaction with energetic electrons in the Radiation Belts still remain unanswered, which does not allow us to predict reliably the intensity of energetic electron fluxes in the Radiation Belts. These fluxes of energetic particles may significantly affect spacecraft in the geostationary and low orbits, astronauts in the space station, as well space-based scientific, military, and communication satellites. This project will study previously accumulated collection of data from the Siple Transmitter Experiment. Statistical analysis of these data in combination with numerical simulations will be used to characterize the dynamics of nonlinear interactions of whistler waves with energetic particles, focusing on the wave growth and generation of newly triggered emissions. This data analysis will guide advanced numerical simulations of the wave-particle interactions in order to understand fundamental physical processes involved, such as generation of naturally occurring plasma waves called "chorus" and "hiss" and also electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. This research project will enhance infrastructure for research and education through a strong collaboration between two academic institutions and contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a collaboration between Stanford University and University of Colorado Denver (CU Denver).  The goals of the project were to better understand a key process in space weather using legacy observations made in Antarctica in the 1970s and 1980s and new simulations techniques.  Space weather is the state of the near-Earth space environment and can affect a multitude of communication and even power grid technologies.  The specific process we were studying was whistler mode waves and how they naturally are naturally generated and grow in amplitude.  Whistler mode waves are a type of low frequency radio wave are among the most powerful waves in the near-Earth space environment.   In 1970s and 1980s a unique experiment was performed in Siple Station, Antarctica with a very powerful low frequency radio transmitter that could create whistler mode waves strong enough to locally modify the near-Earth environment.  Such an experiment has never been repeated so the data from this experiment contain unique and valuable observations.  At the same time, both data analysis techniques and computer simulations have greatly advanced since the 1980s so it was worthwhile to revisit the data with new techniques and develop new models to simulate it.  Further preserving the Siple Station data and making it available to the international research community was also an objective.  Renewed data analysis of the Siple Station observations allowed for a unique wave signature termed "magnetospheric sidebands" to be analyzed more thoroughly than before.  We were able to resolve not only the amplitude but also the phase of this signature.  This analysis confirmed several outstanding theoretical formulations that were previously in contention.   A new approach to simulating the growth whistler mode waves in the nonlinear regime was developed.  Unlike previous approaches, the new model solves the problem backward in time which reduces uncertainty and provides higher resolution of the underlying physics.  This model shed light on the initial frequency change that is observed when whistler mode waves are launched into space from the ground and begin to interact with energetic electrons.  A key broader impact for the scientific community has been the setup of the Worldwide Archive of Low-frequency Data and Observations (WALDO)  (http://waldo.world/) which provides open access to low frequency radio data from the Siple Station experiments and many other locations.  The WALDO database has been a collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology and will be a living repository.  Researchers will continue to add data from ongoing observations made by Georgia Tech and CU Denver.   This award supported the education and training of several undergraduate and graduate students in the Department of Electrical Engineering at CU Denver.  One PhD thesis was written and defended by Dr. Poorya Hosseini from funding under this award.  Dr. Hosseini’s plans to continue to contribute to space science as a skilled researcher. The close collaboration between CU Denver and Stanford University allowed for the cross pollination of experiences and ideas between a world elite institution and Colorado’s only urban research university.
