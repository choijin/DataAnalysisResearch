<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Delaware State University (DSU) seeks to create the Cyber Infused Mathematics Initiative (CIMI) to establish inverted classes for introductory mathematics courses using a student-centered approach that blends online mastery learning and in-class inquiry-based instruction within a scientific problem solving context. Currently, 89% of freshmen students at DSU place into a non-credit, developmental mathematics course. Not being able to take the introductory mathematics and other gatekeeper courses reduces student persistence and retention. The main goal of the CIMI is to improve retention of STEM students, particularly between the freshman and sophomore year by creating a supportive culture of active learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to transform mathematics instruction at DSU to improve students' learning outcomes and engagement with STEM topics; to increase the passing rate of STEM freshman enrolled in College Algebra; to increase the number of students retained in STEM majors from the freshman to sophomore year; to increase the number of students who graduate in STEM majors; and  to develop a cadre of interdisciplinary faculty committed to implementing best practices in the teaching of introductory mathematics.  Mathematics and science faculty will collaborate first to revise the College Algebra course which serves the majority of entering STEM freshman. They will then adapt the approach to Trigonometry and Calculus I, the mathematics courses STEM students take after completing College Algebra. This project will produce an empirically based model that bridges the gap in student preparation between developmental and college-level mathematics coursework, as well as link professional development with changes in instructional practices and students' mathematical practices at the college level. The project will examine undergraduate students' mathematics learning and achievement in the context of a historically black university, where 81% of the undergraduate students are from racial and ethnic groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM. The project is guided by an on-going evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Delaware State University (DSU) Cyber Infused Mathematics Initiative (CIMI) was funded by the National Science Foundation Targeted Infusion in September 2015.  It was a 3-year program with 2 no-cost extensions.  CIMI was designed for two reasons.  First, CIMI was designed to build a partnership with mathematics faculty and their colleagues in science and technology to reengineer our introductory mathematics courses (College Algebra, Trigonometry, and Calculus I) by designing problem-based learning (PBL) activities.  The PBLs were designed as mathematics problem-solving activities embedded in scientific stories that are encountered in their Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses or by STEM professionals in the real world. Second, CIMI was designed to improve students’ performance in their mathematics classes and persistence in their chosen STEM major.  The mathematics was embedded in a scientific PBL story to encourage student persistence and engagement in the problem-solving process.   As students engaged in the process of solving the PBLs, it would reveal the usefulness and relevance of learning specific mathematics topics in their scientific field of study.   During each summer of the project, mathematics and science participated in the Mathematics Teaching Institute (MTI), a multi-day (3-5) professional development workshop.  Teachers received training on research recommended effective teaching practices, using technology in the classroom, and designing PBLs. The goal of MTI was to establish a more consistent approach to student-centered instruction emphasizing the eight Mathematical Practices as defined by the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) and the integration of scientific inquiry.  Although faculty participate in professional development on a regular basis, MTI was the first mathematics teaching workshop that specifically addressed courses offered at DSU.  During the school year, mathematics faculty continued to participate in Professional Learning Communities (PLC), where they discussed course content, best practices for a student-centered learning environment, best practices for implementing PBL activities as in-class group assignments, and conducted data analysis of student performance on select mathematics learning goals.  Each year, faculty developed a better understanding of the difference between a word problem and a PBL activity and improved on the design of the PBL activities they created. Based on surveys and interviews, faculty enjoyed the workshops and believed the lessons helped them to become a more effective teacher.  Another CIMI goal was to teach the three mathematics courses using an inverted classroom approach with the use of PBL activities.  In the inverted classrooms model, students learn the course content through self-paced, online learning modules. Then, in-class time would focus on student-centered learning with the use of PBL activities to develop students’ mathematical proficiency across all five strands - understanding, computing, applying, reasoning, and engaging.  However, the inverted classroom conversion was not fully realized as it proved to be challenging to design enough PBLs to cover the entire course content for each of the three courses.   Over the 4-years of PBL implementation, 84 sections of College Algebra, 24 section of Trigonometry, and 4 sections of Calculus I included PBL experiences.  Each semester College Algebra and Trigonometry students engaged in 3-5 PBLs as in-class group activities.  Calculus implemented 2-3 PBLs, but as take-home group projects.  In general, course pass rates fluctuated but remained similar throughout the life of the CIMI. However, positive results are more visible when examining overall final exam scores, and scores of PBL related questions on the final exam. College Algebra students scored significantly higher on their final exams in 4 out of 9 semesters of PBL implementation. This mostly occurred during the Fall semester where the courses included mostly incoming freshmen.  Trigonometry students scored significantly higher on their cumulative final exams in the last 2 out of 5 semesters of PBL implementation. Calculus I students scored significantly higher on their cumulative final exams in the 2 semesters of PBL implementation. Further examination shows that the higher final exam scores are associated with improved performance on some PBL related exam questions for each course. There was also a Calculus I section that implemented 3 non-PBL projects, which also lead to significantly higher scores on the cumulative final exam.  Mathematics instruction at DSU has been transformed to include more engaging inquiry-based approaches with positive student outcomes and the development of a learning community within the faculty.  Non-credit bearing math classes are no longer offered at the University, and there has been an increase of over 200% in the number of STEM graduates.  The results indicate that PBL activities have a positive impact on student learning. Based on the results from Calculus I, it also appears that implementing at least 3 PBL projects of any kind will also improve student learning. Although further data is needed, if PBLs (or any project) are implemented well and frequently, then students will most likely improve on their performance and understanding of mathematics content.
