<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) seeks to provide new learning experiences in biomedical engineering to undergraduate students. The recruitment efforts include reaching out to high school students and students from community colleges to get them interested in the field of biomedical engineering. This project will ultimately diversify and contribute to the biomedical engineering workforce aimed at solving medical related problems through engineering techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to enhance the existing academic infrastructure at UDC by developing four new courses in biomedical engineering and integrating them into existing engineering curricula; by preparing prospective students at area community colleges towards the pursuit of a BS degree in biomedical engineering; and by educating high school students, undergraduate students, and faculty in current trends and research in biomedical engineering.  The activities and strategies are evidence-based and the project is guided by a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biomedical Engineering is a relatively new and distinctive multidisciplinary field that merges concepts in engineering to solve a wide and diverse array of problems tied to human health.   It is pressing that the next generation of biomedical engineers be cultivated to incorporate diverse talent from untapped, underrepresented minority and gender groups.  This National Science Foundation (NSF) project was aimed towards the creation of a new, Biomedical Engineering Program at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC), the nation's only urban land grant institution and a Historically Black College and University (HBCU).    This project facilitated the development of new biomedical engineering curricular activities, and thus, University education infrastructure was improved. New courses were developed including bioinstrumentation, two special topics courses in biomedical engineering (aimed at machine learning and biomedical imaging), analysis of physiological systems, senior design project, biomechanics, and biomedical engineering seminar.  Further, UDC undergraduate students were exposed to contemporary issues in biomedical engineering via frequently-held guest speaker seminars featuring professionals and researchers from a vast array of institutes, hospitals, and universities.  This project led to University infrastructure improvements within a newly-created research laboratory (the Center for Biomechanical &amp; Rehabilitation Engineering (CBRE)) aimed at training undergraduate students to investigate problems tied to human mobility.  The project also incorporated outreach to high school students and students from community colleges to spark their interest in the field of biomedical engineering via yearly, 2-week Summer Workshops held at the University.   Our overarching goal to contribute to a diverse biomedical engineering workforce, aimed at solving medical-related problems via engineering techniques, was achieved.  Currently, UDC is a distinctive environment for biomedical engineering education and research in that is only one of three HBCUs to offer a Bachelor of Science degree program in Biomedical Engineering nationwide; further, the Program's first ABET accreditation visit will be Fall 2020.
