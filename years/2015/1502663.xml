<AbstractNarration>Microscopic fungi (microfungi) represent a diverse assemblage that is distributed worldwide and includes bread molds, plant pathogens, powdery mildews, rusts, slime molds, and water molds. A large percentage of these organisms are harmless or even beneficial, but some cause disease and death in animals, plants, and other fungi resulting in major economic loss and serious negative implications for human and ecosystem health. Despite their importance, little is known about their distribution, diversity, ecology, or host associations. This project is a collaborative effort involving 38 institutions in 31 states and aims to consolidate data from specimens housed in biodiversity collections for 2.3 million microfungi specimens and make these data available through online resources. The consolidation and increased accessibility of these data is critical to inform and promote new and innovative research, education and community engagement around this little-known but important group of organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specimen data generated by this project will be used to assess natural and human-induced environmental changes on microfungi distributions, and evaluate the impact of these changes on the function and health of ecosystems. This project fills a critical gap in the national digitization effort by contributing images, digitizing specimen label data, and linking associated ancillary data for over 1.2 million North American specimens of microfungi. Additionally, nomenclature and taxonomic information will be updated to reflect the newest practices as dictated by the International Codes for Nomenclature. These data will provide a foundation for making informed decisions by agribusinesses, educators, forest managers, government agencies, horticulturalists, policy makers, researchers, and the general public. The broader education goals of this project will be facilitated through the development and implementation of a teaching module for high school biology on the economic importance of microfungi. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Microfungi represent a phylogenetically heterogeneous group of fungi and fungal-like organisms that include bread molds, plant pathogens, powdery mildews, rust fungi, slime molds, smut fungi, and water molds. These fungi are of immense biological, economical, and ecological importance, yet are more poorly known than larger organisms such as plants. animals, and mushrooms.     The Microfungi Collections Consortium (MiCC) is a nationwide collaboration that aimed to fill a critical gap in the national specimen digitization effort through the digitization of over 1.2 million North American specimens of microfungi.  The Consortium was a collaborative effort among 38 institutions in 31 states that included a variety of small to large university herbaria, natural history museums, and botanical gardens.  An integrated dataset of microfungi specimens was compiled and is searchable through the MyCoPortal, which also holds the results of the complementary Macrofungi Collections Consortium (MaCC) project.  The combination of MiCC and MaCC has resulted in the digitization of nearly all existing specimen documentation (~4 million records) for North American fungi held by US institutions.   The University of California, Berkeley portion of this project digitized and made publicly accessible online collections of North American microfungi housed at the University &amp; Jepson Herbaria, UC Berkeley, the Robert L. Gilbertson Mycological Herbarium at the University of Arizona, and the Herbarium of the University of Wyoming.  The data relevant to specimens in all our microfungi collections now can be accessed by researchers in diverse biological disciplines such as ecology, systematics, and evolution as well in academic discipliplines beyond biology such as biography, history of science, and geography. Data are now freely available to many users beyond academics as well, including hobbyists who enjoy fungi, students and teachers, land managers, and conservationists.
