<AbstractNarration>Scientific evidence is a critical consideration in the process of creating regulatory policies and laws that promote technological innovation while protecting against unintended adverse consequences. The proposed conference will convene researchers from the social sciences, business and legal worlds, and government regulators to identify how scientific evidence can and should support government regulation and policymaking. The workshop will chart a research course that facilitates science based regulatory approaches to scientific innovation, respecting the importance of differing values within a pluralistic democratic society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one-day workshop focuses on the technical domains of nanoscale materials innovation and commercialization; innovation in healthcare, and; environmental regulation for both ecosystem integrity and human health.  Topics considered include the regulation of emerging technologies; identifying authoritative science for policy and regulatory decisions, and; identifying the appropriate loci of regulatory enforcement in multi-level governance systems.  The excepted outcome is to stimulate joint research in regulatory science and to coordinate efforts of scholars in diverse disciplines with practitioners and policymakers across the United States.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Description  We organized a conference and two follow up workshops that brought together a variety of experts to discuss how best to manage emerging technologies in ways that serve the public interest. Participants at the original conference and subsequent meetings discussed potential risks and benefits presented by emerging technologies such as gene editing and geoengineering and addressed the role of science in shaping policies to govern these efforts.  The Project?s major goals were:  (1) to convene a conference to determine the most pressing issues presented by rapidly emerging technologies whose risks and benefits are not currently well understood;  (2) to write a research paper that summarizes the findings from the conference and identifies the most fruitful avenues for future research; and  (3) to write and submit a grant proposal based on the questions identified at the conference to allow for continued research on this topic.  The conference and follow up workshops were designed to create a setting where people with expertise in different sectors&ndash; such as health care, environment and climate, and energy &ndash; could easily discuss their experiences in developing new technologies, articulate their likely risks and benefits, and assess potential regulatory frameworks designed to limit risk without stifling innovation. This approach was successful and allowed the conference speakers, attendees and the project researchers to consider how to find and disseminate best practices for effectively balancing the need for innovation with the goal of limiting irreversible impacts that might accompany the widespread introduction of new technologies. The conference included one keynote speaker, fifteen panelists and approximately sixty additional participants.  The follow-up meeting consisted of seven panelists and nine additional participants.     Intellectual Merit and Broader Outcomes  As science and engineering advances, there are likely to be new opportunities for better managing the potential benefits and risks of technological innovations. Standards setting, evaluation and approval processes must evolve hand in hand with the new technologies to guard against inequitable distributions of risk and benefit in society. The conference drew attention to the ways in which innovations in science as well as innovations in public decision-making can improve the introduction of rapidly emerging technologies. The resulting work products and scholar network build from insights generated at the conference and continue to seek effective regulatory strategies for managing rapidly emerging and novel technologies.        Specific Outcomes and Accomplishments  1. The conference and two follow up workshops allowed participants and the project researchers to identify core issues relating to governing emerging technologies and creating public benefits from them.  2. The project has led to the creation of several interdisciplinary teams that are following up on the initial presentations and findings from the conference and workshops. One team has received a grant from the National Science Foundation to study how regulatory agencies are managing the testing and commercial introduction of autonomous vehicles and gene editing.  A second group will be leading a panel presentation and discussion at American Political Science Association annual meeting examining how public organizations develop new technical capacity.  3.  Young scholars from UC Berkeley and from other universities (supported by travel scholarships) participated in a multi-sector, multi-disciplinary conversation about the challenges involved in governing emerging technologies with unknown risk. The project has also supported graduate students at UC Berkeley and provided them with mentoring, professional development and training opportunities in areas such as drafting scholarly papers; preparing grant proposals; grants management; organizing, planning and conducting scholarly meetings and working in collaborative, multi-disciplinary research teams.  4.  The project team has written a draft manuscript that focuses on detailing: 1) the main themes and findings that had emerged from the project conference, and 2) opportunities and need for future research in the space of governing emerging technologies. The draft has been critiqued at one of the project workshops and is under revision for ultimate submission to a professional journal for publication.
