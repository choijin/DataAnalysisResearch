<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in one of the world's leading accelerator conferences, the 6th International Particle Accelerator Conference, to be held in Richmond VA May 3-8, 2015. This conference expects over 1300 participants from around the world, including many of the leaders in accelerator science research. There are many presentations in all major topics in accelerator science: linear and circular colliders, photon sources, electron accelerators, alternative sources, hadron accelerators, beam dynamics, instrumentation and controls, and others. In addition the conference will have sessions on technology transfer and accelerator applications applicable to a wide field of industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will be used to support, entirely or in part, approximately 35 students. They will be making presentations which will be made available on the public web page. The students will also participate in broadening representation programs: Teacher's Day Program, Women in Science and the National Society of Hispanic Physicists. This program will be an excellent opportunity for young scientists to gain information and for them to interact with more experienced researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Introduction     The Accelerator Science Program of the National Science Foundation/Directorate for Mathematical &amp; Physical Sciences provided grant funding to support three activities at the Sixth International Particle Accelerator Conference (IPACÆ15): 1) travel stipends for undergraduate and graduate students; 2) a "Women in Science" Symposium; and 3) a workshop for middle- and high-school science teachers.  The conference was held May 3 &ndash; 8, 2015 in Richmond, Virginia and attracted nearly 1,300 scientists, engineers, students, and equipment vendors.      1.      Graduate and Undergraduate Student Participation   NSF funded the participation of graduate and undergraduate students at IPACÆ15, selected through a competitive process.  A total of 29 graduate and undergraduate students from the Americas received travel stipends to participate in IPACÆ15, eighteen of whom received some or all of their travel funding under this NSF grant.  The students supported under this grant are from ten US universities and include four women, one of whom is an undergraduate.   Efforts were made to recruit underserved groups for the IPACÆ15 travel stipends, including the publication of an announcement soliciting applications for the stipends in The Hispanic Physicist, the newsletter of the National Society of Hispanic Physicists.     At past IPACs, accelerator science students from the Americas have participated under funding from the American Physical Society, and this has been at a level significantly lower than for their counterparts from Europe and Asia.  NSFÆs funding for IPACÆ15 was leveraged against travel support provided by APS, Jefferson Science Associates, and Fermi Research Alliance and allowed for participation of students from the Americas at a level that was two to three times that of previous IPACs.    2.      Women-in-Science Symposium   Dr. Patrizia Rossi, Jefferson LabÆs Deputy Associate Director for Physics organized and moderated the Women-in-Science Symposium.  Dr. Rossi has extensive international contacts and enlisted eminent women scientists from North and South America, Europe, and Asia to participate on-site and remotely through video connections.  The symposium consisted of a panel discussion to address the cultural impact on Women in Science and Engineering.  Panelists discussed their personal observations about how diverse cultural backgrounds play a role in encouraging (or discouraging) women to go into scientific careers.  This session included more than 300 attendees, including many of the graduate- and undergraduate-students funded by this grant.  The Symposium was open to all conference registrants.  Non-conference participants were invited, including students and faculty from high schools and universities.  IEEE hosted a reception[1] after the formal program that provided additional opportunities for conference participants and students to ask questions and engage one-on-one in more detailed discussions with the panelists.    The full video of this event can also be watched at this link https://www.jlab.org/conferences/ipac2015/video/BlueJeansRecording.mp4       3.      IPACÆ15 Teacher Symposium    Twenty middle- and high- school teachers participated in the full-day IPACÆ15 Teacher Symposium.  This symposium was organized by Ms. Brita Hampton of Jefferson LabÆs Education Office, which has extensive programs promoting science at the primary, secondary, and undergraduate levels.  Participating teachers were invited to the Symposium through e-mail announcements sent to various Science organizations, participants of the JLab Science Activities for Teachers (JSAT) Program, science teachers, and schools participating in Jefferson Lab education programs, and other teacher networks.      The symposium included two workshops that provided teachers with supplies that could be used for subsequent class demonstrations.  The first workshop provided the teachers with a hand held Van de Graaff generator æwandÆ ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
