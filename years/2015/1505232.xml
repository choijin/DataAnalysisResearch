<AbstractNarration>Frequent school absences, pain, malaise, and disease symptoms put chronically ill children at a scholastic disadvantage and render them an underserved educational population.  Populations affected by these diseases spend many hours in clinic, hospital and doctor office waiting rooms, places generally bereft of any educational materials.  This I-Corps team believes these are significant but unrecognized locales for STEM learning. Waiting time could turn into learning time and problems with compliance could be addressed as children, parents and siblings develop a better understanding of their disease as manifest in the most complex system of all, the human body. In essence, the team proposes creating a model for transforming hospital rooms, doctor's offices and clinics from places where children and their parents wait, to places where they can engage in STEM learning. These are novel settings, informal environments with attentive captive audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to inspire the pediatric patients as well as their siblings to become future researchers, physicians, and engineers who, because of their disease, will develop a true passion for science and math. The proposed BME HeathReach active learning manipulatives and modules can be used and adapted to learners of different ages. BME HealthReach seeks to engage this population, their parents and their siblings by offering innovative science and math learning modules using a child's own disease as the context for learning. Middle school science and math teachers as well, could approach common core standards through the window of disease, often a very compelling entry point.</AbstractNarration>

Chronic illness has been defined as, &ldquo;a disorder with a protracted course that can be fatal or associated with a relatively normal life span despite impaired physical or mental functioning&rdquo; and includes diseases such as asthma, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, and diabetes mellitus.&nbsp; For numerous reasons including disease pathophysiology, adverse effects of treatments, and frequent school absences, chronically ill children are already an <em>underserved</em>, <em>under-represented,</em>and <em>educationally disadvantaged</em> population with regards to education, resulting in academic difficulties and learning problems (Wolfe 1985, Thies 1999, Kaffenberger 2006, and Boonen 2011).&nbsp; We see an opportunity to alleviate this disadvantage by leveraging the child's chronic disease as motivation to learn about STEM topics. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upon completion of the I-corps-L program, based on the relationships built during customer discovery, we have expanded into K-12 schools, specifically 5<sup>th</sup> grade and 7<sup>th</sup> grade science classes Woodland Elementary and the Amana Academy, respectively.</span>&nbsp; HealthReach taught bi-monthly at both schools during the 2015-2106 and 2016-2107 school years.&nbsp; Our educational program, HealthReach, engages K-12 students by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">offering innovative tactile STEM learning modules using human physiology as the context for learning science and math</span>. The objective &nbsp;is to continually teach school aged children about math and science using human physiology and the patient&rsquo;s own experience as the context and source of motivation, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with a goal of creating children inspired and driven to become future researchers, physicians, and engineers with a true passion for science, technology, and math, and therefore making a positive future impact on the nation&rsquo;s workforce.</span></p> <p>The Undergraduate-Teachers follow Georgia Department of Education K-12 educational STEM standards to iteratively design-to-user, develop, and deploy their activities. Additionally, Georgia has adopted the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics, as well as the Next Generation Science Standards and those standards are also incorporated during activity development.&nbsp; Once the Undergraduate-Teachers develop their educational modules/manipulatives, they directly interact with patients at Children&rsquo;s Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA), both in one-on-one and group settings. &nbsp;The program focuses on patients with sickle cell disease and congenital heart disease with the hope that our Undergraduate-Teachers would inspire the pediatric patients to become future researchers, physicians, and engineers who, because of their disease, would develop a true passion for science and math.&nbsp; The interactive learning modules can be adapted to learners of different ages and skill level. As mentioned previously, chronically ill patients are educationally disadvantaged due to their disease, treatments, and school absences, therefore all of our activities have been created with built-in adaptability for different cognitive levels.&nbsp; The Undergraduate-Teachers may have a 10 year old student that is functioning at a 3<sup>rd</sup> grade level, our activities can adapt to that.&nbsp; Conversely, the Undergraduate-Teachers may work with a college bound 16 year-old with a higher level of STEM comprehension. For example, in the <em>Make Your Own Blood</em> module, (Figure 1A) young children can enjoy constructing a jar model of their blood whereas older children, using the same module, can gain a better understanding of more advanced specific STEM topics such as the biology of blood and water homeostasis in the human a body as well calculation of red blood cell circumference and derivation of &pi;. Within this activity, we are specifically achieving standards for 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, and 7<sup>th</sup> grade science, high school biology and 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> grade mathematics. In the <em>Make Your Own Bone</em> module (Figure 1B), the activity focuses on understanding the structure of bone and how the structure relates to bodily functions, following science standards for 5<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> grade and high school biology. &nbsp;12 existing math modules and 12 science modules transform topics such as the respiratory system, blood transfusions, gene expression, and exponential bacteria growth, into engaging and highly contextualized learning STEM opportunities, with new activities being created each semester (Table 1).</p> <p>Since completing the I-Corps-L program, HealthReach has successfully completed 3 semesters in which all parties benefit - the chronically ill children, the K-12-Students, as well as the Undergraduate-Teachers.
