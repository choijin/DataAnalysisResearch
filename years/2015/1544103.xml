<AbstractNarration>The Promoting Research and Innovation in Methodologies for Evaluation (PRIME) program seeks to support research on evaluation with special emphasis on: (1) exploring innovative approaches for determining the impacts and usefulness of STEM education projects and programs; (2) building on and expanding the theoretical foundations for evaluating STEM education and workforce development initiatives, including translating and adapting approaches from other fields; and (3) growing the capacity and infrastructure of the evaluation field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports engineering faculty in their efforts to develop, evaluate, and improve delivery of their courses.  The work is supported by the Course Social and Cognitive Engagement (CSCE) Framework.  The expected outcomes of this project are: (1) an exploratory framework for how engineering faculty make choices and engage in evaluation processes; (2) a deeper understanding of processes that underlie cognitive and social engagement in engineering classrooms; and, (3) a valid and reliable CSCE instrument with modular subscales to measure student engagement of STEM education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report ? NSF Award# 1544103     Project Title: Collaborative Research: An Instrument and Adoption Framework for Student Cognitive and Social Engagement with a Course.     Recipient Organization: Washington State University   Project/Grant Period: 01/01/2016 - 12/31/2019  Principal Investigator: Olusola Adesope     This project addressed three key goals: (1) developed, assessed, and validated instruments to measure cognitive and social engagement in the field of engineering; (2) developed an understanding of how engineering faculty engage in measurement of their teaching practices by using the instruments we developed; and (3) propagate research findings with the framework and instruments developed.     Two instruments were developed to address the first goal of the project. Specifically, the project developed the cognitive engagement instrument using Michelle Chi?s Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) framework.  Findings from the cognitive engagement instrument extended the ICAP framework to include a disengagement factor. Our findings imply that there is still a level of engagement that takes place with Passive Engagement. However, the disengagement factor suggests students might be completely disengaged from the tasks. This is an important theoretical extension of the ICAP framework. In addition, a key outcome of this project is the development of the social engagement instrument. Social interactions with peers have long been recognized as one of the critical factors for facilitating the learning process. Such social and interpersonal skills are ranked by employers as the highest expectation for construction engineering and management students to possess upon entry into the workplace. The interaction is critical for construction engineering students for building their collaborative skills and abilities of common goals, communication, coordination, and cooperation (4Cs). The survey tool we developed measures the network and social connection aspect of student-student interactions and student- teacher to represent in- and out-of-class individual student social belonging.     A study was conducted to address the second goal of the project. Specifically,  we investigated the adoption process of the engagement survey using the sensemaking framework and found that faculty had specific needs related to their interests in student engagement that were not all met with the cognitive engagement survey. Based on findings from the sensemaking study, researchers are working on modifying the surveys to be more broadly adopted by practitioners, while simultaneously ensuring validity and reliability of the surveys.      The third goal of the project was to propagate research findings with the framework and instruments developed. To address this goal, the investigators presented and published findings from different stages of the project. In all, the project resulted in a total of 17 published journal papers and proceedings. In addition, we currently have 2 manuscripts developed from the project that are under review.

In addition, the website will advance sustainability of project findings past the granting cycle - https://stem.coe.wsu.edu/index.php/home/       Dissemination efforts were based on statistical analyses and validation of data from several engineering classes across different universities in the U.S. thus fostering the robustness of the findings and ensuring findings can be generalized across different students and engineering disciplines.     In summary, this project is an important step in advancing engagement in STEM fields, especially in engineering. The adoption efforts surrounding the project is another key objective considering that faculty were studied on their use of the survey and modifications made based on feedback from faculty. Findings from different stages of the survey were broadly disseminated.              Last Modified: 03/30/2020       Submitted by: Olusola O Adesope]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
