<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Bradley Dickerson is ?The mechanics and control of a biological gyroscope." The host institution for this fellowship is the California Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Michael Dickinson. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aerial agility of insects is remarkable, especially if considering the biomechanical and physiological challenges associated with their small size. In flies, these maneuvers are initiated by the visual system and ended by gyroscopic organs called halteres. The halteres are small, dumbbell-shaped structures located behind the forewings that are evolutionarily derived from the wings. Like the wings, the halteres are flapping structures contolled by a small set of muscles. However, while the importance of the halteres in flight control is long known, the role of these tiny steering muscles during flight maneuvers remains unclear. The research aims to discover the principles flies use to control motion of the haltere and in turn their aerial maneuvers. It promises to aid the development of micro air vehicles able to navigate complicated aerial environments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through studying the expression of a genetically-encoded calcium sensor in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the Fellow is observing haltere steering muscle activity during tethered flight maneuvers. Newly developed computational techniques are being employed to reveal if muscle activation patterns reflect the muscles acting independently or in context-dependent groups. A more complete understanding of the haltere?s motor control from these experiments provides insight as to how insects can perform elegant behaviors using a limited set of muscles and expands our knowledge of the general principles of motor control. Moreover, the research addresses how hard-wired reflexes are modified by the nervous system to produce voluntary behaviors.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Fellow mentors and serves as a role model for African-American and other underrepresented undergraduate students. Further educational outreach includes presentations to school groups through the Caltech Classroom Connection, the use of online multimedia to disseminate a podcast discussing current topics in science, and the development of informal presentations targeted at teenage audiences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p> <p>Animals must rapidly collect and process sensory information to complete both reflexive and voluntary sensorimotor tasks. Due to the extremely rapid time scales involved, this issue is particularly challenging during the maneuvers of flying insects. Flies are unique among flying insects in that they possess halteres, which function to provide timing information to structure the firing of wing steering muscle motor neurons as well as sense gyroscopic forces <em>via </em>the Coriolis force. These structures are evolved from the wings, and as a result have a set of small muscles that control their motion (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the base of the haltere is equipped with numerous strain-sensitive campaniform sensilla (Fig. 1), which send extensive projections into the thoracic ganglion. Given the crucial role of the haltere in mediating reflexes associated with external perturbations along with its evolutionary history, the intriguing possibility exists that these miniscule structures may mediate voluntary flight maneuvers. For example, descending motor commands to the haltere muscles could alter its kinematics in a manner similar to that during whole-body rotations, and thus the pattern and location of strain experienced by the haltere base. The embedded campaniform sensilla would then detect these strains, and through their connections to the wing and neck muscles, alter the fly&rsquo;s flight path. However, the basis for this hypothesis is based on physiology in quiescent, non-flying animals, and as a result, the potential role of this cross-modal reflex in flight is not known.</p> <p>I obtained the first evidence that haltere kinematics are under visual control. Using fluorescence imaging of a genetically encoded calcium sensor, I observed <em>Drosophila</em> haltere steering muscle and afferent activity in response to a broad array of visual stimuli. I found that the muscles respond to wide-field motion and are tuned to rotations about the body&rsquo;s cardinal axes (Fig. 2). Adapting a preparation for calcium imaging in the brain of flying <em>Drosophila</em>, I then used 2-photon microscopy to record from the haltere afferent projections in the subesophageal zone (SEZ) (Fig. 3). I found that the afferents are also responsive to global visual rotations (Fig. 3). I next tested if these patterns of activity are due to changes in haltere kinematics. Given that the halteres are evolved from wings, and wing afferent activity is likely due to its steering muscles controlling stroke amplitude, I compared haltere afferent activity with that of the wings (Fig. 3). Then, to address the haltere&rsquo;s role in voluntary turning maneuvers, I examined haltere afferent and muscle responses during saccades triggered by a looming visual stimulus, or internally in the absence of visual input. The haltere muscles and afferents exhibited a noticeable response to a looming stimulus (Fig. 4); however, I found no evidence of changes in activity during spontaneously-generated turns (Fig. 4), even though the haltere steering muscles showed small changes in activity. Finally, to test if the haltere steering muscles are sufficient to induce turning behaviors, I used optogenetic activation of the haltere steering muscle motor neurons (Fig. 5) during simultaneous optical recording of wing motion and wing steering muscle electrophysiology. I found that activating the haltere steering muscles modulates the activity of the wing steering muscles by either inducing a phase shift in the spike arrival time or activating quiescent muscles <em>via</em> recruitment.&nbsp;In all, these findings provide the first direct evidence that&nbsp;changes in haltere steering muscle activity may co-opt mechanosensory reflexes, thereby enabling flies to execute voluntary maneuvers (Fig. 6).
