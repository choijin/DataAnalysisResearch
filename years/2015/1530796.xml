<AbstractNarration>The proposed studies will explore, in depth, heterogeneity in the vulnerability of black college students to stereotype threat, and the way in which incentives can mitigate the impact of the threat. Stereotype threat occurs when members of a social group, in a given situation, feel themselves to be at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about their group and therefore perform less well, especially on important or difficult tasks. The study will contribute to knowledge about stereotype threat by identifying factors that contribute to or mitigate the threat and the consequences of stereotype threat vulnerability, and by developing a policy designed to combat its effects on black college students. It addresses one of the most important questions in the study of human capital investment today, which is why black students underperform and as a result are more likely to fail to complete a college degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal the principal investigators plan a series of lab experimental studies that will explore the interaction between stereotype threat and two types of incentives: piece rates and prizes. The project will explore the relationship among a set of key factors that are likely to be responsible for the differences in vulnerability to stereotype threat, and carefully explore the impact of incentives and their interaction with stereotype threat. The proposal has high policy relevance because it can inform the development of interventions to enhance the performance of black students enrolled at institutions with varying demographic distributions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project outcomes report: The major goal of the project is to examine the potential impact of stereotype threat on student performance at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs). It also studies the impacts of these findings and will allow us to make policy recommendations. Stereotype threat is defined as the fear of confirming negative stereotypes about oneâ€™s group.  This fear has been shown to significantly affect performance, particularly on high-importance exams, either because awareness of the stereotype causes stress that interferes with performance, or because such awareness causes individuals to give up in the face of negative perceptions.  The term was originated by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson, who showed that black college students performed worse on standardized tests when they were reminded, before taking the tests, of their race. When their race was not primed, however, black students performed as well as white students. Our project was designed to test whether stereotypes and stereotype threat affect performance in the two different educational environments.   Intellectual Merit: The project has consisted of three major components.  First, we conducted an experimental study of Stereotype Threat using the standard protocol developed by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson.  Importantly, we failed to find any evidence of stereotype threat in a population at a historically black college. We have been as yet unable to complete our study at TAMU because of difficulty recruiting a sufficient number of black participants to achieve statistical validity. (The TAMU student body is about 3% black).  However, that data also showed no evidence of stereotype threat, and even hinted at a reverse effect: when reminded of their race, black students did better on the test than otherwise, but the difference was not statistically significant. The second (and ongoing) component of the project consisted of a survey of students at TAMU and PVAMU that would be linked to their administrative performance data to assess the impact of stereotype threat vulnerability (using a survey measure) on student time to graduation, major, and grades.  The study also collects information on ability, past performance, and non-cognitive skills (behavioral factors such as grit, locus of control, personality, etc.) for use as controls.  We recruited subjects in two waves, Fall 2017 and Fall 2019.  At this point we are just waiting for enough students to graduate so that we can test our hypotheses with their administrative data records. The survey data alone hints at many differences between the two populations. Third, as part of the outreach mission of our project, we conducted a joint TAMU-PVAMU undergraduate research class with student and faculty participants from both schools.   Broader impacts:  The findings of the project have the potential to enhance the awareness of the possible impact of internalized discrimination (stereotype threat) on student performance, which has relevance for all academic fields, and for education research.  In addition, the project led to a long-term collaboration between researchers at the two different institutions.  This collaboration generates benefits to both schools.  Finally, the project provided training and research experience to undergraduate and graduate students at both institutions.
