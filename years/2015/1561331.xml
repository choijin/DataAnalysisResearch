<AbstractNarration>CSBR: Natural History: Saving and Preserving two Valuable Slide Collections at Cornell University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cornell University Plant Anatomy Collection (CUPAC) and the Cornell University Paleobotanical Slide Collection (CUPC-S) comprise more than 114,000 glass microscope slides that are the basis for descriptions and illustrations in an exceptional array of publications.  The result of research in the middle and latter half of the Twentieth Century, these collections are irreplaceable, and illustrate anatomical features of wild, horticultural and crop plants as well as extinct fossil plants, from algae to pine trees to orchids.  In addition to documenting the original work of eminent plant scientists, the collection is a source of further investigation, rechecking of published information, and new studies.  Each slide required an extensive and labor-intensive process, from procurement of plant material (often from remote tropical regions), detailed preparation, embedding and sectioning, staining for optical clarity, and permanently mounting on glass slides.  Because of their great scientific value and connection to the history of plant anatomy and paleobotany, the collections are priceless and unique.  By stabilizing and preserving the slides, this project will save a valuable and irreplaceable resource for the scientific community.  The project will also image and database the slides and make these data available through the web to the general public and scientific community.  This public resource will allow college and high school teachers of biology, plant sciences, and forestry to access high-quality anatomical slides for demonstration without needing to purchase or prepare materials themselves.  All images and data will also be made available to an even broader community through sharing of data with national and international portals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to inventory, stabilize and protect the CUPAC and CUPC-S collections and associated notebooks, and to image and digitize ca. 75,000 slides.  This will include all type materials and publication vouchers, and additional selected slides for breadth of taxonomic and anatomical coverage. Many of the CUPAC slides are vouchered with herbarium specimens and all of the CUPC-S materials are vouchered with fossil specimens housed at Cornell. The collections include an exceptional representation of herbarium-vouchered palm (Arecaceae) material from Bailey, Moore and Uhl, important publication vouchers for Bierhorst and Eames, contributed slides from Carlquist, Esau and Maheshwari, and pivotal early plant fossil preparations by Banks.  The project will include barcoding, linkage to data from associated notebooks, linkage to Cornell herbarium and fossil databases, and digital imaging with high-resolution light microscopy using a 32-megapixel system.  All slides will be rehoused in new cabinets and damaged mounts will be repaired where possible.  The online database will allow advanced search by organ/tissue/feature, taxonomic identity, scientist/researcher, locality and publication.  In addition, online measurement tools will provide a means of utilizing the system for remote analysis by scientists, and direct use in plant anatomy and paleontology instruction at all levels, including college and K-12. The resulting database and images will be made public on the cupac.bh.cornell.edu (CUPAC) website.</AbstractNarration>

Much of their complexity is understood by studying their anatomy which it is fundamental for comprehending how plants are built and how they function. Plant anatomy is a descriptive science; plant anatomists derive basic principles or generalizations after making many observations of plant sections that provide a fantastic array of characters and details that are both general and unique to the specific studied taxon. Plant anatomy features give insight on the common plan of the structures (root, stem, leaves, reproductive organs) and on their origin and development. It also provides knowledge in the competence of the organs for functioning and therefore on their physiology. Careful observations and descriptions are based on four types of sections: cross (or transversal), longitudinal radial (sectioned through the diameter), longitudinal tangential (sectioned through a tangential plane), and paradermal (parallel to the surface), and on tissue macerations and clearings. This allow to reconstruct the anatomy of the organs in their completeness accurately.</p> <p>The Natalie Uhl-Cornell University Plant Anatomy Collection (CUPAC) is an historical important collection of anatomical slide preparations housed at the LH Bailey Hortorium, Plant Biology Section, School of Integrative Plant Science, Cornell University. It comprises materials prepared by Cornell plant anatomists, among them A. Eames, M. Wilde, D.W. Bierhorst, N. Uhl, and D. Paolillo and by donated collections such as those of D. Eggert, G. Rothwell, and D. Kaplan. In addition, it is complemented with contributions of other plant anatomists, for example K. Easu, S. Carlquist, B. Johri, and P. Maheshwari. Although the collection started with approximately 114,000 slides, now it houses more than 300,000. The taxonomic breadth covers all groups of the plant tree of life from algae to angiosperms, while the morphological depth includes both vegetative and reproductive organs as well as representatives of all developmental stages. Moreover, CUPAC is also associated with the Cornell University Paleobotanical Slide Collection (CUPC-S) that enhances the collection with slides and peels of fossil taxa, including groups such as the Progymnosperms (precursors of the gymnosperms) and the Cordaitales (extinct group of woody plants related to the conifers).</p> <p>The Natalie Uhl-Cornell University Plant Anatomy Collection has become the home of many plant anatomy collections via donations by colleagues. For example, CUPAC now includes the "Eggert Collection" that, combined with the "Rothwell Collection" has representatives of all extant genera of gymnosperms, and the "Kaplan Collection" that includes slides of all developmental stages of flowers and inflorescences of monocots with all the boucher notes. D. Toth is donating his collection of anatomy of parasitic plants, that it is unique in the US.&nbsp;</p> <p>Before the development of the CUPAC project, the original slide collections were scattered among four different rooms, slides were kept in old boxes (sometimes broken, sometimes even moldy), and none were databased. Major accomplishments include the consolidation of the original collections and the newly donated ones into 15 steel cabinets for slide (in boxes) storage that were purchased and moved to a renovated room. All slides are now stored in plastic slide boxes (100 slides per box), the majority are being curated, barcoded and databased as we continue the process of digitization. Up today, CUPAC comprises more than 40,000 images.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The collection was and is curated, databased, and digitized following a strict protocol: 1- Selection of slides: reference slide collection; 2- Slides are barcoded and databased (including taxonomic information, anatomical organ/part sections, and other associated information such as dyes used); 3- Slides are imaged at 1X, 4X, 10X, 20X and 40X (magnification) for representing the tissues and cell details in the appropriated context of the organ, and 4- We have implemented keyword and taxon search tools, and online measurement and labeling tools.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Natalie Uhl- Cornell University Plant Anatomy collection can be found at:&nbsp;<a href="http://cupac.bh.cornell.edu/">http://cupac.bh.cornell.edu/</a>.

Additionally, we fill special requests to seek unimaged slides in the collection and provide images to researchers as needed.</p> <p>Based on the CUPAC ecosystem, we developed an online Plant Anatomy Manual. The manual is divided into 14 topics, an appendix with a planting list and schedule, and drawings done by Mary Wilde when she was a student at Cornell University.
