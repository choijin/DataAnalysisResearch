<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The present project concerned interactions between noncommutative algebra, geometry, and mathematical physics.  Activities related to this project were conducted at Louisiana State University, with Milen Yakimov and Richard Ng, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with Pavel Etingof.  We were interested in the following question: In what ways does noncommutative algebra arise naturally in geometric and physical contexts, and how can we leverage noncommutative techniques to answer questions in these disparate fields?  The PI?s work in this direction focused on three main classes of objects: * Orbifolds and Azumaya algebras:  These are geometric objects, hypersurfaces if one likes, in which points of the hypersurface "interact" in some way.  For example, if one considers a hypersurface with some discrete symmetries, then one can attempt to study the hypersurface and its symmetries "at the same time".  A formalization of this idea leads to the notion of an orbifold. * Hopf algebras and Tensor categories: We describe tensor categories via analogy.  Say we have, in a given system, a collection of varied particles of varied types A, B, C, D etc.  If this system is sufficiently dynamic, then we expect these particles to interact in some way so that particles of types A and B, say, fuse in the system, then diffuse, to produce new particles of new types.  One way to speak of this situation mathematically is through the language of tensor categories.  A further algebraic regidification of this idea leads to the notion of a Hopf algebra. * Conformal field theories: A (2-dimensional) conformal field theory is a system of interacting particles on a plane which satisfy a certain conformal invariance property.  One way of studying conformal field theories is to study their associated tensor categories of representations.  In this sense one begins in a physical context, that of a 2-d CFT, and produces a corresponding algebraic object, that of a tensor category.   In the project funded by NSF grant DMS-1503147 we achieved the following: * We provided new explicit descriptions of derived invariants of orbifolds and Azumaya algebras.  These invariants describe the manner in which a given orbifold (or Azumaya algebra) is allowed, or not allowed, to deform into a different orbifold, or completely new geometric object, in the "space of geometries". * We introduced and analyzed new Hopf algebras and tensor categories which are obtained from classical Lie theoretic data.  We also showed that the important "quantum Borel algebra" is determined almost exactly by its associated tensor category of representations. * We laid the foundations for establishing new explicit connection between studies of quantum groups, which are a fundamental class of algebraic objects, and so-called logarithmic conformal field theories.  These logarithmic conformal field theories lie at the boundary of the more well-studied rational conformal field theories, and mark a new frontier in studies of mathematical physics.  &mdash;Intellectual merit:  The activities listed above advanced our understanding of derived invariants for noncommutative algebraic, and algebro-geometric, objects, and have advanced our understanding of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras, tensor categories, and quantum groups. The PI applied techniques of noncommutative algebra in order to understand invariants of an essentially geometric nature, and also applied tensor categorical constructions of quantum groups in order to address issues which arose in conformal field theory. The PI?s activities thus advanced knowledge and understanding across different fields.   &mdash;Broader impacts:  While under NSF support at MIT, the PI managed the SPUR+ REU for underrepresented minorities at MIT, lectured at the mathroots summer program for (mostly minority) high school students, and also served on the diversity committee. While at LSU the PI worked with the Gardere Initiative, which served the majority Black and Latino Gardere community via an after school education program for high school and elementary school students.
