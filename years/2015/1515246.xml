<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1515246, Principal Investigator: Ioana Suvaina&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference "Recent Advances in Kahler Geometry" will be held May 18-22, 2015 at the Vanderbilt University. The main objective of the conference is to bring together leading experts in the separate but related fields of differential geometry, geometric analysis and algebraic geometry, to present recent results and future directions of research in the field. The conference is organized in conjunction with the 30th Shanks Lecture Series. Professor S-T. Yau (Harvard University) will deliver the 2014 Shanks Lecture. The conference will attract mathematicians from underrepresented groups as well as graduate students and young researchers who will greatly benefit from the wide spectrum of topics to be presented at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kahler geometry is an area with deep roots and very rapid and diverse advances. Remarkable progress has been made recently in different directions such as the study of Kahler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds, and complete Calabi-Yau manifolds with prescribed asymptotical behavior. Another very active area of research concerns the study of extremal Kahler metrics and their link with algebraic-geometric notions of stability on polarized manifolds.  The topics of the presentations include, but are not limited to, the following areas: Kahler-Einstein metrics, complete Calabi-Yau manifolds with prescribed asymptotical behavior, extremal Kahler metrics, moduli space of Kahler metrics, Kahler Ricci flow, Hermitian manifolds.  More details about the conference, as well as the list of speakers, are available at the conference website, at: &lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/kahlergeometry</AbstractNarration>

It was organized in conjunction with the Shanks Lecture, the keynote presentation delivered by Professor Shing-Tung Yau, Harvard University.  Kahler geometry is an interdisciplinary subject by nature. It has its roots in mathematical physics (gravitational instantons and relativity). It combines a multitude of techniques coming from complex analysis, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and differential equations. A tremendous breakthrough in the subject was due to the work of Professor Yau on Calabi Conjecture in the 1970's, for which he received the Fields medal in 1982. Since then, there were major developments. These culminated recently in new significant advancements which motivated the organization of this major event. The Shanks Lecture presented the overall development of Kahler geometry, and future directions of research in mathematics and mathematical physics (mirror symmetry, string theory). During the conference, the talks covered a variety of topics: the proof of the Donaldson-Tian-Yau Conjecture, extremal Kahler metrics and their moduli space, complete Calabi-Yau manifolds with prescribed asymptotic behavior, Hermitian manifolds, Kahler Ricci flow, and Sasaki geometry.  The talks were all of high quality and there were stimulating discussions and exchange of ideas. As a result several works emerged after the conference, and new collaborations were established. The conference presented a valuable opportunity for students and young researchers to interact with some of the leading experts in the field of Kahler geometry. Many attendees expressed their high degree of satisfaction with all aspects of the conference, including the choice and quality of mathematical topics discussed and the conference organization.  The conference featured 21 speakers from leading institutions in Canada, China, France, Japan, Italy, UK and USA. Eight of the invited speakers were junior mathematicians, and their participation in this major conference promoted their professional development.

This gave the opportunity to three women mathematicians, one hispanic faculty and four junior mathematicians (post docs or on tenure-track) to present their work and interact with more senior faculty.
