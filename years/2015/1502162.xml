<AbstractNarration>Category theory is an algebraic approach that formalizes the study of mathematical structures. This project lays the foundations of classical geometric  methods in category theory. Today, in  the second decade of the 21st century, modern geometry and theoretical physics are more intertwined than ever before. The convergence of ideas from mathematics and physics is accelerating at the same time as elementary particle physics is on the cusp of a profound revolution to be brought about by the new experimental results coming out of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). At the same time, a lot of mathematical work remains to be done to provide a suitable framework for the new physical theories that are being proposed. The geometric objects investigated in this project  are the foundations for such a framework: homological mirror symmetry is the mathematical realization of dualities and higher categories, the analogues of classical  manifolds, are the mathematical foundation for quantum field theories. These new flavors of geometry on which this project is based will continue to play a fundamental role in the future development of theoretical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach is based on the pioneering works by Seidel, Ein, Lazarsfeld, Mustata, Nakamaye, Popa, and Budur. The PIs will go further and conjecture that the categorical multiplier ideal sheaf  is  related to the Orlov spectrum of the category. Developing K-calculus and making it rigorous the PIs will break new ground in studying classical questions in Algebraic Geometry, including questions of rationality of projective varieties. In particular the PIs plan to consider  some more than hundred years old questions about nonrationality of conic bundles and four dimensional cubics. The applications go beyond the scope of Algebraic Geometry. Classical questions in Sympletcic  Geometry will be studied as well  - using invariants of Fukaya category one can try to distinguish symplectic manifolds with the same Seiberg - Witten invariants. The approach connects  K-calculus with so called tasting configurations used in the study of the existence of  Kahler-Einstein metrics. An intriguing question is that of finding a connection between Orlov spectra and the existence of  Kahler-Einstein metrics. Another direction of the project is the investigation of the connection of  K-calculus with physics, for which a starting point is the interpretation of monodromy data of the K - calculus as limited stability conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Monodromy, vanishing cycles and Hodge theory played  an important role in classical Mirror Symmetry. During this year our group did bring this idea to a new level - Categorical Kaehler Geometry.     We introduce a new type of hodge theory - theory of central manifolds.  The theory of local center manifolds requires to work in suitable Banach spaces.  At the end of the day we get  a final dimensional manifolds which  which behave as  classical hodge theory.  Applications are outlined.  We envision application to the proof of the Shafarevich conjecure  claiming  that the universal covering of the smooth projective variety is holomorphically  convex.  We envision building a theory of  curve complexes - categorical version of the classcial theory created by Mumford and Harrer.  With this approach stabiity conditions have a  deformation retract - the categorical  curve complex.  Sustained efforts by the PI over a number of years have resulted in an initial award for  Simons institute  of  2,000,000 USD over five years starting in July 2019.   This institute is  designed to advance mathematics in the US and across the Americas in a synergistic way. The  leaders will be  US based scientist and another must be based in Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean.       Last Modified: 03/11/2019       Submitted by: Ludmil V Katzarkov]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
