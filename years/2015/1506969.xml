<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technological progress has enabled scientists and engineers to build and manipulate physical systems at the level of individual atoms and molecules.  At these small scales the laws of Nature are often strange and counter-intuitive.  This award supports theoretical research and education aimed to elucidate how the dynamics of such systems can be controlled, and to deepen understanding of how the laws of quantum physics and thermodynamics combine to determine the behavior of nanoscale systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum physics governs the behavior of atoms and molecules, while thermodynamics was developed to describe how systems exchange energy and matter with one another.  Combining the two fields, particularly for systems that are far away from the steady state of thermal equilibrium is a challenging area of research.  The activities funded by this award will address three aspects of this problem.  One project involves developing theoretical methods for controlling a quantum mechanical system so that it reaches a desired final state in a fixed amount of time.  This will involve theoretical tools borrowed from quantum physics, classical mechanics and thermodynamics.  The second project is aimed to explore how thermodynamic concepts such as heat and work apply to systems that are governed by the laws of quantum physics.  In the third project, the PI will investigate the role played by the interactions between a small system and its surroundings, in the thermodynamic behavior of the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These activities will involve students as well as postdoctoral researchers, providing training in theoretical methods at the intersection of quantum physics and thermodynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports fundamental theoretical research and education related to the coherent quantum control and the thermodynamics of systems at atomic and molecular length scales. The first project addresses the new and exciting field of shortcuts to adiabaticity, where the aim is to guide a system to evolve as if it were being manipulated very slowly, even when the manipulation occurs rapidly. The PI will develop strategies that apply the tools of classical and statistical physics to design such quantum shortcuts. The second project undertakes a careful analysis of the relationship between classical and quantal definitions of work, with an emphasis on using semiclassical methods to identify the impact of quantum interference between classical trajectories. The third project involves investigating how the first and second laws of thermodynamics "scale down" to describe the behavior of systems that are strongly coupled to their thermal surroundings. The PI will explore microscopically precise definitions of quantities such as internal energy, entropy and volume that preserve the structure of the first and second laws, without needing to introduce corrections to account for strong system-environment interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Develop a broadly applicable methodology for using classical mechanics to design protocols for the manipulation of coherent quantum systems. This methodology will be useful in experimental settings where many of the current methods, based on scale-invariant driving, do not apply.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Provide a deeper understanding of the emergence of classical thermodynamics from quantum thermodynamics, for isolated systems driven by the variation of external parameters. In particular, it will clarify the role of quantum interference on the second law of thermodynamics and on nonequilibrium fluctuation relations.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Establish a consistent, microscopic thermodynamic framework for describing the interchange of energy between a system and its surroundings, when the two are sufficiently strongly coupled that the interaction energy itself cannot be ignored. This framework will be useful in describing the thermodynamics of biomolecules, which interact strongly with their aqueous surroundings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports graduate student and postdoctoral level training in the methods of theoretical and computational statistical physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has addressed problems related to understanding and controlling the behavior of very small systems &ndash; typically at the level of single atoms or molecules.  We have made fundamental progress toward understanding of how the laws of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics apply to such nanoscale systems.  In one activity, we have contributed to developing a set of tools for manipulating the behavior of a small system that is governed by the law of quantum mechanics, so as to cause the system to evolve rapidly from a given initial state to a corresponding final state.  Such tools, or "shortcuts to adiabaticity", have been investigated intensely over the past decade.  A previously proposed class of these tools has been limited to systems that begin in the ground state, that is the state of lowest possible energy.  We have succeeded in lifting this restriction, developing a shortcut to adiabaticity that can be used when a system begins in an excited state.  We have also developed a separate method for manipulating the state of a quantum system by applying an impulse, that is a brief but strong external force.  These outcomes contribute to the toolbox available for experimentalists to control the behavior of quantum systems.  In a second activity, we investigated the interplay between quantum-mechanical and thermodynamic laws.  We first worked with an experimental team to demonstrate that the second law of thermodynamics &ndash; when expressed as a fluctuation theorem &ndash; applies to a quantum system that is in weak contact with its thermodynamic surroundings.  We also studied how unique quantum properties known as coherences can be exploited for thermodynamic gains.  As an unexpected outcome of this investigation, we found that entirely analogous gains can be obtained for classical systems, in other words quantum mechanics does not provide a uniquely quantum thermodynamic advantage.  Both of these outcomes have helped to clarify how thermodynamic concepts apply to systems governed by the strange laws of quantum mechanics.  For a macroscopic system that exchanges energy with its thermodynamic surrounding, the contact between the system and its surroundings is typically weak, whereas for a microscopic system, the contact with its thermodynamic surroundings is strong.  In a third activity covered by this project, we considered how the laws of thermodynamics must be modified when the contact between a system and its surroundings is strong.  While it might initially seem that these laws must be supplemented with "correction terms" to account for the strong contact, we have shown that this is not the case.  We have developed a theoretical framework in which thermodynamic quantities such as energy, entropy, heat and work are defined precisely at the microscopic level; and we have shown that these quantities obey the laws of thermodynamics, without requiring correction terms.  This outcome contributes toward a comprehensive framework for applying thermodynamic laws to nanoscale systems.  In addition to advancing knowledge, this project has contributed to the development of the scientific workforce through interdisciplinary scientific training and education.  The project has funded three graduate students, two of whom have completed their PhD’s, and a third who is expected to do so within two years.  These students have received rigorous training in theoretical analysis, experience with requisite computational tools, and mentorship related to oral and written scientific communication and scientific ethics.  Additionally, the PI has developed and taught a summer-school course on nonequilibrium statistical physics, in Beg Rohu, France (2014) and Lausanne, Switzerland (2019), and he will teach a version of this course in Bangalore, India in March, 2020.  He has also delivered, over the course of the project, over a dozen department-level colloquiua both within the United States and internationally, as well as a public lecture in Munich, Germany.  The outcome of these activities has been the broad dissemination, to non-specialist audiences, of recent advances in understanding how the laws of thermodynamics "scale down" to nanoscale systems.
