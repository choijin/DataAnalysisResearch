<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) for R/V Roger Revelle, a 273? general purpose Global vessel. The ship is owned by Navy and operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF). The ship supports multidisciplinary oceanographic research in all the world?s ocean basins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2018, REVELLE completed 262 days, 181 (69%) of which were for NSF. In 2019, Revelle is currently scheduled with 86 days, 72 (84%) of which are for NSF. The reason there are so few days is that Revelle plans to spend most of the year in drydock undergoing a mid-life refit. Much of the equipment proposed here would be installed during this period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prioritized SSSE request includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science refrigeration machinery  $197,492&lt;br/&gt;Intercom &amp; dial telephone $411,854&lt;br/&gt;Public address system $239,030&lt;br/&gt;Wide throat sheaves  $121,069&lt;br/&gt;Reduce fan noise on deck $143,109&lt;br/&gt;Work boat outboard engines $16,240&lt;br/&gt;      $1,128,794&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
