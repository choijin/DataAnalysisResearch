<AbstractNarration>This grant will provide partial travel support for 35 junior US-based researchers (assistant professors, postdoctoral associates and graduate students) to attend the 2019 Foundations of Computer-Aided Process Design (FOCAPD-19) Conference that will be held from July 14 to 18, 2019, in Copper Mountain, Colorado. FOCAPD-19 will bring together the most important international researchers in the field of process design. Process design is being profoundly impacted by the convergence of high-performance computing and advances in machine learning and optimization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the field of process design the demand is for cost-effective, energy efficient and highly functional designs. This is coupled with an increased desire for rapid innovation to translate advances in science into engineered products. Furthermore, the demands of society are for zero-accident chemical production combined with a low tolerance for product faults, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. The design process itself is also being driven to high performance by global competition and adoption of streamlined digital information management systems that link every increasing scope of design problems, from the initial molecular discovery to process implementation. The junior US-based researchers supported by this grant will have the opportunity to interact with academic and industrial researchers from around the world and exchange ideas on the latest advances on process design research and education. The organizers expect to attract members of under-represented groups that they may otherwise be unable to attend the Conference. The junior researchers will have an opportunity to interact with each other and with more experienced researchers in the field, which will positively influence their future professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ No matter the domain, process or product, the demand is for cost-effective, energy efficient and highly functional designs.  This is coupled with an increased desire for rapid innovation to translate advances in science into engineered products.  Furthermore, the demands of society are for zero accident chemical production and a low tolerance for product faults, particularly in pharmaceutical industry. The design process itself is also being driven to high performance by global competition, and adoption of streamlined digital information management systems that link every increasing scope of design problems from initial molecular discovery to process implementation.   We are inventing a world in which "high performance design" will become expected and delivered through systems that are agile, fault tolerance, and resilient. Furthermore, the reality of the development ecosystem for new products is quickly shifting from "all in-house" to a complex outsourcing network. This results in new constraints to the development process itself creating new challenges for the product developers.  Every five years the process systems design community comes together at an international conference to consider the future of process design at a conference "Foundations of Computer Aided Designâ€™ - FOCAPD.  The community embraced these challenges and discussed the development of the necessary frameworks, knowledge and tools to support high performance design in a global ecosystem.  Industrial and academic participants were invited to share their views and constructively debate how academic research and industrial development can support high performance design.  One of the key attributes of FOCAPD is that it provides an intimate venue where students and junior researchers can engage in significant interactions and discussions with senior leaders in our field. Their ideas contributed very valuable elements in the meeting discussions and they had the opportunity to hear the vision and insights of the current leaders/experts.  This travel grant helped to support 10 untenured faculty at various institutions in the U.S. to attend the conference by providing funds for the conference registration.  It further supported the travel of every, 46, U.S. based graduate student or post-doc attendee with a partial stipend of help offset their lodging costs.  The posters that the funded participants contributed were organized into three evening sessions and abstracts of the posters published as a special volume of Computer Aided Chemical Engineering (CACE).
