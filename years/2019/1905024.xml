<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel of US participants in the 14th international conference on Finite Fields and their Applications (Fq14) which will be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada June 3-7 2019 at the Simon Fraser University Harbour Centre.  As the name indicates, this conference is the 14th in a biannual series, and it is the premier international conference on the topic of finite fields, an important research area at the crossroads of algebra, number theory and combinatorics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics to be discussed at the conference include the structure of finite fields, perfect non-linear functions, algorithms and complexity, algebraic coding theory, cryptography and quantum information theory among others.  The website for this conference can be found at https://www.sfu.ca/math/news---events/department-events/fq14---vancouver-2019.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The NSF support for the Finite Fields meeting in June 2019 was instrumental to an extremely successful scientific meeting. As requested, the money was used to support many early career researchers (9, including 3 females) and 5 others (including 3 females). For many of these researchers, the support made it possible to attend: Vancouver is a very expensive city and hence would have been prohibitive without the NSF money. Each of the recipients of support gave a talk at the conference, thus providing an outlet for the early career researchers to gain experience. Numerous participants from Europe and Canada (and a few from Asia and Australia) enabled NSF-supported participants to network among the broader Finite Field community. Two of the highlights of the meeting were the plenary talks given by Gretchen Matthews and Toni Bluher, both able to attend due to the NSF support. The steering committee met to discuss the future of the conference, and they were extremely grateful for the NSF support. Part of the discussion revolved around the possibility of having a US-based institution host the next conference since that would allow more US participation. Ultimately Paris was selected (for summer of 2021, or at least that was the plan before COVID-19), but the steering committee hopes to continue to apply for NSF support to allow US participation.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/31/2020<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;A&nbsp;Davis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
