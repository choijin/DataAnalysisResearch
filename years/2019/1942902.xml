<AbstractNarration>Future smart cities will have to provide Internet connectivity to millions of energy-starved Internet-of-&lt;br/&gt;Things devices - even those several miles away from the nearest wireless base station. To this end, recent&lt;br/&gt;years have seen novel Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WANs) deployed, such as LoRa and NB-IoT.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, todayâ€™s LP-WAN technologies require a battery to power these devices, which impacts&lt;br/&gt;their maintenance cost and reliability. This proposal aims to develop a city-scale LP-WAN architecture&lt;br/&gt;that offloads connectivity, sensing and even the source of energy to the more capable base stations and&lt;br/&gt;cloud infrastructure. We develop an architecture where base stations actively collaborate to enable faster&lt;br/&gt;and more reliable connectivity to low-power devices, sense their location and surroundings and provide&lt;br/&gt;energy they require to operate in the first place. The proposed work has a detailed integrated education and&lt;br/&gt;outreach program including course projects that leverage a live testbed and summer labs for K-12 students&lt;br/&gt;in Greater Pittsburgh. The proposed work will be deployed initially to network existing smart sensors at&lt;br/&gt;CMU and later scale to surrounding city infrastructure, through extensive collaborations with the City of&lt;br/&gt;Pittsburgh, forming a first-of-its-kind university-led programmable LP-WAN deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work enables Low-Power Wide-Area Networking in dense smart-city deployments along&lt;br/&gt;three axes: (1) Long-Range Wireless Charging: First, the proposal investigates a system at the base stations&lt;br/&gt;that beams power to battery-free clients at unknown locations. We explore base station and client designs to&lt;br/&gt;perform wireless charging over large distances, orders-of-magnitude higher than prior work. (2) Pushing&lt;br/&gt;LP-WAN Speed and Scaling Limits: Next, the proposed work explores a solution to decode collisions from&lt;br/&gt;even the weakest of LP-WAN signals that cannot be detected at any single base station. The proposal argues&lt;br/&gt;why power starved LP-WAN clients motivate the need for even mundane PHY-layer functions at the client:&lt;br/&gt;radio configuration, decoding and rate adaptation - to be offloaded to the more capable infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal then explores intelligent ways for base stations to collaborate at the cloud, despite limited&lt;br/&gt;backhaul bandwidth. (3) City-Scale Wireless Sensing: Finally, the proposed work investigates novel sensing&lt;br/&gt;solutions that use RF signal measurements received both from city-wide low-power radios as well as&lt;br/&gt;CubeSats in Low-Earth Orbit, collated at the edge and cloud. We evaluate how such a system can sense&lt;br/&gt;properties such as structural health and atmospheric moisture at city-scale, without requiring dedicated&lt;br/&gt;sensors on low-power devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
