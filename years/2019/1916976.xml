<AbstractNarration>Despite many efforts to increase diversity in the electrical and computer engineering professoriate, the number of women on engineering faculty remains alarmingly low. To maintain and strengthen the US as a leader in STEM, it is essential to alleviate barriers and broaden participation of all facets of the US population into the STEM workforce. The goal of this workshop is to motivate women who are doctoral students in electrical and computer engineering to consider faculty positions at US universities. Over 20 women doctoral students will be invited to attend a workshop offered at an annual conference of electrical and computer engineering department heads. The workshop sessions include negotiation strategies, effective teaching methods, writing successful proposals, and navigating the academic job search. Participants will have the opportunity to present their research to department heads. Through specialized sessions, participants will interact with department heads to learn about their programs, potential faculty positions, and learn about the expectations for new faculty. NSF support will make the workshop accessible to participants from institutions that may not have the financial resources to support the travel of their doctoral students. By directly impacting over 20 women students, the workshop will increase the number of women applying for academic positions in electrical and computer engineering. Participation in the focused programming will prepare the participants to be successful in their academic careers. Participants will extend their professional networks through interactions with the diverse range of professionals, from both academia and industry, who attend the department heads conference. Furthermore, by connecting participants with successful women academic leaders, the workshop will catalyze their interest to become the role models for the next generation of women electrical and computer engineering students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will advance knowledge on successful strategies to broaden the participation of women in the engineering professoriate. It is well documented that providing access to role models and mentors is an effective strategy to retain students from underrepresented groups in engineering. This workshop will provide a mechanism to increase access to such role models and mentors for women doctoral students in electrical and computer engineering programs. The workshop is designed to increase the range of opportunities for participants to interact with and build a rapport with department heads and industry leaders. This workshop will broaden participation in electrical and computer engineering by better preparing women doctoral students to enter academic careers supported by a diverse professional network of mentors and peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
