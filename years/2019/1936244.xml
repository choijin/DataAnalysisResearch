<AbstractNarration>This travel grant is to support US graduate students to attend 2019 IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP), a premier conference covering all aspects of network protocol research, including design, analysis, specification, verification, implementation, and performance. IEEE ICNP 2019 will be held in Chicago, Illinois, USA in October 7-10, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support approximately fifteen students. The critical contributions of this award is that students (including first-time attendees, from under-represented groups, and minority students) will be able to attend the IEEE ICNP 2019 and affiliated events, including main conference, workshops,  posters and demos. By attending a high quality conference, the students will have the opportunity to meet and learn from experienced researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
