<AbstractNarration>This grant is to organize the "Pathways to the Future of Arecibo Observatory (AO) Workshop" to be held February 17-20, 2019 in San Juan Puerto Rico. AO's cornerstone research facility is a 305-meter diameter spherical reflector, located in Barrio Esperanza, Arecibo, Puerto Rico. This facility has a unique cluster of instruments, making it a center of excellence with exceptional capabilities to enhance our knowledge in the Space Sciences. The observatory continues to be a magnet for Hispanic and other underrepresented groups. It has extensive educational resources for students, teachers and the public. This workshop is being hosted by the new management of AO, the University of Central Florida (UCF), with the goal of promoting innovative ideas for new research activities at AO. The workshop provides a meeting space so that key stakeholders, community scientists and local students and teachers can come together to create a shared vision of future research to be conducted at AO. It is expected to harness the expertise and forward-thinking leadership of the participants to help create tangible ways to promote cutting-edge research and involve wider participation from the scientific community. A broad range of science is carried out at AO and no single science meeting covers all of topics in one place. Therefore, this workshop was conceived to bring all stakeholders together in one place at one time. This workshop seeks to widen the AO research and science plans for the next decade or so, and the technical improvements that will be needed to guarantee the success of that research. An expected outcome is that the discussions facilitated by this workshop will help maintain AO's status as one of the premier research institutions in the world, and Puerto Rico as the location where breakthrough discoveries can and will happen in the next decade. Furthermore, white papers generated from this meeting may be used to inform Decadal Surveys being facilitated by the National Academies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following overarching question will be addressed at the workshop: What key scientific questions, emerging science opportunities, and technical advances will scientists be pursuing in the next decade? The discussion is expected to lead to the development of next-generation instruments using existing infrastructure and broaden their scope beyond traditional approaches of doing science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The conference Pathways to the Future of the Arecibo Observatory (AO) was hold in February, 17-20, 2019 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The attendees were 82 researches, engineers and students related to the Arecibo telescope. The conference was organized in 5 plenary sessions, 4 parallel sessions (covering three different scientific areas), 2 parallel discussion, 52 talks, a final round table with open discussion with participation of all the attendees, including the AO management team and a lunch to discuss main results with participation of all the AO science and management teams, and representatives of the operations and EPO teams.   The main outcomes of the conference were    Strategic decission to reinforce the astronomy, planetary and atmospheric group of scientist at the Arecibo Observatory. Staffing of the FSI group in Florida with scientist that are actively collaborating with AO researchers.     Reinforcing collaborations with ISR scientist at other institutes, such as the SRI in California    New collaborations with optical observers to support the radar planetary observations, such as the IAA and IAC institutes in Spain.      Development of a comprehensive roadmap for the future of the facility that incorporates science topics as well as potential infrastructure and equipment investments.     Co-organization (together with the Green Bank Observatory) of a single-dish school.  Development of a Pulsar Search Collaboration team based at UCF that will put the focus on using AO data for search of pulsars by high-school students.  Organization of the NANOGrav Spring meeting in 2020 was at UCF with participation of AO scientist Ben Perera, who was also part of the LOC. This meeting was preceded by  a student workshop including hands-on training for undergraduates all over the USA.     As a result of the discussion with the Arecibo users, different initiatives have been developed in the last year to improve communications with the AO users community in a regular manner. The AO management team is sending a letter with updates  twice a year (Spring and Autumn), a quarterly Newsletter is sent out to the AO users including updates on science, EPO, and management actions of interest. Also, several AO users have visited UCF and AO, the aim of these visits is to let people know better how FSI/UCF staff (professors and researchers) envision their participation in the AO development and to increase the possibilities of collaborations of AO research staff with users. Also, AO benefits from the transfer of knowledge between some long term users of the facility and the newly incorporated members of our science team.     The impact of this conference in the media is summarized below     11 videos were published on Facebook and Twitter through Facebook live interviews to the scientist, AO staff and  AO futures attendees.    10 regular posts on Facebook and Twitter which include quotes form speakers, photos, and highlights of the event.    A Netflix film crew covered one of the talks for a documentary (to be announced)    UCF press release  "Scientists Gather to Discuss Future Objectives of Arecibo Observatory". A version in Spanish was submitted to the media in PR.    A newsletter was developed and sent daily (during the event) to every registered participant of the AO Futures.
