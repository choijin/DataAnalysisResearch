<AbstractNarration>Achieving accurate, complete, trustworthy and usable traceability across software-intensive systems can be extremely beneficial as the underlying network of traceability links can be used to answer diverse questions about the software system and its development process.  However, in practice, many software projects suffer from inadequate or inaccurate traceability due to the cost and difficulty of manually creating and maintaining trace links.    This research will develop a holistic, interactive tracing environment, which incorporates diverse algorithmic solutions for dynamically generating trace links, visualizing the results, and guiding the user through the interactive process of using the results to support diverse Software Engineering tasks. Automating the creation and maintenance of accurate traceability links offers significant potential for industrial impact. For example, traceability is required by certifying bodies in safety-critical domains and can help in the construction and delivery of high quality, competitive, timely products.  The cross-disciplinary nature of the team will introduce new opportunities for software engineers, data scientists, and human-computer interaction experts to collaborate in addressing open Software Engineering challenges and will provide research opportunities for diverse and underrepresented students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will explore challenging problems at the intersection of software engineering, semantic text mining, and visualization.  It will directly address one of the prominent causes of trace-link inaccuracy caused by the inability of current algorithms to reason over deep semantics of underlying software artifacts such as requirements, design, and code.  First, the researchers will investigate semantically enhanced traceability algorithms that generate trace links, even in the absence of shared textual representations. Second, the work will develop a holistic tracing solution that dynamically configures a trace engine to leverage diverse tracing techniques such as semantic traceability, trace link evolution, and other existing techniques. Finally, given a diverse set of trace links with different degrees of accuracy, the research team will design, develop, and publicly release a novel, interactive, visual interface that enables users to understand the provenance and trustworthiness of each link while providing a clear rationale for trace query results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ -What are the major goals of the project?  The projects is organized in three thrusts, each with its own set of objectives:  Thurst 1 Trace Link Generation and Evolution Integrating Diverse Trace Link Evidence Dynamically Evolving Trace Links Thurst 2: Semantically Enhanced Traceability Unsupervised Ontology Construction Leverage Ontology and Deep Learning to infer Trace Links Thurst 3: A User-Centric Tracing Environment Interactive Visual Trace Interface Trace Link Provenance            -What was accomplished under these goals (you must provide information for at least one of the 4 categories below)?  Major Activities:  PI Falessi has supervised a grad student to pursue objective 1.a: a. Integrating Diverse Trace Link Evidence. Specifically, Traces among software artifacts have been proven to support a large set of tasks such as certification, impact analysis, and reuse. However, since establishing traces requires effort and does not provide benefits that are immediate when compared to other activities such as testing or feature development, then establishing traces is usually postponed when time is available.  To support safety certification, one common scenario is the need to retrieve traces among end-to-end artifacts such as requirements to code. In this scenario,  when intermediate artifacts, and even their traces, are available. For instance it is common to trace requirements to code (i.e., end-to-end traces), when design (i.e., the intermediate artifacts), and maybe the traces from requirements to design and from design to code (i.e., the intermediate traces), are available.  The aim of our study is to investigate how intermediate traces and intermediate artifacts support automated trace retrieval of end-to-end artifacts. We propose and evaluate 32 methods to retrieve traces by combing two techniques to compute the semantic similarity of text, four techniques to aggregate multiple paths scores, and four technique to aggregate multiple paths.  Results related to two large open-source projects and one large industrial project, featuring a total of about 200,000 possible traces, show that, as expected, the highest the number of traces with intermediate artifacts are used, the highest the accuracy in retrieving end-to-end traces. More interestingly, the use of intermediate artifacts increases the accuracy in retrieving end-to-end traces even when no intermediate traces are available.     -What opportunities for training and professional development has the project?   Alberto Rodriguez, a computer science grad student coming from an underrepresented population, spent hundreds of hours on the project and he learned several concepts related to tracing such as semantic similarity, natural language processing techniques and machine learning.     -How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?  We are currently writing a research paper that we intend to submit to TOSEM at the end of Summer 2021.     -What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?  As described above, the short-term plan is to publish a paper about what we have done. A medium-term plan is to tackle objective 1.b Dynamically Evolving Trace Links.      -What is the impact on the development of the principal discipline(s) of the project? Describe how findings, results, techniques that were developed or extended, or other products from the project made an impact or are likely to make an impact on the base of knowledge, theory, and research and/or pedagogical methods in the principal disciplinary field(s) of the project.   Our findings will likely contribute to the base of knowledge, theory, and research about trace retrieval. Our successful use of intermediate artifacts opens new frontiers on how to retrieve links in software applications.     -What is the impact on technology transfer? Describe ways in which the project made an impact, or is likely to make an impact, on commercial technology or public use.  Our study provides an approach to better retrieve trace links. This improvement will likely translate in safer products if the traces are used in the context of safety certification, and/or in reduced effort, which in turn will likely translate in the competitive advantage of industries adopting our approach.
