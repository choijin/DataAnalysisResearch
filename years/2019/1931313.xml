<AbstractNarration>This NSF Scalable Parallelism in the Extreme (SPX) workshop provides an opportunity for SPX principal investigators as well as other researchers in the areas of parallel and distributed computing to discuss the latest advances, demonstrate technical accomplishments, and inform NSF of important and groundbreaking future research directions in these areas. The technical program, while taking stock of recent results, will include breakout sessions to discuss research directions that address critical concerns in the design and implementation of extremely scalable parallel and distributed systems. The broader impacts include broadening participants' perspectives and providing a venue to form new collaborations. Furthermore, a post-workshop report describing the most important and promising research directions will be made available to the broader research community, to inspire research in those directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The goal of this project was to identify and promote research on important and groundbreaking research directions in the area of extremely scalable parallel and distributed computing.  Extreme-scale parallel and distributed computations underlie many important practical applications in scientific computing, machine learning, data analysis, and simulation. To achieve this goal, we organized the 2019 NSF Workshop on Future Directions for Parallel and Distributed Computing.  It was held on June 22, 2019, in Phoenix, AZ, as part of the ACM Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC).  The workshop brought together about 80 researchers, including researchers already working in this area and researchers from other relevant computer science disciplines.  It distilled their knowledge, ideas, and insights to identify important challenges and research directions in this area.  The workshop also broadened participants' perspectives and provided a venue to form new collaborations. After the workshop, the organizers wrote a report describing the most important challenges and most promising research directions in this area.  The report also contains several recommendations to guide research in this area, including: the importance of inter-disciplinary collaborations within Computer Science, especially between hardware-oriented and software-oriented researchers, and with domain experts outside of Computer Science; the need for new techniques for domain-specific and platform-specific design that directly integrate specialized abstractions into algorithm, language, and system design; the need for increased focus on techniques to ensure correctness of these increasingly complex systems; and the importance of full-stack, end-to-end evaluation of these systems using realistic applications and workloads.  The final version of the report was submitted to NSF in October 2019 and made available to the broader research community.
