<AbstractNarration>This project supports the participation of junior researchers in the workshop "Last Frontiers in Quantum Information Science (LFQIS)". Held in Talkeetna, Alaska from July 18-22, 2019, LFQIS builds on a successful 5-year track record (2013-2017) of bringing together junior and senior researchers to collaborate and share knowledge in Quantum Information Science (QIS). LFQIS is the only annual QIS event held in Alaska. This project will allow for the participation in LFQIS of talented undergraduate students and teaching faculty at Alaskan universities interested in QIS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the objectives of "Quantum Leap", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments. The 10 big ideas will push forward the frontiers of U.S. research, provide innovative approaches to solve some of the most pressing problems the world faces, as well as lead to discoveries not yet known. This project also advances objectives of the National Quantum Initiative (NQI), a coordinated multiagency program to support research and training in Quantum Information Science (QIS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the 6th annual "Last Frontiers in Quantum Information Science" (LFQIS) workshop, held in Talkeetna, AK from July 18-22, 2019.  Since 2013, LFQIS has brought together high-quality junior and senior researchers in an environment that produces high-quality collaborations, interactions, and research outputs.  It fills a particular essential niche:  a small, relaxed workshop with time for extended talks and discussion, focused on QIS but not devoted to a particular subfield.  Small meetings like LFQIS broadcast new results across subfields, foster new collaborations, and encourage cross-disciplinary breakthroughs.  LFQIS aims to nurture QIS and physics research in Alaska -- a state that is chronically underserved educationally because of its remoteness, and which provides few opportunities even to learn about scientific research, much less pursue it as a career -- by reaching out to promising undergraduate students and interested teaching faculty at Alaskan universities, and engaging the general public.     LFQIS 2019 brought together 16 experts in quantum science from around the world for 5 days of invited talks, round-table discussions, and relaxed collaboration in Talkeetna, Alaska.  Post-event surveys were enthusiastic, with one participant exclaiming "I wanted to say thanks for the invitation to such a cool workshop! I especially liked the informal, small feeling of the workshop, as I found it easier to have fruitful scientific discussions than I do at larger conferences."  At least two participants report having formed a productive collaboration at LFQIS that continues today.     The highlight of the workshop was a public lecture, "Six Impossible Things", delivered at the University of Alaska (Anchorage) by Professor Benjamin Schumacher from Kenyon College.  In conjunction with the public lecture, three of the organizers answered community questions about their Alaska upbringings and scientific careers at a town-hall style event at the UAA Bookstore.
