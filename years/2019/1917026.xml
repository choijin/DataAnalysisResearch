<AbstractNarration>This workshop aims to synthesize an industry perspective about the structure and content of STEM education that will be needed by the nation's STEM workforce in the future. The project responds to the accelerating disruptive changes to work behaviors and business models, which are expected to affect the nature of work, the skills needed on the job, and the composition of the nation's workforce. The project will explore challenges to meeting current and future industry demands and will seek to identify shortcomings in the effectiveness of current STEM degrees in supporting development of competencies and skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to inform the national discussion about STEM education for the future, and to motivate needed changes in the structure and content of STEM education nationally. The project will focus on the future work environment and work rules, the types of expertise needed on the job, and preferred formats of development. It will examine industry-driven certification systems, including standards, benchmarks, and badging, as well as industry practices of skills validation. The project will also examine talent pipelines used by industry today and the trends for the future, such as internships, apprenticeships, onboarding, continuing professional development and life-long learning, industry leaves for study, and leveraging senior workers' knowledge and experience. This project will examine student development in terms of both technical skills and soft skills that are needed regardless of discipline.  It will also examine how academic institutions view the value and credit-worthiness of industry preparation such as certification and badging versus academic courses. This project will engage industry experts and research faculty with deep industry experience to provide industry perspectives on workforce re-skilling and educational trends. Activities will include conducting a broad survey of industry, a convening of industry thought leaders to identify topics in need of exploration, one-on-one interviews with a subset of participants to validate the survey results and subsequent analysis, and compilation of results into a formal published report.  This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program (IUSE): Education and Human Resources (EHR).  The IUSE Program supports projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Automation, powered by advances in machine learning and data science, is super-charging innovation and disrupting industries and jobs. Work in America looks very different from a couple of decades ago, and it will look even more different going into the future decades.  As more and more repeatable tasks are relegated to machines, some jobs will disappear, and new ones will appear. For new jobs to offset the losses, particularly in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), America requires an adaptable workforce with a new set of skills (McKinsey Global Institute, 2019). To gain an industry perspective on how STEM undergraduate educational institutions might best meet these expected demands for new skills, the International Society of Service Innovation Professionals (ISSIP) was awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to undertake a project to seek such a perspective in order to inform higher education leaders on workforce re-skilling and educational trends that industry views as important and necessary for a thriving workforce - today and in the future.   The ISSIP approach to the project consisted of conducting a workshop, augmented by stakeholder feedback. A panel of experts (Expert Panel) was assembled, and initial input was obtained from stakeholders through Surveys and Dialogues. A one-day Workshop was held with industry leaders and members of academia having strong industry exposure, followed by additional surveys with a wider set of stakeholders, and finally synthesizing all the findings into this report.    It is important to note that this research was conducted the COVID-19 crisis hit the US, e.g., low unemployment, STEM talent scarcity, relatively low demand for remote work and learning. While it is important to study the long-term impact of the crisis to our findings, that is outside the scope of the current project and therefore this report.  The following is a summary of the findings from the Stakeholder Feedback and the Workshop. Key Takeaways from the survey responses encourage accelerated, earnest responses from higher education leaders and their institutions as outlined below:    Rapid technology advances are changing the nature of jobs, resulting in jobs that are driving demand for new skills.    Universities are lagging behind in teaching undergraduates some of the skills needed for industry entry-level jobs. These skills span a broad range that can be categorized as Specialized Skills (technical in nature), and Foundational Skills (general in nature). While industry is interested in both categories of skills, its view is that undergraduate hires come to work well-prepared with Specialized Skills, but not well prepared with Foundational Skills.     Industry leaders advise higher education leaders to provide more Foundational Skills learning opportunities to students.     Badging and other skill verification approaches are considered by industry as augmenting, and not replacing, the 4-year degree programs.    "Life-long learning" and "pervasive learning" are viewed by industry leaders as very important.    A basic level of computing skills is required, even for non-technical jobs, in STEM work environments.     Industry demand is increasing for candidates that have more practical experience through internships, and co-ops.     Finally, US universities are not producing enough American STEM graduates to satisfy industry needs, resulting in industry dependency on new hires with H1B visas.   The key takeaways from the Workshop: Panel speakers and participants identified a number of important skills as required for new jobs of today and tomorrow. These skills (Figure 1) were viewed as belonging to two major categories: 1) Specialized Skills designating those technical and scientific skills for which requirements keep changing as technologies advance, and 2) Foundational Skills which include those skills that are long-lasting and transferable across technologies, jobs, companies, and even industries. While acquiring Specialized Skills is a reasonable strategy for learners to start preparing for the STEM jobs of the future, according to the workshop participants, they considered the strategy far from sufficient. To be sufficiently prepared, industry representatives in this panel agreed that STEM graduates must come to work also prepared with the Foundational Skills that will enable them to adapt quickly to the constantly changing environment of work.  Based on input from the Workshop and Survey, two types of Foundational Skills were identified: a) Work Practice Skills; and b) Soft Skills.  In this view, Work Practice Skills are those skills mostly pertinent to work processes, such as human-centered design, agile, service thinking, and interdisciplinary skills, while Soft Skills are those skills such as interpersonal &amp; communications skills, risk-taking, and collaboration. In addition to both types of skills, according to the industry participants in this study, New Mindsets are required to constantly reskill and upskill across these skills dimensions. These mindsets include the Growth Mindset, Probabilistic Thinking, Design Thinking, and Service &amp; Systems Thinking.  Finally, a dire need for greater representation of women and members of minority groups in reskilling and upskilling efforts was repeatedly mentioned by the Workshop panelists, and in the survey responses.
