<AbstractNarration>One of the major problems in Cell Biology is that detailed knowledge of specific molecular or cellular events is not integrated across time and space, and investigators lack the understanding of how one event relates to or influences another to result in the totality of cellular responses. Understanding how a specific atomic or molecular reaction results in the overall cellular behavior is extremely difficult by experimentation alone, and computational modeling is required to significantly advance our understanding. The main goals of the workshop funded by this award are to promote the discovery of biophysical laws that govern cellular differentiation and homeostasis by promoting the interdisciplinary collaborations between experimental cell biologists and computational modelers. The workshop aims to provide unique opportunities for cell biologists and computational modelers to work together to develop predictive understanding of the cell.  The workshop also provides a unique educational experience for researchers who participate.  Organizers will work with professional societies to ensure the recruitment of faculty from underrepresented groups as well as graduate students and postdocs and other early career professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding for a 3rd year extension of the extremely successful "Finding your Inner Modeler (FYIM)" workshops supported by the NSF MCB Award 1649160 during 2017 and 2018. The vision for the 3rd year workshop is to use the 2-day format to continue the goals articulated in the original proposal to: 1) stimulate interest in computational modeling among scientists currently not using this approach; 2) promote the formation of interdisciplinary collaborations between cell biologists and computational modelers; and 3) develop an information and guidance network to provide advice to cell biologists and computational scientists on how to start a collaboration, who to contact, and what resources are available to support collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Traditionally, scientists have examined these processes by looking at a single sub-event through experimentation. However, such empirical examination often misses the underlying biophysical principles that govern biological systems. To extract the principles underlying a specific process, it is necessary to combine molecular/genetic/biochemical experiments with computational modeling, which uses mathematical tools and computer algorithms to test specific hypotheses.  Unfortunately, the majority of traditional experimentalists do not know the utility of modeling approaches and/or are resistant to incorporating such approaches into their projects. Generally, these scientists fall into 3 classes: (1) those that question the value of computational modeling in research; (2) those that are interested, but do not think they have the right type of data to benefit from modeling; and (3) those that simply do not know how to start or where to get advice.  To educate traditional cell biologists as to why, when, and how to incorporate computational modeling in their research, three annual workshops were designed to: (1) demonstrate the utility of computational modeling in advancing understanding of biological processes; (2) illustrate how computational models are built and how their output is appropriately interpreted; (3) debunk widespread misconceptions about the difficulty of modeling and related topics; and (4) catalyze the formation of interdisciplinary collaborations between traditional cell biologists and expert modelers interested in working on biological problems.  The three "Finding Your Inner Modeler" (FYIM) workshops were unique in that they brought together traditional cell biologists and computational modelers for in-person opportunities to form collaborations. The vast majority of scientific meeting are attended by scientists within the same narrow discipline, and our workshops were purposefully designed to cross disciplines to facilitate interdisciplinary approaches to biological questions.  The first two workshops (FYIM1-2) were held at the University of Illinois at Chicago in the summers of 2017 and 2018. The last workshop in the series (FYIM3) was held on the campus of the University of Alabama at Birmingham in the summer of 2019.
