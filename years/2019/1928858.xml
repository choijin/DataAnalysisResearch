<AbstractNarration>The Diversity Workshop and Mentoring Program will be held July 28-31, 2019 at the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) at the Colorado Convention Center. The program brings historically-underrepresented undergraduates, graduates, post-docs, and early career professionals together with more senior statisticians in academia, government, and the private sector for mentoring, networking, and leadership and skills development. The ultimate objective of this workshop is to foster enduring mentoring relationships and prepare statisticians and data scientists of diverse backgrounds for career success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will include information sessions, small group discussions and one-on-one meetings of mentor/mentee pairs during the conference. The overarching theme for the sessions is Developing Leaders, Growing Community, and Ensuring a Diverse Profession. Participants will have an opportunity to participate in parallel sessions on topics such as Career Success: Tips and Traps, Graduate School Success, Effective Presentation Skills, Strategic Networking, and Developing Successful Mentoring Relationships. The program will conclude with a Keynote address and a 100th Birthday Celebration of David Blackwell. The program is organized by the American Statistical Association's Committee on Minorities in Statistics with additional support provided by a workshop planning committee. The workshop website is https://community.amstat.org/cmis/events/dwmp/dwmp2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Approximately 110 individuals participated in the program, and 34 mentor-mentee pairs were matched for 1-1 mentoring, making this the largest Diversity Workshop and Mentoring program to date.</p> <p>The first full day of sessions included career success, success in graduate school, transformational leadership, overcoming challenges, influencing without authority, effective presentation skills, networking skills, and building mentoring relationships. In the first interactive session, Dr. Sally Morton (Virginia Tech), Dr. Sean Simpson (Wake Forest), Dr. Bill Pikounis (Johnson &amp; Johnson), and Betsy Gunnel (CDC), offered advice for career success. The role of mentoring throughout one&rsquo;s career was a prominent theme. Faculty Dr. Chris Kinson (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Dr. Emma Benn (Mount Sinai), and Dr. Miguel Marino (Oregon Health &amp; Science University) joined recent students and recent graduates Dr. Briana Stephenson (University of North Carolina), Dr. Luvenia Hellams-Dorsey (Iowa State University), Heather Mattie (Harvard University), and Pratik Manandhar (Duke University) to offer candid advice to current students. Dr. Brian Millen, (Eli Lilly), introduced the essential skillset and mindset of a transformational leader and offered advice on how to create positive change. A panel of statisticians discussed how they responded to and overcame self-perceived personal, academic, or professional challenges throughout their careers.&nbsp; Panel included Dr Rene&eacute; Moore (Emory University), Dr. Lloyd Edwards (University of Alabama, Birmingham), and Dr. Elvis Martinez (Travelers). Dr. Abie Ekangaki (Premier Research) presented a session offering insight into a leadership mindset and skills to influence, gain support from others and foster collaboration regardless of positional power. This is a critical skill in today's world where leadership is best defined as the ability to influence others with or without positional authority. Dr. Leslie McClure (Drexel University) presented tips and advice for delivering effective oral and poster presentations - a critical competency for success in a statistics career. Dr. Dionne Price (FDA and 2020 ASA Vice-President) emphasized networking and provided practical tips for creating and growing a professional network. In the final session, a panel provided perspectives and best practices for mentors and mentees to develop successful mentoring relationships. Panelists included Dr. Therri Usher (FDA), Dr. KnaShawn Morales (University of Pennsylvania), Dr. Abie Ekangaki (Premier Research), Dominque McDaniel (Purdue University), and Jeff Swartzel (Procter and Gamble)</p> <p>On day two, topics explored included interviewing advice and career search tips, building a personal brand online, and the dynamics of trust.

They provided tips for conducting career searches and interviewing for academic positions. Jemar Bather, a Biostatistics doctoral student at Harvard University, offered tips for creating and managing a meaningful personal brand by creating an online presence that reflects one&rsquo;s values, uniqueness and professional identity. Dr. Adrian Coles (Eli Lilly) facilitated a discussion on the importance of trust in workplace relationships, potential cross-cultural barriers to trust, and tools for evaluating and proactively building trust in workplace and school relationships. The session consisted of case studies and discussion of practical applications.</p> <p>On Tuesday, July 30, issues raised by mentees in the program were discussed in an open roundtable format with statisticians from industry, government and academia. Topics ranged from technical competency, cultural competency, mentorship, navigating organizational politics, self-advocacy and work-life balance. The formal presentations concluded with a keynote address on Wednesday, July 31. Dr. Talithia Williams, an innovative, award-winning Harvey Mudd College professor, presented a talk entitled, &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Power in Numbers: Unveiling Statistical Hidden Figures</em>.&rdquo; She shared her personal journey as a woman of color in statistics and her current research involving cataract disease modeling. Building on the movie &ldquo;<em>Hidden Figures</em>&rdquo; and the lives of the African America women who served as NASA &ldquo;human computers." Dr. Williams concluded by offering ways to excite public interest in data science to build upon the rich legacy of Hidden Figures that came before.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In addition to the scheduled sessions on Monday-Wednesday, mentors and mentees met one-to-one throughout the meeting and participated in some JSM activities together, such as the JSM opening mixer and the networking mixer sponsored by the ASA Committee on Minorities in Statistics.</p> <p>Evaluations of the program indicate that the sessions met the learning objectives and were very well-received by participants including mentors and mentees.
