<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for students to participate in the 2019 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Atomic Physics to be held June 9 - June 14, 2019 at Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island, and the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), "Cold Controlled Atoms and Molecules, Ultrafast Spectroscopy and Precision Measurements," to be held at the same location on June 8 - June 9, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference program includes many emerging research topics that are important for atomic, molecular, and optical physics, as well as several recent advances in this field.  The meeting offers an opportunity for students to study new applications of atomic, molecular, and optical science, and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for students enrolled at U.S. institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Atomic Physics Gordon Conference has a long history of bringing together top researchers and future leaders in the fields of atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and of reporting exciting recent breakthroughs. The conference always features a great deal of lively and informal discussions between students, speakers, and researchers at all levels of experience. Equally important as the presentations were the discussions outside the lecture hall, where ideas are generated, collaborations form, and new connections are made. The Atomic Physics Gordon Conference moves with the frontiers of atomic physics, relating this discipline to the other branches of the physical sciences whenever possible.     The 2019 conference session themes included quantum degenerate gases, quantum information science, quantum optics, cold molecules and chemistry, few- and many-body physics, precision measurements, atomic clocks, tests of fundamental symmetries in nature, searches for dark matter with atomic systems, ultrafast spectroscopy, frequency combs and connections to condensed-matter, particle, and gravitational physics. While we expected that a number of senior scientists will attend the 2019 conference, we also anticipated that, as in previous years, it would attract a large number of younger participants. We especially encouraged the participation of graduate students and postdocs. The beautiful setting of Salve Regina University affords many opportunities for informal scientific conversations, as well as afternoon activities both on-campus and in the city of Newport, Rhode Island.     The Gordon Research Seminar on Atomic Physics is a unique forum for graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education to present and exchange new data and cutting edge ideas.     This year?s seminar explored the wide range of research directions that AMO physics is taking, including newly developed tools and platforms, current progress in well-established subfields, and connections to other fields. The forms that AMO physics takes nowadays range from new theoretical frameworks to the development of novel technology, while it creates bridges to other areas of physics including particle physics, cosmology, condensed matter, and quantum information. The seminar presented a perfect opportunity for younger scientists to present their work and participate in lively discussions inside and outside of the auditorium.
