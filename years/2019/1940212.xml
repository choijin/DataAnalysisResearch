<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address consumer weather, and agricultural information needs as an advanced precipitation sensor and as a fully automated detector and classifier of insect species. Information on hydrometeor rate and type is critical for transportation safety and weather prediction. Wet snow and freezing rain events count among the worst natural disasters in North American history; the proposed device will be the first with the unambiguous capability for providing reliable remote detection of particles in a semi-frozen state for transportation management. Further, insect number, species, and motion vectors are critical for targeted pesticide applications that prevent the spread of disease and crop damage while preventing off-target damages to vulnerable species, such as bees. The combined commercial damages from precipitation and agricultural pests in the United States exceed $100 billion annually. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will exploit recent advances in lighting, digital imaging, motion detection, and image processing to develop a new Small Airborne Particle Imager for obtaining high-resolution forward-illuminated photography of precipitation particles, as well as insects and their trajectories. The goal is to create a device capable of detecting and photographing objects moving up to 10 m/s at resolutions as fine as 0.01 mm. Primary components of the Phase I effort involve the integration of multi-spectral, multi-polarization photography and design of a novel motion detection system capable of providing 3D motion vectors of objects 0.1 mm across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Phase I Small Airborne Particle Imager (SAPI) development program was aimed at meeting the cross-disciplinary measurement needs of airborne biological and physical particles.  The SAPI design goal is to classify and measure the 3D directional fluxes of both precipitation particles and a wide variety of insects. PFA has prior expertise and an established reputation in the area of precipitation sensing, so the focus of Phase I activities as insect detection and classification.  Working closely with the Salt Lake City Mosquito Abatement Division (SLCMAD), Phase I was aimed at customer discovery and surmounting three primary technical challenges in order to supply markets with camera technologies suited for automated airborne particle detection, measurement, and classification.  The first was to attain  imagery of fast-moving particles with sufficient resolution for species classification. The second was development of mechanism for automatically triggering a camera exposure of a small object. The third was development of the computational logic required for accurate particle 3D velocimetry.  Through a collaboration with Teledyne Lumenera, a 12 MP Lt-M4020 camera was acquired for testing with a 22 frames per second, a 3.45 um pixel size, and a 73 dB dynamic range.  Mosquitos were provided through collaboration with the Salt Lake Mosquito Abatement Division and separated by sex and species. Preliminary laboratory images show the potential to obtain crisp imagery of small objects at sufficient resolution to clearly distinguish mosquito type, specifically the difference between females and males and Culex Quinq and Aedes Serrensis.  For detection of mosquitos, and triggering of cameras, the primary route that was explored was to use an Adafruit VL53L0X commercial off-the-shelf micro-LIDAR time-of-flight (ToF) sensor.  The sensor accurately determines particle position at an adjustable frequency up to 200 Hz from the time of reflected return from a  narrow-beam  850 nm wavelength laser with a ranging accuracy of approximately 3% within a 20-degree cone in range of 100 mm distance  In laboratory tests, upon detection of a mosquito by the ToF sensor, a signal was sent to trigger a short burst of camera images that terminated upon exit of the mosquito from the ToF sensor cone, revealing the potential to provide the relevant information for establishing a 3-D mosquito velocity vector (2-D in the camera image plus 1-D for the ToF depth of field).  Deployment of the SAPI technology is aimed at a win-win by enabling precise measurement of what flying insects are present, in what numbers, and their direction of movement.  The potential is to help growers save money by micro-targeting pesticide control practices to regions actually at risk, simultaneously reducing off-target effects to bees and natural predators. A patent application filed on March 9, 2020, is pending on the concept (United States Patent Application No. 16/813,557  "Systems and methods for imaging of flying objects").
