<AbstractNarration>The project focuses on swarming cyber-physical systems (swarming CPS) consisting of a collection of mobile networked agents, each of which has sensing, computing, communication, and locomotion capabilities, and that have a wide range of civilian and military applications. Different from conventional static CPS, swarming CPS rely on mobile computing entities, e.g., robots, which collaboratively interact with phenomena of interest at different physical locations. This unique feature calls for novel sensing-motion co-design solutions to accomplish a variety of increasingly complex missions. Towards this, the overall research objective of this project is to establish and demonstrate a generic motion-sensing co-design procedure that will significantly reduce the complexity of the mission design for swarming CPS, and greatly facilitate the development of effective, efficient and adaptive control and sensing strategies under various environment uncertainties. This project aims to offer comprehensive scientific understanding of the dynamic nature of swarming CPS, contribute to generic engineering principles for designing collaborative control and sensing algorithms, and advance the enabling technologies of practically applying CPS in the challenging environment. The research solutions of this project aim to bring significant advance in the environmental sustainability, homeland security, and human well-being. The project provides unique interdisciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students through both research work and related courses that the PIs will develop and offer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project significantly advances the state of the art in cooperative control and sensing and provide an enabling technology for swarming CPS through highly interrelated thrusts: (1) a generic sensing and motion co-design procedure, which reveals the fundamental interplay between the sensing dynamics and motion dynamics of swarming CPS, will be proposed to facilitate the development of effective and efficient control and sensing strategies; (2) by following such co-design procedure, provable correct, computation efficient, and communication light control and sensing strategies will be developed for swarming CPS with constrained resources to accomplish specific missions, e.g., locating pollutants, in an unknown field, while navigating through uncertain spaces; (3) to provide an enabling mobile platform to verify the proposed strategies, innovative small, highly 3D maneuverable, noiseless, energy-efficient, and robust robotic fish fully actuated by smart material will be designed to meet the maneuvering requirements of the proposed algorithms; (4) novel Magnetic Induction (MI)-based underwater communication and localization solutions will be developed, which allows robotic fish to timely and reliably exchange messages, while simultaneously providing accurate inter-fish localization in the harsh 3D underwater environment; and (5) the proposed sensing-motion co-design strategies will be verified and demonstrated using a school of wirelessly interconnected robotic fish in both lab-based experiments and field experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The development of swarms of autonomous underwater robotic vehicles has a host of applications.  Such swarms can be employed for pollutant source seeking, water quality monitoring, tsunami and seaquake warning, surveillance of leakage in underwater oil and gas pipelines, study of fish behavior, and so on.  Toward this end, this project has developed innovative bio-inspired robotic fish designs wherein the fish are actuated by smart materials, are energy efficient and have the ability to perform 3-dimensional maneuvers.  Such fish designs have advantages over propeller-driven underwater vehicles, in that they are noiseless and have minimal impact on marine life.   The robotic fish perform forward and sideways motion by flapping motion of their fin(s).  Steering is achieved by means of an ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) soft actuator attached to the tail fin.  Depth change is achieved by means of an IPMC water electrolysis-enabled buoyancy control device.    The robotic fish have the ability to autonomously avoid collisions with static and moving obstacles in the dynamic underwater environment.  This collision avoidance feature has been developed using algorithms based on a collision cone approach.  These algorithms enable the robotic fish to perform reactive and optimal, energy-efficient maneuvers to avoid collisions.   Underwater communication among the robotic fish is facilitated by a magnetic induction (MI)-based approach.   The MI communication module enables the robotic fish to exchange messages with reliable performance, and this performance is measured in terms of acceptable values of transmission range, data rate and packet loss rate.  The MI-based scheme is also used to perform underwater relative localization, which is essential to sustain collaborative behavior in the swarm of robotic fish.   The robotic fish designs, collision avoidance capability and underwater communication and localization modules have been validated through detailed experimental testing.  The project has supported and trained several engineering/computer science students in the areas of underwater robotics, smart materials, trajectory planning for robotic swarms, and communication in underwater environments.  Outcomes of this research have been published/presented in several top-tier journals and conferences.
