<AbstractNarration>Interaction of fluids with magnesium-rich and silicon-poor rocks results in chemical reactions that remove carbon dioxide from the fluids. This has been proposed as a means of carbon sequestration. The world's largest body of such rocks occurs in Oman, and NSF has funded a drilling program to assess the mechanisms and chemistry of fluid-rock interaction. A hydrophone array was deployed in two of the drill holes to measure cracking related to this interaction. Preliminary data show an unanticipated high frequency of cracking, which also produces standing waves with the drill hole, an organ-pipe effect. This RAPID proposal is to now deploy a dense network of seismometers around the holes, in order to locate the cracking, measure how the cracks open, and measure the velocity structure around the holes. There is substantive collaboration with scientists from Oman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A network of short-period seismometers will be deployed around a hydrophone-instrumented ICDP hole in the Oman ophiolite. Data obtained during deployment of the hydrophones show unexpectedly high amounts of seismicity and the production of acoustic standing waves in the water column. This array will permit accurate location of the events, which occur at a rate of about 10 per hour, and focal mechanisms. Moreover, the standing waves can be used as a source to image the mantle section. The motivation behind the Oman project is to test the feasibility of carbon sequestration in ultramafic rocks. The project involves substantive international collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This grant funded the acquisition of a unique seismic dataset from the BA1 site of the Oman Drilling Project (OmanDP). 38, month-long, 3-component geophone records were acquired at a sampling rate of 1000 samples/second. The seismic stations were positioned around 400 m deep boreholes drilled by OmanDP into an actively serpentinizing/carbonating section of the Samail ophiolite. In lay terms, this means that groundwater was reacting with the host rock (peridotite). The various reactions that are associated with groundwater + peridotite are believed to fracture the rock while simultaneously moving carbon from the groundwater to the rock matrix. In other words, the reactions sequester carbon, but scientists do not know how fast these reactions occur. This means that we do not know how fast carbon is naturally being sequestered in these environments. While peridotite domains are relatively rare on land, they are very common in the oceans - vast regions of the ocean floor are peridotite domains.<br /><br />The seismic data that we acquired was archived at a national facility so that anyone will be able to download the data in the future.<br /><br />Our preliminary analysis of the data revealed that we did indeed detect large numbers of very small events that we suspect are due to peridotite alteration. Many of these events occurred in intense swarms (see swarm example figure). We also detected tremor-like signals of unknown origin (see tremor signal figure), that we suspect may also be related to the peridotite alteration process.<br /><br />Acquisition and archival of these data constitute a successful completion of this grant. Subsequent analyses of the data will be conducted under other grants.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/09/2020<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;A&nbsp;Sohn</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1945305/1945305_10637247_1599666042008_Figure_5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1945305/1945305_10637247_1599666042008_Figure_5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Seismic network"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1945305/1945305_10637247_1599666042008_Figure_5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Seismic network"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Left panel: Map of seismic deployments.
