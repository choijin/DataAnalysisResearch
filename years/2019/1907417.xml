<AbstractNarration>The fastest stars in the Galaxy are often referred to as hypervelocity stars (HVSs). These stars are excellent laboratories to study the extreme physics that accelerates stars. The stars are also key tracers of the Galaxy's elusive dark matter. Yet their origin and nature are still not well understood. With new data from the Gaia spacecraft, hundreds of these fast-moving elusive stars have been found. The investigator's primary goal to understand the origins and nature of HVSs. This project will also discover new HVSs using the next release of data from the Gaia mission. The chemical fingerprint of these fast-moving stars will also be measured to tag where they were born. The project will also measure the motions of these stars to constrain the mass of the Galaxy and determine the physics needed to accelerate stars to such high speeds. Each of these novel measurements will advance the field by providing key constraints of the origin of HVSs and use them to make inferences about the mass of the Milky Way and its dark matter halo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will engage the public and train the next generation of our STEM workforce with an emphasis on under-represented minority students. The investigator will work with students from the TARUS program at the University of Texas. This program focuses on training minority students in various aspects of computer coding and research methods. This project, through TARUS, will provide underrepresented minority students technical expertise that can be transferable throughout STEM careers. The project will also advance public scientific literacy by creating an annual 'Stars on the Run' outreach night for Austin, TX area. This event will enable the public to learn about the fastest stars discovered by this project. It will also focus teaching the public about basic astronomical and physical principals. This will be done through an exciting set of lectures, demos, and night sky observing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
