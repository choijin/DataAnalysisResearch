<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports student travel to attend the Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES) conference, to be held in Atlanta in August 2019. CHES is one of the leading international conferences on research on both design and analysis of cryptographic hardware and software implementations. The conference is a premier venue for new results from the research community as well as from the industry. Participation in conferences such as CHES is an extremely important part of graduate students' research and career development, providing the opportunity for them to present their own work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, interact with peers and senior researchers, and exposure to leading edge work in all aspects of cryptographic hardware and security in embedded systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
