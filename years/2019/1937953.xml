<AbstractNarration>There are national calls for improved production of research data that are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) in order to increase scientific discovery and enhance the societal and economic benefit of federal research and development (R&amp;D) funding. To stimulate growth of such a FAIR data ecosystem in the U.S., the concrete action taken by this project is to increase expert knowledge of FAIR-oriented tools and techniques, thereby creating new capacity for increasing the value of new and existing data sets. Developing a community of practice for making data FAIR and increasing the network of available expert trainers available will serve to accelerate awareness and build new knowledge in application of FAIR techniques in the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By means of a two-and-a-half-day intensive training session, the project will bring together practitioners and consultants from academia, non-profits, and industry.  The intended audience for the course is seasoned data stewards and researchers, research computing staff with depth in data-driven research, and library and informaticists. The trained teachers will be prepared to teach researchers, data experts, and research library staff at universities and research institutions who are dealing with the ever-growing complexity of data integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
