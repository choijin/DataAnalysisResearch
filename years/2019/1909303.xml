<AbstractNarration>Many marine fish species change sex during their lifetimes, and many of them are targets of commercial and recreational fishing. The timing of sex change in these animals is often related to body size, so populations typically consist of many small fish of the initial sex (usually female) and few large fish of the other sex (usually male). In nature, smaller fish are at a greater risk of mortality due to predation, but fishermen tend to seek larger fish. Thus fishing that targets larger individuals may skew sex ratios,  removing enough of the larger sex to hinder reproduction. However, the extent to which size-selective mortality affects sex-changing fishes is poorly understood. This research will explore the effects of size-selective mortality on the population dynamics of sex-changing species using an integrated set of field experiments and mathematical models. It will provide the first experimental exploration of the sensitivity of different sex-change patterns and reproductive strategies to selective mortality. The results will advance our knowledge of the susceptibility and resilience of sex-changing organisms to different types of size-selective mortality and will reveal how sex-changing species can recover after size-selection ceases, as in populations within marine reserves where fishing is suddenly prohibited. The findings will inform fisheries management policies, which do not currently consider the ability of a species to change sex in setting fisheries regulations. The project will provide professional training and research support for three graduate students and multiple undergraduates from California State University Northridge, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, and University of North Carolina Wilmington. The research findings will be communicated with fisheries managers, via national and international scientific meetings, posted on institutional websites and social media, and through publicly available modeling exercises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will consist of a three-year study of the effects of size-specific mortality on sex-changing fishes. Field experiments will use three closely related rocky-reef fishes that differ in sex-change pattern and are amenable to field manipulation and direct measurement of reproductive output. The species include a protogynous hermaphrodite (a female-to-male sex-change pattern common among harvested species) and two simultaneous hermaphrodites that differ in their ability to switch between male and female. Two types of experiments will be conducted on populations established on replicate patch reefs at Santa Catalina Island, California: (1) sex ratios will be manipulated to determine when the scarcity of males limits population-level reproductive output; and (2) experiments cross-factoring the intensity of mortality with the form of size-selection (i.e., higher mortality of large or small individuals) will test the demographic consequences of size-selective mortality.  In concert with the field experiments, size- and sex-structured population models (integral projection models) will be developed for use in three ways: (1) to evaluate how different types of selective mortality should affect population dynamics; (2) to predict outcomes of the field experiments, testing/validating the model and allowing direct prediction of the ecological significance of short-term selection; and (3) to fit to existing survey data for a fourth species, a widely fished, sex-changing fish, inside and outside of marine reserves. Part (3) will evaluate whether and how quickly the mating system and reproductive output of that species (not directly measurable in the field) is recovering inside reserves. This integrated set of field experiments and models will yield novel insight into the effects of size-selective mortality on the population dynamics of sex-changing marine species.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In many species of fishes, individuals first mature as one sex and later switch to reproduce as the other sex. The most common pattern is to be female first, then change to be male, though the opposite pattern also occurs (most famously in clownfish). Importantly, the female-first pattern is found in many species that are harvested, like the California sheephead (Fig. 1a). Usually, harvesting targets the larger individuals in a population (it is 'size-selective mortality'). This means that harvesting will not only remove individuals from a population, but change the sex ratio by removing more males than females. This project investigated whether that change in sex ratio made sex-changing species more or less resilient to size-selective mortality.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To invesigate this, we used a combination of mathematical models of fish populations, and field experiments with sex-changing gobies. In the models, we investigated whether sex-changing fishes would respond differently than non-sex changing fishes to protection in no-take marine reserves. No-take reserves (or 'marine protected areas') are an increasingly common marine conservation strategy. When designing no-take areas, managers need to know how big to make them to sustain populations, and how fast populations will recover inside them. Analyzing hte models revealed that whether sex-changing fishes needed bigger or smaller reserves than non-sex-changing fishes, and whether they would recover faster or slower than non-sex-changing fishes, depended on one key factor. That factor is how many males are needed per female to have successful reproduction. If one male can successfully fertilize the eggs of many females, sex-changing populations require smaller reserves and recover faster than non-sex-changing populations. If one male can only reproduce with a few females, the opposite is true. Of course this leads to the question, how many males are needed in a population? This was largely unknown before this project, and is the information provided by the field experiment.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The two species of sex-changing gobies we studied are useful for studying fish reproduction, because they lay their eggs in nests. Males guard nests and multiple females lay eggs in one nest. We provided gobies with artificial nests made of PVC tubes containing plastic sheets (Fig 1b, c); after eggs are laid divers can unroll the sheets to count the eggs (Fig. 1d). We manipulated goby populations to remove the larger individuals (mostly males) and recorded how much reproduction was reduced, and how quickly the populations returned to normal sex ratios. We found that just one male goby could fertilize the eggs of all nearby females, and that female gobies changed sex to restore the sex ratio within a few weeks. Thus goby populations are very resilient to size-selective harvesting. Looking back to the model results, the field experiment results suggest that sex-changing fish populations will tend to require smaller reserves and will recover more quickly in reserves.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The mathematical models developed for this project included a computational tool for estimating the harvest rate of fished populations. Because harvest tends to remove the larger individuals in a population, this computational tool can compare the relative numbers of large fish in a population to the relative numbers we would expect if there were no fishing, to estimate the harvest rate. This allows scientists to determine how much harvest is occuring in different populations, and predict how much a population will increase after harvest is stopped (as when a no-take reserve is put in place). This tool has now been applied to a variety of questions in the management of marine protected areas in California. We found that different locations on the California coast had different levels of harvesting before protected areas were put into place, allowing us to predict (correctly) that populations would increase in heavily fished places but not change in places that were not fished beforehand. Later, we used the same tool to confirm that there was no fishing inside protected areas, but intense fishing in sites that were not protected. We have also been able to suggest what species would likely show faster recoveries inside protected areas, and what types and amounts of sampling (by divers or by remote-controlled submarines) are needed to collect enough data to detect changes in the populations. All of this information has had the Broader Impact of influencing the way the state of California manages their marine resources.
