<AbstractNarration>Community Colleges enroll a higher percentage of Hispanic students than any other sector of higher education.  Moreover, U.S. institutions of higher education are experiencing a growth trajectory of Hispanic student enrollment, with more than 2.3 million students currently enrolled.  Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) are essential points of access because they enroll a majority of all Hispanic college students and nearly half of all HSIs are community colleges. This project will bridge two NSF initiatives: Mentor-Connect (M-C) (DUE-1204463 and DUE-1501183) and KickStarter (KS) (HRD-1450661). These initiatives support community and technical colleges in learning about funding opportunities in relevant STEM programs at the NSF, and mentor institutional teams (faculty and administrators) in developing their project ideas, crafting a proposal, and submitting to the program of interest. To date, these two programs have collectively served 32 HSIs in nine states, with student enrollments ranging from 400 to 40,000 and Hispanic enrollment percentages ranging from 27% to 97%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable Mentor-Connect and KickStarter to work together to: 1) support three annual cohorts of four teams from Community College-HSIs (CC-HSIs) with a program that combines the expertise of the two initiatives; 2) support the cohorts with mentors who are experienced ATE PIs, and/or with HSI-relevant ATE resources; 3) collect data on the effectiveness of the bridging strategy and augmentation activities; and 4) assess the impact as a proof of concept model for the ATE program (or any NSF program) to become more ethnically and racially diverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The HSI ATE Hub, a three-year collaborative research project, established a bridge between two successful programs: Mentor-Connect (DUE-1501183, 1840856) and KickStarter (HRD-1450661, 1929686). Mentor-Connect mentors 2-year college faculty to develop competitive proposals for the NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Program, and KickStarter facilitates strategic STEM assessment and planning to drive competitive STEM proposal development at 2-year Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs).  The primary program goals for HSI ATE Hub are: build capacity and leadership at 2-year HSIs for developing competitive ATE proposals and elevate 2-year HSIs as drivers of their community?s economic success via technician education.  Strategies to accomplish these goals included: 1) providing two-tiered mentoring of KickStarter participants to leverage the strength of the STEM planning completed through KickStarter with ATE proposal development mentoring provided by Mentor-Connect; 2) community building that would connect HSI ATE grantees with one another for learning and sharing; and, 3) identify or develop and make readily accessible resources specific to two-year college HSIs to support their work in meeting the needs of Latinx students and crafting competitive ATE proposals to advance technician education programs at their colleges.  Table 1 lists the program objectives under these goals and strategies, the mapping of program objectives to four research questions, and the program's performance to those objectives.    Data sets from three annual HSI ATE Hub Cohorts, four prior KickStarter Cohorts, and nine Mentor-Connect Cohorts were aggregated to assess the following research questions about 2-year HSIs:  1. What are unique opportunities/barriers/challenges related to STEM program development and grant-writing for advanced technological education?  2. How do we build capacity to pursue the opportunities and address the barriers/challenges?  3. How do mentoring efforts/styles related to STEM program development and grant-writing need to differ for HSI faculty? 4. What types of resources are relevant to the HSI ATE Community?    The responses to the research questions are provided in Table 2.  Figures 1 and 2 also support the findings as noted in Table 2 and in the discussion below. While providing valuable insights for developing and implementing mentoring programs, the first strategy did not achieve anticipated outcomes. For a variety of unforeseen reasons, the projected number of KickStarter participant colleges did not choose to transfer to Mentor-Connect to develop ATE proposals. Few among those that transferred succeeded in submitting proposals and/or receiving grant awards. Teams were more successful when they followed through to proposal submission with their original mentoring initiative. Figure 1 shows the total numbers of 2-year HSIs pursuing ATE proposals that were served by both programs together and individually over eight years.  Figure 1 also helps explain the ebbs and flows in recruiting 2-year HSIs to Mentor-Connect prior to establishing HSI ATE Hub and after HSI ATE Hub was established in 2018.  Of note, the first NSF HSI program solicitation, released in early 2018, attracted 2-year HSIs away from ATE proposal submission.   The Mentor-Connect and KickStarter programs operated under different approaches as summarized in Table 3.  Primary differences included 1) cohort sizes (Mentor-Connect &gt;= 20 2-year colleges, both non-HSIs and some HSIs and  KickStarter 5-6 HSIs); 2) one annual submittal cycle (Mentor-Connect) vs. try until you succeed over  multiple years (KickStarter); 3) Focus on mentoring for ATE proposal writing and developing faculty leadership (Mentor-Connect) versus focus on mentoring competitive proposal writing across multiple NSF programs and developing institutional leadership through strategic STEM assessment and planning.  Figure 2 overlays data about ATE submissions, declinations and awards for Mentor-Connect and KickStarter from 2013 to 2019.  Data for other NSF programs are shown for KickStarter HSIs, to illustrate the contribution to building capacity at 2-year HSIs for competitive grant development and to support some of the responses to the research questions in Table 2. Two strategies have proven successful. Measurable positive impacts are resulting from curating HSI-specific resources and providing faculty development designed to guide use of the resources and broaden educator understanding to enable them to adjust to the changing student demographics in positive ways.
