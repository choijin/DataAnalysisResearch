<AbstractNarration>This grant partially supports the participation of students from US-based institutions in the Doctoral Symposium at the 2019 Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) conference. MICCAI is the annual conference of MICCAI society with expected over 1,000 attendees in 2019 from all the world. This grant will help the career development of some of the brightest junior researchers in MICCAI fields attending the conference, contributes to the research community in general by drawing attention to an important aspect of graduate student development. The doctoral symposium committee will select awardees, with priority given to those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funding will partially support travels for 10 US-based students to attend MICCAI 2019 and participate in the doctoral symposium. The proposed symposium will feature both invited and selected research presentations that focus on MICCAI topics. The MICCAI Society is dedicated to the promotion, preservation and facilitation of research, education and practice in the field of medical image computing and computer assisted medical interventions including biomedical imaging and robotics. The multidisciplinary nature of these emerging fields brings together clinicians, bioscientists, computer scientists, engineers, physicists, and other researchers who are contributing to, and need to keep abreast of, advances in the methodology and applications. This doctoral symposium provides an opportunity to students including students from US based institutions to present, discuss, and receive feedback on original research within the broader community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
