<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Paragraph:&lt;br/&gt;This proposal funds travel for a group of NSF-invited genomics researchers to attend the "Perspectives in Comparative Genomics &amp; Evolution" meeting being jointly organized by NIH-NHGRI/USDA/NSF that will take place Aug. 15-16, 2019 at the Marriott North Bethesda. This meeting will address growing opportunities as well as challenges in the fields of Evolutionary and Comparative Genomics. It includes presentations and discussions about the genomes of humans, traditional and non-traditional lab organisms, and agricultural and wild species, as well as how their comparative study can help scientists to devise strategies that can better impact human health, agriculture and conservation practices. Invited speakers are recognized authorities and emerging scientists who are applying cutting-edge genomics and bioinformatics tools to address a broad range of fundamental questions in evolutionary genomics. This interagency conference is intended to identify effective strategies that can broaden the impact of comparative genomics research by targeting research efforts that impact basic, applied, and health focused systems. Speakers and attendees are being invited paying close attention to balanced representation of gender and seniority level, as well as the need to cover the broadest possible theme range. Among the expected outcomes of this conference will be the production of one or more white papers, as well as an interagency position statement. These documents will be shared with the general scientific community, outside stakeholders, as well as program officers in each of the participating federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Paragraph:&lt;br/&gt;The explosive growth of available genomic data and related resources for a broad range of species, including humans, model organisms, species of agricultural relevance, and wildlife species, has created opportunities to better understand basic principles of comparative genomics and evolution, as well as potential applications to health, agriculture, and conservation. Challenges include the need to develop methods that can handle vast amounts of data, assurances for high quality of genomes and feature annotations, and the development of effective computational and bioinformatics approaches that take into account phylogenetic principles. This meeting will address these needs by bringing together experts with diverse backgrounds, expertise, and perspectives in comparative genomics. The format includes series of short talks on key themes, as well as extensive follow-up discussions and targeted breakout sessions, maximizing the open exchange of novel approaches and emerging solutions to shared problems. Expected outcomes include identifying areas of synergy, current gaps in knowledge and resources, as well as defining areas of relevance to the NIH/NHGRI for understanding human health and disease. Partnerships with the USDA and NSF will place further emphasis on the relevance of species that are of agricultural and economic relevance, as well as the pressing need for genomics research on wildlife species. Overall, the planned in-depth discussions will help to identify aspects of comparative genomics that should be at the "forefront" of this burgeoning field, meeting the demands of a range of stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award was co-funded by the Enabling Discovery throughout GEnomic (EDGE) Program and the Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Infrastructure Innovation for Biological Research (IIBR) Program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

DRAFT  The goal of this project was to provide travel support to a meeting ("Perspectives in Comparative Genomics &amp; Evolution") organized by NHGRI/USDA/NSF and that took place in August of 2019 to discuss the emerging needs, and most promising directions for the growing field of comparative genomics. This meeting provided a unique vehicle for comparative genomics experts who study a broad range of organisms to get together and brainstorm about the opportunities provided by the recent advances in genomics, as well as the most critical challenges faced by the field.The specific goals of the meeting were to obtain a big picture look at the present state of the field of comparative genomics, addressing common points of interest across a broad range or organisms, including humans, traditional and non-traditional model organisms, species of agricultural interest, wildlife species and microbes. In total, the project covered the travel/lodging needs for 23 researchers, including 22 from institutions in the US and one from abroad, reflecting a broad range of attendees with balanced gender representation, career stage representation, and inclusion of individuals from groups that have been historically underrepresented in science     The key outcomes of this meeting can be summarized as:  Identified key areas of synergy. Identified gaps in knowledge and resources that need attention and development. Made recommendations for areas of focus for comparative genomics as a whole, and specifically to NHGRI, with relevance to understanding human health and disease.      Specific recommendations for improving the impact of future comparative genomics efforts included:  Better chromosome-level sequencing and analysis methods. Higher quality reference genomes for more species across the tree of life. Improved methods for cross-species comparison of genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, and traits. Better genomic visualization methods (e.g. genome browsers).  Technology development support for synthetic genomics. NHGRI leadership in trans-NIH support for non-traditional models of health and disease.           Last Modified: 11/25/2020       Submitted by: Claudio Mello]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
