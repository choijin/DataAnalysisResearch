<AbstractNarration>This award enables about 16 US students to participate in the 2019 Association of Computing Machinery International Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD-2019) held in Amsterdam, Netherlands, June 30 - July 5, 2019. The aim is to support a diverse group of students,  including students from under-represented groups and make it possible for them to attend the conference and discuss and disseminate their work. The conference also provides an opportunity for them to interact with future national and international scientific collaborators. The students will gain important training in data management research and this will contribute to the development of a new generation of researchers, educator and practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SIGMOD conference, which was established in 1975, has a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction, including research papers, tutorials, panels, industrial papers, technical demonstrations, and undergraduate research papers. The program includes publications relating to all aspects of data management defined broadly, and particularly encourages publications on topics of emerging interest in the research and development communities. The program also includes workshops that demand dedicated coverage due to their relevance to the current data management research and development, industrial exhibits, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry. All these activities provide a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge, experience, and research work with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
