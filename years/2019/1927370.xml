<AbstractNarration>This project supports participation in the thirty-ninth annual Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE) at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida on October 26-27, 2019. Starting its first conference at Virginia Tech in 1981, the SEARCDE is held annually by various institutions in the Southeast region of the United States. The conference provides a unique platform for all researchers in the field of differential equations and applications and related fields to share their research experiences, to disseminate recent results, and to establish collaborations. The SEARCDE aims to promote research and education in all aspects of differential equations and applications and related fields. Many research experts, beginning researchers, and graduate students will be brought together to give talks, to exchange recent research and new ideas, to discuss open problems in the area of differential equations and applications and related fields. Beginning researchers and graduate students will be able to learn from plenary and invited speakers, interact with experts, and meet with colleagues to discuss working problems. Women, minority, and underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to participate in the SEARCDE.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of the conference is to create a friendly atmosphere for participants to share their findings and recent progress, explore new techniques and discuss open problems. The thirty-ninth SEARCDE will focus on three major areas:  linear and nonlinear analysis of differential equations, mathematical fluid mechanics and mathematical biology, and numerical and computational methods of partial differential equations. There will be five internationally renowned experts giving three one-hour plenary talks and two thirty-minute invited talks on these topics. Several researchers will give twenty-minute contributed talks divided into six parallel sessions.  Junior researchers and graduate students whose research interests are closely related to these topics will benefit greatly from this conference. Information about the conference can be found at https://commons.erau.edu/searcde/2019-39th/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
