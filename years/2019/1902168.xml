<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of graduate students and postdoctoral associates at the "Twenty-Second Riviere-Fabes Symposium" held at the University of Minnesota from April 5 to April 7, 2019.  The award gives early-career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of funding a chance to attend and participate in this conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium focuses on recent developments in the field of analysis, this year especially in the fields of partial differential equations, applied analysis, harmonic analysis, and geometric measure theory.   More information can be found on the symposium web page https://math.umn.edu/rivi%C3%A8re-fabes-symposium/riviere-fabes-2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
