<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in providing new techniques for brewers, distillers, biofuel producers, and biopharmaceutical companies to increase yield, reduce cost and minimize potential losses.  Microwave flow cytometry (microFC) technology is promising to accurately measure cell density, monitor cell viability, and detect microorganism contaminations at high throughput and in real time without the use of expensive reagents. The long term and continuous monitoring process also requires minimal human intervention. Thus, the technology is promising to provide its users precise and instantaneous information for process control and optimization as well as early contamination detection.  It can help improve yield and product quality while save water, energy and manpower, while promoting discoveries of new biomanufacturing processes and new products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will explore the market potential for microwave flow cytometry (microFC) technology by investigating the needs of companies that use biological cells to manufacture products. microFC is based on novel microwave interferometer technology, which includes novel tuning mechanisms to cover broadband frequency ranges for specificity and allows for high sensitivity sensing. Employed in the interferometer system is a microwave sensor with embedded microfluidics that transport individual cells through the sensor, measuring multiple parameters of yeast cells and bacteria including cell density (cells/mL), volume, and physiological state (viability and bedding cells). The measurements are reagent-free and noninvasive. microFC's are expected to enable low cost and easy-to-use online cell monitoring, which will fill an instrumentation gap in both industry and academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
