<AbstractNarration>This broadening participation project will focus on a regional workshop aimed at increasing Historically Black Colleges and Universities' (HBCUs) capacity to develop high quality proposals for future competitions of various programs in the Division of Research on Learning. The proposed effort will occur through three specific steps involving a: (1) pre-workshop webinar to introduce and lay the foundation for the opportunity; (2) full two-day workshop to engage participants in a rigorous grant-writing exercise; and (3) post workshop follow-up to provide ongoing support and proposal development guidance. Through a theory-driven process, the goal is to establish some degree of conformity for maximizing grant productivity around strategies and ideas shown to be effective in retaining students in the STEM pipeline. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multi-tiered workshop will establish a launching pad for increasing attendees' capacity to build on prior knowledge and use best practices to improve future grant writing efforts. Specialized activities will help prepare HBCUs to increase their contributions to diversifying the future STEM workforce, support innovation and creativity in STEM fields, expand networking strategies, and promote opportunities to learn. Central to this capacity-building effort will be a focus on understanding the current research context and expectations for competitive participation in funding opportunities offered by NSF. This, in turn, will align with the Foundation's strategic direction for broadening participation in STEM through meaningful cutting-edge STEM education research. Resources from the workshop will be made available online to facilitate broader dissemination of information beneficial to HBCUs and other education institutions engaging in broadening participation efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
