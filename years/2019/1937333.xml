<AbstractNarration>The NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE) 2019 Grantees Conference is a two-day annual event that brings together nanoscale educators, researchers, and experimentalists from academia, government, and industry to highlight information on the research and education activities funded by NSF NSE grants. The primary goals are to promote dissemination of innovative research progress, to facilitate research partnerships, and to identify future research directions. Panel discussions will be moderated by NSF-funded researchers as well as NSF Program Directors. The conference helps advance the goals of the NSF and the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative. Conference materials are made available to the wider audience following the event at the website: www.nseresearch.org, along with archival information from previous events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSE grantees conference will foster interaction among academic, government, and industry researchers in nanotechnology fields. Keynote presentations and interactive panel discussions on the grand challenges in and convergence of nanotechnology generate opportunities for creative interdisciplinary collaboration. Identification and exploration of future trends in nanotechnology and cyberinfrastructure enable researchers and industry to prepare to fully capitalize on next-generation capabilities. The first day of the conference will focus on Progress in foundational nanotechnology and infrastructure: Nanoscale processes in neural systems; AI confluence with nanoscale modeling, design and systems; Quantum phenomena in nanobio and environmental systems, Cell Nanocomponents and Synthetic Biology, Nanomachines; and Nano research centers, NNCI and Nano-HUB. The second day will feature Grand opportunities and convergence: Nanosustainability and Nanoplastics in Environment; Nano- biosensing; Metamaterials; Nano-Geosciences and convergence; Convergence approaches - accelerators; Convergence Learning challenges; and Societal and environmental aspects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
