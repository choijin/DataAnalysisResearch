<AbstractNarration>This project will support US-based participants in the upcoming Young Geometric Group Theory IX conference to be held February 24-28, 2020 in Brittany, France. This will be the ninth iteration of the Young Geometric Group Theory meetings, which have been held every year since 2012. The conferences typically attract between 100 and 200 young researchers. The meeting will have three main types of events: minicourses given by four established experts in the field, informal discussion sessions, and research talks given by junior researchers in geometric group theory. This format allows young researchers to publicize their work, allows graduate students and postdocs to learn cutting-edge methods from their peers and from experts, and provides an opportunity to foster new and international collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric group theory is a fairly young and very active field, and the selection of minicourses and speakers at this conference will reflect various current key directions of research, including groups of birational transformations, Furstenberg-Poisson boundaries and their connections to geometry, conformal dynamics, and groups acting on non-positively curved spaces. Participants will be exposed to a very broad spectrum of topics at the forefront of research in geometric group theory. As most of the participants are expected to be graduate students and early-career mathematicians, they will be able to greatly broaden their knowledge of the field. Through the selection of speakers and participants, the conference will promote the growing diversity that geometric group theory enjoys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information, please see the conference website https://yggt2020.sciencesconf.org/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Over 160 people applied during the registration period (Sepember 15 - November 30, 2019). Due to the capacity of the conference venue, the number of participants was limited to 120 people. Priority was given to Ph.D. students and young post-docs in the area of geometric group theory. All other factors being equal, we prioritized those with an earlier application date. The event was attended by 115 participants, including 23% of women, coming from 16 different countries: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Poland, Russia, and USA. The project covered all participants based in the US and Canada that requested support, up to and including room and board, and travel costs.</p> <p>The program consisted of 4 mini-courses, and 6 junior talks. Several parallel discussions sessions were organized on topics were chosen daily according to the interest of the participants, whom also lead the discussions. Since the audience was almost entirely composed of young researchers, lightening talk sessions were planned so that they could introduce themselves and their mathematical interests. In addition a booklet gathering the research statements of every participant was distributed on the first day.
