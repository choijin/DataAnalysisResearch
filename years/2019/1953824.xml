<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for US participants in the workshop "Mathematical Trends in Medical Imaging", which will be held at the University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA from June 23-26, 2020. The workshop will bring together junior and established researchers from different US institutions working on both theoretical and practical aspects of inverse problems and imaging to discuss recent trends and new challenges in the field, mainly focusing on its applications in medical imaging. Topics include, but are not limited to, mathematical modelling, analytic and geometric methods, computational approaches, and numerical algorithms.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This four-day workshop will feature 24 forty-minute plenary talks that will address the latest progress in research at the interface of mathematics and medical imaging, and will discuss open problems that will drive the development in these areas in the coming years. The discussion sessions between the talks will foster communication and future collaboration among participants coming from mathematics, computer science, as well as radiology departments. A contributed poster session will also provide a platform for junior researchers to share their research. This award gives graduate students and early career researchers, including members of underrepresented groups and those without other funding sources, an opportunity to attend and participate in this workshop. Over 45 participants are anticipated with approximately 20 junior researchers. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be made available at the conference webpage: https://cam.uchicago.edu/events/event/1294/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
