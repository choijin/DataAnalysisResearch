<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be in the railroad, civil infrastructure, and engineering services industries, by providing engineering firms and infrastructure owners the means to enhance public safety while significantly reducing the costs of bridge infrastructure monitoring and revenue losses due to infrastructure downtime due to sudden events. Thousands of sudden events, such as vehicle impacts and overweight vehicle crossings, occur annually on the over 700,000 bridges in the U.S. Many go unnoticed or unreported, despite their potential to induce structural failures or hidden damage that significantly reduces the structure's service life. This project will provide a cost-effective wireless solution to detect, quantify, and report sudden events on civil infrastructure in near real-time. The proposed solution will replace three existing types of monitoring systems with one compact, easy-to-deploy device at a fraction of the cost of even a single legacy system. The rapid condition assessment capability will further reduce traffic disruption, thereby lowering daily economic losses that can range in the millions of dollars and offering the potential to make the nation's transportation infrastructure safer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project seeks to develop a smart IoT monitoring system for rapid condition assessment of civil infrastructure under sudden events. Wired systems are prohibitively expensive for most structures, particularly bridges in remote locations, and existing wireless solutions following a duty-cycle approach to reduce power draw are incapable of always-on monitoring needed for sudden event detection. The objective of the research is to develop a low-cost IoT system to maintain always-on monitoring, so as not to miss an event, under a minimal power budget, without sacrificing data fidelity, and with a very low false positive rate. To this end, an asynchronously-triggered, synchronized data acquisition method will be developed, using high-fidelity wireless sensors that are tightly coupled with a programmable event-based switch capable of always-on operation. This method would enable the system to maintain ultralow-power operation indefinitely, and upon event detection, to rapidly transition to high-fidelity measurement. Uniquely, the pre- and post-event data are processed and stitched together across multiple sensors without the need for a priori synchronization. Experiments will be conducted to demonstrate the system?s capabilities to capture the onset of sudden events and present structural damage assessment in near real-time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the course of this SBIR Phase I project, Embedor Techologies developed and validated a prototype for a smart IoT system for rapid condition assessment of bridges under sudden events. Bridges form a key part of the nation's transportation infrastructure, and maintaining them in a state of good repair is critical both for public safety and the economic activity they support.  Sudden events can be damaging, e.g., vehicle impacts and earthquakes, or routine, e.g. train crossings. In both cases, their timing is unpredictable, which makes it a challenge to capture them with power-constrained wireless sensors that normally rely on duty-cycling to reduce power draw. This project takes on that challenge. Through a combination of hardware and software advancements, a wireless monitoring system for railway bridges has been developed and validated through laboratory testing and analysis, using data captured from real railway bridges.  Three key components enable the system to provide high-fidelity, always-on sudden event monitoring.  First, a smart triggering circuit was developed for a high-fidelity wireless sensor platform suitable for structural analysis applications. This circuit enables power-efficient implementation of long-term monitoring and trigger sensing without losing any part of the event's data.  Second, data synchronization schemes are proposed for both online and offline monitoring. Precisely synchronized data from multiple sensors is critical for structural analysis applications, yet traditional synchronization approaches fare poorly for sudden event scenarios due to the need for a priori time synchronization. The proposed synchronization schemes, which do not have that problem, were tested extensively and found to achieve data synchronization precision on the order of 10 microseconds, a level sufficient for most structural analysis application.  Third, an adaptive approach to filtering out bad data (e.g., from faulty sensors) and events of no interest (e.g., small vibrations, hi-rail vehicles, etc.) was developed, with the goal of reducing the false positive detection rate of the sudden event monitoring system. Keeping the false positive rate low is important, as a system that "cries wolf" frequently can cause bridge engineers to lose confidence in its results. Using a previously-collected dataset of railway bridge vibration data, a three-stage strategy was developed, which combines adaptive knowledge-centric and event-centric methods to filter out upwards of 99.9% of false event detections.  These components were integrated into a fully-functional prototype system that was tested on a scale-model structure under simulated earthquake scenarios. The system successfully demonstrated the capability to capture 100% of the structure's transient response under sudden events without any data loss.  The value of this techology to assist in the inspection and maintenance of bridge infrastructure has been recognized by the railroad industry, and planning for pilot projects with industry partners to validate the system at scale on in-service railway bridges is underway.
