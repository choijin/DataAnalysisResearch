<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable a new generation of small satellites to aid many essential functions ranging from environmental management and law enforcement to natural disaster evaluation and urban studies, improving forestry and agricultural yields, oil and gas pipeline inspection, emissions and marine pollution monitoring, land-use surveys and planning, and a host of other commercial, industrial, environmental and humanitarian use-cases.  The technology will enable access to a $10B addressable market of new space applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a new approach to small satellite constellation operations through integrated on-board data fusion and processing.   The technology is a first-of-its-kind, high payload volume bus closely coupled with image processing and object detection techniques based on neural net technologies.  This is a deeply layered approach that create “edge-intelligence” on the satellite itself. This project will: 1) use building detection as a notional example to demonstrate a proof-of-concept deep learning system fusing data from multiple sources (in this case, visible RGB and short wave infra-red imagery); 2) assess the performance and compatibility of the data fusion and processing algorithms on a low size, weight and power (SWaP) processor customized for space-based applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Phase I effort focused on demonstrating multi-sensor data fusion and on-board processing for a small satellite bus, and showed that combining optical and infrared information can lead to higher detection accuracy for features of interest (e.g. building detection in satellite imagery).  It also showed that pre-trained machine learning algorithms can successfully be exercised on small size, weight and power computing platforms that are optimized for "on-board" processing, and provide real-time feature detection in a matter of seconds using no more than a few watts of power.  The results of the project are expected to impact the use of earth observation satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), and validate the need for on-board data fusion and processing of multiple signals for efficient and low-cost collection of all the signatures associated with a particular area or feature of interest.   This will in turn, enable a move towards integrated, multi-functional small-sats capable of not only accommodating a number of different payload sensors within a compact form factor, but intelligently fusing and processing their information on board the spacecraft itself to create the equivalent of "edge intelligence" in the small-sat world and provide:  Game-changing reductions in capital cost for constellation deployment through amortization of bus and launch costs over multiple payloads; Coincident gathering of multiple signals (e.g. optical RGB, multi-spectral, RF, etc.) from a single platform; and  Near real-time intelligence for dynamic tasking and response (vs. transmission of large amounts of raw data through narrow a bandwidth ?pipe? for terrestrial processing and analysis).
