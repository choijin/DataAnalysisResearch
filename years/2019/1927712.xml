<AbstractNarration>Social computing systems bring enormous value to society by harnessing the data generated by members of a community. While each individual alone can offer only limited knowledge, time, and effort, a crowd together can solve challenging societal problems. General approaches to aggregate such data from crowds exists, but are typically suboptimal and inefficient. This project applies information-theoretic techniques to explore the fundamental sample/computation/accuracy trade-offs in social computing. The success of the proposed research will make progress towards a society that efficiently learns from the activities of its members for greater societal good. The proposed research is strongly integrated with an education plan that aims to develop a new graduate course on algorithmic foundations of social computing and innovative adaptive learning platforms that integrates the technology of social computing into the domain of education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate several topics: (1) characterizing the fundamental trade-offs between the available budget and the accuracy of the answers in crowd-sourcing platforms, by applying information-theoretic tools and methods; (2) designing efficient algorithms achieving this fundamental trade-off using techniques from spectral graph theory and coding theory, as well as by applying a family of novel rank-breaking approaches to reduce complexity; and (3) characterizing the three-way fundamental trade-offs between computational complexity, sample size, and accuracy in aggregating preferences from partially observed traces of online and mobile activities.</AbstractNarration>
