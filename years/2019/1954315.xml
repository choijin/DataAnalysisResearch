<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The 2020 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) entitled Functional Inorganic Materials - Exploratory Synthesis, Advanced Characterization, and Computational Methods, is funded in-part by the several program in NSF's Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. It will be held at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire, beginning with the GRS on July 25-26, immediately followed by the GRC that runs from July 26-31, 2020. The cultivation of innovative approaches to address the most pressing challenges currently faced is enhanced by the inclusive and collegial nature of the GRC, as well as the emphasis on sharing unpublished data. A mixture of students, post-doctoral associates, and early career scientists interact along side with distinguished veteran scientists to discuss new and exciting scientific directions. Through these interactions the expertise of scientists with decades of experience inspires and educates future leaders. The GRC is specifically structured to promote the exchange of ideas and creating collaborations between researchers from academics, government laboratories, and industry. The GRS that immediately precedes the GRC, is a meeting solely for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, which promotes an environment to introduce new graduate students into a conference atmosphere. This allows all students and fellows to present their work in a low stress environment, and it promotes networking among peers. The organizers are committed to a meeting that promotes diversity, with particular attention placed on encouraging participation of women, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solid state chemistry has played an essential role in the design, discovery, and optimization of new functional inorganic materials to meet every-growing societal demands for smaller, faster, cleaner, and more sustainable technologies. The road from exploratory synthesis to the commercial application is complex and inherently a multidisciplinary path. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Solid State Chemistry is a unique meeting that brings together a diverse group of scientists investigating solid state materials and their applications. Researchers in this field are interested in the discovery of new materials, their structure-property relationships, and ultimately the use of these materials in technological applications. The 2020 conference focuses on functional inorganic materials - their synthesis, characterization, and computational methods. Sessions cover the science of synthesis, advanced characterization techniques, and diverse approaches to materials chemistry. Other sessions focus on materials and technologies where solid state chemistry is essential, such as energy conversion and storage, magnetism, and electronics. Researchers from academia, national laboratories, and industry provide a broad perspective that seeks to strengthen the links between fundamental studies and applications. Speakers and poster presenters are explicitly encouraged to emphasize advances and discuss unpublished results, while sharing new ideas on synthesis, characterization, computation, and theory. The organizers strongly encourage active contribution to discussions and participation in poster sessions that offer an excellent opportunity for presenting and learning about new and exciting research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
