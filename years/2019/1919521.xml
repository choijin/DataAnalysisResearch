<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NONTECHNICAL ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $7000 are requested towards the travel expenses and conference related ground transportation uses  for sixteen US based speakers at the United States-Japan Polymer Symposium: "Macromolecules: Challenges and Opportunities for the 21st Century", to be held June 18-21, 2019 at Stanford University. The request includes part-support for facility usage. The goal of the symposium is to cover state-of-the-art developments in controlling polymer structures and understanding structure property relationships to achieve novel macromolecular designs and precisely controlled materials properties and functions. There will be 34 speakers (16-US, 17-Japan) half among them world leaders in their fields and the other half younger rising stars. A total attendee of 50 is anticipated,the planned small number intended to ensure rigorous interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The symposium brought prominent leaders and rising young researchers, including 16 speakers from the US and 17 speakers from Japan, to discuss the exciting and rapidly advancing frontiers of polymer science as well as remaining challenges. The topics ranged from new synthesis and design of polymers to new engineering and characterization techniques to understand the structure-property relationships. The discussions covered a broad range of synthetic polymers with increasingly complex and diverse structures and functionalities to address global challenges ranging from human health to energy and sustainability.

The poster session was overwhelmingly praised by all the symposium participants (speakers, observers, and industry sponsors) and student presenters. The poster session provided the students an invaluable opportunity to discuss their polymer research with academic and industrial researchers from both countries. An international committee of 2 senior faculty (Profs. Matyjaszewski and Sawamoto) and 2 junior female faculty (Profs.
