<AbstractNarration>This award will fund efforts by the Harvard AI Robotics Labor (AIRL) project. The team will research advances in artificial intelligence and robotics that are likely to impact the workplace of the future and thus the employment and wages of American workers. It will assess the extent to which recent technological advances in robots and artificial intelligence are affecting current workers and the specific tasks they perform on the job.  Since AI and robots are more cost effective substitutes for workers in some activities compared to others, the investigators will focus on specific work tasks in carefully defined occupational categories. The goal is to determine what tasks will be key to future jobs and what skills humans will need to succeed in those tasks. The findings of the project should help school and career counselors inform students and job seekers about the prospects in various jobs and to provide information to individuals, firms, and policymakers who seek to advance the well-being of American workers in the global economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project brings together a unique team of experts to assess the future of work. The project includes efforts to bring together the engineering and computer science experts who develop new technologies with the economics, sociology, psychology and business experts who study how firms implement technologies and change work tasks when technology changes. Past technologies have invariably created new jobs as well as altered older jobs, so the investigators will study how leading edge firms that have invested in new robots or in the latest work-related algorithms are reorganizing their work tasks among occupations, and the pay and benefits associated with different types of work. It will determine the skills and knowledge that workers will likely need in the new jobs as well as to continue working in existing occupations. Finally, since new technologies do not come out of the blue but are developed by engineers and computer scientists, and are influenced by business and government users of the technologies, the investigators will analyze the factors behind the choices of which tasks to digitalize or to develop robots to undertake, and the potential for moving those choices in worker-friendly directions. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop the necessary research personnel, research infrastructure, and foundational work to expand the opportunities for studying future technology, future workers, and future work at the level of a FW-HTF full research proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research conducted using data mainly between 2005 and 2015 shows only weak relationships between automatability, repetitiveness, and other job attributes and changes in occupational employment. The results suggest that analysts give greater attention to within-occupation impacts of technology in assessing the future of work.  Within-occupation changes dominate, raising doubts about the ability of projections based on expected changes in the occupational composition of employment to capture the likely future of work.  Our team will continue to look at developments as data improves for more recent years up to the present.  Research findings indicate that self-driving vehicles and automation in transportation and trucking still have obstacles to overcome and many unforeseen costs that will slow down their adoption.  Robotics and AI are attracting focused study, but it is important to keep a research eye on developments in software and digitalization.  The research team uncovered major differences in software use based on age patterns in workplaces.  Younger workers typically encounter much more software-intensive work environments.  Using a survey conducted in the RAND American Life Panel in 2018, there was confirmation that average job demands between 2003 and 2018 increased cognitive job demands, and physical job demands decreased.  But these shifting job demands have been highly unequal across groups: those with high school or less education had increased demands in all categories (cognitive, physical, sensory, and psychomotor), while those with college degrees or more faced lower demands in three of the four domains of work (sensory being the one exception).
