<AbstractNarration>From jumping jacks to jumping for joy, the "body language" of human movement provides&lt;br/&gt;important information about the intentions and emotions of others. Growing evidence suggests&lt;br/&gt;that we understand others' mental states by internally recreating, or simulating, their external&lt;br/&gt;actions. Yet questions remain about how different brain systems contribute to action simulation,&lt;br/&gt;and whether this process is linked to individual differences in social perception abilities. This&lt;br/&gt;research uses electroencephalography (EEG) to examine brain activity associated with action&lt;br/&gt;simulation during observation of emotional body movements, both in typically developing&lt;br/&gt;individuals and in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a condition associated with&lt;br/&gt;social perception impairments. By testing the link between EEG measures of action simulation&lt;br/&gt;and emotion perception capabilities across a broad sample of individual socio-emotional&lt;br/&gt;functioning, these data will provide a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding the&lt;br/&gt;neural basis of emotional action simulation. More broadly, the research may provide new&lt;br/&gt;insights into the neural origins of social impairments observed in ASD, potentially leading to&lt;br/&gt;improved diagnoses and therapies. Finally, these activities will promote undergraduate training&lt;br/&gt;in the STEM disciplines by providing authentic research opportunities for students including&lt;br/&gt;women and underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will examine the relation between perceptual and motor circuits in&lt;br/&gt;emotion simulation. In a previous EEG study, the investigators found distinct neural markers&lt;br/&gt;associated with the observation of emotional and emotionally-neutral actions. Emotional actions&lt;br/&gt;elicited a reduction of cortical "mu" alpha rhythms (9-12 Hz) linked to perceptual aspects of&lt;br/&gt;action simulation, but neutral actions produced enhanced beta-band oscillations (14-20 Hz)&lt;br/&gt;associated with motor planning and response inhibition. Both effects were attenuated in a nonclinical&lt;br/&gt;sample of individuals reporting greater autistic tendencies, suggesting these neural&lt;br/&gt;markers are sensitive to individual differences in social-emotional traits. The proposed research&lt;br/&gt;will investigate the contribution of motor circuits to mu-alpha suppression for emotional actions&lt;br/&gt;by comparing action execution with observed emotional action and varying the familiarity and&lt;br/&gt;ease of simulating observed emotional actions. Examination of individuals with ASD will&lt;br/&gt;distinguish how mu and beta band activity relate to individual differences in emotional&lt;br/&gt;processing, allowing assessment of whether neurodevelopmental disruptions of sensorimotor&lt;br/&gt;systems play a role in emotion simulation deficits. Collectively, these studies will provide&lt;br/&gt;important insights into the relations between EEG measures, action simulation processes, and&lt;br/&gt;emotion perception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
