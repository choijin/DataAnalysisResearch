<AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to ameliorate the current and increasing severe shortage of geoscientists in the U.S. workforce. The goal is to institutionalize a transformative model to effect a long-term, sustained increase in recruitment and retention of students from Palm Beach State College (PBSC), a two-year college (2YC), particularly more women and underrepresented minorities (URMs), into geoscience programs at Florida Atlantic University (FAU), a four-year (4yr) institution in South Florida. The proposed activities of this model, such as embedding workforce readiness components into the science curriculum at FAU and PBSC, developing and implementing Exploring Geopaths Summer Institute (EGSI) and Undergraduate Geopaths Research Experiences (UGRE), which will both expose and train more students in cutting-edge geoscience technologies, support and align with NSF's Harnessing the Data Revolution, and Future of Work Big Ideas. PIs anticipate a sustained increase in graduation rates of skilled geoscientists who will enter the workforce ready and pursue employment opportunities in much needed sectors such as: energy, oil and gas, environmental services, mining, research institutes, and federal, state or local governments. Through this project PIs also intend to position PBSC and FAU students and faculty in line with NSF's INCLUDES Big Idea that "aspires to transform education and career pathways to help broaden participation in science and engineering".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to ameliorate the current and increasing severe shortage of geoscientists in the U.S. workforce. Our goal is to institutionalize a transformative model to effect a long-term, sustained increase in recruitment and retention of students from Palm Beach State College (PBSC), a two-year college (2YC), particularly more women and underrepresented minorities (URMs), into geoscience programs at Florida Atlantic University (FAU), a four-year (4yr) institution in South Florida. By targeting the diverse student population at PBSC, the project will significantly increase the enrollment, and the number of females and URMs in geoscience programs at FAU. As part of the transformative model PIs will implement: (1) Growing the transfer student pipeline and increasing student diversity by recruiting geoscience majors from PBSC, revising and strengthening the transfer articulation agreement (Link Program), implementing geoscience-specific 2+2 transfer flight plans, developing a cross-institutional collaborative advising protocol framework, and initiating and embedding career readiness components directly into the geosciences courses taken by PBSC students prior to transferring to FAU. (2) Developing a new Exploring Geopaths Summer Institute (EGSI), with authentic experiences utilizing a rich spectrum of geoscience high-tech and field methods, designed to attract, and recruit PBSC students. (3) Developing a new Undergraduate Geopaths Research Experiences (UGRE), designed to motivate and retain transfer students early in their matriculation into geoscience degree programs at FAU. (4) Enhancing the departmental culture with faculty and peer mentors to make it a more welcoming, and supportive environment for students. PIs anticipate the outcomes will position this model as one that can be easily adopted by other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
