<AbstractNarration>This award will support attendance by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at the 2019 Gordon Research Conference on RNA Editing to be held in Lucca, Italy on March 23-24, 2019, just prior to the associated Gordon Research Conference. The meeting is organized and chaired by two postdoctoral scientists.  The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings.  Participants will also benefit from dedicated career-specific events, including a keynote lecture from a leader in the field and a panel discussion on careers in science by three individuals who have taken different career tracks, e.g., academia, scientific publishing, and industry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modification and editing of nucleic acid molecules play important roles in regulating gene expression.  The scientific focus of this meeting (and the accompanying Gordon Research Conference) will be on "Next Generation" aspects of research in this field.  This will have dual benefits in terms of emphasizing the cutting-edge nature of latest findings and promoting the career development of early-career scientists in the field.  The meeting will provide an excellent forum for junior investigators, including those from underrepresented groups, to learn about new scientific discoveries and challenges, to meet and talk with leaders in the field, and to have an opportunity to present and receive feedback on their own research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
