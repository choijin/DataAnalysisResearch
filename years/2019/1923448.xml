<AbstractNarration>The award will provide support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to attend the 2019 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Chromosome Dynamics (June 22-23, 2019 in Newry, ME), to be held just before the associated Gordon Research Conference (GRC; June 23-28, 2019). These conferences bring together young and established investigators from multiple disciplines, ranging from mathematics and computing to biology, who are studying chromosome structure/dynamics and function. The GRS is focused on early career scientists, and it provides an effective forum for them to discuss research through seminars and poster sessions, exchange ideas and resources informally, and develop their professional network. A notable programmatic activity is a panel discussion on mentoring and career development with the keynote speaker and a diverse group of faculty mentors. The GRS is organized and co-chaired by two post-doctoral fellows, and it serves as a significant career development experience for them as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New technology development has accelerated discoveries in chromosome biology in recent years. It has also led to high levels of specialization that have a profound impact, but can also hinder fuller understanding of how the biophysical properties of packaged DNA influence the function, maintenance and propagation of the genetic code. The GRS and GRC serve as a vital link for investigators by facilitating discussion of the latest discoveries in topics such as chromosome organization and the impact on gene regulation, DNA replication and repair in the chromosomal context, meiotic chromosomal organization and segregation, as well as centromeres and chromosome stability. The GRS in particular will facilitate training and professional development of the next generation of scientists, including underrepresented minorities, in the field of chromosome biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The information in chromosomes - nucleic acid sequences of long chromosomal DNAs - controls the lives of all organisms. Far from being inert genetic data storage elements, chromosomes are increasingly being seen as highly dynamic organelles involved in a wide range of cellular functions. Chromosome biology is an interdisciplinary field studied by a large and diverse set of scientists using a broad set of experimental methods, with just the past few years having seen remarkable steps forward in our molecular understanding of how chromosomes are organized by the cell.     The Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Chromosome Dynamics was a unique forum for graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education to present and exchange new data and cutting-edge ideas. This seminar brought together young scientists from a wide range of disciplines, including biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics, to discuss unpublished work pertaining to chromosome biology. A wide range of topics were included with a focus on how bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic chromosomes are packaged, repaired, replicated, and transcribed.     The seminar preceded the Chromosome Dynamics Gordon Research Conference GRC) which brought together the leaders of this field to share their cutting-edge results and to work together to further develop interdisciplinary approaches that and seed further advances in the understanding of chromosome structure and dynamics.
