<AbstractNarration>This award is partial travel support of the 2019 conference Future of Cyber-Assisted Chemical Engineering Education on July 19-20, 2019 in Breckenridge, Colorado. The conference focuses on future directions in the innovative use of computing technology, data science, and internet-based communications infrastructure to enhance chemical engineering education. This conference immediately follows the CACHE (Computer Aids for Chemical Engineering Education) Corporation sponsored research conference, Foundations of Computer Aided Process Design in Copper Mountain, Colorado.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference program includes 12 plenary speakers who will offer their views of important directions in cyber-assisted education as well as highlights of the accomplishments and current thrusts of CACHE in molecular modeling, systems biology and process systems engineering. It will also involve 20 invited oral presentations as well as posters contributed by outstanding young faculty reporting innovations in the development of educational media, exploring novel ways of organizing student-instructor interactions to enhance learning and experimenting with alternative knowledge delivery modes. The presentations and discussion will serve to identify gaps across the curriculum and at all degree levels and to outline the content and identify the most effective vehicles to deliver the content that would fill the identified gaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  This report describes the conference on the Future of Cyber-Assisted Chemical Engineering Education, held at the Beaver Run Resort in Breckenridge, CO, July 19-20, 2019. The conference, stimulated by the 50 year anniversary of the founding of the non-profit CACHE (Computer Aids for Chemical Engineering Education) Corporation, had as its primary focus future directions in the innovative use of computing technology, data science, and the internet-based communications infrastructure to enhance chemical engineering education. The program included 12 plenary speakers who offered their views of important directions in cyber-assisted education as well as highlights of the accomplishments and current thrusts of CACHE in molecular modeling, systems biology and process systems engineering. It also involved 20 invited oral presentations and posters contributed by outstanding young faculty reporting innovations in the development of educational media, exploring novel ways of organizing student-instructor interactions to enhance learning and experimenting with alternative knowledge delivery modes. Special emphasis was placed on attracting and including under-represented groups in the program. The conference was attended by 63 participants; NSF funding was used for travel support for 20 junior faculty and the two conference co-chairs.  Intellectual Merit  The Conference brought together thought leaders, innovators, educators and industrial practitioners who are concerned with preparing a workforce of chemical engineers with the skill sets needed to accelerate the penetration of data analytics, management of massive data sets, artificial intelligence, data-driven and first principles models and simulations at all levels of organizational decision making in government, industry and academia.  The presentations and discussions served to identify gaps across the curriculum and at all degree levels and to outline the content and identify the most effective vehicles to deliver the content that would fill the identified gaps.    Broader Impact  The conference attracted and stimulated a new generation of innovators in cyber-based education. Through refereed publications we will disseminate the findings across the chemical engineering profession The conference stimulated the identification and organization of educational projects that teams of faculty and industry collaborators will pursue to benefit the community.  The educational innovations promoted by this conference will benefit US industry by preparing a workforce that is well-trained in data analytics, data management, artificial intelligence and data- and first principles models at molecular, continuum and cellular levels.
