<AbstractNarration>This grant provides financial support for the workshop entitled NSF-AFOSR Joint Workshop on Mechanics-Based Design of Intelligent Material Systems by Multimaterial Additive Manufacturing, to be held on August 15, 2019, in Melbourne, Australia, during the 22nd International Conference on Composite Materials 2019. Recent advances in additive manufacturing technologies have drastically changed the perception of how multifunctional composites and structures are designed and fabricated. The emergence of multimaterial 3D printing--precise placement of dissimilar materials in space--has opened unprecedented opportunities up for creating new types of composites. While tremendous research possibilities exist, center to these opportunities is mechanics, which is not only critical in understanding fundamental engineering issues, such as interface properties and reliability, but also drives innovative design through mechanical behavior, such as mismatch of strains and nonlinear thermomechanics. The objective of this workshop is to review the recent progress in the mechanics-based design of intelligent material systems by multimaterial additive manufacturing and to identify new directions and opportunities. Funding from this grant will support travel costs for 13 invited speakers to attend the workshop and present their work, and two graduate students for organizing the workshop as well as the production of a report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this one-day workshop, 13 invited leading experts in mechanics of multifunctional materials as well as additive manufacturing from across academia, government, and industry will discuss present and future challenges and opportunities related to the mechanics-based design of intelligent material systems by multimaterial additive manufacturing. The workshop will be comprised of three sessions in a single technical track with each session covering a different topic and having two 25-min presentations, three 5-min presentations, and one 30-minute discussion period. With each session covering a different topic and allowing plenty of discussion time, this unique format is intended to foster discussions around the most important technical challenges in each topic and opportunities for future research. This workshop will also feature a final one-hour panel discussion that will integrate the topics and discussions from the three sessions. The outcome of these presentations and discussions will be documented in a final report and will be widely disseminated across academia, government, and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
