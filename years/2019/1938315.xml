<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will offer the space industry a timely and cost-effective means for accurately quantifying and evaluating the effects of space radiation on their materials and products. Companies will have the capability to understand the performance of their materials and products in dynamic, realistic space radiation environments, which will lead to advances in materials, longer lifespans, and fewer accidents/failures. The capability to study subsystem response in a realistic simulated environment and inform complex models will enable faster optimization and design iterations at lower costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a simulation tool coupling the drastic timescale differences of surface and internal charging in a user-friendly interface, and pairing this tool with a dynamic space radiation testing chamber. A simulation tool with these capabilities addresses the usability gap in the state of practice and enables the solution of the complete spacecraft charging problem in a single simulation. The ability to produce broad spectrum energies and alter these sources in-situ allows for materials and objects to be exposed to realistic environmental changes without the approximations and extrapolations currently required due to the limitations in capability, scheduling, and size at appropriate facilities.  The proposed system will offer a new capability for testing and modeling of subsystems such as human radiation protection devices, satellite materials and components, solar panels, and others; this will enable design advances that are faster, more accurate, and more effective than those currently available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ EMA has successfully designed a combined effects space radiation test chamber and developed the framework for a software suite capable of simulating the space radiation effects environment.  During the period of performance for this SBIR award, EMA has implemented the capability to simulate surface charging effects without facing the existing limitations that accompany currently available simulation environments. EMA's tool supports CAD import and manipulation/repair, a streamlined workflow, and does not have node limitations that bound problem size/complexity. EMA's software can drive internal charging simulations with the surface charging outputs, which demonstrates the capability to make a single, fully coupled simulation possible.  Future work in this area will include incorporating internal charging and the fully coupled surface and internal charging simulation into the software suite.  EMA's test chamber has been designed to support commercial test operations in the space radiation effects area. This has required the chamber to be designed in such a manner that the radiation environments (energies, etc.) it can produce are flexible and will allow for complex radiation profiles of different orbits to be produced. To accomplish this, in addition to designing a vessel that can support these operations, EMA has developed adjustable electron flood guns that can be tuned to meet specific output requirements.   Future work in this area will involve the implementation of measurement techniques and equipment, workflows and other capabilities needed to support testing in these areas.   These capabilities are an important step in the commercialization of space radiation effects analysis and testing, which is necessary to provide a means for rapidly de-risking technologies and developing new materials.
