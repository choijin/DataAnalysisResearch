<AbstractNarration>This project will support rapid geologic, geodetic and seismological field investigations associated with the Searles Valley earthquake sequence in the Eastern California Shear Zone, which included a magnitude (M) 6.4 earthquake on July 4, 2019, and a subsequent M 7.1 event on July 5. The immediate field response is essential because the seismic and geodetic signals decay rapidly with time and geological evidence becomes obscure quickly. Rapid field studies should provide a wealth of data to facilitate understanding of the earthquake rupture properties and fault damage zones, 3D crustal structures around the ruptures, post seismic transients of geodetic fields, and effects of the events on the subsurface and human structures. This study should help clarify earthquake processes and structures in the highly active and complex Eastern California Shear Zone, which hosted three M &gt; 7 events in the last three decades, and contribute significantly to improved understanding of the tectonic deformation and seismic hazard in Southern California.  The field studies and recorded data will provide valuable experience for students and early career scientists, and produce excellent material for education and outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will include obtaining differential lidar and optical image surveys, campaign Global Positioning System measurements, seismic deployments of across-fault linear and 2D arrays, and mapping effects of the ground motion on infrastructure. The obtained multi-disciplinary observations will enable researchers to address numerous outstanding questions about earthquake ruptures, spatio-temporal seismicity patterns, fault zone and crustal structures, intensity of ground shaking and postseismic deformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit. Geodetic observation of the coseismic movement from the Ridgecrest sequence reveals that a very large proportion of California and Nevada permanently moved because of the event. The observations show a NNE contraction and WNW extension consistent with the strike and style of the dextral slip, with the movement extending hundreds of kilometers to the north, south, east and west.   For example, to the south in southern California GPS station CAT2 on Catalina Islands moved a little over 3 mm northward, while the town of Tonopah in central Nevada moved ~4 mm south.  Stations in the San Francisco Bay Area moved 2 mm ~west.  Thus the area that shifted is that within 500 km of the epicenter, near one million square kilometers.  Measuring these movements allows better understanding of the earthquake processes, its impacts, the seismic cycle, its relation to tectonic loading prior to the event, and how postseismic deformation plays a role in changing stresses in the Earth.   Broader Impacts. The data collection facilitated by this RAPID project serves a very broad set of communities of scientists working on earthquake processes and effects.

The recorded data and follow up studies contribute broadly to improved understanding of tectonic deformation in the ECSZ and SWL.  The MAGNET GPS component of the response provided valuable experience for students who contributed to the field deployment, and many opportunities for other scientists to perform original research using the GPS data that was collected.  GPS data products generated by NGL, including time series files, plots and tables of the estimates of coseismic offsets, were made available through our website and updated periodically following the earthquake.  Having data on the coseismic offsets from the Ridgecrest events contributed directly to our ability to have high precision coseismic offsets for the next significant earthquake: the Monte Cristo Range, Nevada Earthquake that hit on May 15, 2020 that also struck within the footprint of the MAGNET GPS Network.  The field work and derived results generated excellent material for the NSF and SCEC E&amp;O activities and media outreach.
