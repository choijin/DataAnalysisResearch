<AbstractNarration>The goal of the Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (CB2) is to improve the basic knowledge of the synthesis, processing, properties, and compounding of bioplastic and biocomposite materials, as well as to develop reliable material characteristics data for industrial partners and support large-scale industrial implementation of renewable materials. Sustainability is a rapidly growing aspect of technology, driven partially by social factors; however, many industries are struggling to effectively incorporate sustainability-related practices. CB2 creates new knowledge, materials, and processes for sustainable biobased plastics and composites. The vision of the center is to develop knowledge that will facilitate the production of an array of high-value products, including plastics, coatings, adhesives, and composites, from renewable feedstocks that are compatible with current industrial manufacturing systems and thereby promoting rural development as well as national growth. NDSU's specific expertise in areas such as coatings technology and thermosetting polymers will be applied to the design of high performance biobased materials for use in coatings, composites, and adhesives. NDSU will also provide life cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis to projects across CB2. The center focusses on the development of jobs in the area of sustainable manufacturing, focusing on conversion of agricultural and woody crops to energy and materials which are crucial to lasting job creation in the United States.  The center also strives to support education and diversity through engagement of K-12 educators, supporting a NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)  -- co-located at ISU and WSU -- where students participate in research on sustainable materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of the Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (CB2) is to develop fundamental knowledge related to bioplastics and biocomposites, to disseminate research-based findings to industry to promote sustainability and to educate future scientists and engineers. The team of researchers includes experts from the fields of polymer processing, polymer chemistry, materials science, and biomass utilization. It combines a wide area of experience and expertise, allowing a well-rounded interdisciplinary approach. In addition, all of the participating institutions (North Dakota State University Iowa State University, Washington State University, University of Georgia) have state-of-the-art facilities for polymer processing and characterization to facilitate the development of a fundamental understanding of the influence of processing on the properties of biopolymers and composites.  Research focus and priority areas are determined by industry partners through a process developed by the industry partners to ensure the relevance to and positive impact on sustainable future industry development.  Individual projects are based on seed concepts generated by the center?s industry partners and ultimately defined through an interactive process between researchers and industry partners.  The projects are then mentored on a monthly basis by the industry partners, which serves as a model for technology transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
