<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Materials Research provides support for the 17th International Summer School on Crystal Growth (ISSCG-17) to be held at the YMCA of the Rockies - Snow Mountain Ranch in Granby, CO from July 21-26, 2019.  The event is organized and hosted by the American Association for Crystal Growth (AACG) under the auspices of the International Organization for Crystal Growth (IOCG).  The school is scheduled the week prior to the 19th International Conference on Crystal Growth and Epitaxy (ICCGE-19) which will be held in Keystone, CO USA from July 28-August 2, 2019.  The international meetings (ICCGE/ISSCG) represent a 60-year history of international cooperation in the field of crystal growth and epitaxy.  The summer school was last held in the USA in Park City, UT in 2007. The technical program consists of about 15 lectures covering both theoretical and experimental aspects of growth and characterization of semiconducting, oxide, metallic, organic and biological crystals by leading researchers in the field.  The format of the school is designed to encourage interaction between lecturers and attendees.  Informal discussions will be facilitated via technical and social events.  The YMCA venue has numerous outdoor activities which will provide additional opportunities for attendees to interact in a rustic and scenic outdoor setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided funds for participant support for the 17th International Summer School on Crystal Growth (ISSCG-17) which was held at the YMCA of the Rockies ? Snow Mountain Ranch in Granby, CO from July 21-26, 2019.  The event was organized and hosted by the American Association for Crystal Growth (AACG) under the auspices of the International Organization for Crystal Growth (IOCG).  In keeping with tradition, the school was scheduled the week prior to the 19th International Conference on Crystal Growth and Epitaxy (ICCGE-19) which was held in Keystone, CO USA from July 28-August 2, 2019.  The international meetings (ICCGE/ISSCG) represent a 60-year history of international cooperation in the field of crystal growth and epitaxy.   The technical program consisted of 14 lectures covering both theoretical and experimental aspects of growth and characterization of semiconducting, oxide, metallic, organic and biological crystals.  Lectures were given by leading researchers in fundamentals of crystal growth and epitaxial processes, nanocrystallization, and in-situ and ex-situ characterization.  A textbook entitled ?Fundamentals of Crystal Growth and Epitaxy? based on the lecture materials was provided to students in advance of the School to help them prepare for the immersive educational experience and to serve as a useful reference text for their future research.   The format of the School was designed to encourage interaction between lecturers and attendees.  Informal discussions were facilitated via numerous social events including breakfasts and dinners, poster sessions with extended coffee breaks, a welcoming reception and outdoor barbeque.  In addition, the YMCA venue had numerous outdoor activities providing additional opportunities for attendees to interact in a rustic and scenic outdoor setting.   Intellectual Merit  The summer school was designed to introduce graduate students and early career researchers to the fundamental science and practical aspects of crystal growth through lectures and activities given by internationally recognized experts in the field.  This included concepts related to the fundamentals of crystal growth (thermodynamics, transport phenomena, kinetics), crystal structure (defects, characterization methods), techniques (solution growth, epitaxy, vapor phase deposition, bulk growth) and specialized topics (nanoscale materials, oxides, energy materials).  As a result of the cross-disciplinary nature of crystal growth research, participants had diverse academic backgrounds in fields such as chemistry, physics, materials science, chemical engineering and electrical engineering.  The summer school therefore provided a unique venue to provide a common core of foundational knowledge that spans a range of science and engineering disciplines.  Few institutions in the U.S. currently offer this combination of topics in a graduate-level course, consequently, the summer school serves an important role in educating the next generation of researchers and sustaining the scholarly impact of the field. meetings.  Broader Impact  ISSCG-17 provided educational and professional development activities for graduate students and early career researchers from a variety of countries and geographic regions.  Given the location in the U.S., a majority of the attendees (66%) were domestic with 34% of the other participants from Europe and the Asia-Pacific to maintain the international flavor of the meeting.  A total of 72 participants attended the school (including lecturers) attendees and 50% were graduate students or postdoctoral scholars with the remainder consisting of both new and experienced researchers in the field of crystal growth.  The ISSCG attendees were diverse with ~21% of the lecturers being women or minorities with strong female representation (~37%) among the rest of the attendees.
