<AbstractNarration>This NSF award will provide funding to support travel of researchers based in the US to attend the conference "Model Theory of Valued Fields and Applications", to be held on June 10-14, 2019 at the Institute for Mathematical Logic and Foundational Research, Munster, Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this conference is to bring together specialists from the algebraic (or arithmetic) and the pure model theory community who all study valued fields, but with very different tools. The talks will range from the more classical model theory of valued fields to the pure and geometric side of the model theory spectrum. There will also be talks presenting applications of model theory of valued fields, e.g. to non-archimedean geometry and motivic integration. This award provides an opportunity for US based early stage researchers and Ph.D students to learn from the world-leading experts and to actively engage in research on these recent developments.&lt;br/&gt;More details are available at the conference website https://ivv5hpp.uni-muenster.de/u/fjahn_01/mtvfa/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
