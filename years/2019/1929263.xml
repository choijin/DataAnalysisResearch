<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This research explores the synthesis, structure, and properties of a new class of ceramics, i.e. compounds composed of metallic and non-metallic elements. Ceramic single crystal materials, where the atomic arrangement is the same throughout the bulk sample, are desirable because of their unique properties. Unfortunately, they are usually difficult to fabricate, requiring specialized equipment and very high temperatures. This project explores a novel solid-state method for growing a single crystal ceramic, starting from a mixture of two different ceramic compositions. The potential exists for the discovery of ceramic crystals with new and interesting properties for next generation structural and electronic applications.  Furthermore, the reverse process, i.e., changing from a single material to two distinct materials can be exploited to create composite materials that are microscopic mixtures of either different ceramics, or a metal and a ceramic. The scale and interconnectivity of these mixtures can be tailored to modify the overall physical properties. Students are undergoing training in advanced techniques encompassing both experimental and computational materials science. They will typically find employment in high tech industries or government/industrial laboratories. Associated outreach activities are directed towards encouraging K-12 students to pursue careers in science and engineering, with a particular emphasis on underrepresented groups. These efforts include the creation of bilingual educational modules, as well as participation in programs such as:  1) Materials Camps for high school students and teachers, 2) CHOICES (Charting Horizons and Opportunities In Careers in Engineering and Science), which is aimed at middle school girls, and 3) STAR (Students That Are Ready), which targets economically and academically disadvantaged and/or at-risk 8th to 12th grade students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:  Entropy-stabilized oxides are complex ceramics that are stable only above a certain critical temperature. To date, this material class has received little prior attention from the research community. Recently a new type of transformation was observed whereby bulk single crystal growth was induced by solid state synthesis, starting with a two-phase, polycrystalline precursor. Conversely, the eutectoid-like transformation of these materials when annealed below the critical temperature yields novel two-phase morphologies. The project combines experiment and an informatics-based modelling approach to seek a fundamental understanding of the transformation mechanisms. In particular, the research aims to identify the materials' parameters that together with the initial microstructure, define the morphological and textural evolution of the resultant structure. Graduate students and undergraduates are being trained in state-of-the art high temperature materials synthesis and characterization techniques, as well as modelling of nucleation and growth processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
