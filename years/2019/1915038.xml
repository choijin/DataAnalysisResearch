<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Sera Cremonini at Lehigh University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our best understanding of gravity currently relies on Einstein's theory of general relativity. Despite its many successes, the theory is not equipped to describe gravity at all length scales --- it fails when quantum-mechanical effects and gravitational effects are equally important. The development of string theory and of deep connections between certain theories of gravity and purely quantum-mechanical theories have given us new insights into the basic building blocks of nature and the structure of spacetime. They have also led to valuable new tools to probe quantum systems whose constituents interact strongly with each other --- systems which are notoriously difficult to examine using standard techniques. The goal of Professor Cremonini's research is to advance our understanding of quantum gravity and the microscopic structure of spacetime. In addition, this research aims to unveil the fundamental mechanisms driving the unconventional behavior of strongly interacting quantum materials such as high-temperature superconductors. Progress in this direction can lead to the development of new technologies that can benefit society as a whole.  Thus, this research has potential long-term applications to technology and industry as well as fundamental science, thereby advancing the national interest in all of these areas.  The proposed work will also have significant broader impacts. Professor Cremonini will involve graduate students in her research, providing critical training for junior physicists in the early stages of their careers. She will also share exciting research advances with the broader community through public lectures and incorporate research highlights into her teaching through the development of new courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the duration of this research project, Professor Cremonini will address these questions working within the framework of holography, building on her expertise in both fundamental and phenomenological aspects of the duality.  The proposed projects will involve studies of renormalization-group flow for non-relativistic geometries, extensions of the holographic dictionary to settings with fewer symmetries and the construction of new infrared geometries, holographic realizations of symmetry broken phases, and studies of transport in strongly interacting phases of matter. The projects are structured along several complementary directions which are deeply intertwined with each other.  Each direction addresses a different aspect of the research program through both short-term and long-term projects, using both analytical and numerical techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
