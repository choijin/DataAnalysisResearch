<AbstractNarration>Part 1 - As students are prepared for global change, there's an obligation to educate them in the significance of human impacts on Earth systems through the study of geoscience. The growing geoscience job market will present exciting new opportunities to contribute to the sustainability and well being of society; however, for a variety of reasons, students are not being made aware of these opportunities. The problem is particularly acute among underrepresented minority (URM, or Black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaskan Native) students. This program applies a novel multi-level approach of engaging students at different stages in their education in a five week summer research project related to the challenges of living sustainably on Long Island. Four teams each year made up of an undergraduate science major, a high school student, and a future science teacher will perform hands on research closely mentored by expert faculty. The ultimate goal is to increase the number of students (particularly those underrepresented in the STEM pipeline) pursuing geoscience related degrees and planning on entering geoscience professions. In addition, the program seeks to strengthen the ability of future teachers to inspire students and influence their future STEM learning and interest in STEM careers, and to raise awareness among teachers of the research opportunities in the geosciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2 - During an intensive 5 week program, GEOTeam members will engage in collaborative, authentic, scientific inquiry on projects that focus on hydrogeology, sedimentology, geohazards, climate, and biogeochemistry. Weekly seminars and workshops will introduce students to research processes, safety training, and career development through interaction with geoscience professionals from local governments and businesses. GEOTeams will present their work and results in professional settings such as science fairs, conferences, and public meetings. The project capitalizes on several outstanding Hofstra programs, including the Summer Science Research Program; a STEM Collaboratorium; established connections with area public schools, particularly high need schools; the STEP and CSTEP collegiate preparatory programs for underrepresented students; and the Noyce Scholars Program. The project provides new insights on engaging students raised in a developed environment with limited exposure to geology a significant topic which has not yet received adequate attention. It adds to the knowledge base on how the strategic use of team?\based learning rooted in a collaborative process can impact the performance of students, particularly underrepresented students, in geoscience. It enhances the infrastructure for science teacher education by improving science teachers' ability to advance student learning through authentic research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores how universities can directly engage high school students in explorations of geoscience early in their studies before they lose interest. Finally, project findings should contribute to [best practices] in STEM instruction for underserved minority students and increase their self\efficacy and performance in mathematics and science, thus expanding their opportunities for STEM careers. The students' engagement in authentic, career\relevant geoscience experiences will give them a concrete understanding of key knowledge and skills in the field and the importance of geoscience in solving real world problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
