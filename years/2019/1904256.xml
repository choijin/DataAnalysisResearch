<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the proposed technology provides a much-needed solution to the current problems in electrosurgery that is widely used in many medical specialties such as neurological surgery. Electrosurgery is fast and requires short post-surgery recovery time; however, major problems such as collateral nerve damage and seal failure still exist, sometimes with fatal consequences. The proposed technology helps eliminate those problems by monitoring the electrosurgical process with an acoustic signal. It will enable an assistive device for surgeons to make precise decisions that will ensure the surgical quality. It will reduce surgeon fatigue, time in the operating room, and healthcare cost, while improving the overall patient experience. This project allows extensive customer discovery and market analysis, from which commercial products will be developed to satisfy the needs of patients, surgeons, and hospitals. With the projected $5.17B global market for electrosurgical equipment by 2021, the proposed technology will have a significant commercial potential. The monitoring methodology applied to this project brings advances to the field of precision surgery with engineering principles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project focuses on developing a real-time acoustic signal monitoring system for quality assurance of the electrosurgical process. First, sound signals captured during the surgery is correlated to the water boiling and protein denaturing process in heated tissue. Then, a decision-making algorithm is developed based on the signal strength and number of bubble bursting events. Previous research on the electrosurgical process has provided fundamental understanding and suggested that the acoustic monitoring method is dramatically better than existing ones. In the previous study, experiments was conducted with ex-vivo porcine tissue and the feasibility of the proposed technology using a low-profile sensor was demonstrated. This I-Corps award will provide opportunities to conduct customer interviews for technology refinement. A set of functional requirements for product development will be identified to support commercialization of the proposed technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Bipolar forceps are a prominent surgical tool used to create tissue hemostasis, or tissue welding, during an electrosurgical operation. Bipolar forceps are advantageous to surgeons of varying specialties because this methodology leads to less bleeding, shorter post-surgery recovery time, and suitability for laparoscopic surgery. Although this tool has been beneficial to the surgical community, it brings with it precarious issues. These issues, such as tissue sticking, charring, smoking, and excessive thermal damage do not halt completion of surgeries, but are limiting to the efficiency of these procedures. With these issues widely known, the consideration of a modified version of bipolar forceps is necessary. The opinions on the effectiveness of bipolar forceps from 54 surgeons of 19 varying specialties were documented and evaluated. It was determined that although all surgeons believe bipolar surgeons to be useful, the criticalness of these tools is highly dependent on the surgical specialty. With surgical specialties, 80% of neurosurgeons believe there is a need for modified bipolar forceps. With the brain being the most sensitive organ on the body to operate on, neurosurgeons need absolute control and assurance that the instrument they are using will perform to par. With collateral damage being the primary concern for them, a change in price for a better equipped instrument is not an issue. The next specialty that supported this concept was plastic surgeons. 66% of the plastic surgeons interviewed agreed that there needs to be an update to the functions of bipolar forceps, generally sharing the same ideas that the current tools lack the manipulation and sensory feedback that a successful weld was complete. On the contrary, 100% of the cardiothoracic surgeons did not believe there to be a need for change in the functions of the current commercially available bipolar forceps. 15 of the 19 specialties supported the idea that they would like a modification to the current bipolar forceps, but do not consider it a top priority. One leading factor behind surgeons not being fully inclined to wanting updated bipolar forceps is because of cost. Many stated that if the new tool was capable of drastically solving the smoking and sticking issue, but for the same price as the currently available products, then they would recommend to their purchasing department. Trauma surgeons use bipolar forceps the least amount in their procedures. Although they are effective in cauterizing smaller blood vessels, a lot of trauma surgeons deal with large open wounds that need a more aggressive seal, such as a harmonic scalpel or an argon beam. Another surgical procedure that does not use them as frequently is a hip arthroplasty. Although bipolar forceps are used in the initial opening of the hip, it is not the surgeons? primary tool. This procedure also deals with a larger region to control the bleeding because there are larger blood vessels. With neurosurgeons being the dominant user, optimally designed bipolar forces with feedback capability could be justified on an economical scale for neurosurgeries.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/01/2020<br>      Modified by: Wei&nbsp;Li</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1904256/1904256_10587251_1588305986692_UseRateofBipolarForceps--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1904256/1904256_10587251_1588305986692_UseRateofBipolarForceps--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Use Rate of Bipolar Forceps"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1904256/1904256_10587251_1588305986692_UseRateofBipolarForceps--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Use Rate of Bipolar Forceps"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">THE USE RATE AND CRITICALNESS OF BIPOLAR FORCEPS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF SURGERIES PERFORMED PER 100,000 POPULATION</div> <div class="imageCredit">Marissa Martinez, Xiaoran Li, Wei Li</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wei&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">Use Rate of Bipolar Forceps</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
