<AbstractNarration>Formal Methods in Computer Aided Design (FMCAD) 2019 is the ninteenth in a series of conferences on the theory and applications of formal methods in hardware and system verification. It provides a leading forum to researchers in academia and industry for presenting and discussing ground-breaking methods, technologies, theoretical results, and tools for reasoning formally about computing systems. This grant will help support conference travel for up to 15 students enrolled in US institutions to attend FMCAD in San Jose, California October 23-25th 2019. The students will get the opportunity to present at the Student Forum, which is a platform for graduate students at any career stage to introduce their research to the wider Formal Methods community, and solicit feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formal methods is being rapidly deployed in a variety of areas both in academic research as well as in industrial systems. Thus the broader significance and importance includes fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to present at the Student Forum, learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise. The organizers will give priority to students from under-represented groups and from small universities without a formal methods program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project funded US-based students attending the 2019 Student Forum, held as part of the nineteenth conference on Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD), held in San Jose, CA, October 22-25, 2019.  The forum was initiated in 2013 to familiarize young researchers with cutting-edge formal verification technologies and their applications.  The goal of the Student Forum is to give students at any career stage the opportunity to present their ongoing work to the wider community and receive feedback from experienced researchers.  Mimicking the exact submission and  review  procedure  used  in  conferences,  the  Student  Forum  gives  younger students the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the academic process of publishing in a non-hostile setting.  We put particular emphasis on ensuring productive and encouraging feedback during the review process.  During the conference, students had the opportunity to present their own research to the community, and to discuss the research challenges and future directions with these experts in a special poster session.  In contrast to standard conference submissions,  the Student Forum gives participants the opportunity to present work in progress that is not yet mature or advanced enough to be published as a full-length paper at a conference.  The grant funded 11 students from 9 different institutions.  Student feedback on the experience was extremely positive, with representative quotes including: "I am so grateful for the learning and presenting opportunities that I was provided"; "My experience...was amazing and unique"; "this event has been tremendously helpful to me"; "FMCAD '19 was an amazing experience for me"; and "I  found the experience very productive as I have extended my contact network and receivedmany  good  tips  to  work  on  in  my  research."  The FMCAD website at https://fmcad.forsyte.at/FMCAD19/ contains additional information about the conference and about the Student Forum in particular, including links to posters and slides prepared by the students.
