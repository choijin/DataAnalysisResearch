<AbstractNarration>The IEEE International Workshop on Antenna Technology (iWAT) is an annual forum for the presentation and discussion on the newest research and development of innovative antenna technologies. The 2019 iWAT will be held in Miami, Florida, on March 3-6, 2019. The workshop is sponsored by the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society and the local IEEE chapter. The workshop features 4 plenary talks and 8 invited sessions with more than 40 distinguished researchers in this research community. In addition, the workshop has 3 interactive poster sessions with more than 100 presentations by graduate students and industry professionals. The workshop therefore provides a unique setting for graduate students to interact with and learn from experts from academia and industry. To support the training and education of next-generation scientists and engineers working on antenna technologies, this NSF grant provides travel support for graduate students to present their research papers at the conference and learn the advanced research and development in antenna technologies. The travel grants will be awarded competitively to 30 graduate students from U.S. institutions.  A selection committee is formed to manage the award selection process. To promote diversity, priority will be given to underrepresented students including women and minority. This NSF grant will benefit participating students by enabling them to gain experience and skills in presentation, to learn about the latest developments in antenna research and emerging applications, and to network with the international antenna community that can lead to future collaborations or career opportunities. As the antenna plays a vital role in many wireless systems and applications, this travel grant support has broad impacts to the society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
