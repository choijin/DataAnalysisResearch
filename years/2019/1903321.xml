<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty, and other researchers in a conference on "Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics" (FACM) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) on May 23 - 24, 2019. FACM 2019 is focused on mathematical and applications challenges related to systems involving particles in fluids, broadly interpreted. This topic is motivated by the significant recent progress that has been made in areas of discrete and continuum modeling of such systems, as well as in related fields within physics, biology, and the engineering disciplines. These systems are of relevance to a number of applications including materials science, energy applications, as well as health and medicine.  We also envision a significant focus on high-performance computing which is integral part of the research in this field. The conference, which is this year carried out jointly with the 11th Northeast Complex Fluids and Soft Matter Workshop, will include mini-symposia on applications of networks and computational topology to granular systems, as well as on suspensions, active matter, and related materials science systems. The conference will bring together mathematicians, scientists and engineers, with significant participation of junior researchers. More information can be found on the conference website http://m.njit.edu/Events/FACM19/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FACM conference series has been organized over the past fifteen years by the Department of Mathematical Sciences and Center for Applied Mathematics and Statistics at NJIT. The annual meeting is a forum for the dissemination of research in applied and computational mathematics and statistics. FACM conferences are more focused and student centered than large society meetings, and a goal of the organizers is to introduce future leaders in applied mathematics and engineering disciplines  to established investigators and emerging research areas. Participation of a large number of local junior researchers who typically attend NCS workshops will be particularly important this year.  The junior researchers will have a chance to present their work through posters and contributed talks which they will present in minisymposia alongside leading scientists. For students and postdocs, this will be a learning and networking experience that will help them with their research and career paths. Special efforts will be made to continue the participation underrepresented groups in the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
