<AbstractNarration>This award seeks to support U.S. student participation in the Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW), being organized as part of the 24th ACM International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), the premier conference on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. The event is in Berlin, Germany during 18-23 August 2019. This award specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshop in addition to the ICFP conference. The impact of the award relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners with general expertise in programming languages, and specific expertise in functional programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students attending the PLMW workshop with support from this grant will hear eminent researchers in the field talk about the latest trends in the field, and get one-on-one mentoring from these speakers and other mentors in research and pursuing their career aspirations. The connections formed at this event will help create lasting connections between researchers and students, thereby shaping emerging innovations in computer programming languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
