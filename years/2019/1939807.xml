<AbstractNarration>This award seeks funding to support conference expenses for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, as well as junior and/or female faculty to participate in the symposium on Acoustically-Active Colloids for Imaging and Therapy at the 2020 National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Philadelphia, PA. The symposium organizers are Eugenia Kharlampieva (University of Alabama at Birmingham), Andrew Goodwin (University of Colorado Boulder), and Jesse Jokerst (University of California, San Diego). The symposium will be open to all interested scientists/engineers actively working on topics related to acoustically-active particles for biomedical applications. NSF funding is requested specifically to partially offset the costs for  young researchers including  junior faculty, graduate students or postdoctoral fellows to attend the conference and present the results of their research efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Known for its excellent penetration depth and safe procedures, ultrasound imaging is a mainstay in the medical imaging world. Yet, only recently have colloidal structures been developed that can reliably interact with acoustic energies produce a defined sound output. This symposium served as a scientific forum for discussion of fundamentals of in the field of biomaterials colloidal science and acoustic interactions. Among the main themes of the forum were emerging applications of acoustically-active colloids in the field of medical imaging and therapy.  The distinguishing features of the symposium were emphasis on increased participation of young faculty, postdoctoral associates and graduate students; in-depth discussions of fundamentals of soft and solid acoustically-active colloidal materials including polymer nano- and microparticle, microbubbles and nanodroplets, acoustically-mediated drug and gene delivery agents, as well as a broad representation of applications and transformative research.  The symposium was a successful platform for scientists and engineers involved in synthesis of biologically relevant colloidal structures that can reliably interact with acoustic energies and in sharing the most recent advances made in the rapidly expanding field.    Broader Impact. The symposium brought together leading scientists working in the interdisciplinary area of biomaterials synthesis, properties, and applications. This symposium hosted one full day of fifteen oral presentations that included six newly appointed assistant professors as well as five well-established researchers in academia and industry, three postdoctoral scholars, and a graduate student who showcased their research and emphasized new trends and future directions at the interface  of colloidal science and acoustic interactions.
