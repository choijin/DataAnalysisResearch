<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry is supporting Professor Kirk Schanze at the University of Texas at San Antonio.  This investigation brings together several distinct studies that probe the fundamental, excited state properties of molecules when exposed to light.  Potential applications  are based on efficient light emission (phosphorescence) which enables the materials to serve as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs ? particularly efficient deep blue phosphors), solar cells, photodetectors, sensor and materials for medical diagnostics and therapy, which are widely used in today's society.  This research will advance fundamental insights with respect to the design and synthesis of molecules that efficiently react with light contribution to large sectors of new technologies in the commercial, military and health sectors.  This award provides new opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student training.  Professor Schanze develops education and outreach activities involving underrepresented groups in the science-technology-engineering-math (STEM) fields at a Hispanic Serving Institution.  Specifically, he will develop and distribute a module entitled 'Navigating Scientific/Technical Literature for Non-Scientists' (NSTL) with the goal of teaching the general public how to search and access the scientific, technical, and patent literature by using publicly-accessible resources and/or by using traditional subscription-based search and access tools typically available at local Universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Platinum acetylide molecules and polymers that contain pi-conjugated organic ligands provide a unique opportunity to investigate fundamental properties of spin-allowed and -forbidden electronic excited states in delocalized electronic systems.  This research focuses on several distinct studies that probe fundamental excited state properties and explore potential applications, focused particularly on new platinum-carbene based chromophores and polymers that exhibit efficient light emission.  Development of such materials expands the range of accessible optoelectronic organometallic materials and improves the understanding of relationships between chromophore structure and excited state properties.  A significant potential benefit could also emerge by the development of a new class of efficient deep blue phosphors for application in OLEDs.  The project advances knowledge in the fields of organic, organometallic and polymer materials chemistry with potential impacts on applications of organic electronics.  Special emphasis is placed on broadening the diversity of students working on this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
