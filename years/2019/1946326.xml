<AbstractNarration>Correlating ecosystem responses to past climate forcing is highly dependent on the use of reliable techniques for establishing the age of events (dating techniques). In Antarctic dry regions (land areas without glaciers), carbon-14 dating has been used to assess the ages of organic deposits left behind by ancient lakes. However, the reliability of the ages is debatable because of possible contamination with "old carbon" from the surrounding landscape. The proposed research will attempt to establish two alternate dating techniques, in situ carbon-14 cosmogenic radionuclide exposure dating and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), as reliable alternate dating methods for lake history in Antarctic dry areas that are not contaminated by the old carbon. The end goal will be to increase scientific understanding of lake level fluctuation in the lakes of Taylor Valley, Antarctica so that inference about past climate, glacier, and ecosystem response can be inferred. The results of this study will provide a coarse-scale absolute chronology for lake level history in Taylor Valley, demonstrate that exposure dating and OSL are effective means to understand the physical dynamics of ancient water bodies, and increase the current understanding of polar lacustrine and ice sheet responses to past and present climatic changes. These chronologies will allow polar lake level fluctuations to be correlated with past changes in global and regional climate, providing information critical for understanding and modeling the physical responses of these environments to modern change. This research supports a PhD student; the student will highlight this work with grade school classes in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to establish in situ carbon-14 exposure dating and OSL as reliable alternate (to carbon-14 of organic lake deposits) geochronometers that can be used to settle the long-disputed lacustrine history and chronology of Taylor Valley, Antarctica and elsewhere. Improved lake level history will have significant impacts for the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research (MCM LTER) site as the legacy of fluctuating lake levels of the past affects the distribution of organic matter and nutrients, and impacts biological connectivity valley-wide. This work will provide insight into the carbon reservoir of large glacial lakes in the late Holocene and have implications for previously reported radiocarbon chronologies. OSL samples will be analyzed in the Desert Research Institute Luminescence Laboratory in Reno, NV. For the in situ carbon-14 work, rock samples extracted from boulders and bedrock surfaces will be prepared at Tulane University. The prepared in situ carbon-14 samples will be analyzed at the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The two datasets will be combined to produce a reliable, coarse scale chronology for late Quaternary lake level fluctuations in Taylor Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
