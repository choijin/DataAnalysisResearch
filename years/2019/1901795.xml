<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for US-based researchers to participate in the third Women in Topology (WIT III) workshop that will take place August 25-29, 2019, at the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany. The workshop is organized by the Women in Topology network in a continuing effort to increase the visibility of active female researchers, while supporting and expanding research efforts by female mathematicians in a field of mathematics known as homotopy theory.  Following the format of the WIT I (2013) and WIT II (2016) workshops, both held at the Banff International Research Station, the main feature of the meeting is engagement in collaborative group projects for teams of 5-6 participants, each including senior and junior researchers.  The workshop is designed to help junior researchers develop collaborations and networks in the field.  Participants are based in thirteen different countries and include graduate students, postdocs, and faculty from a range of types of institutions, including four-year colleges.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy theory is a thriving field of algebraic topology. Previous workshops in the WIT series resulted in significant research contributions. In a similar spirit, participants in the WIT III workshop will work on team projects in the months leading up to the workshop, then work intensively together during the workshop period, with the goal of producing published papers.  Workshop organizers will serve as editors of the conference proceedings.  The past outcomes of this program indicate that it is successful not only in producing new results in the field, but also in the retention and success of the women who participate in it. This model has proved to be successful in several research areas. More information about WIT III is found at https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/events/scientific-events/single-scientific-events/women-in-topology-2019/description/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
