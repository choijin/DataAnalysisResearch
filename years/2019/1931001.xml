<AbstractNarration>We propose a "listen and learn" workshop to facilitate partnerships between NSF and Native American/Alaska Native (NA/AN) communities in the US to develop an innovation and STEM/STEAM-based entrepreneurship curriculum and incubator program.  The goals are to collect, understand, and document best practices among existing entrepreneurship incubator programs in NA/AN communities as well as envision what an entrepreneurship incubator program could look like.  Workshop participants will come away with knowledge of community needs, existing, existing successful models for NA/AN entrepreneurship programs, NSF entrepreneurship, lean launchpad, and the business model canvas; skills including: Customer discovery process; STEM, social, and community-based culturally-relevant entrepreneurship; positive attitudes around defining individual entrepreneurial mindsets and imagining a future NA/AN entrepreneurship incubator program.  The activity will help advance understanding of best practices among existing entrepreneurship incubator programs in NA/AN communities and to help develop a vision for what an NSF-sponsored program for NA/AN STEM entrepreneurs could look like.  It will lay a ground work for a pilot cohort of NA/AN entrepreneurs to participate in a culturally relevant I-Corps variant, Culturally Relevant Enterprise Development (CRED) program that could ultimately be expanded to other communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
