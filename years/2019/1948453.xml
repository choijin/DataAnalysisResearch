<AbstractNarration>The project will design and develop a web-based digital resource, entitled Laboratory Acquisition Protocols and Standards (LAPS), to facilitate public access to geophysical laboratory information. This information includes equipment capabilities, original and edited experimental data, laboratory calibrations, as well as information about testing protocols and procedures. Recent developments in data mining techniques and machine learning have made it possible to utilize and digest large amounts of information; yet such data must be initially prepared and structured in a meaningful way. This project will initially develop a prototype database resource with sample data, which will be available for testing by researchers and the public. The final resource will be compatible with Strabospot, a newly developed digital data system, which will enable the comparison of field and experimental data based on key criteria. The LAPS resource will help improve the quality of scientific and technical studies, such that: 1. Laboratory managers will be able to compare data using standardized testing protocols in order to improve data quality; 2. Data analysts will be able to quickly examine large sets of experimental data using new algorithms and potentially discover previously unnoticed phenomena and correlations; and 3.  teachers will be able to search and access experimental data in real-time to illustrate concepts discussed in the classroom. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory data are essential for testing and refining theories and models in the Earth sciences. Yet, this data is currently not accessible in digital, searchable form, limiting its utility. Recently a digital data system, StraboSpot, was developed to incorporate field and microstructural data and make it available to the public. The utility of StraboSpot will be further enhanced by the integration of data from laboratory experiments on rock mechanics and properties. However, there are a wide variety of specialized laboratories, and many follow their own procedures and standards. The goal of this project is to integrate relevant data and metadata from rock mechanics experiments conducted at any laboratory into the StraboSpot system so that the data is openly accessible and searchable by any interested party. This project will establish a coherent and effective way to describe equipment and experiments across a variety of testing rigs and devices to facilitate communication and common standards in experimental geophysics. Goals of the project include publishing data for the broad Earth science community and improving interlaboratory communication. Specific research objectives include: 1. Collecting data for lab specific procedures, needs, and current workflows; 2. Outlining and describing metadata structure, attributes, formats, and restrictions for experimental data via community input; 3. Building an inventory of experimental systems and their capabilities for the benefit of the experimental community; 4. Publishing applications and tools to aid integration with StraboSpot; 5. Demonstrating the capabilities of the system by integrating the applications into the workflows of rock deformation laboratories; and 6. Documenting ongoing progress on the projectâ€™s homepage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
