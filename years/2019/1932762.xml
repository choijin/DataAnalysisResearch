<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to provide partial travel support for 10 graduate students, post-docs and young investigators to attend the 11th International Conference on Porous Metals and Metallic Foams to be held from August 20-23, 2019 in Dearborn, Michigan. The conference focuses on new developments in the field of metallic foam and porous metal manufacturing science and engineering. The students present their research at the conference and exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from U.S. and international institutions. Travel grants for the students are based on diverse institutional representation. Priority is given to student participants who are women or who come from underrepresented groups. This approach promotes diverse participation at the conference. This award benefits the nation through the education and training of a skilled and diverse engineering workforce better prepared to provide transformative solutions to challenges in their chosen fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This participation support is expected to benefit the students' professional, scientific and technical development. Participants are given an opportunity to nurture a global vision in advanced manufacturing and learn about the latest developments in the field. A wide range of topics are presented to stimulate learning and training. These include additive manufacturing, freeze casting, fabrication, scalability, design, characterization, properties and industrial applications. Participating students learn by attending technical presentations by leading international experts in porous metals and metallic foams, and by interacting with fellow researchers from around the world. These experiences foster new ideas and a deeper fundamental understanding, which helps shape future of research in advanced manufacturing science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
