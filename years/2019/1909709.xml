<AbstractNarration>The latest-generation telescopes and instruments are opening a new window on the variable and transient universe.  Forthcoming time-domain surveys will collect thousands of observational epochs for most of the night sky.  But these data provide opportunities beyond the study of time series, and this project will work towards realizing the promise of higher resolution shape measurement and improving the inference of galaxy properties.  Preliminary work has already shown the promise of future success.  Students in applied mathematics, computer science and astronomy will join forces to tackle the challenges of real data and subtle effects.  Multi-epoch image and video analysis is arguably the fastest growing topic in data science today.  The images and methods created in this study are ideal for inspiring and training students.  The derived visual representations are also an efficient vehicle for public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science beyond the transient and variable cosmos comes firstly by oversampling in overlapping, repeated exposures, which can produce higher spatial resolution and shape measurements, thus improving weak lensing, cosmology and galaxy morphology studies.  Less obviously, introducing multiple effective sub-bands within a broad passband will significantly improve the inference of galaxy properties and the estimation of photometric redshifts.  This study will work towards the new methods needed to realize these opportunities, by (1) evaluating the limitations of these ideas in real situations, including photometric redshift estimation for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST); (2) developing optimal, efficient methods for reconstruction; and (3) implementing production-quality code to make super-resolution hyper-color images from multi-epoch astronomical observations.  The approach of building on robust statistics has already been successful in a monochrome setting, but multi-color will need detailed modeling of differential chromatic refraction (DCR) in the atmosphere.  This will require a new method to leverage the color-dependent subtle shifts in source directions due to DCR.  Part of the created educational material will be publicly available Jupyter notebooks in Python.  Colorful renderings of scientific data will be developed as live Jupyter notebooks and made available on the SciServer for all to view and to modify, using just a browser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
