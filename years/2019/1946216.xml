<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop soft robotic arms as human-compatible machines for harvesting applications in the agriculture industry. Currently, many fruits and vegetables are harvested by hand, representing un-automated area in an industry that has readily embraced technical advancements. By using soft robotic arms, farmers will be able to automate the processes of harvesting delicate fruits and vegetables without bruising. The implementation of these technologies can potentially ensure the entire crop is reliably and safely harvested in a timely manner. The soft robotics technology, being able to grip and transfer fruits and vegetables without bruising, can potentially significantly impact several agricultural industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will further develop a technology platform of soft robotic arms. By adding soft components in traditional robots or radically designing robots with mostly soft materials, soft robotic devices have demonstrated promising capabilities which have enabled many unique applications not possible with traditional robots. Inspired by nature, this project further develops a vasoconstriction-like micro pinch valve which enables localized flow control. Using this valve, it has been possible to build pneumatically-powered tetherless soft actuator prototypes, including soft arms and soft grippers, and demonstrate their advantages, such as flexibility and safety, over traditional robots. Such a soft robotic arm system is capable of navigating around complex obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this project, we performed a variety of tasks relating to the exploration of commercialization pathways for soft robotic gripping and modeling technologies. The primary activity was conducting interviews with potential customers and experts in the fields we were interested in. In addition to these interviews, the process was supplemented by opening and closing meeting for our cohort in LA. We also attended weekly workshops to assess our progress and develop new skills surrounding customer discovery, technology commercialization and entrepreneurship. The framework that we used to complete this work was the business model canvas, where we were able to identify key groups of people and entities that we needed to investigate prior to commercialization. When we started the project, we thought that our soft robotic gripping technology would be useful for strawberry farmers who relied heavily on human labor to harvest and care for their crops. However, during our interviews we discovered that human laborers were so cheap that creating a cost-effective robotic competitor was not viable at this point in time. With this knowledge we pivoted to exploring soft robotic modeling, another core technology our lab works on. After conducting additional interviews, we discovered that there is a need for soft robotic modeling software, and that many of the existing options are expensive, inefficient, or lack important features. This allowed us to make the determination that additional work on further developing our soft robotic modeling capabilities would have a high probability of leading to a commercially viable product in the future.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/04/2021<br>      Modified by: Yang&nbsp;Zhang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
