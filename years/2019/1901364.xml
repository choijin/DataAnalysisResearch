<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the international conference "Dynamics, Measures, and Dimensions" held at the Stefan Banach International Mathematical Center in Bedlewo, Poland, April 7-12, 2019.  The conference focuses on recent developments and breakthroughs in dynamical systems, ergodic theory, and geometric measure theory.  The goal is to bring together international experts in these fields, to foster exchange of ideas and collaborations, and to introduce junior scientists to very active areas of research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference aims to continue the tradition of US-Polish collaboration in dynamical systems and neighboring areas, as it will allow the fostering of face-to-face collaborations that might not occur as readily otherwise. The topics will include but are not limited to: conformal and holomorphic dynamical systems, rational functions and transcendental iteration, thermodynamic formalism, fractal geometry, random dynamical systems, infinite ergodic theory, one dimensional dynamics, orbit counting and Diophantine approximation. The versatile program of plenary talks is complemented by several shorter talks by young researchers, a poster session, a panel for advancing women's career in dynamics, and two crash courses, intended for graduate students and postdocs, that will take place the weekend before the conference. More information is available at: www.impan.pl/en/activities/banach-center/conferences/19-dynamics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
