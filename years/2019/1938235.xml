<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create value for grape farmers by reducing crop damage from frost by delaying the time when the buds break in spring.  The innovation proposed will reduce the costs of frost management, decrease yield loss, and improve quality. Delaying bud break will also assist in labor management by increasing the operating window for optimal shoot removal.  Grapes are the highest value fruit crop in the U.S. and the sixth largest crop globally.  Grape production is highly influenced by the weather, with frost damage among the top weather hazards. Success in the grape market opens the door to deployment with many other fruit crops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will allow grape growers to reduce frost damage and maximize resources for mechanization. This approach integrates many studies, including: biophysical and biochemical factors influencing the endogenous regulation of bud break, resistance to cold injury, and polymer sciences. Preliminary studies indicate the ability to resist wet conditions and regulate bud break by 10 to 14 days.  If the aims of this project are achieved, the technology will contribute significantly to farmersâ€™ abilities to cope with present and future threats of spring frost, with current mechanization and available labor limitations, and will be the foundation for continued innovation in tools that address current and emerging challenges of climate change. The project will demonstrate the feasibility of the spray through a series of in situ applications with partners in Washington and Illinois. In addition, the project will launch data analytics studies to guide the application timing of bud break delay technology by testing sensors for farm microclimate data acquisition and gaining access to critical data sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This technology has the potential transform the science of frost protection  while building U.S. economic strength. From the grower's standpoint, make this technology available to them means reductions of billions of dollars in crop losses each year, and from an environmental standpoint, the reduction of the large-carbon-footprint from current frost mitigation methods.    During the Phase I research period, we tested: A) the impact of different formulation to extend the durability of the product when exposed to field environmental conditions B) the extent to which the gel encapsulation formula[s] delays bud break, C) the bud break delay of capsules in vitro, D) the  cold hardiness of encapsulated grape tissue,  E) the moisture content of buds, and F) the impact that the capsule had on harvest maturity dates and berry quality.  We also G) implemented microclimate weather instrumentation in vineyards. After improving the formula in response to the Spring 2020 field trials, we increased the durability of the capsule with less focus on hydrophobicity, adding two objectives: H) develop a second generation of bud break delay formulations (Part 2), and I) test through a vineyard-sponsored field trial in Mendoza, Argentina (Part 2), which was supported by our partner, Bodegas Salentein Winery, and not by the Phase I project.  Analysis of those results was performed in the US as part of the Phase I effort.   Furthermore, we J) developed a decision support system (DSS) in response to growers expressed need for assistance in deciding when to apply the formula.  Key Technical Findings  A, H) The use of natural materials in the formation was more effective in promoting field durability of the gel than other type of particles, which tended to create internal stress and micro-voids.  At the beginning of the Phase I work, we expected that hydrophobicity would be the primary key to environmental durability.  B) In field tests, bud break delay averaged 3-4 days, whereas in laboratory it showed 2-11 days delay. Effects of the spray were reduced in the field because of capsule degradation from weather conditions, especially rain. Because the project period contained only one bud-break season, we tested an improved version of the formula in the laboratory with simulated weather stressors, and we tested for durability in the field.  The second-generation formula showed an average of 5-14 days of budbreak delay in the field.  These test results varied depending on the grape cultivar, physiological status of the grapevine, and number of days prior to bud break the spray is applied.  C, D) The encapsulation technology increased grapevine bud's freezing resistance (cold hardiness) by delaying the deacclimation of vines (i.e., lowering the killing temperature), which in turn makes ecodormant buds in spring more resistant to cold injuries. Cold hardiness of treated buds was 3-6 oC higher than controls. These results agreed with positive tendencies in yield increase found in treated vines.  E, F) The two cultivars monitored, Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) and Cabernet Franc (CF), showed no significant differences between treatment and control in sugar content, acidity, and pH.  CS did show significant differences in moisture content, with treated buds having higher freezing resistance and lower water content than controls.  CF showed no such difference.   G) Local plant-level sensors, reliably collected and reported data via the Internet in all four test sites, and revealed significant differences in the data collected compared to remote conventional weather stations. This finding points to 1) the benefit of on-site weather sensors to maximize effectiveness of the application, and 2) the need for tools that growers can use to manage crops based on more precise data. To address the broader pain point of resource management for viticulturalists and to guide the strategic application of our own product, we prototyped a Decision Support System in Phase I.  H) The enhanced formula remained intact 30-45 days in actual field conditions.  J) The downscaled seasonal and sub-seasonal forecasts coupled with the bud break prediction model in the DSS provided skillful estimates of frost risk with lead time up to 45 days.
