<AbstractNarration>IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks, IEEE DySPAN 2019, will be held between November 11 and November 14, 2019, in Newark, NJ, USA. DySPAN is a unique symposium that gathers industry, academia and regulatory communities and facilities interactions between these communities on technical, business and policy aspects of spectrum. DySPAN 2019 offers not only technical paper presentations but also a wide range of other educational formats, including panels, tutorials, industry presentations, posters and keynote speeches by leaders from academia and industry. Spectrum engineering and policy are crucial for the continued advancement of future wireless networks that provide enormous societal benefits and DySPAN is well positioned to provide a venue for exchange of research ideas and training of the future workforce in this multi-disciplinary area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to support approximately 12 U.S.-based students with travel grants to attend DySPAN 2019. The students will have the opportunity to present their work or attend this symposium without accepted papers. Most students attending the symposium will be working on topics related to communications, spectrum, protocol and modeling. They may discover new directions for their research that can lead to new intellectual contributions. Announcement for the Student Travel Grant will be posted on the DySPAN 2019 website and the committee will conduct outreach (e.g. to N2Women and other minority groups) to attract potential attendees. The announcement specifically encourages the participation of women, undergraduates and beginning graduate students, and underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
