<AbstractNarration>The Arctic is changing. The Distributed Biological Observatory studies these changes in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas. Investigators sample locations that are biologically important in U.S. territorial waters. These locations have been sampled annually since 2010. Other investigators also sample the same locations. As a result, the locations are sampled multiple times a year. Data are collected on environmental conditions including water column and sea floor animals that are food for whales, seals, and birds. Data are shared internationally. The project contributes to the U.S. National Ocean Policy and Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee 5-year plan. The data will be of value to U.S. and international science and management agencies, private industry, and local communities as they try to understand changes to the environment. The project supports four graduate students and one postdoctoral research associate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The observational plan includes consistent standard hydrographic and biological measurements along five transect lines located in the northern Bering and Chukchi Seas. These sampling locations are arrayed south-to-north and reflect a gradient of seasonal sea ice change and seawater warming. The investigators chose these 5 regions because they are zones of high biological productivity and biodiversity. Results so far indicate a freshening and warming of Pacific seawater which transits northward over the spring to fall season. These changes have impacted prey for larger marine mammals and seabirds. Satellite observations are also used to evaluate seasonal changes in sea ice concentration, surface seawater temperature, and chlorophyll concentration. The biological measurements focus on lower trophic levels and shipboard surveys of upper trophic level organisms. This research will increase our understanding of the impact of key environmental forcing parameters on biological change in the system. The collection of key prey-predator biological data along with physical and chemical measurements will allow for analyses and ecosystem modeling which will promote better understanding of Arctic environmental changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
