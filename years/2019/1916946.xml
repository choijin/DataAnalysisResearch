<AbstractNarration>This is a proposal to fund a multi-day workshop to be hosted by the Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona in October 2019. The goal of the workshop is to identify ways to facilitate research and education in this markedly interdisciplinary field that is assuming increased prominence in the Social and Behavioral Sciences. Bioarchaeology exists at the intersection of biological anthropology, archaeology, and socio-cultural anthropology. Practitioners to date have largely been trained in one of these sub-fields, assimilating additional information on an ad hoc basis.  The proposed workshop will focus upon creating a model curriculum across the relevant fields, while also defining big picture questions that invite bioarchaeological input. Problematic areas of methodological topics, especially those relating to research design and analytical methods, will receive in-depth treatment. The workshop provides a platform for scientific collaboration, the results of which will benefit those working to develop more effective methodologies and avenues for the dissemination of findings from anthropological research to promote public scientific understanding. Products from the workshop will be made publicly available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discussion at the workshop will focus on key issues facing the field, both curricular and in research. Examples include: 1) identifying and implementing a desirable balance in training between evolutionary theory, social theory, and methods; 2) how to creatively and effectively deal with the osteological paradox; 3) the research balance between big picture questions and focused, contextually rich research; 4) statistical approaches to small sample sizes and integrating continuous and categorical data; and 5) the importance of outreach and sensitivity to perspectives of descendent communities. Bioarchaeology, profoundly interdisciplinary, has emerged as a productive and popular anthropological research and teaching domain. To date, there has been no encompassing consideration of the curricular and research issues that should be addressed in order to advance the field and to take advantage of 21st century developments from outside anthropology, for example, in biogeochemistry, epigenetics, statistics, public health, and other physical and social sciences. Funds support travel costs for a diverse group of approximately 40 participants in various career stages to and from the School for Advanced Research in Tempe, AZ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Workshop on 21st Century Bioarchaeology: Taking Stock and Moving Forward     Bioarchaeology is an interdisciplinary field that investigates the lives of past peoples, primarily by studying human remains within their historical and archaeological contexts.  Bioparchaeology emerged during the 1970s in the US and has expanded globally, with bioarchaeologists represented in colleges, universities, and museums around the world.       Interdisciplinary scholars are typically trained rigorously in only one contributing discipline, and may thus be less likely to obtain discipline-specific grant funding that is crucial for research success, student training opportunities, and career advancement. This workshop was stimulated in part by the perception that bioarchaeology proposals are underrepresented among National Science Foundation (NSF) Senior Research Grants, especially within the Biological Anthropology Program.  This workshop was therefore organized to evaluate bioarchaeological training and research relative to the intellectual merit and broader impacts criteria of the National Science Foundation.  Funding for this Workshop was provided primarily by the NSF (awarded to Jane Buikstra Arizona state University [ASU], PI) and Sharon DeWitte (University of South Carolina, co-PI).  Support was also provided by the School for Human Evolution and Social Change (SHESC) and the Center for Bioarchaeological Research at ASU, which is gratefully acknowledged.    A questionnaire was circulated to prospective participants prior to the Workshop asking for input concerning issues of significance to bioarchaeological training, research, and outreach.  The results of this questionnaire served to focus the Workshop and as a basis for selecting participants and leaders for breakout sessions.  Held at ASU (Tempe, Arizona) March 6-8,2020, the conference included 40 bioarchaeologists (primarily middle career and senior bioarchaeologists) who were selected for their success in grant-getting, primarily in the United States, as indicated on award data bases.  We also added international representation as well as early career scholars known for their engagement with social issues. ASU graduate student support (Sarah Hall, Jessica Rothwell, Sofia Pacheco-For&eacute;s, Kelly Blevins) was essential to the success of the planning and execution of the workshop.  A welcome reception on March 6 included SHESC graduate students and faculty from across ASU, as well as workshop participants.  Buikstra began the workshop (3/7) by summarizing its vision and logistics, followed by brief remarks from Rebecca Farrell (biological anthropology) and John Yellen (archaeology) representing the NSF.  The remaining all-participant introductory session considered two methodological issues of broad concern in bioarchaeological research, small and biased samples (Christopher Stojanowski) and Bayesian modeling (Lyle Konigsberg).  We then began a series of four focus-group sessions on topics relating to rigor in graduate training and the execution of high quality bioarchaeological research, with a goal of enhancing the Intellectual Merit of bioarchaeological research.  These discussions focused upon key research challenges and opportunities faced by bioarchaeologists today (including the osteological paradox, DoHaD, integrating genomic knowledge with bioarchaeological models, and biological vs social estimations of sex/gender and age) and graduate training (including balance between methods and theories).     Complementing these two sets of sessions were two devoted to exploring ways of bringing bioarchaeological research to bear on contemporary issues and thus improve the Broader Impacts thereof. These issues included migration, inequality, environmental crises, epidemic disease, human adaptability, and violence.  Two sessions also focused upon methods for outreach to various publics via media of different forms.  Our daily closing sessions focused upon summaries of each session by the session moderator and the scribe, who were chosen from session participants.  The scribe was charged with reporting key points, which would serve as a basis for a report to be generated by the moderator and scribe within 2 weeks of the end of the Workshop.  Graduate student recorders were charged with recording the discussion generally, though without the detail captured by transcriptions.  The recorders notes are available to the organizers; the scribes’ notes were made available to all participants via Dropbox.   Given time limitations, the organizers perceived a need to add essays to the adaptation session and the biological vs social age, sex/gender sessions.  These were solicited from appropriate participants and gratefully received.       Planned Workshop products include 1) a summary article to be submitted to the Yearbook of Physical Anthropology during 2021, written by Buikstra and DeWitte, with oversight and co-authorship by all participants, including the graduate assistants; 2) organized symposia sessions for anthropological and archaeological national meetings, 3) extension of the Workshop concept to other regions (e.g., Latin American), also awaiting the lifting of COVID-19 travel restrictions; and 4) a survey of graduate students and early career professionals in bioarchaeology concerning their perception of the adequacy of their training on various topics including ethics, methods, and theories.  This questionnaire was generated by Rothwell in collaboration with Hall, Buikstra, and DeWitte during the summer and fall of 2020.  It has received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval at Arizona State University (Buikstra sponsorship) and will be distributed during 2020.  Results will be compiled by Rothwell, Buikstra, and DeWitte.                Last Modified: 12/02/2020       Submitted by: Jane Buikstra]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
