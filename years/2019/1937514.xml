<AbstractNarration>Almost all of Earth's northern biomes have evolved in the absence of earthworms since the last glacial maximum. This status quo is rapidly changing, however, due to advancing human disturbances and land use changes in the cold regions of the world. Invasive European earthworms are now beginning to appear at the edge of Alaskan permafrost. Among these invasive earthworms, geoengineering earthworms include species that physically disturb soil environments. Invasion of geoengineering earthworms is an irreversible process resulting in rapid deterioration of ecosystem functions including soil carbon and nutrient cycling and reduction of floral and faunal biodiversity. Early intervention is key, and it is urgent to establish the underlying scientific knowledge of earthworm invasion in Alaska. Here the principal investigator proposes to conduct rapid assessments of the distribution and primary introduction mechanisms of exotic earthworms across diverse ecoregions in Alaska. This research will also reveal the extents that the invasive earthworms, where present, disturb boreal and tundra soils in Alaska. By collaborating with Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, Agricultural Extension Station of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, and the University of Alaska Museum, the investigator will leverage this RAPID project as a way to facilitate agency-, public-, and policy-level actions to stop earthworm invasion in Alaska in its infancy - before it is too late to act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vast boreal forests and tundra of Alaska are increasingly threatened by ongoing climate change. Global scale climate impacts on soil biogeochemistry can, however, be substantially accelerated by increasing introductions of exotic European geoengineering earthworms. The project goal is to (1) urgently prepare research community for this upcoming change and (2) facilitate early intervention to stop earthworm invasion in Alaska. The investigator seeks to test the following hypotheses: 1) human introduction (not climate conditions) primarily limits the current earthworm distribution in Alaska; 2) impacts of exotic geoengineering earthworms on Alaskan soils are more dramatic than those reported for the formerly glaciated temperate forests in the contiguous U.S.; 3) species composition of exotic geoengineering earthworms differs by human introduction mechanisms in Alaska; and 4)  earthworms' ability to invade into boreal and tundra depend on their population compositions. To test the hypotheses, the investigator will examine earthworm populations and their impacts on soils at the interfaces between human-disturbed areas and the surrounding natural vegetation at field sites that reflect the major eco-regions and range of climate conditions including extents of permafrost in Alaska. This RAPID project will contribute to advancing science by newly highlighting the vulnerability of the Alaskan Arctic to the combination of both human land use changes and climate change. In addition to peer-reviewed publications, the investigator will publish a booklet that helps land managers and citizens to identify exotic geoengineering earthworms on their properties and assess their impacts on the natural vegetation and soils in Alaska. Collected earthworm specimens will be archived in the University of Alaska Museum, and specimen-specific information will be published online through the Museum's database for the broader scientific community and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
