<AbstractNarration>This award is for the partial support of the International Conference on Electron, Ion and Photon Beam Technology and Nanofabrication (EIPBN) to be held May 28-31, 2019, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The conference includes presentations, exchange of ideas, and extended discussions and interactions among international participants, academics, industry leaders and government stakeholders in the areas of nanofabrication and nanomanufacturing. This forum is instrumental in the generation and incubation of breakthrough and transformative ideas in many scientific areas in nanotechnology and advanced manufacturing. This award supports the participation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty members. Women and under-represented minority students are targeted to attend and participate in the conference activities. The requested NSF funds provide support for the attendance of about 36 students. This international conference is a key mechanism for linking basic science with engineering towards the development of useful nano-enabled products, which benefit the US economy and society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EIPBN is a major international conference, which provides a single forum for discussion of the latest developments in the synthesis, fabrication, manufacturing, imaging, measurement and characterization of small-scale or nano-scale structures, multi-layered devices and integrated multi-scale systems. Regular meetings of the key researchers, developers and users in the advanced nano manufacturing field are necessary for the exchange of ideas, information, and knowledge to enable and accelerate advances and breakthroughs in nanofabrication and nanomanufacturing. This conference offers a platform for the open exchange of new and previously unpublished scientific research and ideas. It fosters education and workforce development through presentations, lectures, short courses, and other student-oriented activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of the conference is to advance knowledge by enabling the exchange of information concerning advanced and emerging nanofabrication and nanomanufacturing topics and how they enable traditional and novel applications. The conference encompassed a short-course workshop session, a commercial exhibit session, a plenary session, an Industrial Highlights session, an exhibitor pitch session, 29 oral sessions organized in 3 parallel tracks, and 2 poster sessions. The meeting provided excellent opportunities for training and professional development for both student attendees and more established researchers. In addition to the technical sessions, there were multiple special sessions designed to allow for professional development. These included the Industrial Highlight, Exhibitor Quick Pitch, and the Start-Up Competition to foster collaboration between academia and industry.
