<AbstractNarration>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) offer the potential for significant improvements in the mobility, safety, accessibility, and sustainability of transportation systems. As the automotive industry continues rapid advances in the technical domain, there are a myriad of associated social consequences that will result from large-scale deployment. However, these consequences are not well understood, and there is an imminent need to train students in sociomobility -- an area of research at the intersection of engineering and the social sciences. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Michigan State University will train future thought leaders for careers that are focused on the development of innovative, multidisciplinary solutions that jointly address both the technical and societal aspects of AVs. The program will: (1) examine social, political, legal, and economic concerns that may affect the widespread adoption of AVs; (2) assess issues related to social equity and the accessibility of AVs to groups with limited mobility alternatives, including adolescent, elderly, low-income, and disabled individuals; and (3) study the implications of AVs on public health, urban planning, workforce development, and the environment. The site will provide research experiences leading to technological advances with potential for near-immediate adoption by public agencies and private industry, while the scientific findings will help to shape emerging policies and programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this project is to engage 30 undergraduate students in a rigorous program that provides exposure to a diverse range of educational and research opportunities under the sociomobility theme. Student cohorts will be recruited with emphases on technical and social diversity, and the program will leverage existing campus resources as part of a robust initiative. The 10-week program will allow participants to play an active and meaningful role in a series of multi-disciplinary projects under the direction of faculty from various departments and programs. These projects will be developed collaboratively with a diverse range of public and private industry stakeholders while supplementing ongoing campus-wide mobility research efforts. The students will gain immersive, hands-on experience in addressing sociomobility issues, furthering our understanding of both the technological capabilities and societal implications of new mobility solutions that are introduced in complex social systems. Participants will work in pairs as part of a tiered mentoring structure that includes direct interaction with faculty and graduate students who have complementary expertise from engineering and social sciences. Over the course of the program, students will also participate in a series of short technical courses, professional development workshops, and a lunch and learn seminar series. At the conclusion of the program, students will have the opportunity to present their results in a student symposium and a professional conference setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
