<AbstractNarration>This project examines Black women teachers' pre-service preparation in an effort to broaden participation of African American girls in computer science (CS) careers by developing their computational thinking (CT) skills. This study will examine how Black elementary school teachers learned to support their kindergarten through sixth grade African American female students to learn CT in efforts to inspire their futures in the CS workforce. The objective of this research is to understand how African American women teachers support Black students to enter computer science careers.  We will specifically examine: 1) teacher certification program components that build CT for elementary Black girls; 2) training in culturally responsive computing (CRC); 3) CRC training in ways that support African American girls; and 4) best practices for supporting Black teachers at institutions of higher education where teacher certification programs train predominately white future teachers. The overarching objective of this research study is to add to the literature by exploring how Black female teachers learn to inspire Black girls' participation in the CS workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
