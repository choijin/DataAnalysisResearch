<AbstractNarration>This NSF INCUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot will increase the recruitment, retention, and matriculation of racial and ethnic minorities in STEM Ph.D. programs contributing to hazards and disaster research. Increasing STEM focused minorities on hazards mitigation, and disaster research areas will benefit society and contribute to the achievements of specific, desired societal outcomes following disasters. The Minority SURGE Capacity in Disasters (SURGE) launch pilot will provide the empirical research to identify substantial ways to increase the underrepresentation of minorities in STEM disciplines interested in hazards mitigation and disaster research. Increasing the involvement of qualified minorities will help solve the broader vulnerability concerns in these communities and help advance the body of knowledge through the diversity of thought and creative problem solving in scholarship and practice. Utilizing workshops and a multifaceted mentorship program SURGE creates a new model that addresses the diversity concerns in both STEM and disaster fields, and make American communities more resilient following natural disasters. This project will be of interest to policymakers, educators and the general public.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Minority SURGE Capacity in Disasters (SURGE) NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot will enhance the social capital of racial and ethnic minority communities by increasing their networks, connections, and access to disaster management decision-making among members of their community from STEM fields. The four-fold goals of SURGE are to: (1) increase the number of minority graduate researchers in STEM fields with a disaster focus; (2) develop and guide well-trained, qualified disaster scholars from STEM fields; (3) provide academic and professional mentorship for next generation minority STEM scholars in hazards mitigation and disaster research; and (4) develop professional and research opportunities that involve outreach and problem solving for vulnerable communities in the U.S. The SURGE project is organized as a lead-organization network through the University of Nebraska at Omaha and includes community partners. As a pilot project, SURGE participation is limited to graduate students from research-intensive universities across the country. Each student will attend workshops and training programs developed by the project leads. SURGE investigators will conduct project evaluation and assessment of their workshops, training, and mentorship projects. Results from evaluations and assessments will be presented at STEM and disaster-related conferences and published in peer-reviewed academic journals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Minority SURGE Building Capacity in Disasters (SURGE) program emerged as a National Science Foundation Design and Development Launch Pilot for the INCLUDES initiative, focused on <strong>S</strong>cholars from <strong>U</strong>nder-<strong>R</strong>epresented <strong>G</strong>roups in <strong>E</strong>ngineering and <strong>S</strong>ocial Science. INCLUDES is an NSF acronym which stands for Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science. The SURGE program, led by seven disaster scholars from across the nation, designed a three-fold approach to attract, unite, and retain minority graduate students to research and employment at the nexus of STEM and Disasters. The program also developed an experiential learning model, Boots-on-the-Ground, where SURGE Scholars participated in reconnaissance missions and conducted research post-disaster in the U.S. Virgin Islands following the impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. A key component of the boots-on-the-ground experience was the opportunity to holistically explore the envirnomental, built environment, and human impacts from the storms. The boots-on-the-ground experience provided the opportunity for the Scholars to present their findings twice at the Natural Hazards Workshop (NHW) in Colorado. The NHW is one of the rare interdisciplinary academic research forums dedicated to disasters and hosts more than 500 federal, state, and local mitigation and emergency management officials; representatives of nonprofit, private sector, and humanitarian organizations; hazards and disaster researchers; and others dedicated to alleviating the impacts of disasters. The workshop provided a unique exposure opportunity for student participants.&nbsp;</p> <p>As proposed, the program has made an indelible mark on the 21 racial and ethnic minority graduate students who participated. The participants represented 18 universities and 13 different disciplines. The universities represented state institutions, private schools (including ivy league), historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and a minority-serving intuition (MSI). Since the start in 2017, six participants have graduated from their academic programs. Three are focused on academic careers, and three are working or interning in federal agencies; all are directly or indirectly focused on disasters, resiliency, or sustainability.</p> <p>In 2018, several SURGE team leaders (PI and co-PIs) worked with the St. Thomas Long-Term Recovery Team to assist in securing external funding for the nonprofit. Several students and a few of the team leaders were able to help promote urban agriculture and cooperative community farming on the island to lessen food import dependency using a sustainable gardening method, "African Keyhole Gardens." The SURGE sub-team was then able to pilot the gardens during the boots-on-the-ground mission, creating a video and guidebook for the public. Since the initial gardens have been built, the St. Thomas Long-Term Recovery Team has continued to build, with the aim of nearly 100 gardens on the island.</p> <p>Additionally, during the 2018 Boots-on-the-ground experience, other sub-teams focused on a variety of projects. One team worked with the University of Virgin Islands to assist in recovery and mitigation work on the drainage infrastructure features along each of the three main islands (St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix). Another team worked with the nonprofit, All Hearts and Hands with building construction in St. John. Yet another team worked on mapping food desserts and the cultural and financial disparities of food sold at grocery stores in St. Thomas.</p> <p>In 2019, as the NSF INCLUDES DDLP funding ends, the impact of SURGE is ongoing. SURGE team leaders have begun to expand the Boots-on-the-Ground experience to undergraduates at their home institutions. Bucknell University hosted 16 undergraduate students in Houston, Texas, post-Hurricane Harvey. The University at Albany will host 11 undergraduate students in U.S. Virgin Islands in March 2020 alongside new partners from the University of Nebraska at Omaha and University of Nebraska- Lincoln, who will also bring 11 undergraduate students. The teams have developed additional collaborations with local volunteer organizations and researchers in extended areas, including public works and public health. The program has attracted the attention of over ten university programs, four research centers, four federally funded initiatives, and four university-funded initiatives, all interested in partnerships.</p> <p>The SURGE program has contributed to the body of science from papers published by both team leaders and SURGE scholars. The articles highlight the reconnaissance mission, the research projects undertaken, the diversity necessary in the fields surround disaster management, and the scholarship of teaching and learning through experiential programs. The SURGE program has also contributed to society by increasing and enhancing the community capacity in the locations of the boots-on-the-ground experiences. By working alongside community partners, shared knowledge was developed to increase the resiliency potential of high-risk communities. Furthermore, the SURGE program provided workshops, training, and tangible real-world experiences to retain and develop well-trained scholars and practitioners successfully. With the expansion into the undergraduate space, the concept of SURGE is to develop a pipeline which promotes the idea of pursuing research and research-informed practices that both reduce the disaster vulnerabilities of underrepresented communities and encourage more disaster focused STEM studies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/02/2020<br>      Modified by: Deedee&nbsp;Bennett</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929204/1929204_10521117_1583164018856_KickOff_11--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929204/1929204_10521117_1583164018856_KickOff_11--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2019 SURGE Kickoff in PR Feb 2019"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929204/1929204_10521117_1583164018856_KickOff_11--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2019 SURGE Kickoff in PR Feb 2019"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SURGE Scholars, Team Leaders, and Partners in Puerto Rico to learn of the comparative impacts of both US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico following Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
