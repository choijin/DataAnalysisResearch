<AbstractNarration>In recent decades the growth in the number of people on probation, on parole, in jail, and in prison has required increased public expenditures, often limiting funds available for other essential services such as education and health care.  Effective community supervision (i.e., probation and parole) offers the possibility of containing these costs when it keeps people out of jail and prison, increases their employment, and promotes individual and community health and welfare. One of the main ways that probation and parole officers can influence offenders is through the discussions that occur during supervision.  However, compared to knowledge about how doctors and other medical and mental health professionals interact effectively with patients, little is known about ways to increase the positive impact that probation and parole officers can have on offenders.  Prior research on women who are supervised in the community has shown that when supervising officers give offenders the information they need to establish a prosocial lifestyle (e.g., strategies to find jobs or avoid substance misuse), it reduces supervision failures and limits costs. It also showed that having a two-way conversation with offenders increased their compliance with requirements. The main goal of this research is to determine the specific forms of communication that are effective for both male and female offenders.  This goal is important because (1) men and women on supervision face different problems, and (2) research has shown that men and women often respond differently to the same messages.  In addition, because people who are under community supervision are disproportionately African American, the study also examines differences in effective communication for men and women from minority versus majority groups.  This knowledge is essential for making efficient use of community supervision resources and for developing educational and training programs.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study uses communication and psychological theories and research methods to gain a better understanding of effective officer-offender communication. It examines both officer and offender perceptions of supervision interactions and tests for gender and race differences in those perceptions. The study addresses the key questions: (1) Do the content and manner of communication predict subsequent positive and negative behavior? (2) Is the effect of communication on outcomes different for gender and racial groups? In particular, the focus is on communication about three areas critical to reducing recidivism: employment, substance misuse, and contact with people who break the law. The research also includes an experiment testing whether, for example, informational-oriented messages are more effective if they support the offender's autonomy.  Finally, the study identifies messages from supervising officers that have lasting positive effects on offenders' actions. To address these questions, ninety supervising officers and 300 men and 300 women from their caseloads will be studied. Officers will complete two on-line surveys and offenders will complete two interviews, both at six-month intervals. Official sources will be used to gather criminal history data, data on supervision intensity, non-compliance with supervision requirements, new arrests, and new convictions. Including both officer and offender perspectives as well as official data will provide unique insights into the supervision process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
