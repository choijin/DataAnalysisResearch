<AbstractNarration>Providing effective and engaging laboratory experiences is an important part of the effort to improve undergraduate biology education. Introducing current and cutting-edge topics to undergraduate students keeps them excited and brings relevance to the material being studied. The rapidly emerging technology of genomic engineering using programmable nucleases like the CRISPR-Cas9 system is a topic that is both scientifically exciting and socially relevant. As CRISPR-Cas9 continues its meteoric rise into mainstream molecular biology, it is essential for students to learn how to work with it. To that end, this award will support a four-day workshop at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities that builds on the momentum of a similar project in 2018. The overall goal of the conference organizers is to expand the development and propagation of effective CRISPR-Cas9 tools across multiple model systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;At the conference a group of "veterans" from the 2018 workshop will join CRISPR-Cas9 experts across several popular model systems to work with a new cohort of undergraduate-focused instructors towards three objectives. The first is to foster "big sibling/little sibling" working groups between 2018 workshop alumni and new 2019 participants that can sustain the experiences from the workshop. The second is to share the successful implementation efforts of participants from the 2018 workshop, improve previously implemented pedagogical modules, and create new ones beyond the scope of the original zebrafish workflow suitable to different types of classrooms/labs. Finally, the conference will continue to foster and provide support to the undergraduate educators to disseminate gene engineering/editing technologies and make innovations to their classrooms/labs. The long-term goal of this workshop is to form small, regional groups of experienced and new instructors that can support each other both locally and nationally and to develop online resources that will allow these groups to publicly share their insights with the education community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The meeting provided the opportuniy to explore CRISPR-Cas9 through the use of a modular workflow designed around the use of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model system but which is adaptable for use across a variety of model systems.  Equally important to the workshop were sessions dedicated to pedagogical best practices and discussion of ideas for implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 into the undergraduate classroom in an accessible and manageable manner.      Post-meeting assessment revealed that participants were most appreciative of the ability to work through the workflow in a deliberate manner and in close colaboration with a diversity of fellow instructors.  The use of facilitators who were alumni of the previous workshop and who had direct experience with implementation of the workflow in their classrooms was also a significant asset to the participants.  Comments from participants highlighted the ability to take tools from the workshop and directly implement them into classwork at their respective institutions immediately in the following semester.  Importantly, the participants and facilitators of the workshop continue to collaborate and communicate to this day, providing the foundation for a network of undergraduate instructors who can develop new and innovative CRISPR-Cas9 pedagogical modules for public dissemination.
