<AbstractNarration>This award will partially support the participation of approximately 20 participants in the 2019 Theory Winter School at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee Florida, which will take place from January 7th to January 11th. Preference will be given to supporting graduate students, postdoc, and junior faculty participants. The winter school will feature lectures from leading scientists, and will address current challenges in theoretical and experimental condensed matter physics, discussing new ideas and future research directions, and will enable networking and future collaborations among the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
