<AbstractNarration>Chemical technicians have vital roles in the manufacture and improvement of many consumer products, ranging from shampoos, cereal, and engine oil, to new medicines.  They work in industrial facilities such as chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants, environmental laboratories, forensic chemistry labs, and the food and beverage industry. These technicians are typically trained in chemical technology programs.  Despite the essential roles of chemical technicians in the national workforce, many people are unaware of either the career possibilities in chemical technology or the chemical technology education programs across the nation.  This project plans to strengthen the Colleges’ Associate of Applied Science in Chemical Technology program so that it is more visible and accessible to students, including students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM, veterans, and students with General Education Development credentials.  The project also intends to educate local employers, high school teachers, and high school students about the chemical technology field and its opportunities. To achieve these goals, the project plans to develop new partnerships and collaborations, prepare educational materials and approaches that explain the roles of chemical technicians in science and society, increase interest in Associate of Applied Science degrees, and clarify the need for more skilled technical workers.  Expected outcomes include an increase in STEM teacher awareness of the chemical technology field and educational pathways, a larger number of students who have experiences in the chemical technology laboratory and its career paths, and expanded hiring of graduates with Associate of Applied Science in Chemical Technology graduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to advance the recruitment efforts of the chemical technology program, to incorporate STEM teaching practices that maximize student learning in this advanced technology trade, and to educate the public about this high-demand advanced technology field.  Activities supported by the project will focus on serving potential students and career influencers, such as teachers, faculty, counselors, and administrators. Project activities include:  (1) implementing a summer STEM teacher academy to provide educators with experiences in chemical laboratory sciences and the career possibilities for chemical technology graduates; (2) hosting an annual high school student academy where students can use advanced analytical equipment and learn about the chemical technology profession; (3) establishing a new work-based learning agreement that will allow Cape Fear Community College’s Chemical Technology laboratory to serve as an on-boarding facility for employers, thus fast-tracking student employment after graduation; and (4) hiring a liaison who will focus on student recruitment, student retention, and employer awareness throughout the state of North Carolina.  These activities are expected to support the project plan of recruitment, enrollment, employment of students into the chemical technology workforce. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
