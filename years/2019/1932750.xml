<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to transform the provision of early mobility devices to infants and very young children with motor impairments.  There is currently no mobility device commercially available that is reasonably priced and that can be controlled by very young children, despite the growing belief that early mobility is necessary for the development of cognition, perception, language, and socialization. This project can potentially benefit the 35,000 or more children born each year in the US who require significant assistance with mobility when very young, including those who may eventually be able to move on their own. Availability of this device could change the way physicians and therapists approach the treatment of these children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further develops prototype early mobility devices designed for infants and very young children with motor impair. The device is innovative in that it provides an intuitive control method. Infants control the device by leaning in the direction they want to move. Mobile robot technology provides the powered mobility base.  A set of force sensors on the top of the robot support a seat and are used by custom software to determine if the child is sitting upright (as measured during an initial calibration phase) or is leaning forward or to the left or right.  If the child is determined to be leaning, the software moves/turns in the desired direction.  The software also permits the device to be customized so that if the infant is only able to make very small postural changes, the robot will still respond. The device leaves the child's hands free to interact with objects in the environment. Two safety features are also integrated:  Range sensors stop the robot if an obstacle is detected; the child can then move in any direction other than into the obstacle.  A remote control allows an adult to take control of the robot at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to determine whether there was a need and a market for a powered mobility device for infants and young children.  Most experts in the field of pediatric mobility agree that when a typically-developing infant starts to crawl (at around 7 months of age) this onset of independent mobility contributes to physical, cognitive and social development in an important way.  Yet there is no device currently available that infants as young as 6 months of age with delayed mobility can learn to control in order to gain independent mobility.  We have devleoped a device that infants as young as 5 month of age can learn to independently control.  Our previous research has also shown that there is a significant development in executive function for children provided with mobility versus those who are not.  We believed this device would be valuable as a product provided to parents and therapists.  This project allowed us to travel and to interview many stakeholders, such as parents of children with motor impairment, pediatric occupational and physical therapists, and others.  As a result, we determined that our device did meet a need and that there was a market for it.  Since our participation in this I-Corp program, we have formed a company, Assistance in Motion, and are moving forward with our plans to produce a marketable assistive technology for very young child with delayed or permanent motor impairment.
