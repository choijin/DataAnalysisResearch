<AbstractNarration>This project examines STEM trajectories of women of color who start their STEM education at two-year public institutions. The goal is to use national and social network data: to 1) understand the integration of mobility patterns, student characteristics, college experiences, and institutions to support career persistence in STEM women of color; and 2) identify what influential networks at the student- and institutional-level have affected their scientific thinking, and persistence and success in STEM. To accomplish the research goals, the investigator will deepen her knowledge of biological sciences education, qualitative and quantitative research design and methods, and data analysis.  Guided by working with her advisors and mentor, specific professional development activities include pursuit of a data analytics certificate and attending network analysis/ softare workshops and STEM conferences. The study will advance knowledge about successful, first-generation women of color STEM majors who started their careers in community colleges and the factors that enabled them to persist. This research has the potential to inform retention initiatives for underrepresented groups at other academic institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will use Social Network Analysis  and a mixed methods approach to understand how advisors, peers, and relatives influence the persistence and STEM career trajectories of women of color who attend community colleges. The research questions will be answered through two stages of analysis, including descriptive statistics and multiple membership random modeling. The investigator will:  1) map the networks that provide navigational capital to the student participants; 2) quantify a matrix of resistance for what aids and deters students as they navigate STEM pathways; and 3) contextualize how influential networks enable students to overcome personal and institutional challenges. The matrix combines complex systems and socio-ecological theory to track non-linear, adaptive, and emergent interactions. The longitudinal and network data will be provided through the National Center for Education Statistics, Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, and the Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System, questionnaires, and qualitative interviews.  The findings will be significant in mapping the complex pathways of women of color STEM majors and informing institutions about ways to improve academic services and support for this understudied group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is supported through NSF's EHR Core Research Building Capacity in STEM Education Research competition that is designed to build individuals' capacity to carry out high quality fundamental STEM education research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
