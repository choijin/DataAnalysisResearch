<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the area of neurosurgical treatment for evacuating abnormal fluid collections in the brain. While the technology is primarily intended to treat chronic subdural hematomas, it may have a role in treating other types of brain hemorrhage, infection, and cancer. A chronic subdural hematoma is a fluid collection containing blood breakdown products and is located between the brain and its covering called the dura. Current treatment for such fluid collections typically involves surgery to evacuate the fluid collection through holes or surgical removal of bone pieces of varying sizes, followed by irrigation and drain placement. This is the one of the most common neurosurgical procedures. Recovery is often prolonged, and recurrence can be common. There is a significant need for less invasive and more effective treatments. A less invasive treatment would allow for an effective bedside procedure, reducing the cost associated with a major brain surgery and facilitating recovery.  Reduction in recurrence rates is expected to lead to improved health, reduced disability and increased independence in patients, and reduce costs associated with repeat hospitalizations and procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is aimed at determining the commercial potential of a device for evacuating abnormal fluid collections in the brain. The device is a system that allows for continuous irrigation of areas in the head with control of the pressure and monitoring of the fluid. The desgn allows for percutaneous bedside placement of bolts connected to catheters and a pump that replaces the chronic subdural hematoma with normal cerebrospinal fluid.  Access is minimally invasive, and the approach is designed to be a bedside procedure. Next steps in the development include plans to test the prototype device in biophysical brain models. Depending on these results, it may be necessary to develop animal models of the conditions intended to be treated, or it may be possible to proceed to human clinical trials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
