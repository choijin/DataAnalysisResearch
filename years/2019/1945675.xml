<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description&lt;br/&gt;Plant synthetic biology is an emerging field that intersects many disciplines, including plant biology, synthetic biology, computational modeling and mathematical analysis, and engineering sciences to enable crop improvement and enhanced bio-production of high value chemicals.  The award will provide travel and registration support to facilitate participation of US-based researchers, including graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early stage investigators in the 3rd International Conference on Plant Synthetic Biology, Bioengineering, and Biotechnology Conference to be held October 4-6, 2019 in Cambridge, United Kingdom.  This meeting will bring together researchers from academia, industry, and government to participate in a highly interactive and engaging meeting, enabling professionals and young researchers to hear from one another through organized talks, panel discussions, and poster sessions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Presented by the Society of Biological Engineering (SBE), the conference includes scientists and engineers from universities, industry and government, and consists of multiple sessions in areas such as:  photosynthetic factories, novel bioproducts, new tools and technologies in synthetic biology, engineering biotic interactions, engineering plant development and morphology, and engineering primary productivity, and food and nutritional security.  Through the interactive program, the conference will provide a venue for:   scientific presentations from a diverse group of international researchers working in various areas, active student and trainee engagement in the field, investigators from diverse disciplines to discuss cutting edge methodologies and approaches in plant synthetic biology.  The conference will help promote the participation of women and underrepresented scientists in the field of plant sciences, synthetic biology, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
