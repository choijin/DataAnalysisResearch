<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research/Texas A&amp;M University, located in College Station, TX, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020-22. It is anticipated that 30 students, from schools with limited research opportunities and/or from under-represented groups, will be trained in this program. Recruiting efforts focus on students who have completed their freshman, sophomore or junior years. The program combines cutting-edge lab research and professional skill development. Students will learn how to do research from faculty who direct nationally-funded programs. In addition, students will attend weekly meetings to support the development of their professional skills. Meeting topics include responsible conduct of research, developing research questions, applying to graduate school, and instruction in presentation skills. At the end of the program, students will present their research accomplishments in written and oral reports. Participants will learn how research is conducted, and many will present their results at scientific conferences and/or in scientific publications. The program promotes the development of research and communication skills that are critical for success in graduate school and careers in research. Assessment of the program will be done using the online SALG-URSSA assessment tool. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants become members of labs in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics. Participants study the structure and function of macromolecules in research projects investigating energy production by mitochondria, cell membrane components involved in signal transduction, uptake or secretion, bacterial cell organization, metabolites that regulate bacterial communities, proteins and RNAs that regulate chromosomes and/or gene expression, the use of bacteriophage to treat bacterial infections, and more. Ethics and responsible conduct in research training use case studies to promote dialogue among students. The PI and co-PI consider academic record, reference letters, diversity, and interest in pursuing graduate education and a career in science when selecting participants. The web-based SALG URSSA assessment tool will be used to determine the effectiveness of this training program. More information about the program is available at https://biochemistry.tamu.edu/academics/summer-undergraduate-research-in-biochemistry/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Mary Bryk, bryk@tamu.edu) or co-PI (Dr. Gary Kunkel, g-kunkel@tamu.edu).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
