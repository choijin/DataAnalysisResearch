<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide the consumers of credit/debit cards with tools for preventing fraud in real-time at the point of contact, that is, before it posts to the account. Credit/debit card transactions involve five key players, namely: payment network provider, issuing bank (issuer), acquiring bank, merchant and cardholder (consumer). The payment network providers are the target customers of this project. They facilitate transactions and provide services to issuers and acquirers. The project proposes a payment defense strategy with the potential to save customers' money from fraud losses by placing the consumer between the merchant and the issuer, thereby adding another layer of security to the chain of communication. The project shifts the responsibility of fraud prevention from banks to the consumers by notifying consumers of impending fraud and providing the requisite techniques to stop the fraud, thereby reducing the time to launch a successful attack. Solutions on the market are reactionary in nature and rely on consumers to detect and report fraud to issuers. Issuers then perform forensic analysis to verify the legitimacy of the claim. These solutions aim to prevent future attacks whereas the proposed solution aims to prevent the attacks at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project presents a real-time, proactive solution that tailors machine learning (ML) with human intelligence to prevent the fraud from occurring. The project implements an adversarial ML technique to simulate card usage behaviors to realistically predict changing behaviors and distinguish them from potential fraud. The ML module is hosted on the back-end server and communicates with payment networks via APIs (application programming interfaces) to obtain real-time transactional data from merchants. This same data is sent to issuers to verify the availability of funds. The acquired data is scored to determine whether it is fraudulent. Scores are compared to a set of threshold values, beneath which consumers are notified for manual approval/declining of the transaction by a single click on their mobile phone. Above this threshold, the transaction is automatically approved or disapproved, signifying a legitimate or fraudulent transaction, respectively. In the case where consumers make manual inputs to approve or decline transactions, transfer learning is used to learn new behaviors to improve the performance of the existing model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Current financial fraud detection and prevention tools/methods rely heavily on Artificial Intelligence (AI) particularly, because it has the power to analyze huge amount of data to find trends that fall outside of normal user behavior. The flaw with these systems, just like any machine learning system, is that of misclassification. These systems are mostly reactive and are effective after fraud has taken place. They also rely on the consumers reporting these frauds. This means consumers have to first detect that a transaction is fraudulent, which can be an overwhelming task for some consumers.The proposed solution, iMonitR, has the potential of alerting consumers of fraud in real-time and offering them the resource to prevent it. iMonitR is a mobile application for preventing credit/debit card fraud at the point of contact; before it posts to the account. It is a real-time, proactive solution that tailors machine learning with human intelligence to offer debit/credit card holders a resource to approve or disapprove suspicious transactions. It works by assigning a fraud score to each transaction and sending a notification to the consumer if the score is beneath a set threshold value. iMonitR has the potential to save credit/debit card companies money and save their consumers a peace of mind from hectic fraud resolution process. The team engaged over 100 customers in an effort to gather enough insights and find related patterns that distinguish reality from our guess. The team traveled to 11 cities in 11 states to gain useful insights independent of company or geographic location. The key result of our findings showed to be successful. iMonitR has to sit at the payment authorization side of the transaction process. In that case, banks are not the customers, but card processors, who own the authorization process. We met the industry leaders who championed creating a credit/debit card data consortium and encouraged that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would look favorably on such initiative, as it serves the greater financial sector. A prototype has been developed.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/31/2021<br>      Modified by: Kaushik&nbsp;Roy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
