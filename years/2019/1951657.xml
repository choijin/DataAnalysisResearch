<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the pressing problem of saltcedar invasion from a perspective that overcomes the spatial scale disparities between remote sensing and ground-based ecological studies. The overarching goal of this project is to develop an integrated remotely sensed population modeling framework to investigate the invasion mechanism based on the contrast of saltcedar dynamics in its native and non-native habitats. Through shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of saltcedar invasion across scales, the framework will contribute to the large-scale riparian restoration practices. Research findings will be broadly disseminated to conservation agencies to help predict and address the threat of invasive saltcedar. The synergistic educational and research activities will offer learning and research opportunities to students from secondary to graduate levels. Lastly, outreach activities will broaden the participation of traditionally underrepresented student communities in STEM related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saltcedar invasion remains a severe ecological problem, negatively impacting riparian areas, with broad implications on society, the economy, and, ultimately, human health and wellbeing. Developing a comprehensive understanding of its spatial expansion and spread mechanisms is essential for proactive ecosystem management. The key research question of the project is: what are the contrasting dynamics of saltcedar in response to varying hydroclimatic factors across its native and non-native habitats? To answer this question, the investigators will develop an integrated remotely sensed population modeling multi-component framework. The integrated framework will form the basis for a contrasting saltcedar dynamic analysis across scales, and foster insights into the hydroclimatic regimes driving the vastly disparate dynamics of saltcedar across its native and non-native habitats. This multi-scalar framework will be transferable to other types of competing vegetation species, enhancing its utility widely, and contributing to more effective land management practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
