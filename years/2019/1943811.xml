<AbstractNarration>Fostering educational environments that empower every student to access available and necessary resources in their pursuit of undergraduate engineering degrees is a national imperative. To support this goal, colleges and universities provide numerous forms of student support intended to increase the retention and graduation rates of its undergraduate engineering students (e.g., peer mentoring programs). Because of the current lack of diversity in engineering, support often focuses on marginalized groups, such as Black and Latinx students. However, student outcomes and previous research reveals the need for more responsive student support tailored to individual students’ needs. Accordingly, the aim of this CAREER project is to advance the extent to which the engineering education community understands how marginalized students 1) navigate undergraduate engineering programs, and 2) make decisions with respect to seeking help. The study will provide information directly to student support services. By understanding the experiences and decision-making of Black and Latinx students, colleges and universities can support educational environments that are more responsive to the potential diversity of the student populations. The impact of this work will be the more intentional use of university investments and resources focused on broadening participation in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award is a multi-case study which seeks to: (1) compare the support systems and navigational strategies across four universities of undergraduate engineering students’ responses to challenging situations (e.g., receiving poor grades, needing a recommendation letter), and (2) critically interrogate the effectiveness and appropriateness of different navigational strategies as defined by the students themselves. Primary data sources include institutional documents (e.g., program descriptions) from academic units and interviews with marginalized students. Data analysis is informed by person-environment fit theory. This project will introduce person-environment fit theory to scholars and practitioners who focus on marginalized students in engineering, and significantly advance fundamental knowledge of the strengths and deficiencies within university support structures and processes. The results of the study will inform the development of Situational Judgement Inventories for undergraduate engineering students, which will be openly shared, and seminars and workshops for educators and administrators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
