<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will deliver crucial missing infrastructure to make the battery industry more efficient.  Research and development teams in the battery industry often lose substantial engineering time on data chores. By automating big data chores and recovering lost engineering time, this project may deliver substantial value. This translates to faster sales cycles for companies in the battery supply chain, and potential will improve the safety and quality control of batteries through automation. By empowering battery R&amp;D teams with this software platform, this development can help bring better battery technology to market faster by integrating battery technology development and data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project develops a cloud-based platform that simplifies battery data management and analysis. Battery research and development is largely conducted with software tools ill-suited to the needs of the energy storage industry. The innovation develop improves on this situation with battery data cleaning and battery data analysis. The system provides integrations between analysis software and installed battery testing hardware on-site to dynamically monitor experiments from disparate systems. This enables visualization and analysis packages to holistically synthesize electrochemical and other materials characterization data to provide greater insight into the fundamental relationships between materials processing and performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
