<AbstractNarration>Mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, are becoming extremely prevalent nowadays. Equipped with diverse sensors, from GPS to camera, and paired with the inherent mobility of their owners, mobile devices are capable of acquiring rich information of surrounding environment. However, the wide adoption of mobile crowd sensing is largely hindered by its privacy concerns. To facilitate the functionality of each stage of mobile crowd sensing, including sensing task allocation, sensing data collection, and result aggregation, sensing devices report their location information, sensing capabilities, task preferences, and sensing results to servers that will potentially disclose their daily routings, behavior patterns and even identities. With these concerns, the overall goal of this project is to address privacy leakage issues from different stages of mobile crowd sensing. Privacy-enhanced mobile crowd sensing will attract more participants and thus accelerate the maturity of smart health care, environment monitoring, traffic surveillance, social event observation, etc. In addition, this project will also serve as a training ground for educating future decision-makers and workforce on theory and tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs plan to develop effective and efficient privacy preservation schemes for different stages of mobile crowd sensing. It corresponds to three closely intertwined research thrusts. Thrust I explores protecting user's sensitive information, such as locations, sensing capabilities and task preferences, from the server, while still allowing it to optimally or approximately solve task allocation problems. Rather than highly computationally-intensive crypto-based techniques, privacy preservation schemes will be designed based on decomposition methods and distributed computing algorithms. Thrust II aims to provide user's location privacy in the stage of data collection. Since locations of users, who perform sensing over the same event within a certain geographic area, are highly correlated, it deteriorates user's privacy achieved individually. To address this issue, privacy preservation schemes will be developed by exploring collaborations among users. Game theories will be adopted to further analyze users' strategies and interactions. The objective of Thrust III is to protect users' sensing data privacy during the stage of data analysis. The research is featured by jointly considering the data imperfection that is caused by the limited sensing capabilities at mobile devices and even the misbehavior of lazy/malicious users. To achieve data privacy and service accuracy simultaneously, novel schemes will be developed combining efficient matrix completion methods and advanced crypto techniques.</AbstractNarration>
