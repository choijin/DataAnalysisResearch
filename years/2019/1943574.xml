<AbstractNarration>Water quality and availability are vital to society and wildlife sustainability. However, we are still not able to predict the paths that water follows from precipitation to streamflow in a river, nor how long this process takes. A deeper understanding is crucial to anticipate overall water quality and supply. This is particularly true for headwater streams because their input controls the water quantity and quality of larger freshwater systems. While it is widely recognized that the flow paths water can take depend on the available catchment storage, i.e., the size of the underground “bucket”, it is not yet possible to measure how large this storage is. This project will investigate the relationship between geology, geomorphology, and topography and storage availability, as derived from hydrologic tracers such as water stable isotopes. This investigation will enhance societal ability to adapt and ensure sustainable supply of clean water under modified hydrologic conditions, likely to occur as consequences of human activities (forest harvesting, urbanization) and climate change. Through this project a relationship with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry will be established to develop hands-on activities and to teach the general public about water availability in the context of climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to understand the temporal-spatial variability of rainfall-runoff generation in headwater streams using LiDAR derived metrics of storage potential and tracer data. This research will be conducted in headwater streams over variable geomorphology and geology over a wide range (0.1–62 km2) of catchment areas. The approach will integrate water stable isotopes and electrical conductivity as tracers, hydrometric data collected by an NSF LTER site, and LiDAR in catchment-scale models to predict event transit times and storage in unmonitored locations. This study has the potential to transform the current approach to estimate water storage and to incorporate it in multiscale hydrologic modeling. This research will form the structure for an educational program to engage the public in activities that enhance their understanding of the water movement in the context of climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
