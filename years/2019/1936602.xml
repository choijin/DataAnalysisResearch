<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference, the 4th Northeastern Analysis Meeting (NEAM 2019) that will be held from October 4 to October 6, 2019 at Syracuse University. The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of complex analysis, nonlinear analysis, geometric analysis and partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of distinguished mathematicians will speak at the conference. The award will provide supports for graduate students, early career researchers, people from underrepresented groups, and researchers who are not funded by the NSF and would like to have an opportunity to participate in this conference and to present their research works. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be made available at: https://sites.google.com/view/neam2019/home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
