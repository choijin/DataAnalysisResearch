<AbstractNarration>Part I: Non-technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the mechanisms that animals use to find and acquire food is a fundamental question in ecology. The survival and success of marine predators depends on their ability to locate prey in a variable or changing environment. To do this the predators need to be able to adjust foraging behavior depending on the conditions they encounter. Emperor penguins are ice-dependent, top predators in Antarctica. However, they are vulnerable to environmental changes that alter food web or sea ice coverage, and  environmental change may lead to changes in penguin foraging behavior, and ultimately survival and reproduction success. Despite their importance in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, relatively little is known about the specific mechanisms Emperor penguins use to find and acquire food. This study combines a suite of technological and analytical tools to gain essential knowledge on Ross Sea penguin foraging energetics, ecology, and habitat use during critical periods in their life history, especially during late chick-rearing periods. Energy management is particularly crucial during this time as parents need to feed both themselves and their rapidly growing offspring, while being constrained to regions near the colony. Penguin ecology and habitat preference will also be evaluated after the molt and through early reproduction. This study fills important ecological knowledge gaps on the energy balance, diet, and habitat use by penguins during these critical periods. Finally, the project furthers the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists through training of undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher. Public outreach activities will be aligned with another NSF funded project designed to provide science training in afterschool and camp programs that target underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II: Technical summary&lt;br/&gt;This project will identify behavioral and physiological variability in foraging Emperor penguins that can be directly linked to individual success in the marine environment using an ecological  theoretical framework during two critical life history stages. First, this project will investigate the foraging energetics, ecology, and habitat use of Emperor penguins at Cape Crozier using fine-scale movement and video data loggers during the energetically demanding life history phase of late chick-rearing. Specifically, this study will 1) Estimate the relationship of foraging efficiency to foraging behavior and diet using an optimal foraging theory framework to identify what environmental or physiological constraints influence foraging behavior; 2) Investigate the inter- and intra-individual behavioral variability exhibited by emperor penguins, which is essential to predict how resilient these penguins are to environmental change; and 3) Integrate penguin foraging efficiency data with environmental data to identify important habitat. Next the researchers will study the ecology and habitat preference after the molt and through early reproduction using satellite-linked data loggers. The team will: 1) Investigate penguin inter- and intra-individual behavioral variability during the three-month post-molt and early winter foraging trips; and 2) Integrate penguin behavioral data with environmental data to identify which environmental features are indicative of habitat preference when penguins are not constrained to returning to the colony to feed a chick. These fine- and coarse-scale data will be combined with climate predictions to create predictive habitat models. The education objectives of this CAREER project are designed to inspire, engage, and train the next generation of scientists using the data and video generated while investigating Emperor penguins in the Antarctic ecosystem. This includes development of two university courses, training of undergraduate and graduate students, and a collaboration with the NSF funded “Polar Literacy: A model for youth engagement and learning” program to develop after school and camp curriculum that target undeserved and underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
