<AbstractNarration>This award supports US-based participants in the meeting "Building Bridges: 5th EU/US Summer School on Automorphic Forms and Related Topics (BB5)" taking place July 6 - 11, 2020 at the University of Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The summer school consists of three mini-courses.  Each mini-course will have two prominent instructors as well as a teaching assistant. Students will attend three hours of lecture each morning and work on problem sets in the afternoon.  Students whose research overlaps with the topics chosen for the summer school will be given priority for funding.  The summer school at BB5 will bring students at different stages in graduate school together to explore the material in the mini-courses. This mix has proven successful for both the more junior and more senior graduate students in helping them reach their full potential in learning the material.  In addition to the mix of level of the students, the participants come from a diverse list of countries. The organizers strive to achieve a diverse mix of genders, ethnicities, and nationalities. This exposure is a good experience for the students and allows them to make connections they would not make at other more regional or national conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automorphic forms touch many aspects of not just number theory, but mathematics in general. It is important to adequately train the next generation of researchers in this field.  It can be difficult for students to get up to speed on the latest developments in the theory due to the large background demands as well as the delays inherent in publication.  This summer school brings together instructors at the cutting edge of research in the field of automorphic forms and students interested in the field.  Instructors are known excellent expositors who will ensure a rewarding experience for the students; it is critical that students come away with an understanding of the material in the courses for the school to be a success.  The three mini-courses will focus on (1) lattices, finite quadratic modules, and Weil representations; (2) homogeneous dynamics and number theory; and (3) quantum ergodicity and subconvexity of L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
