<AbstractNarration>This award will support attendance by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at the Royal Society of London Meeting on Molluscan Genomics, to be held September 16-17, 2019 at Chicheley Hall in Milton Keynes, UK.  This meeting, entitled "Pearls of wisdom: Synergizing leadership and expertise in molluscan genomics", is organized as one of the Royal Society's Theo Murphy meetings and is designed to bring together scientists from around the world to present and discuss new research on diverse topics that promise to reveal important links between genomics and the biology of mollusks. The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings. Early-career participants will benefit from engagement as speakers and discussion leaders in general sessions and as presenters in a special poster session featuring the work of junior scientists.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific focus of the meeting will be on four themes:  diversity of molluscan life, technological advances in molluscan genomics, challenges in molluscan genome assembly, and advances, insights and problems addressable with molluscan genomics.  These topics were chosen to catalyze new, significant advances in understanding the biology of mollusks, which have high importance from ecological, economic, and medical perspectives.  Concerted efforts to include participants who are relatively young scientists in the field will help ensure that the conference meets one of its goals, e.g., to develop a new cadre of researchers prepared to move the science forward. The meeting will provide an excellent venue for graduate student and postdoctoral participants, including those from underrepresented groups, to share their latest results with researchers from the U.S. and abroad and to receive feedback on their work from experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We used this funding to support participation of 13 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from the US and around the world in a Theo Murphy International Meeting focused on molluscan genomics. These Theo Murphy meetings, sponsored by the Royal Society of London, provide a unique opportunity to bring a fairly small (capped at 80 people) group of scientists together in a fantastic professional and networking environment to discuss a shared topic of interest. The meeting selection is very competitive, with the Royal Society selecting meeting proposals to support that are viewed as of international interest and at the cutting edge of science. Our meeting was viewed as a tremendous success, with a full-capacity group of 80 scientists spending the two-day meeting in near constant discussion, engagement, and networking. New ideas were generated and exchanged, new collaborations were forged, and meeting attendees left feeling excited, energized, and inspired. The 13 young scientists presented posters featuring this work and had many opportunities to connect with other meeting attendees, including many leaders in the field. A substantial fraction of these NSF-supported students will also contribute as authors to articles that will be featured in a special journal issue inspired by the meeting, demonstrating that NSF support directly translates into positive contributions to the productivity of a diverse group of junior scientists.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/03/2020<br>      Modified by: Maurine&nbsp;Neiman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1903796/1903796_10587209_1578077277436_IMG_3405--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1903796/1903796_10587209_1578077277436_IMG_3405--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Modak poster"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1903796/1903796_10587209_1578077277436_IMG_3405--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Modak poster"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">NSF-supported postdoc Dr. Tejashree Modak (U.
