<AbstractNarration>Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems are used in a wide range of mission- and safety-critical applications, thus imposing stringent requirements on the security of the underlying communication infrastructure. An IIoT network consists of multiple communication parties and follows a two-way communication model, including delivering sensing data on the uplink and transmitting control messages on the downlink. Tampered sensing data or control messages by outside attackers will result in wrong decisions, potentially causing significant harm. The recent trend in industrial automation to connect interdependent industrial plants together to provide decentralized, verifiable and immutable services further exacerbates the problem. This project aims to design 1) efficient signature schemes to support verifiable authenticity, integrity, and uniformity for intra-plant two-way communications, and 2) hierarchical and scalable blockchain protocols to support inter-plant immutable services.  The close collaboration of the research teams will lead to a publicly available IIoT-enabled advanced manufacturing testbed, effective dissemination of research results among practitioners, and initiation of technology transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address existing limitations, the proposed secure communication framework aims to (i) ensure authenticity, integrity, and uniformity of sensing data in IIoT networks by designing novel signature schemes that are fast and efficient for both the signer and the verifier; (ii) enable public-key cryptography (PKC)-based fast control message authentication by extending the control border of IIoT networks to the cloud/Internet and solving the new security challenges; and (iii) provide inter-plant immutable services by developing a hierarchical blockchain structure and scalable lightweight consensus protocols. The proposed solutions will be implemented and deployed on a unique IIoT-enabled advanced manufacturing system testbed for thorough design validation and performance evaluation.  Successful design, implementation and demonstration of the proposed security solutions should advance the adoption of IIoT network infrastructure, accelerate the transformation of legacy security architectures to PKC-based security architectures and lift the security protection of the industrial communication infrastructure to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
