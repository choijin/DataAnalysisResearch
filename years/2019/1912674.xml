<AbstractNarration>This award supports U.S. student participation at the Urbino Summer School in Paleoclimatology (USSP).  Every summer since 2004 the USSP offers 40-70 graduate students from around the world an intensive, integrative experience which includes lectures, investigations, case-studies, parallel specialized-sessions, and field work and analyses; building a network of young scientists in the field. Support for faculty and student participation is shared among several participating countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer program provides a unique immersion experience in the latest thinking in paleoclimate science and the hands-on nature of the teaching provides a strong bridge between theory and practice.  The process for selecting participants is structured to enable recruitment of a diverse student body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Improving our understanding of global climate dynamics is increasingly critical as we continue to perturb the Earth?s climate. One approach that contributes towards understanding the diverse processes and interaction in Earth?s climate system is modeling of climate dynamics; another is the reconstruction of climate history from natural archives. The field of paleoclimatology strives to integrate these complementary approaches, and views resulting model-reconstruction disparities as targets for focused investigation to improve our understanding of climate system dynamics. This synergistic approach strengthens our collective scientific framework for evaluating the tempo and mode of modern climate changes that are increasingly driven by anthropogenic forcing.</p> <p>To promote this synergistic approach in the next generation of paleoclimatologists, the Urbino Summer School in Paleoclimatology (USSP) develops and delivers the annual USSP program, which has been hosted since 2004 by the Universit? degli Studi di Urbino in Urbino, Italy. The USSP 2019 provided 59 early-career graduate students with an intensive two-and-a-half weeks program in the fundamentals of paleoclimatology and the reconstruction of Earth?s dynamic climate at various temporal scales. This was done through an integrated series of lectures, investigations, case-studies, and field work. Complementing these formal course components, we actively promote informal scientific interactions among faculty and students through integration sessions, coffee breaks, panel discussions, poster sessions, mini-workshops and the embedded Cioppino ?conference.? This unique convergence of paleoclimate specialists and early-career graduate students provides an excellent opportunity to promote communication and collaboration on an international scale building a strong community of current and future paleoclimatologists.</p> <p>&nbsp;To increase U.S. student participation in the 2019 USSP, NSF awarded funding for ten competitive scholarships (out of 54 applicants) that covered airfare, course costs, and a stipend for incidental expenses. Student were selected based on the applicants? academic merit, potential to benefit from the experience, and potential for excellence as a future teacher-scholar in paleoclimatology, keeping in mind need for financial aid and diversity This led to an increase in the representation of US students as well as the broadening the diversity of the participants from an institutional perspective. The students also represent a disciplinary diversity, including study intervals have ranged from the Paleozoic to the sub-modern, analytical approaches, research environments and future occupation interests.</p> <p>This award can be viewed as an ?early investment? in continuing to improve our understanding of the history and dynamics of the global climate system and its sensitivity to anthropogenic forcing factors.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/30/2020<br>      Modified by: Adina&nbsp;Paytan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580432017826_KPgUSSP--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580432017826_KPgUSSP--rgov-800width.jpg" title="KPg"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580432017826_KPgUSSP--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="KPg"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Here the dinosaurs died</div> <div class="imageCredit">USSP</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Adina&nbsp;Paytan</div> <div class="imageTitle">KPg</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580431617881_Evaluation--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580431617881_Evaluation--rgov-800width.jpg" title="USSP Evaluations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580431617881_Evaluation--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="USSP Evaluations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">USSP Evaluations</div> <div class="imageCredit">USSP</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Adina&nbsp;Paytan</div> <div class="imageTitle">USSP Evaluations</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580431703955_OutcropUSSP--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580431703955_OutcropUSSP--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Outcrop"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580431703955_OutcropUSSP--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Outcrop"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Outcrop in Italy</div> <div class="imageCredit">USSP</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Adina&nbsp;Paytan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Outcrop</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580431781818_ClassUSSP--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580431781818_ClassUSSP--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Class"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580431781818_ClassUSSP--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Class"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Learning in Class</div> <div class="imageCredit">USSP</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Adina&nbsp;Paytan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Class</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580431902264_FieldtripUSSP--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580431902264_FieldtripUSSP--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Field Trip"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580431902264_FieldtripUSSP--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Field Trip"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Field Trip</div> <div class="imageCredit">USSP</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Adina&nbsp;Paytan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Field Trip</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580426389483_Program--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580426389483_Program--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Program Schedule"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912674/1912674_10587486_1580426389483_Program--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Program Schedule"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Program Schedule</div> <div class="imageCredit">USSP</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Adina&nbsp;Paytan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Program Schedule</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
