<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national need for exceptional mathematics and science master teachers in high-need schools, particularly teachers with similar demographics as the communities they serve.  Master teachers fill a crucial need in low-performing, hard-to-staff schools that enroll high percentages of low-income students who are historically underrepresented in mathematics and science careers.  This project will recruit 30 in-service teachers with strong leadership potential.  These teachers will receive financial and other supports as they complete a rigorous five-year program to achieve master teacher competencies.  The project will support one cohort of secondary mathematics and science teachers and one cohort of elementary teachers. The project will test the effectiveness of a research-based training model for master STEM teachers that encourages interdisciplinary, standards- and project-based approaches. These master teachers will be prepared to collectively improve STEM teaching and achievement in 23 schools in South Los Angeles that enroll more than 18,200 students, of which 85% are low-income, 74% are Latinx, and 10% are African American.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project at California State University, Dominguez Hills includes partnerships with the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Over a six-year period, the project will recruit, support, and prepare 30 master teachers, including 15 secondary biology, chemistry, and mathematics teachers in cohort one and 15 elementary teachers in cohort two. Innovative aspects of the project include: (i) micro-credentials in project-based learning, fabrication lab technology, Next Generation Science Standards, and Common Core mathematics standards; (ii) summer internships in the university?s Fabrication Lab; (iii) three-year action research projects; and (iv) the choice to pursue a pathway in research, National Board certification, or computer science authorization. The project will disseminate results regionally and nationally via presentations at professional conferences and publications. Project evaluation aims to increase understanding of the approaches that are effective in developing exceptional master teachers who can enhance STEM education in high-need schools, develop the skills of preservice and in-service teachers, and help shape future strategies for teacher leadership development. This Track 3: Master Teaching Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
