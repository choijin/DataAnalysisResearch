<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enhance both public safety and public health by addressing two problems:   1) Approximately 3,500 letters containing white powders and over 5,500 explosive threats are received by private and public offices each year; these may be hoaxes that result in temporary shut-down and lost productivity; or more critically, they may contain anthrax, ricin, fentanyl, or an explosive device.   2) The opioid epidemic is fueled by international delivery of powders contained in small packets, pills, or liquid formulations; all require to non-invasive detection.  This project will develop novel image processing techniques utilizing terahertz imaging to detect harmful items concealed within letters and packages.  If successful, terahertz scanners powered by these image analysis algorithms may become as ubiquitous as copiers, printers, and document scanners in any corporate office, addressing critical public health and safety challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop image processing and computer vision techniques to capitalize on the multidimensional, dynamic 3-D terahertz imaging dataset captured via desktop-based terahertz scanners.  No commercially-viable approaches exist, capable of automatically detecting threats in real-time from terahertz imaging data streams for security applications.  This project aims to develop robust techniques to both enhance the capabilities of a human operator and automatically detect specific threats.  One non-trivial challenge is the detection of liquid/particle motion within the context of a moving reference frame - such as the motion of liquid within a small pouch, itself concealed within a moving package.  The terahertz imaging system is capable of detecting single drops of liquid (50 mg) and imaging the movement of powders within explosives in real-time.  Another focus area for the project will be the integration of the 3-D terahertz data set together with contextual information gleaned from other sensor inputs, as well as external sources due to the connected nature of the device (internet of things).  The fusion of this information with the terahertz data will provide unparalleled detection capabilities and have far reaching impacts in the field of dynamic, 3-D imaging, well beyond threat detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SBIR Phase I: Advanced Terahertz Image Processing Systems     Intellectual Merits  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project developed a framework for image processing and computer vision techniques to capitalize on the multidimensional, dynamic 3-D terahertz imaging datasets.  No commercially-viable approaches exist, capable of automatically detecting threats in real-time from terahertz imaging data streams.  This project developed robust techniques to both enhance the capabilities of a human operator and automatically detect specific threats.  One non-trivial challenge was the detection of liquid/particle motion within the context of a moving reference frame ? such as the motion of liquid within a small pouch, which is itself concealed within a moving package.  The RaySecur THz imaging system is capable of detecting single drops of liquid (50 mg) and imaging the movement of powders within explosives in real-time.  Another focus area for the project was the integration of the 3-D terahertz data set together with contextual information gleaned from other sensor inputs, as well as external sources due to the connected nature of the device (internet of things).  The fusion of this information with the terahertz data provides unparalleled detection capabilities and has far reaching impacts in the field of dynamic, 3-D imaging, and threat detection.         Broader Impacts/Commercial Potential  According to the US Postal Service, approximately 3,500 letters containing white powders are received each year.  In the best case, the letter is a hoax resulting in temporary shut-down and lost productivity costing organizations $500,000 per event on average.  In the worst case, the powder may be anthrax, ricin, or fentanyl, resulting in hospitalization or death.   Recently the opioid epidemic has also grown to become a national health crisis, with a large fraction of opioids entering the U.S. via the international mail system.  Most of these drugs exist in the form of powders contained in small packets, pills, or liquid forms in the mail.  There is a large unmet need to non-invasively detect these materials as well.  The MailSecur terahertz scanner can image trace amounts of powders and liquids in the mail, along with conventional threats including weapons and explosives.  The hardware system has gained early market traction and efforts are now focused on developing automated image analysis tools to increase the effectiveness of the technology solution. The outcomes of this project deliver not only tangible commercial benefits, but also address critical public health and safety challenges.
