<AbstractNarration>Wayne State University has made investments in research computing including construction of a new data center, deployment of high-speed networks with global reach, and massive storage for globally accessible data.  This NSF CC* project augments those existing high-performance computing resources through the addition of six high-speed, multiprocessor systems with a large amount of memory each with 1.5 terabytes and 3 NVIDIA graphic processing units (GPUs) capable of up to 120 trillion calculations per second in each system. Simulations that used to take months can be completed in days, thereby speeding research in many areas and expanding resources for the University's 275 research teams and 1,500 unique users of which 1,000 are students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this new equipment spreads across multiple disciplines including Computational Chemistry, Membrane Biophysics, Molecular Dynamics, Complex Materials and ground-breaking work in the study of Nuclear Matter and its various phases.  Modeling relativistic heavy ion collisions that produce the Quark Gluon Plasma in reasonable wall times was beyond the capability of the old hardware, but with the new system such simulations can be made and help shed light on strongly coupled systems and inform the nature of the early Universe. The GPUs have special features called Tensor Flow Cores, of particular use in Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Analytics.  These augment research in urban and environmental health.  The GPUs are also a boon for education in Wayne State's new Master of Science in Data Science joint program in Engineering, Computer Science and School of Business&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award procured high performance computing resources at Wayne State University for use by researchers there.  These computers were also shared with other researchers on the NSF sponsored Open Science Grid.  The primary users were Nuclear Physicists who are building a model of high speed collisions of large nuclei.  During these collisions a new form of matterr called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is created.  The JETSCAPE collaboration has built a freely available model which other researchers can use to study the properties of the QGP.  The QGP is an example of a strongly coupled system and study of it may yield deeper understanding of other such system.  Major use was also made by Computational Chemists who study the interactions of large molecules.  They use simulations to explain observed phenomena and design new compounds with useful and valuable properties.  Other researchers in Physics, Chemistry and engineering made use of these new computers.  Users included clinicians and researchers in the Wayne State Medical School and OSG users from around the country,  Outcomes of the research included numerous papers and presentations at national and international conferences with notable clusters of results in Nuclear Physics, a major release of the JETSCAP model, and in Computational Chemistry.
