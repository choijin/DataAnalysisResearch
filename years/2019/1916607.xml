<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Seventh European Set Theory Conference, Vienna, Austria  The Seventh European Set Theory Conference took place at the University of Vienna July 1-5, 2019.  143 people from all over the world took part in a high level conference that saw a mixture invited speakers and contributed talks. The main objective of the meeting was dissemination of new ideas and techniques, as well as providing an occasion for colleagues to interact, and particularly for younger colleagues and early career researchers to make contacts and learn about new research.     Preceding the European Set Theory Conference was the Twelfth Young Set Theory Workshop, which had a synergistic effect on attendance for both the Conference and the Workshop.  While travel to the Young Set Theory workshop was not directly supported by the NSF many participants attended in both conferences.     The Hausdorff Medal  A highlight of the meeting was the award of the Hausdorff medal to Itay Neeman.  Here is the official citation:     The Hausdorff medal 2019 for the most influential work in set theory in the previous 5 years was awarded to Itay Neeman for his work on the new method of iterating forcing using side conditions and the tree property. The committee cited the following papers for their fundamental contributions and for opening up the new directions of study:     -  Forcing with sequences of models of two types, Notre Dame J. Formal Logic, vol. 55 (2014), pp. 265?298,  - Two applications of finite side conditions at &omega;2. Arch. Math. Logic 56 (2017), no. 7-8, 983?1036  - The tree property up to &alefsym;&omega;+1. J. Symb. Log. 79 (2014), no. 2, 429?459.  Invited Speakers   The 15 Invited Speakers who gave one-hour addresses included Jorg Brendle (Kobe University), Clinton Conley (Carnegie Mellon University), Mirna Dzamonja (University of East Anglia), Todd Eisworth (Ohio University), Moti Gitik (Tel Aviv University), Gabriel Goldberg (Harvard University), Alexander Kechris (CalTech), Piotr Koszmider (Polish Academy of Sciences), Maryanthe Malliaris (University of Chicago), Justin Moore (Cornell University), Farmer Schlutzenberg (University of Munster), Dima Sinapova (Univerity of Illinois, Chicago), Slawomir Solecki (Cornell University), Boaz Tsaban (Bar-Ilan University), Anush Tserunyan (University of Illinois), Matteo Viale (University of Torino), Hugh Woodin (Harvard University).   The invited speakers topics included  Cardinal Invariants, Set Theory of the Reals and Higher Cardinal Invariants Borel Combinatorics Logics beyond first order Singular Cardinal Combinatorics Large Cardinal Axioms Measure Preserving Group actions C* algebras Ultrapowers and Boolean Ultrapowers Thompson?s Group Inner model theory, Fine Structure and applications to Descriptive Set Theory. Polish Groups and Concentration of Measure   In addition to the invited one-hour addresses there were 44 shorter contributed talks.  The conference website, which includes a complete schedule, is available at  https://sites.google.com/view/estc2019/home  About 2/3 of the attendees were junior researchers and graduate students. Several of the invited speakers were women.  The travel money from the grant allowed 10 American junior researchers/ graduate students and two senior researchers to attend the meeting.  Of these 2 were women. A couple of initial awardees turned down their awards because they got support from other sources that allowed them to attend both meetings.
