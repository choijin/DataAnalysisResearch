<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at South Carolina State University will enhance undergraduate education in the Computer Science department to prepare students to meet the needs of the workforce or advanced studies in cybersecurity related fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to create a successful model of institution-wide reform for undergraduate cybersecurity education through the use of instruction, internships, workshops and seminars. This project will use a multi-tier approach to increase capacity in cybersecurity education, training, and awareness in the undergraduate curriculum by developing relationships with academia, government and industry; developing an introductory cybersecurity general education course; providing awareness of and training for cybersecurity issues to middle school, high school, and college teachers, and to the general public through lectures, seminars, workshops, and hands-on experiences; developing a minor in cybersecurity; and  providing the participants access to an online cybersecurity laboratory. The project is guided by formative and summative evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
