<AbstractNarration>A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is being organized as part of the 40th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), the premier conference in the areas of programming languages and compilers. The conference will be held in Phoenix, Arizona, as part of ACM's Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC). This award specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshop in addition to the PLDI conference. The impact of the award relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in programming languages and compilers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The workshop program included technical sessions that covered both the history and current practice of core subfields within programming languages, mentoring sessions that cover effective habits for navigating the research landscape, and social sessions that create opportunities for students to interact with researchers in the field.           We had 48 registered student attendees. Thirteen of these registered students identified as female; eight identified as minorities &#8203;(3 women, 4 hispanic / Latino, 1 HBCU) and 4 preferred not to provide such information&#8203;.  We awarded full or partial scholarships to 30 students who attended (25 from US-based institutions). Eleven of these students identified as female; three identified as a member of an underrepresented minority.      The workshop program included an icebreaker, 7 talks, and a panel. Of the 7 talks, two were dedicated to mentoring, three were about research in PL, and two were about research career options. Since this was an FCRC (Federated Computing Research Conference) year, we coordinated with (International Symposium on Computer Architecture) ISCA?s mentoring workshop for undergraduates.           Overall attendees enjoyed the event based on an evaluation performed by the Computing Research Association Evaluation, CERP). Students had many positive comments about the icebreaker, which enabled them to network with each other and some felt it helped them be more comfortable with interacting more with the whole group.
