<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for students to participate in the 13th International Workshop on High-pT Physics in the RHIC/LHC Era, devoted to the study of partonic energy loss in the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), which is a state of matter thought to have existed shortly after the Big Bang. This topic is particularly interesting now, as the field adapts from a discovery phase of the QGP to the phase where the quantitative properties of the medium are determined. The workshops in this series are intended to provide an informal forum in which theorists, experimentalists, senior researchers, and junior researchers interact and learn from each other. The workshop will take place at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, TN, March 19 - 23, 2019. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will also present their research and the PI will discuss her course-based undergraduate research experience with applications to partonic energy loss in the QGP.  This will not only highlight undergraduate researchers but propose a model for how other researchers can incorporate undergraduates into their research and broaden participation in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
