<AbstractNarration>The 2019 SIGCOMM conference will take place from August 19 to August 23, 2019 in Beijing, China. This award provides funds to assist 20 US-based graduate students attend this conference. Participation in conferences such as SIGCOMM forms a central part of the graduate school experience as it provides students with an opportunity to interact with senior researchers from academia and industry and exposes them to leading-edge research in the field. ACM SIGCOMM stands unique in its emphasis on interactions between networking researchers at an international level.  Attending SIGCOMM presents an excellent opportunity for US graduate students to connect with a thriving international research community. In 2014-2015, SIGCOMM added additional programming to enrich the student experience. A mentorship program has run in the past five years assigning junior students with  more senior mentors at the conference. In 2015, the introduction of `preview sessions' gave students a chance to get briefed on topics prior to attending main session talks. The response to both has been extremely positive. Attending SIGCOMM will expose students to new ideas in emerging research areas and allow them to interact with other researchers thereby broadening their intellectual horizons. Support from this award enables students to attend the main conference and associated workshops at SIGCOMM 2019. The travel grant co-chairs are committed to the participation of women and under-represented minorities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attending SIGCOMM integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated workshops. The proposed student participation will have a positive impact on the quality of their research. Women and other minorities are strongly encouraged to participate. The SIGCOMM conference has developed into a top-tier international conference, presenting a tremendous opportunity to students to expand their breadth of ideas, research skills, and technical perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
