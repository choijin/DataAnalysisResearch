<AbstractNarration>A workshop for students and early career scientists will be held in conjunction with the bi-annual conference known as the Ocean Sciences Meeting 2020, which is co-sponsored by the Association of the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO), the American Geophysical Union (AGU and The Oceanography Society (TOS) and which will be held in February 2020 in San Diego, CA. The one-day workshop is designed to train students and early career scientists in the oral and visual communication skills needed to effectively communicate with a variety of audiences.  Workshop organization and evaluation will be managed by Drs. Schiebel and Stone, from Suffolk University. The main speakers will be Dr. Jessamyn A. Fairfield, a physicist and Lecturer, National University of Ireland Galway's School of Physics and Dr. Echo A. Rivera, owner of Creative Research Communications, LLC. Both speakers are highly experienced and well qualified, with expertise in training scientists to give effective presentations to a variety of audiences. Evaluation of the workshop will be conducted by Dr. Rebecca Stone, Assistant Professor of Sociology, Suffolk University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will offer a group of approximately forty students and early career scientists an opportunity to improve their presentation skills. The plan for the workshop is solid, and the event is likely to be well-attended and highly successful because it will be held in conjunction with a large bi-annual conference. The broader impacts of the workshop include training and professional development for a diverse group of participants. In addition to the training provided to participants, this award will support two early career scientists who will gain experience in workshop organization, grant management and scientific leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For two consecutive years, a workshop entitled <em>Developing the Science of Science Communication</em> has been offered at the Aquatic Sciences Meeting (2019) and Ocean Sciences Meeting (2020) scientific conferences for (generally) oceanographers and limnologists. The goal of these workshops was to provide training for early career scientists (here defined as undergraduate students, graduate students along with those within five years of graduate work completion) specifically related to verbal and visual communication skills that are sorely lacking in early career science curricula. Both qualitative and quantitative data was collected from 91 participants across the two workshops through pre- and post-survey data. Participants overwhelmingly agreed that they (a) would recommend the workshop to others and (b) found the workshop content would be useful in their careers. Workshop participants had the opportunity to offer more feedback in response to several open-ended questions related to the visual and verbal components of the workshop, each of which provided interesting feedback in terms of which session(s) were the most useful for different types of audiences and how to proceed in future workshops. The workshop hosts created a report with background information, survey data results, and recommendations moving forward including strategies for content/time constraints and technology issues.
