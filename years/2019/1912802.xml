<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to push forward the principled use of data in science and applications. By means of rigorous mathematical analysis, the PIs intend to uncover the hidden unity of seemingly unrelated learning problems and methodologies, facilitating the transfer of theoretical and computational developments and unifying the growing applied literature. The proposed work intends to partially satisfy the societal and scientific need to build paradigms that combine data and complex mathematical models to obtain more accurate predictions while accounting for uncertainty quantification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs intend to address some of the new challenges that the increasing complexity of models and the growing size of data sets have brought to the foundations of optimization and Bayesian approaches to machine learning and inverse problems. This project will emphasize the connection between statistical consistency and algorithmic scalability: consistent problems are often computationally tractable, and a key principle for the design of scalable algorithms is to exploit statistical consistency wherever present. The specific research projects that will be pursued have five overarching themes: &lt;br/&gt;i) The analysis of continuum limits of discrete objects defined on random data.&lt;br/&gt;ii) The study of new regularization techniques. &lt;br/&gt;iii) The design and analysis of scalable sampling algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;iv) The use of discrete approximations of complex models. &lt;br/&gt;v) The quantification of uncertainty in the solutions. &lt;br/&gt;Contributing in a substantial manner to this wide range of themes will require close collaboration between the PIs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The overall goal of this one year project was to explore the connection between applied problems formulated using partial differential equations (like in fluids or geophysics)  and problems in data analysis formulated in discrete data settings. We sought to connect these two types of problems by using rigorous mathematics in order to establish consistency of data analysis procedures (i.e. As more data is collected does the outcome of a given data analysis procedure approximate a ground-truth? Is this ground-truth connected to a PDE?). With these consistency results, we intended to provide insights into the type of computational techniques that are more appropriate for carrying out the data analysis tasks in the regime of large numbers of data. We sought to build solid bridges between different research areas, in an attempt to transfer knowledge from one to the other. Our overall goal was in line with the collective current effort of developing sound data analysis methodologies with strong theoretical guarantees that can be used to more accurately and more efficiently address relevant societal problems.    The more specific outcomes of the project range from strong mathematical results like the ones obtained in the work "Lipschitz regularity of graph Laplacians on random data clouds" (where regularity theory of solutions to important equations characterizing learning tasks were obtained for the first time) to the more computational and methodological results like the ones in the works "Data-driven forward discretizations for Bayesian inversion" and "On the consistency of graph-based Bayesian learning and the scalability of sampling algorithms" (where the theoretical aspects explored in the project guided the introduction of computational paradigms with the aim of efficiently solving learning tasks in the presence of uncertainty and noisy data).  This line of research, as well as its outcomes, were driven by the strong belief that rigorous mathematics is essential to the development of data analysis. Seven research articles by the PI, four already published in peer reviewed journals, and three that are currently in the review process, summarize the scientific production of this one year project.    Explicit in joint papers and implicit through informal conversations, one broader outcome of the project was to provide a platform of interaction between researchers from different disciplines and different departments, and to provide an inviting environment for students to get involved in mathematical research applied to data analysis. The knowledge produced during this year project was widely disseminated in scientific conferences in the US and abroad, and has attracted the interest of several graduate and undergraduate students that are now actively working with the PI on related research inquiries.
