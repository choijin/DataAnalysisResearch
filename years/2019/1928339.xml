<AbstractNarration>The 25th ACM international conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, MobiCom will be held in Los Cabos, Mexico between October 21 and 25, 2019. MobiCom is one of the leading conference venues for researchers addressing algorithmic and system challenges in the fields of wireless networks, wireless sensing, mobile systems, edge computing to name a few. MobiCom not only encourages researchers to push the boundaries and innovate, but also provides a platform to discuss open challenges and learn from experience in the form of Experience Papers, Challenge Papers, and Verification Papers. MobiCom invites leading researchers from diverse research areas, background, and geographical locations through research presentations, Workshops, Keynote Talks, Topic Review Sessions, and Panel Discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference, akin to the research presented there, continues to innovate and facilitate students with increased opportunities to get involved. MobiCom 2019 introduced a new two deadline model and accepts submissions in Fall and Summer, with scope for a "One-shot revision" after one round of submissions, to encourage more and higher-quality submissions. MobiCom has dedicated sessions to motivate students such as poster sessions, demos, mobile app competitions, student career fair and startup competitions. The NSF travel grant will encourage more students to attend the conference and avail the benefits of interacting with leading researchers in the areas of mobile computing and networking and get motivated by the high-quality research work and discussions in the conference. The travel grant program has a proven record of providing minority and underrepresented students the means to benefit from this educational experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
