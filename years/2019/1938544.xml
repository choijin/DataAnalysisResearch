<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the second report-out meeting of current recipients of the EAGER awards focusing on topological quantum computing. The funding opportunity, announced in February 2017 with NSF 17-053 Dear Colleague Letter: Funding Opportunity - A "Quantum Leap" Demonstration of Topological Quantum Computing" generated 15 funded EAGER proposals focusing on research in the area of braiding. The first meeting was organized in the Spring of 2018, and involved participants of the first "class" of EAGER awards made in 2017. This award supports the second meeting, scheduled for the second week of July 2019. The workshop enables a full report-out and overview of accomplishments so far based on results of work done within the first 2 years of funding existence, which marks the final report for the first class of awards, and 1-year report for the second class of the 2-year EAGER awards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Providing experimental evidence for braiding is a needed transformative step towards topological quantum computing. Ability to generate, control and braid Majorana zero modes is central to this effort. Theoretical support is required to design braiding schemes, ways to design and execute algorithms, and enable topological quantum computation protected from local disturbances by non-local character of the shared quantum state. The meeting of Principal Investigators funded through the NSF 17-053 Dear Colleague Letter: Funding Opportunity - A "Quantum Leap" Demonstration of Topological Quantum Computing", will serve as report-out session and review of accomplishments, while also providing an opportunity for the award recipients to exchange and discuss details of their findings and plan next steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>On July 9, 10 the University of Maryland held a workshop entitled "Enabling Braiding and Fusing of Majoranas". In this workshop, researchers working in a variety of materials and devices reported on the progress made for detecting, fusing and braiding Majorana fermions &ndash; an excitation sought for use in topological quantum computing. The workshop was open to undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers working in the field. Understanding how exotic quasiparticles manifest themselves in the solid state and alter behavior of electric devices remains an important area of research in condensed-matter physics. Precise generation and control of the Majorana states remains a key challenge to progress in this area. The workshop provided a platform for researchers in the field to discuss successes they have had with challenges that lie ahead. The workshop also expanded the knowledge and capabilities of the next generation of scientists: undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Use of Majorana fermions in the solid state for topological quantum computation remains a challenging goal for condensed matter physicists. Success in this area will likely be a results of a coherent effort across many material platform and device detection techniques. Thus, bringing together members from disparate areas of Majorana research has facilitated progress in this field. Further, through the National Quantum Initiative, Congress has identified enhancing the quantum workforce as a key area needed for progress in the field of quantum computation.
