<AbstractNarration>This award is to support three outreach activities held during the US National Combustion Meeting, March 24-27, 2019. These activities include an Early Career Workshop for Combustion Researchers, a Mentoring Mixer, and a Women in Combustion Luncheon. The goal of these activities is to bring together a community of early-career combustion researchers and form action committees to encourage early-career participation in the combustion research community. In the U.S. nearly 70% of energy conversion is accomplished by combustion. Hence the advancement in combustion science is crucial to the society. The participants will further develop four high-priority items, including education and communities of practice, development of mentorship programs, cross-disciplinary collaboration and open-source sharing, and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combustion is a key technology for power generation, and this will remain the same for decades to come. However, the combustion research community is facing various technical and non-technical challenges. The participants will identify challenges, educate the early-career researchers about these challenges, and discuss possible solutions. Discussion around technical issues will include brainstorming of novel, possibly cross-disciplinary research areas for future work. On the other hand, various non-technical issues will also be discussed, including mentoring of early-career faculty members and retention of talented researchers of diverse backgrounds. Results of the proposed outreach activities are expected to help build a more productive combustion research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
